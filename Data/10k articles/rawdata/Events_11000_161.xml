The '''1984 Barneveld, Wisconsin, tornado outbreak''' is a significant severe weather and tornado event that took place across the central [[United States]] from [[North Dakota]] to [[Kansas]] on June 7–8, 1984. The [[tornado outbreak]] produced several significant tornadoes including an [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|F5]] [[tornado]]&lt;ref name=Grazulis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grazulis |first1=Thomas P. |title=Significant Tornadoes 1680-1991: A Chronology and Analysis of Events |date=1993 |publisher=Environmental Films |location=St. Johnsbury, Vermont |isbn=1-879362-03-1 |pages=1257-1260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"On the original Fujita scale [F0-F5], the damage generated by an F5 tornado corresponded to estimated wind speeds of 262 to 317 mph. However, research has shown that these estimated wind speeds may be over-exaggerated. As of 2007, any tornado that creates damage corresponding to estimated wind speeds of 200 mph or greater [on the Enhanced Fujita Scale] is classified as an EF5 tornado." https://weather.com/tv/shows/tornado-week/news/ef5-f5-most-violent-tornadoes-20140430&lt;/ref&gt; which traveled through [[Barneveld, Wisconsin]], in the early hours of June 8, 1984. The entire outbreak killed at least 13 people across three states including 9 in Barneveld alone.&lt;ref name=Grazulis/&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==

A [[low pressure system]] entered the Midwestern United States on June 7, 1984, and intensified while bringing a surge of moist and humid air coming from the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. After most of the affected areas were hit by a [[Mesoscale Convective Complex]] earlier during the morning of June 7, the unstable atmosphere, as well as [[wind shear]] and high [[Convective available potential energy|CAPE values]] produced a favorable environment for the development of extensive severe weather with possible tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aos.wisc.edu/uwaosjournal/Volume1/AOS453/FCS_Harrington.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at around mid-afternoon, it started to produce several tornadoes across southern [[Minnesota]] and northwestern and southern [[Iowa]] including three F3s and a long-track F4 which traveled over 130 miles from extreme northern [[Missouri]] to southwest of [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]]. That tornado killed 3 people including one in Missouri's [[Harrison County, Missouri|Harrison County]]. Another person was killed in [[Ringgold County, Iowa|Ringgold County]] in Iowa by an F2 tornado at around 9:00 PM [[Central Daylight Time|CDT]]. Activity continued through the overnight hours as a new cluster of storms developed across [[Wisconsin]] near the Iowa and [[Illinois]] borders and produced strong tornadoes including the Barneveld tornado up until the early [[morning]] hours of June 8, 1984, before dissipating.

Straight-line winds in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;mph and very large hail were also reported in eastern Iowa from the storm that went on to drop the tornado in Barneveld, Wisconsin.

==The Barneveld Tornado==

As the tornado activity calmed down across Iowa and Minnesota in which numerous strong to severe tornadoes struck those areas from mid-afternoon to mid-evening, the severe weather shifted east towards Wisconsin after dark where a tornado watch was issued at about 11:00 PM CDT. By this time, most of the residents of [[Barneveld, Wisconsin|Barneveld]] had gone to bed and were unaware of the tornado watch. A [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]], which affected portions of southeastern Iowa with a few tornadoes at around 9:00 PM CDT before weakening and intensifying shortly after, entered Wisconsin from the Iowa/Illinois border at around 12:00 AM CDT near [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]]. Shortly after 12:30 AM CDT, June 8, it produced its first tornado near [[Belmont, Wisconsin|Belmont]] in [[Lafayette County, Wisconsin|Lafayette County]] and lifted near [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin|Mineral Point]] in [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]] about fifteen miles southwest of Barneveld.

A few minutes later, this storm system produced one of the few F5 tornados to hit Wisconsin, developing northeast of Mineral Point (five to six miles southwest of Barneveld). At 12:41 CDT this F5 tornado drove through the center of Barneveld in full force, finally dissipating in northern [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] around 1:40 AM CDT after traveling 36 miles (62 kilometers) for 59 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 8, 1984, Barneveld, WI F5 Tornado|url=http://www.weather.gov/mkx/060884-barneveld-tor|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sharp bolt of [[lightning]] followed by a deafening clap of [[thunder]] cut the electricity to the town just a few minutes before the tornado struck Barneveld, awakened many residents. (It is said that the loss of power prevented the [[tornado siren]] from being activated prior to its arrival. In actuality, the town did not have a distinctive [[tornado siren]] from the siren used to activate the town's volunteer fire and EMT squad. If a siren had been activated, the residents would not have known it was a tornado warning.)&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jann Cather|title=Interview|publisher=Unpublished|Notes=name where interview can be found/broadcast, add date etc }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; At its peak, the tornado was nearly a quarter-mile wide. Other tornadoes rated from F1 to F3 touched down from [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia County]] to [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge County]] until after 3:00 AM CDT when activity finally weakened.

The tornado was responsible for nine deaths and nearly 200 injuries in Barneveld while causing about $25 million in damage. In total, all three churches (the Congregational United Church of Christ, the Lutheran Church, and the Roman Catholic Church),&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jann Cather|title=Interview|publisher=Unpublished&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; 93 homes were destroyed as well as 17 businesses out of the town's 18, including the library, municipal building, fire station, bank, and post office. The village's water tower, though damaged, was not toppled by the winds. In addition, 64 other homes were badly damaged. The F5 damage occurred at a cul-de-sac on the northeast side of town. A cluster of several newly built homes were completely swept away at this location. Trees were debarked and vehicles were thrown and mangled. The Lutheran Church was completely leveled as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://extremeplanet.me/2012/11/27/the-indefinitive-list-of-the-strongest-tornadoes-ever-recorded-part-iv/&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the debris including paper work were later found about 135 miles away from the village. Eight homes were also destroyed in [[Black Earth, Wisconsin|Black Earth]], and 24 additional homes were destroyed between Barneveld and Black Earth. Other tornadoes in Wisconsin caused two additional injuries and about $15 million worth of damage but no additional fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/document/tor/060884.php NWS Milwaukee/Sullivan, WI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel3000.com/news/3395188/detail.html Barneveld, 1984: 9 Dead, 200 Injured - News Story - WISC Madison&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]   {{webarchive|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/3395188/detail.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927014820/http://www.channel3000.com/news/3395188/detail.html|dead-url=yes|date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Weather Service in Madison reported the next day that the frequency of lightning flashes in the storm visible from Madison exceeded 200 per minute, the flashes running together into a strobe-like effect, as mentioned in media reports and books about the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Extreme Weather'', pp 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barneveld tornado was more particular as it was one of the rare tornadoes to occur during the overnight hours well after sunset although EF5/F5 tornadoes have occurred elsewhere during night, including more recently in [[Greensburg, Kansas]], on [[May 2007 Tornado Outbreak|May 4, 2007]] as well as in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in [[Birmingham Tornado of April 1998|April 1998]], downtown [[Lubbock, Texas]], in [[Lubbock Tornado|1970]], [[Tanner, Alabama]], and [[Guin, Alabama]], in [[1974 Super Outbreak|1974]] and [[Udall, Kansas]], in [[1955 Great Plains tornado outbreak|1955]], the last being the deadliest Kansas tornado ever with over 80 deaths.

The Barneveld tornado was the first F5 in Wisconsin since the 1958 [[1958 Colfax, Wisconsin, tornado outbreak|Colfax Tornado]], which killed 21.  It was the first F5 in the US since 2 April 1982 when one touched down near [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma]]; the next one occurred on 31 May 1985 in [[Wheatland, Pennsylvania]], during the [[1985 United States-Canadian tornado outbreak]]. The [[Oakfield Tornado]] of 18 July 1996, the most recent F5 in Wisconsin, did not cause any fatalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13067">The '''2010 Boston Water Emergency''' occurred on May 1, 2010, when a water pipe in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Massachusetts]], broke and began flooding into the [[Charles River]]. This led to unsanitary water conditions in the [[greater Boston area]], which resulted in [[Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]] declaring a state of emergency and an [[Boil-water advisory|order for residents to boil drinking water]].&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt; The leak was stopped on May 2.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt; On May 4, the order was lifted.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5geDUvZfc7dzGJd8oa6hV7msLnuEwD9FFTLQO1 |title=Boil water order is lifted for 2M in Boston area |accessdate=4 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507041238/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5geDUvZfc7dzGJd8oa6hV7msLnuEwD9FFTLQO1 |archivedate=7 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] signed an emergency disaster declaration offering federal help, authorizing the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] to coordinate disaster relief efforts with Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/2010/05/03/obama-disaster-declaration |title=Obama Declares Mass.

==Chronology==
At about 10 am on May 1, a collar connecting two sections of {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} pipe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/03/mass_says_broken_pipe_could_be_fixed_within_days?mode=PF |title=Hope of fix within days |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507145520/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/03/mass_says_broken_pipe_could_be_fixed_within_days?mode=PF |archivedate=May 7, 2010 }} &lt;/ref&gt; ruptured in [[Weston, Massachusetts]], disrupting the connection between the [[MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel]] and the City Tunnel.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwra.com/|title=MWRA homepage|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the water supply cut off, the emergency water supply reserve system from surrounding ponds was routed to the main water supply.

The rupture worsened as the afternoon progressed, eventually resulting in the loss of access to clean water from the [[Quabbin Reservoir|Quabbin]] and [[Wachusett Reservoir]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s for approximately two million residents of 31 cities and towns, including Boston. At the height of the spill, approximately {{convert|8|e6USgal|m3}} of water entered the Charles River per hour.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt;  By evening, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority had activated the backup water system, which was drawing water from the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]], and [[Spot Pond Reservoir]]. The Sudbury Aqueduct supplied additional water to the Chestnut Hill reservoir from the [[Sudbury Reservoir]] and the [[Framingham #3 reservoir]]. &lt;ref name="official" /&gt; Because water from these older surface reservoirs is not treated, the MWRA issued a [[boil order]] for the affected communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/02/a_catastrophic_rupture_hits_regions_water_system/|title=A ‘catastrophic’ rupture hits region’s water system | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | first1=Michael | last1=Levenson | first2=Beth | last2=Daley | date=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/01news/2010/boilwaterorder1.htm |title=Mwra - Mwra Water Main Break Requires Water Ban, Boil Water Order |website=Mwra.state.ma.us |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] (MWRA) issued an emergency water notice for the Boston area. Governor [[Deval Patrick]] issued a [[state of emergency]] and a [[boil-water advisory]] for [[Boston]] and a dozen surrounding communities, affecting nearly 2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/05/catastrophic_le.html |title='Boil-water' order issued for nearly 2 million in Mass. |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |first1=Martin |last1=Finucane |first2=Beth |last2=Daley |first3=John M. |last3=Guilfoil |first4=Sean |last4=Teehan |first5=Caitlin |last5=Castello |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503233105/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/05/catastrophic_le.html |archivedate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwra.com/updates/leak.html |title=EMERGENCY WATER NOTICE &amp;#124; Starting May 1, 2010 - Updated Regularly |website=MWRA.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local agency officials used a variety of means to inform locals about the situation&lt;ref name="NYTBoston"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/us/03boston.html |author=Derrick Henry|title=Ruptured Pipe Cuts Water in Boston|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 2, 2010|accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Everbridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everbridge.com |title=Everbridge |publisher=Everbridge.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston's reverse 911 citizen alert system, highway alert signs, driving through affected neighborhoods with bullhorns, and other [[emergency management]] systems.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt; As a result of the water boil order, many residents rushed to purchase [[bottled water]] at local stores. Many stores quickly sold out of water, and bottled water companies increased shipments at the request of the [[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency]], maintaining availability at other stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/05/demand_for_bott.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505145458/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/05/demand_for_bott.html |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/lifestyle/health_and_beauty/x1195009876/You-don-t-have-to-go-far-to-buy-water |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509014506/http://www.patriotledger.com/lifestyle/health_and_beauty/x1195009876/You-don-t-have-to-go-far-to-buy-water |archivedate=2010-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local stores quickly sold out their supplies of bottled water, and the [[Massachusetts National Guard]] was dispatched to deliver additional bottled water.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt; The state government also asked bottled-water suppliers to increase their deliveries to the area.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt; Many cafes such as [[Starbucks]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]] that depended on municipal water for coffee production were closed or forced to operate with limited functionality.

By May 2, workers had stopped the spill and begun repairs on the pipe and MWRA officials reported steady water pressure on the night of May 2.&lt;ref name="NYTBoston" /&gt;

Experts and officials associated with the MWRA interviewed by reporters&lt;ref name=a1&gt;[http://www.necn.com/pages/landing?Boil-water-order-What-you-need-to-know=1&amp;blockID=227079&amp;feedID= ''Boil water order: What you need to know''], NECN Comcast Network, May 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a2&gt;[http://www.necn.com/05/02/10/Weston-water-main-break-not-worst-case/landing_newengland.html?blockID=227412&amp;feedID=4206 ''Weston water main break not worst-case''], NECN Comcast Network, May 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130121132820/http://www.dailynewstribune.com/features/x826102585/Boil-water-order-remains-in-effect-but-progress-reported-on-water-main-break ''Boil-water order remains in effect''], ''but progress reported on water main break'', ''[[Daily News Tribune]]'', by Glen Johnson of the Associated Press, May 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the boil-water order was necessary because the backup reservoirs were untreated and unmonitored by bacterial cultures, which take a few days to run; similar situations had resulted in bacterial contamination bad enough to cause distressing [[Gastroenteritis|gastrointestinal symptoms]] in otherwise healthy adults.&lt;ref name=a1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=a2 /&gt;

On May 4, 2010, at 3 am, [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] announced that Governor Patrick had lifted the water-boil order for all but one of affected communities, Saugus. In a press conference later that morning, Patrick stated that tests had since cleared the water in Saugus as well.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6432V620100504?type=domesticNews|title=Boil-water ban lifted for Boston area | work=Reuters | first=Scott | last=Malone | date=May 4, 2010| accessdate= 7 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test results indicated that the bacteria levels in the emergency supply were not atypical for a normal day. If this had been known earlier, the boil-water order would have been unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;

'''35 Denton''' (formerly '''NX35''' and '''35 Conferette''') is an annual 3-day music festival that takes place in the burgeoning arts corridor of downtown [[Denton, Texas]]. The festival is programmed each March the week prior to the music portion of [[SXSW]] in [[Austin, Texas]].

35 Denton is organized by a core staff of volunteers. The music festival has featured many nationally touring acts, such as [[The Pains of Being Pure At Heart]], [[Local Natives]], [[Portugal. The Man]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[The Mountain Goats]], [[Bun B]], [[Devin the Dude]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Big Boi]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[The Civil Wars]], [[Best Coast]], [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]], [[A Place to Bury Strangers]], and more. Likewise, it also has a roster of notable local acts, such as [[Neon Indian]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Riverboat Gamblers]], [[Seryn]], and more.

==History==
'''2005 – 2008: The Austin Years'''

During SXSW 2005, festival founder Chris Flemmons planted the seeds of 35 Denton in the soil of Big Red Sun, a floral design boutique in Austin. Thirteen Denton acts performed on a stage in the business's outdoor garden for an invite-only crowd of international journalists and industry types. The beer was free, the Tex-Mex was homemade, and the goal was uncomplicated: Show the world what Denton's all about. Flemmons called the event NX35: The Afternoon Party of the Other, Smaller, Music Town in Texas. In 2006, it took place at Club DeVille, and in 2007 and 2008, the party moved to Momo's. Some notable performers from the event's years in Austin include Centro-matic's [[Will Johnson (musician)|Will Johnson]], [[Midlake]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], and the [[Baptist Generals]].

'''2009 – Present: The Denton Years'''

In 2009, after four years in Austin, Flemmons and a small staff of volunteers brought the day party home and turned it into a multi-day festival. The goal of showcasing Denton's performers and people did not change, but the name did: NX35 Music Conferette, which opened with a keynote address  led by [[American Splendor]] creator [[Harvey Pekar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waters |first=Erin |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2009/03/yesterday_at_nx35_a_conversation_about_jazz_with_harvey_pekar.php |title=Yesterday at NX35: A Conversation About Jazz with Harvey Pekar |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the inaugural festival ended, more than 4000 people had watched over 120 acts play on the stages of Denton's numerous clubs and coffeeshops.

In 2010, more than 250 acts performed on and around Denton's downtown square – to an estimated audience of 20,000 people. The event began with keynote speaker [[Steve Albini]] and featured a now storied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/north-by-unrest-chris-flemmons-wants-to-put-denton-music-on-the-map-with-nx35-if-it-doesnt-kill-him-first-6406254|title=North by Unrest: Chris Flemmons Wants To Put Denton Music on the Map With NX35-If it Doesn't Kill Him First|last=Rodrigue|first=Daniel|date=2010-03-11|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; free Saturday night performance by the [[Flaming Lips]] and Denton's own Midlake at the North Texas Fairgrounds. Other notable performers from this era include [[Neon Indian]], [[Centro-matic]], Health, [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], [[Baptist Generals|The Baptist Generals]], [[Brave Combo]], [[Sarah Jaffe]], [[Monotonix]], [[The Riverboat Gamblers|Riverboat Gamblers]], and [[True Widow]].

In 2011, the festival changed its name to 35 Conferette. The name wasn't the only big change, as the fest expanded into the streets of downtown Denton with the addition of three outdoor stages, one of which was on the courthouse lawn. Performers included a growing roster of national talent like [[Big Boi]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Japanther]], and [[Damien Jurado]]. In the months that followed, 35 Conferette was named Best Promotional Event of 2011 by the Texas Downtown Association. Festival founder Chris Flemmons handed the event's future to a new leadership staff led by Creative Director Kyle La Valley and Programming Director, Natalie Dávila. The festival's name changed to 35 Denton in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/the-scene/events/Denton-Music-Fest-Changes-Name-125085534.html|title=Denton Music Fest Changes Name|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 35 Denton was headlined by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] – though they performed a few days later than anticipated. After visa issues prevented their Saturday night appearance, the band played the following Wednesday at the North Texas Fairgrounds, with [[Ty Segall]] as an opening act. Other notable 2012 acts included [[Built to Spill]], [[Bun B]], [[The Raincoats]], OM, [[Best Coast]], [[Oh Sees|Thee Oh Sees]], and [[Dum Dum Girls]].[[File:Flaming Lips at NX35 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Flaming Lips]] performing a free show during NX35 2010]]In 2013, 35 Denton featured performances by [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], Sleep, [[Roky Erickson]], [[Com Truise]], [[Silver Apples]], [[Killer Mike]], [[Thee Oh Sees]], [[Akron/Family]], [[Man Man]], [[Mikal Cronin]], [[Mac DeMarco]], [[Beach Fossils]], [[Reigning Sound]], [[Marnie Stern]], [[Soul Clap]], and the live Texas debut of [[Thurston Moore]]'s side-project [[Chelsea Light Moving]].

After 2013, La Valley and Dávila left the festival leadership and the organization's primary investors withdrew funding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/entertainment/the-scene/35-Denton-at-Risk-as-Staff--Financial-Backer-Part-Ways-214221121.html|title=35 Denton at Risk as Staff and Financial Backer Part Ways|work=NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The festival did not take place in 2014, opting instead to take a year off to reorganize and locate new investors. During this time, a new Denton music festival in [http://oaktopiafest.com Oaktopia] was formed to run opposite 35 Denton in the fall of each year.

In 2015, 35 Denton returned under the theme "Back To The Music", and featured performances by the 1970s [[The Zombies]], [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]], [[Cymbals Eat Guitars]], [[Chastity Belt (band)]], [[Lowell (musician)]], S U R V I V E, and the reunion performance of [[Ten Hands (band)]] led by local musician Paul Slavens.

In 2016, was headlined by the soul artist [[Charles Bradley (singer)]] and his Extraordinaires, hip-hop throwback [[Biz Markie]], and [[Eliot Sumner]], the child of English rock musician [[Sting (musician)]]. Other notable performances were by [[Electric Six]], [[Fat Tony (rapper)]], [[Class Actress]], [[Tacocat]], [[Sheer Mag]], Alesia Lani and the [[Mydolls]].

The 2017 event was canceled without firm plans to revive the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guidelive.com/music/2017/02/06/official-35-denton-music-festival-canceled|title=It's official: 35 Denton music festival is not happening this year|date=2017-02-06|work=GuideLive|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{Show|The Eight Track Museum:
| Earotica Music storeowner and music producer Bucks Burnett brought his extensive and unusual eight track collection to NX35.
The event presented rare tapes, promotional materials, and ephemera related to the popular history of the format. Materials of note within the museum collection include 500 sealed eight tracks by [[The Rutles]] (with the original shipping cartons), a three-pack eight track box set of recordings by [[The Beatles]], and thirty sealed eight tracks by [[Elvis Presley]] (in their original [[RCA Records]] shipping carton).
In conjunction with the exhibition opening, Burnett curates a special exhibition entitled "Metal Machine Music: 35 Years" focused on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the release of [[Lou Reed]]'s infamous 1975 double album, featuring eight tracks of many of Reed's legendary projects and associates, including rare sealed tapes from [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Nico]], and more.}}

===The Hot Wet Mess===

In May 2012, 35 Denton announced a one-day end of summer party to take place on September 1, 2012 entitled 'The Hot Wet Mess.' The festival's first venture into event production outside the 35 Denton festival took place at the North Texas Fairgrounds and featured [[Black Lips]], [[No Age]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Big Freedia]], [[Unknown Mortal Orchestra]] as well as local acts [[Fergus &amp; Geronimo]], DJ Sober and RTB2. The event was sponsored by [[Vitamin Water]] and [[Corona Light]], and consisted of attractions such as a water slide to overlook the stage.

The '''Animex International Festival of Animation and Computer Games''' takes place every year in [[Middlesbrough]] in the [[North East England|North East]] of [[England]]. The festival has its roots firmly planted in the creative side of the animation and computer games industries and acts to provide animators, directors, students, artists, designers, writers and educators with a forum in which they can share their knowledge and skills and promote the art of animation and computer games development.

Animex began as a two-day series of lectures by animators and industry professionals at the [[University of Teesside]] in February 2000, and has rapidly grown to a week-long festival incorporating the two-day event that began it all, '''Animex Talk'''. '''Animex Game''' expanded on this idea in 2004, by creating another two days of presentations, this time by games professionals. 2013 sees the birth of a new comics day, the first event hosted by Jim Zubkavich of [[Udon Entertainment]]

The main venue for the festival is The University of Teesside, with other events taking place at [[Cineworld]] Cinema and other venues throughout Middlesbrough and the rest of the north east.

The festival also runs an exhibition of animation and games art, an international student awards scheme, screenings, workshops and Animexperience, a programme of school and community events giving people the chance to try their hand at animation and meet industry luminaries.

Guest speakers in the past have included such industry professionals as [[Pixar]] animator Mark Walsh, [[Bob the Builder]] designer [[Curtis Jobling]], Phil Tippett, Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, owner of Ritual Entertainment Richard [[Levelord]] Gray, [[Valve]], [[Epic Games|Epic]], [[Naughty Dog]], [[Blitz Games]], [[Ernest W. Adams]], [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]], Professor Stuart Sumida and representatives from almost every major games and animation studio around the world.

Animex was in part the inspiration for the [[Red Stick International Animation Festival]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]].

Animex is run by animation and computer games lecturers within the [[University of Teesside]].

'''Bellefonte''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson County]], [[Alabama]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|113878}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the site of the [[Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station]]. It is located roughly two miles southeast of [[Hollywood, Alabama]].

==Demographics==
Bellefonte was listed on the 1860 and 1870 U.S. Census rolls. In 1860, it was the most populous (and only) incorporated community in Jackson County with 181 persons (of whom 173 were White, and 8 were "Free Colored"; no slaves were recorded.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1860a-04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

==History==
Bellefonte was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated on December 15, 1821,&lt;ref name="alabama-law-1823-lxiii"&gt;A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama: Containing The Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the end of the General Assembly in January, 1823.  Published by Ginn &amp; Curtis, J. &amp; J. Harper, Printers, New-York, 1828.  Title 62. Chapter LXIII. Page 839. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvtKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA839 "An Act to Incorporate the Town of Belle-Fonte, in the County of Jackson.—Passed  December 15, 1821." (Google Books)]&lt;/ref&gt; when it had nearly 200 residents. Its name was a subjective description consisting of the French words "belle", meaning "beautiful," and "fonte", meaning "fount." It was the [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson County]] [[county seat|seat]] from 1821 to 1868, when it was relocated to [[Scottsboro, Alabama|Scottsboro]]. 

During the 1820s, a courthouse and church were constructed. A post office was established in 1830. By 1844, the population had grown to 400. The town suffered severe damage during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The post office was closed in 1859. 

The relocation of the county seat in 1868 drew off business from town. This town rapidly lost population, dropping off the census rolls by 1880. The town was abandoned by the 1920s. All that remains of Bellefonte today are the cemetery, the chimney of the local [[Public house#Inns|inn]], and piles of scattered bricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dream Has Gone: Civil War, Rejection of Railroad Led to Bellefonte's Demise|work=Huntsville Times|first=Jeff |last=Tryon|date=July 6, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foscue, Virginia.

'''Sir Robert John Parker''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM}} (born 13 January 1953) is a former New Zealand broadcaster and politician. He served as [[Mayor of Christchurch]] from 2007 to 2013.

==Early years==
Parker grew up in the [[Christchurch]] suburbs of [[Heathcote Valley]] and [[Somerfield, New Zealand|Somerfield]]. He attended [[Christchurch South Intermediate]] and [[Cashmere High School]]. He studied an intermediate year in [[zoology]] at the [[University of Canterbury]] before undertaking casual work.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/mayor/biography.aspx |title=Mayor Bob Parker – biography |publisher=Christchurch City Council |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222045858/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/mayor/biography.aspx |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting career==
Parker got his first job on radio, in Nelson. His broadcasting career then took him to Christchurch, Wellington and then Auckland.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He was the associate producer and original host (1984–1996) of the New Zealand version of the ''[[This Is Your Life (New Zealand TV series)|This is Your Life]]'' series after he purchased the New Zealand television rights for the show from Ralph Edwards Productions in California. He returned to Christchurch in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nztourismconference.co.nz/Programme---Highlights/Speakers-Biographies.asp |title=Speakers Biographies – Bob Parker |date=1 August 2008 |publisher=Tourism Industry Conference New Zealand |accessdate=27 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105015652/http://www.nztourismconference.co.nz/Programme---Highlights/Speakers-Biographies.asp |archivedate=5 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local body politics==
Parker's local government career spanned more than two decades. He first became politically active when he filled a councillor vacancy on the [[Banks Peninsula District]] Council in 1994.&lt;ref name="Press bio"&gt;{{cite news |title=Twenty years serving the community |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=19 June 2013 |page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television star new mayor of Banks Peninsula|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=222678|accessdate=25 April 2015|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|agency=[[The Star (Christchurch)|The Star]]|date=13 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having lived in [[Akaroa]] for several years, he served as mayor of [[Banks Peninsula]] District for two terms (2001–2006). He favoured amalgamation of the district with Christchurch City and led a high profile and controversial campaign leading to a poll in 2005. Amalgamation with the City was supported by 65% of the Peninsula's voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobparker.co.nz/index.html |title=bobparker.co.nz |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803041710/http://www.bobparker.co.nz/index.html |archivedate=3 August 2004 |df=dmy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amalgamation took place on 3 March 2006, at which Parker, after winning a by-election, became a Christchurch city councillor, and the sole Banks Peninsula representative on the council.&lt;ref name="Press bio"/&gt;

In 2006 Parker was elected as the independent chair of the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy. This saw the bringing together of four local councils—Christchurch, Selwyn, Waimakariri and the Canterbury Regional Council—for a major planning undertaking based on creating a sustainable growth plan for the greater Christchurch area. The Strategy was adopted in 2007 by all of the member councils and is today the basis for all spatial planning in the greater Christchurch area.

In October 2007, Parker successfully stood in the [[New Zealand local elections, 2007|local government elections]] for the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2007|Christchurch mayoralty]], after the retirement of [[Garry Moore (mayor)|Garry Moore]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10469695"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10469695 |title=New faces aplenty in local government shake-ups |author=Gay, Edward |date=13 October 2007 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received 47,033 votes, with [[Megan Woods]] (32,821) and [[Jo Giles]] (14,454) in the election contested by ten candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christchurch City Mayor |url=http://www.elections2010.co.nz/2007/elections/christchurch-city-mayor |publisher=Local Elections 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827073353/http://www.elections2010.co.nz/2007/elections/christchurch-city-mayor# |archive-date=27 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker announced in 2009 that he would seek re-election at the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2010|2010 Christchurch mayoral election]].&lt;ref name="Gordon candidacy"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/3597603/Gordon-announces-mayoral-candidacy |title=Gordon to enter race |last=Conway |first=Glenn |date=20 April 2010 |publisher=The Press |page=A2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being the incumbent, he initially polled behind his major challenger&lt;ref name="UMR June opinion poll"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mayoralty SurveyChristchurch City Council |url=http://www.umr.co.nz/Media/Christchurch_MayoralElectionResearch_Jun10.pdf |publisher=UMR Research |accessdate=20 July 2010 |location=Wellington |format=PDF |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195105/http://www.umr.co.nz/Media/Christchurch_MayoralElectionResearch_Jun10.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="umr_1"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1006/S00145.htm |title=Anderton Leading Parker In Race|publisher=UMR Research Ltd |date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4070928"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/4070928/ |title=Anderton leads in mayoral race |author=Conway, Glenn |date=28 August 2010 |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the large [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/3366146g.html Christchurch 7.1magnitude – 4.35am Sat 4th Sept 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905223314/http://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/quakes/3366146g.html |date=5 September 2010 }}, Geonet, Christchurch Earthquake Reference&lt;/ref&gt; on 4 September 2010.

===2010 earthquake===
[[File:Band Together Concert For Canterbury.jpg|thumb|Parker performing with [[The Bats (New Zealand band)|The Bats]] at the Band Together Concert For Canterbury in October 2010]]
Parker was the incumbent mayor at the time of the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|September 2010 Canterbury earthquake]]. During the days following the quake, he worked with [[Civil Defence]], the police and the New Zealand Army to get the city back up and running. In October 2010, Christchurch band [[The Bats (New Zealand band)|The Bats]] and many others played at a free earthquake relief concert in [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]] in front of about 140,000 people. Parker joined The Bats for the performance and played guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rocking for right reasons |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4269120/Rocking-for-right-reasons |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bob and The Bats on show |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4217870/Bob-and-The-Bats-on-show |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the earthquake, some polls had Parker trailing Anderton but his high profile since 4 September and cool handling of the earthquake's aftermath won him widespread praise and the support of voters who overwhelmingly backed him to run the city for a second term.&lt;ref name="Parker re-elected"&gt;{{cite news |last=Conway |first=Glenn |title=Bob Parker re-elected Christchurch Mayor |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/local-elections-2010/4215351/Bob-Parker-re-elected-Christchurch-Mayor |accessdate=22 December 2011 |newspaper=stuff.co.nz |date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 earthquake===
[[File:Mayor bob Parker speaks to ships' companies in Lyttelton.jpg|thumb|Mayor Parker speaks to ships' companies in the port town [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]]]
Parker was the media face of the recovery efforts in the aftermath of the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], working with the police and the army and rescue squads, as well as answering the media's questions.

On 18 March 2011, Parker addressed the national Christchurch memorial service at [[Hagley Park (New Zealand)|Hagley Park]] of Christchurch in the presence of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], Prime Minister [[John Key]], Dame [[Malvina Major]], [[Hayley Westenra]], [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]] Choir, dignitaries, international rescue teams and tens of thousands of [[New Zealanders]].&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4071980"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-quake-memorial-service-happened-4071417/video?vid=4071980 |title=Christchurch quake memorial service: As it happened |date=18 March 2011 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February earthquake the New Zealand Government brought in a special act of Parliament, [[The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act]], which essentially passed ultimate responsibility for the [[rebuilding of post-quake Christchurch]] to the Government. The Council was given the task of preparing a new plan to rebuild the central business district of the city. The project, chaired by Parker, was titled "share an idea". It won international acclaim for the Council, including the international "Co Creation" award - the first time this award had been granted outside of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stoppress.co.nz/blog/2011/11/strategys-share-an-idea-gets-international-co-creation-plaudits | title=Strategy's Share an Idea gets international co-creation plaudits | work=StopPress | date=28 November 2011 | accessdate=17 September 2014 | author=StopPress Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outrage was expressed at the Council, after Christchurch City Council CEO [[Tony Marryatt]] was given a near $70,000 pay rise in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christchurch protest over city chief's pay rise |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-protest-over-city-chief-s-pay-rise-4666796 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |newspaper=TVNZ |date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest was held at the City Council Building on 1 February 2012. Approximately 4000 citizens turned up to protest the decision of the City Council, and to call for a mid-term election.&lt;ref name="CCC protest"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=Protesters threaten rates revolt in Christchurch |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6351630/Protesters-threaten-rates-revolt-in-Christchurch |accessdate=4 February 2012 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 when the government announced the cost of the rebuild was going to be as much as $40 billion, Parker said it was "no surprise", and welcomed the extra investment as being "good for [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Dan |last = Satherley | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Rebuild-cost-jump-no-surprise---Parker/tabid/423/articleID/295852/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News NZ]] |title= Rebuild cost jump 'no surprise' - Parker| date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bob's Mob cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Residential protest against Parker and CEO [[Tony Marryatt]]]]
In mid-June 2013, Minister for Earthquake Recovery [[Gerry Brownlee]] revealed in a press conference that [[International Accreditation New Zealand]] (IANZ) had written to [[Christchurch City Council]] threatening to revoke its accreditation for issuing building consents. This caught Parker by surprise, as he knew nothing of this threat, and he criticised Brownlee for not communicating with him before the press conference; Parker famously labelled Brownlee's practice a "media missile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultimatum in consent crisis looms |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/8794459/Ultimatum-in-consent-crisis-looms |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Council's 'arranged marriage' on the rocks |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/8794426/Councils-arranged-marriage-on-the-rocks |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] | date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownlee and Parker had at times a strained relationship, with the government taking an increasing amount of control in local decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Race to decide who's the boss |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8828396/Race-to-decide-whos-the-boss |accessdate=5 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Parker announced on ''[[Campbell Live]]'' he would not be running for re-election in the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|2013 Christchurch mayoral elections]], citing exhaustion and not having the required energy for a third term as mayor.

In July 2013 an editorial in ''[[The Press]]'' noted that a tribute paid to Parker by the Prime Minister of New Zealand [[John Key]] was "well deserved".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/8966098/Editorial-Parker-tribute-well-deserved&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister in a speech to the [[Local Government New Zealand]] organisation in 2013 stated that Parker's "commitment to the city during its darkest hours will be his legacy".&lt;ref name="LGNZ"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.national.org.nz/news/news/media-releases/detail/2013/07/22/address-to-2013-local-government-new-zealand-conference | title=Address to 2013 Local Government New Zealand Conference | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=17 September 2014 | author=Rt Hon John Key|publisher=[[New Zealand National Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2014 New Year Honours]], Parker was appointed a [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to local-body affairs and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2014 | title=New Year honours list 2014|date=31 December 2013 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''The Press'' stated that Parker had "fronted the media coverage of the two disasters and the ensuing civil emergencies to local and international media. His calm leadership throughout the emergency periods were noted for providing reassurance and hope to the people of Christchurch."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/9564989/Editorial-Controversial-but-deserved&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chalica was created as a holiday in 2005 by Daylene Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wuuc.org/2014/12/chalica/ |title=Chalica |last1=Van Leer |first1=Lois E. |last2= |first2= |date=11 December 2014 |website=wuuc.org |publisher=Woodville Unitarian Universalist Church |access-date=5 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has gained followers since, it is not a widely celebrated holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/chalica-gains-adherents |title=Chalica, new weeklong UU holiday, slowly gains adherents |author=Donald E. Skinner |date=December 7, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
To solve the problem of having only a single week in which to cram seven [[wiktionary:nonnominal|nonnominal]] deeds for the  [[Unitarian_Universalism#Seven_Principles_and_Purposes|seven Unitarian Universalist principles]], the Unitarian Universalist Church of Bowling Green in Kentucky extends Chalica into a seven-week observance.  Further, Chalica at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Bowling Green starts on the first Sunday in January as an extension of the [[New Year's resolution]] concept.&lt;ref name="7-week-variant"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''China Touring Car Championship''' (CTCC) is a [[touring car racing]] series based in [[China]]. Between 2004 and 2008 the series was known as the '''China Circuit Championship'''. The series consists of two classes, one for 2000cc cars and one for 1600cc cars.

The series will join forces with the [[Japanese Touring Car Championship]], which returns in 2012, with the series visiting each other during the 2012 season. The promoters of the two series are looking to form an [[Asian Touring Car Championship]] for [[Super 2000]] cars in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiawtcc.com/Read_News.asp?idnews=645 |title=WTCC – FIA World Touring Car Championship |publisher=Fiawtcc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cooks Source'' infringement controversy''' occurred in November 2010, when ''Cooks Source'', a free, advertising-supported publication distributed in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]], became the center of a [[copyright infringement]] dispute after the magazine reprinted an online article without permission of the author.&lt;ref name="holmes2010"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
As reported by Dan Crowley of the local ''[[Daily Hampshire Gazette]]'', ''Cooks Source'' was founded in 1997 by Judith D. Griggs, a former town planner&lt;ref name="hamel2007"&gt;Hamel, Chris (December 12, 2007). [http://www.masslive.com/springfield/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-12/119744766266990.xml&amp;coll=1 Warren to seek town planner.] ''[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|The Republican]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ellery2007"&gt;Ellery, J.P. (December 14, 2007). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172508875.html Selectman denies bullying in heavy-duty discussion.] ''[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation agent,&lt;ref name="devlin2009"&gt;Devlin, Emily (August 8, 2009). [http://www.allbusiness.com/environment-natural-resources/land-use-development/12639130-1.html Angry words exchanged at meeting.] ''[[Sentinel &amp; Enterprise]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="devlin2009b"&gt;Devlin, Emily (August 19, 2009). [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FSEB&amp;p_theme=fseb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12A35063690B9D38&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Agent fired over heated remarks.] ''[[Sentinel &amp; Enterprise]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who had art directed and edited several small magazines previously. The magazine stated its goal was "to help educate readers about sustainable sources of foods and products, farms, cooking, restaurants and businesses," and to provide a marketing tool for small businesses and farms which create and sell food for local businesses and consumers. At the time of the incident, ''Cooks Source'' was published by Cooks Source Publications in the second-floor office of a rented duplex in [[Sunderland, Massachusetts]], almost {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of  [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Griggs, who was 59 years old at the time of the incident, hand-delivered the monthly publication with her adult daughter along a 2,000-mile distribution route to locations in western New England, including [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Vermont]], and some of [[New Hampshire]]. The magazine's circulation varied, but it was under 10,000 a month.&lt;ref name="crowley2010c"/&gt;

Griggs rose to internet notoriety on November 4, 2010, after it became known that an article published on page 10 in the October 2010 ''Cooks Source'' issue infringed on the copyright of Monica Gaudio, the piece's author.&lt;ref name="pegoraro2010"&gt;Pegoraro, Rob (November 4, 2010). [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2010/11/cooks_source_masters_new_recip.html ''Cooks Source'' magazine masters new recipe: How to annoy the Internet.] ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Gaudio had published the copyrighted piece under the title "A Tale of Two Tarts" on a website devoted to [[medieval]] [[cookery]].&lt;ref name="gaudio2005"&gt;Gaudio, Monica (2005). [http://www.godecookery.com/twotarts/twotarts.html A Tale of Two Tarts.] via ''Gode Cookery'', accessed November 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudio was credited in ''Cooks Source'' for the 1,300-word piece, which was retitled "As American As Apple Pie — Isn't!" and was revised from Gaudio's original in places. Griggs neither paid Gaudio nor notified her when the piece had run.&lt;ref name="lynch2010"&gt;Lynch, Rene (November 4, 2010). [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dailydish/2010/11/cooks-source-magazine-vs-the-web.html Daily Dish: ''Cooks Source'' magazine vs. the Web.] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiceCast12"&gt;DiceCast Episode 12: Interview with Monica Gaudio (by [[Polymancer]] Studios). November 15, 2010 [http://dicecast.blogspot.com/2010/11/dicecast-episode-12-interview-with.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudio notified Griggs of the infringement and asked for an apology and a small donation to the [[Columbia School of Journalism]]. (Gaudio chose the Columbia School of Journalism so ''Cooks Source'' could easily comply with her request; she has stated that she is neither a journalist herself nor is she affiliated with that institution.&lt;ref name="DiceCast12" /&gt;) The ensuing response by Griggs "has become the stuff of internet legend,"&lt;ref name="silverman2010"&gt;Silverman, Craig (November 12, 2010). [https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/890234--newsmangled-cooks-source-s-recipe-for-disaster Newsmangled: Cooks Source’s recipe for disaster.] ''[[Toronto Star]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and said in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But honestly Monica, the web is considered 'public domain' and you should be happy we just didn't 'lift' your whole article and put someone else's name on it! It happens a lot, clearly more than you are aware of, especially on college campuses, and the workplace. If you took offence and are unhappy, I am sorry, but you as a professional should know that the article we used written by you was in very bad need of editing, and is much better now than was originally. Now it will work well for your portfolio. For that reason, I have a bit of a difficult time with your requests for monetary gain, albeit for such a fine (and very wealthy!) institution. We put some time into rewrites, you should compensate me! I never charge young writers for advice or rewriting poorly written pieces, and have many who write for me... ALWAYS for free!&lt;ref name="gaudio2010Nov3"&gt;Gaudio, Monica (November 3, 2010).

==Online response==
Griggs' response, particularly her statement that all web content is considered [[public domain]], was publicized by a number of online celebrities, including [[Nick Mamatas]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[John Scalzi]], [[Neil Gaiman]], and [[Warren Ellis]].&lt;ref name="DiceCast12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc2010"&gt;Staff report (November 5, 2010).

Gaudio said she never intended the online response to go as far as it had, but she expected mainstream media coverage once Gaiman re-tweeted it. She said she knew one or more ''Cooks Source'' advertisers had been contacted, but she did not intend for any small businesses or people to be harmed or harassed. She said she found many of the Facebook comments amusing.&lt;ref name="DiceCast12" /&gt;

==Response by ''Cooks Source''==
Gaudio did not receive a direct response from Griggs or ''Cooks Source Magazine'' in relation to the affair after Gaudio posted about their email communication.&lt;ref name="gaudio2010Nov4"&gt;Gaudio, Monica (November 4, 2010).

On November 9, the ''Cooks Source'' website was updated with an unsigned statement indicating ''Cooks Source'' had complied with Gaudio's requests for redress and were changing their business practices.&lt;ref name="pace2010"&gt;Pace, Gina (November 10, 2010).

In her first interview after the incident, Griggs said she had received hundreds of emails and disconnected her phone after getting over 100 calls. Though the November issue was scheduled for delivery, Griggs said, "I don't know if I'm going to continue ''Cooks Source''. At this point, it's looking doubtful." The article elaborated that ''Cooks Source'' commonly received cookbooks and recipes from publishers and that its content was routinely duplicated from those sources, sometimes with express permission.&lt;ref name="crowley2010c"&gt;Crowley, Dan (November 12, 2010).

On November 17, 2010, the ''Cooks Source'' homepage was updated again, with a personal statement from Griggs which claimed Gaudio's email was "antagonistic and just plain rude", that Gaudio had neglected to post "nice" things Griggs had said in her email alongside the rude things, and that Griggs had offered to compensate Gaudio for the article, but that Gaudio "never gave [her] a chance" to address the issue.

The NPR program ''[[On the Media]]'' discussed the episode as an example of how quickly and severely anger can spread on the Internet, noting that the episode had made the phrase "but honestly, Monica" into an internet meme and had spawned the [[verb]] "to Griggs", defined as "to use content on the Web without permission, then request payment from the original author for rewrites and editing."&lt;ref name="gladstone2010"&gt;Gladstone, Brooke (November 12, 2010).

'''Dance hosts on cruise ships''' are people who fill an unpaid position on [[cruise ship]]s.  They are almost exclusively [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], typically between the ages of 40 and 70, who excel in social [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dancing]].

Many [[cruise line]]s allocate cabins for dance host programs. Dance hosts are expected to socialize with passengers and dance with the female passengers, who happen to greatly outnumber male passengers on most cruises.  Dance hosts must be present nightly at dance floor locations and "work the room", offering a dance to each unescorted female passenger, while being careful to not to show favoritism.
They are also responsible for attending all ship-sponsored parties and are often asked to host tables at dinner time.  They serve as general companions, making conversation and joining in for shipboard activities and games. All the while, romance is not involved, so these gentlemen must have their wits and tact about them. Crossing another passenger's cabin threshold can result in disembarkation. The film [[Out to Sea]], a comical interpretation of the position, is basically a guide of what ''not'' to do.

Ideal applicants come from well travelled and well educated backgrounds who find it easy to converse on a variety of subjects. It is important that hosts have polished appearances and refined, approachable manners. They must also be in good shape, as dancing, most nights, lasts for hours.
Cruise lines usually allocate one passenger cabin for two hosts and allow a placement agency to charge a small daily fee. This covers the cost of recruiting, qualifying, and booking hosts for the cruise lines' itineraries.  Qualification procedures include a [[background check]], a dance audition with a local dance instructor or video audition, and a written biography with a photograph which can be used as an introduction and conversation starter once on board.

A host must have an inherent love for dancing and socializing and not consider his responsibilities a job, because he'd be disappointed to learn that dance hosting is not a paid position. On the other hand, he will be sailing to exciting destinations on a luxury vessel for a small fraction of the ticket price that the regular guests pay.  There are often perks associated with this position including paid airfare for some long sailings, discounts for laundry, bar tabs, and internet, and opportunities to serve as an escorts for shore excursions - which means they may join in on $150+ land-based itineraries for free.

The '''Engelbrekt rebellion''' was a rebellion in 1434–1436 led by [[Sweden|Swedish]] miner and nobleman [[Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson]] against [[Eric of Pomerania]], the king of the [[Kalmar Union]]. It resulted in the deposing of Eric and the erosion of the union.

==Background==
In 1434, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union, a [[personal union]] that united Sweden with [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] under a single [[monarch]], the current monarch being [[Eric of Pomerania]]. The Swedes were not happy with the Danes' frequent warfare on [[Schleswig]], [[Holstein]], [[Mecklenburg]], and [[Pomerania]], which disturbed Swedish exports (notably [[iron]]) to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. During the [[Danish-Hanseatic War (1426–1435)|Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war]], while the exports were brought to a halt, the collection of [[taxes]] continued, enraging Swedish peasants. Furthermore, the centralization of government in Denmark raised suspicions. The [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] wanted to retain a fair degree of [[self-government]].

==Rebellion==
The rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]].

In the summer of 1434, enraged [[miners]] and peasants burned the castle of [[Borganäs]] near [[Borlänge]]. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman [[Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson]] with mining interests in the [[Bergslagen]] area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in [[Vadstena]] in August 1434, but were unsuccessful.

In January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in [[Arboga]], which later has been called the first [[Riksdag of the Estates]] (although it is uncertain whether the [[Estate of Swedish Peasants|peasants]] really participated). Engelbrekt was elected Captain (''Rikshövitsman'') of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards [[Stockholm]], where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city.

A certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the [[Swedish nobility|Nobility]] and [[Estate of Swedish Clergy|Clergy]] decided to support [[Karl Knutsson Bonde]], who in 1436 had risen to the position of ''Rikshövitsman''. Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates ([[Estate of Swedish Burgers|Burghers]] and [[Estate of Swedish Peasants|Peasants]]). However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active. In a twist of fate highly beneficial to Knutsson, Engelbrekt was [[assassinate]]d on May 4 by [[Måns Bengtsson (Natt och Dag)]], the cause being an unrelated personal conflict. Consequently, Knutsson won the power struggle (and became King Charles VIII of Sweden in 1448). A man named Erik Puke attempted to rally Engelbrekt's old supporters in the ''[[Pukefejden]]'', but it was too late. Puke was apprehended and executed in Stockholm in 1437.

==Consequences==
The Engelbrekt rebellion caused the unity of the Kalmar Union to erode, leading to the expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden. Although later [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish kings]] regained influence over Sweden, the rebellion had set a precedent for Swedish claims to sovereignty. It also set a precedent for peasants to engage actively in Swedish politics; in the future power claimants always took pains to appeal to peasant and peasant interests.

Furthermore, where it is uncertain whether all four Estates participated in the Diet (''[[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]]'') in [[Arboga]], this was in fact the case in 1436, when a Diet was held in [[Uppsala]] following the death of Engelbrekt. Thus, the Engelbrekt rebellion marked the start of a [[democracy|democratic institution]] which to a certain extent included the peasants.

[[File:Festival of Britain.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Festival of Britain emblem – the [[Festival Star]] – designed by [[Abram Games]], from the cover of the South Bank Exhibition Guide, 1951]]

The '''Festival of Britain''' was a national exhibition and fair that reached millions of visitors throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the summer of 1951. Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] says the Festival was a "triumphant success" as people:
:flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the Dome of Discovery, gaze at the Skylon, and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom,  showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Nahm.|title=Britain Since 1945: The People's Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKwGaWWKzNAC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1992|publisher=Oxford UP|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour cabinet member [[Herbert Morrison]] was the prime mover; in 1947 he started with the original plan to celebrate the centennial of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Donoughue, and G. W. Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973), pp 492-95.&lt;/ref&gt;   However it was not to be another [[World Fair]], for international themes were absent, as was the British Commonwealth. Instead the 1951 festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of £12 million.  The Labour government was losing support and so the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=DK Publishing|title=History of Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWjmgqpSgAC&amp;pg=PA361|year=2011|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.  

The Festival's centrepiece was in London on the [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]].  There were events in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]]  (Architecture), [[Battersea Park|Battersea]] (The Festival Pleasure Gardens), [[South Kensington]] (Science) and [[Glasgow]] (Industrial Power).  Festival celebrations took place in [[Cardiff]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Bournemouth]], [[York]], [[Aldeburgh]], [[Inverness]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Oxford]], [[Norwich]], [[Canterbury]] and elsewhere&lt;ref name="Britain 1951"&gt;''The Festival of Britain'' (Official Book of the Festival of Britain 1951). HMSO, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; and there were touring exhibitions by land and sea.  

The Festival became a "beacon for change" that proved immensely popular with thousands of elite visitors and millions of popular ones. It helped reshape British arts, crafts, designs and sports for a generation.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Turner, ''Beacon for Change: How the 1951 Festival of Britain Shaped the Modern Age'' (2011).  &lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Harry Hopkins highlights the widespread impact of the "Festival style". They called it "Contemporary". It was:
:clean, bright and new.... It caught hold quickly and spread first across London and then across England....In an island hitherto largely given up to gravy browns and dull greens, "Contemporary" boldly espoused strong primary colors.&lt;ref&gt; Harry Hopkins, ''The New Look: A social history of the Forties and Fifties in Britain'' ( 1963) pp 271-72. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception and organisation==
[[File:1951 South Bank Exhibition.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the South Bank Exhibition from the north bank of the [[Thames]], showing the 300-foot tall  [[Skylon (tower)|Skylon]] and the [[Dome of Discovery]].]]
The first idea for an exhibition in 1951 came from the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1943, which considered that an international exhibition should be held to commemorate the centenary of the 1851 [[Great Exhibition]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/events/2007paulingconference/video-s2-3-anderson.html |title="Circa 1951: Presenting Science to the British Public", Robert Anderson, Oregon State University |publisher=Osulibrary.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706032208/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/events/2007paulingconference/video-s2-3-anderson.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945, the government appointed a committee under [[Lord Ramsden]] to consider how exhibitions and fairs could promote exports.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; When the committee reported a year later, it was decided not to continue with the idea of an international exhibition because of its cost at a time when reconstruction was a high priority.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; [[Herbert Morrison]] took charge for the Labour government and decided instead to hold a series of displays about the arts, architecture, science, technology and industrial design,&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Cox, Ian, ''The South Bank Exhibition: A guide to the story it tells'', H.M.S.O., 1951&lt;/ref&gt; under the title "Festival of Britain 1951".&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;  Morrison insisted there be no politics, explicit or implicit. As a result Labour-sponsored programs such as nationalisation, universal health care and working class housing were excluded; instead what was allowed was town planning, scientific progress, and all sorts of traditional and modern arts and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, "A Tonic to the Nation" p 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of London  lay in ruins and models of redevelopment were needed.  The Festival was an attempt to give Britons a feeling of recovery and progress and to promote better-quality design in the rebuilding of British towns and cities.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vads.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/festival.html |title=V&amp;A, '&amp;#39;Designing Britain'&amp;#39; |publisher=Vads.ac.uk |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Festival of Britain described itself as "one united act of national reassessment, and one corporate reaffirmation of faith in the nation's future."&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; [[Gerald Barry (British journalist)|Gerald Barry]], the Festival Director, described it as "a tonic to the nation".&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

A Festival Council to advise the government was set up under General [[Lord Ismay]].&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  Responsibility for organisation devolved upon the [[Lord President of the Council]], Herbert Morrison, the deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who had been London County Council leader. He appointed a Great Exhibition Centenary Committee, consisting of civil servants, who were to define the framework of the Festival and to liaise between government departments and the festival organisation. In March 1948, a Festival Headquarters was set up, which was to be the nucleus of the Festival of Britain Office, a government department with its own budget.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; Festival projects in Northern Ireland were undertaken by the government of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;F.M. Leventhal, "'A Tonic to the Nation': The Festival of Britain, 1951." ''Albion'' 27#3 (1995): 445-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the Festival of Britain Office were the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the [[Council of Industrial Design]], the [[British Film Institute]] and the National Book League.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  In addition, a Council for Architecture and a Council for Science and Technology were specially created to advise the Festival Organisation and a Committee of Christian Churches was set up to advise on religion.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  Government grants were made to the Arts Council, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the [[National Museum of Wales]] for work undertaken as part of the Festival.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt;

[[Gerald Barry (British journalist)|Gerald  Barry]] had operational charge. A long-time editor with left-leaning, middle-brow views, he was energetic and optimistic, with an eye for what would be popular, and a knack on how to motivate others. Unlike Morrison, Barry was not seen as a Labour ideologue. Barry selected the next rank, giving preference to young architects and designers who had collaborated on exhibitions for the wartime  Ministry of Information. They thought along the same lines socially and aesthetically, as middle-class intellectuals with progressive sympathies. Thanks to Barry a collegial sentiments prevailed that minimised stress and delay.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, "A Tonic to the Nation" p 447&lt;/ref&gt;
===Displays===
The arts were displayed in a series of country-wide musical and dramatic performances.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; Achievements in architecture were to presented in a new neighbourhood, the Lansbury Estate, planned, built and occupied in the Poplar district of London.

The Festival's centrepiece&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; was the South Bank Exhibition, in the [[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]] area of London, which demonstrated the contribution made by British advances in science, technology and industrial design, displayed, in their practical and applied form, against a background representing the living, working world of the day.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

There were other displays elsewhere, each intended to be complete in itself, yet each part of the one single conception.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; Festival Pleasure Gardens were set up in Battersea, about three miles up river from the South Bank.  Heavy engineering was the subject of an Exhibition of Industrial Power in Glasgow.  Certain aspects of science, which did not fall within the terms of reference of the South Bank Exhibition, were displayed in South Kensington.  Linen technology and science in agriculture were exhibited in "Farm and Factory" in Belfast. A smaller exhibition of the South Bank story was put on in the Festival ship ''[[HMS Campania (D48)|Campania]]'',&lt;ref name="Britain 1951"/&gt; which toured the coast of Britain throughout the summer of 1951, and on land there was a travelling exhibition of industrial design.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The [[University of Brighton Design Archives]] have digitised many of the [http://vads.ac.uk/results.php?&amp;cmd=search&amp;page=1&amp;mode=boolean&amp;words=dcafb&amp;idSearch=boolean&amp;ordered=title&amp;ordered=image_up,key1 Design Council's files] relating to the planning of the festival.

==The South Bank Exhibition==

Construction of [[the South Bank]] site opened up a new public space, including a riverside walkway, where previously there had been warehouses and working-class housing. The layout of the South Bank site was intended to showcase the principles of [[urban design]] that would feature in the post-war rebuilding of London and the creation of the [[new town]]s. These included multiple levels of buildings, elevated walkways and avoidance of a street grid. Most of the South Bank buildings were [[International Modernism|International Modernist]] in style, little seen in Britain before the war.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Newman, and Ian Smith, "Cultural production, place and politics on the South Bank of the Thames." ''International Journal of Urban and Regional Research'' 24.1 (2000): 9-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features of the South Bank Exhibition===

====The Skylon====
[[File:In16695.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Skylon on the Southbank, Festival of Britain, 1951]]
{{Main article|Skylon (Festival of Britain)}}
An unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad steel tower supported by cables, [[Skylon (tower)|the Skylon]] was the “Vertical Feature” that was an abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50&amp;nbsp;feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300&amp;nbsp;feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by [[Hidalgo Moya]], [[Philip Powell (Architect)|Philip Powell]] and [[Felix Samuely]], and fabricated by [[Painter Brothers]] of [[Hereford]], England, between [[Westminster Bridge]] and [[Hungerford Bridge]]. It had a steel [[latticework]] frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller in situ.&lt;ref name="Grant, construction photo" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects' design was made possible by the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the [[Architectural Association]] School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The Skylon was scrapped in 1952 on the orders of [[Winston Churchill]], who saw it as a symbol of the preceding Labour Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=3805 |title=Skyscraper news |publisher=Skyscraper news |date=19 February 2000 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished and sold for scrap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1952/feb/05/skylon-disposal#S5CV0495P0_19520205_CWA_157 |title=Hansard |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=5 February 1952 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being toppled into the Thames.

====Royal Festival Hall====
{{Main article|Royal Festival Hall}}
Designed by [[Leslie Martin]], [[Peter Moro]] and [[Robert Matthew]] from the LCC's Architects' Department and built by [[Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts]] for [[London County Council]]. The foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Clement Attlee 1949 on the site of the former [[Lion Brewery (London)|Lion Brewery]], built in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitstablepier.com/fob/building%20the%20future.htm The Festival of Britain – Building the Future] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213033222/http://whitstablepier.com/fob/building%20the%20future.htm |date=13 February 2009 }}. Retrieved 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin was 39 when he was appointed to lead the design team in late 1948. He designed the structure as an 'egg in a box', a term he used to describe the separation of the curved auditorium space from the surrounding building and the noise and vibration of the adjacent railway viaduct. [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] used similar imagery, calling the building a "giant chicken coop".&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was officially opened on 3 May 1951.  The inaugural concerts were conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent|Sir Malcolm Sargent]] and [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 November 1950, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 May 1951, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1988 it was designated a Grade I [[listed building]], the first post-war building to become so protected.

==Festival Pleasure Gardens==
[[File:FoB-01.jpg|thumb|420px|The Festival Pleasure Gardens]]
The Festival Pleasure Gardens were created as the lighter side of the Festival of Britain.  They were put up in [[Battersea Park]], a few miles from the South Bank Exhibition.  They included:

*an amusement park which would eventually outlast all the other entertainments and later become 'Battersea Fun Fair', only closing in the mid 1970s.
*a [[Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Branch Railway|miniature railway]] designed by [[Rowland Emett]] which ran for 500 yards along the south of the gardens with a station near the south east entrance and another (with snack bar at the western end of the line;
*"a 'West End' Restaurant with a terrace overlooking the river and facing Cheyne Walk;
*'Foaming Fountains' (which have recently been restored);
*a wine garden surrounded by miniature pavilions;
*a wet weather pavilion with a stage facing two ways so that performances could be done in the open air, with murals by the film set designer Ferdinand Bellan;
*an amphitheatre seating 1,250 people, featuring the music hall star [[Lupino Lane]] and his company on its opening, and later used as a circus;

Most of the buildings and pavilions on the site were designed by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RiversideTheatre.htm |title='&amp;#39;The Riverside Theatre, Festival Pleasure Gardens, Battersea Park, London'&amp;#39; |publisher=Arthurlloyd.co.uk |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a "Guinness Festival Clock". The Pleasure Gardens received as many visitors as the South Bank Festival.  They were managed by a specially-formed private company financed by loans from the Festival Office and the London County Council.&lt;ref name=archives/&gt; As they failed to cover their costs, it was decided to keep them open after the rest of the Festival closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/pub/html/thm/gardens.html |title=Treasury Historical Memorandum No.2 |publisher=Archive.treasury.gov.uk |date=8 March 1951 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125203324/http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/pub/html/thm/gardens.html |archivedate=25 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of the Festival==

===Architecture===
The Festival architects tried to show by the design and layout of the South Bank Festival what could be achieved by applying modern [[town planning]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''A Tonic to the Nation''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Festival Style, (also called "Contemporary")&lt;ref name=powers&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers |first=Alan |url=http://www.architectural-review.com/essays/history/sixty-years-on-from-the-festival-of-britain-alan-powers/8616772.article |title=Powers, A., "Sixty years on from the Festival of Britain", '&amp;#39;Architectural Review'&amp;#39;, 22 June 2011 |publisher=Architectural-review.com |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining [[modernism]] with whimsy and Englishness, influenced architecture, interior design, product design and typography in the 1950s. [[William Feaver]] describes the Festival Style as "Braced legs, indoor plants, lily-of-the valley sprays of lightbulbs, aluminium lattices, Costswold-type walling with picture windows, flying staircases, blond wood, the thorn, the spike, the molecule."&lt;ref name=Feaver&gt;William Feaver, "Festival Star", in Mary Banham and Bevis Hillier, ''A Tonic to the Nation: The Festival of Britain 1951'', London, Thames and Hudson, 1976 {{ISBN|0-500-01165-6}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of the Festival Style was felt in the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20081206081857/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/coffeebars.html coffee bars] and office blocks of the fifties. [[Harlow]] new town and the rebuilding of [[Coventry]] city centre are said to show the influence of the Festival Style "in their light structures, picturesque layout and incorporation of works of art",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/News.aspx?id=NewsItem32 |title=English Heritage, '&amp;#39;PastScape'&amp;#39;, "The Festival of Britain: 60th anniversary" |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |date=3 May 1951 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coventry Cathedral]] (1962), designed by Basil Spence, one of the Festival architects, was dubbed "The Festival of Britain at Prayer".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/3312287/Making-the-grade-Coventry-Cathedral.html] Miller, Keith, "Making the grade: Coventry Cathedral", ''Daily Telegraph'', 5 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an exhibition about building research, town planning and architecture, the "Live architecture" exhibit of buildings, open spaces and streets in the [[Lansbury Estate]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] (named after the former Labour Party leader [[George Lansbury]]. Plans for social housing in the area had commenced in 1943.  By the end of the war nearly a quarter of the buildings in the area had been destroyed or badly damaged. In 1948, the [[Architecture Council]] decided that the Poplar site would make a good exhibition partly because it was near to the other Festival exhibitions. Despite funding problems, work began in December 1949 and by May 1950 was well advanced. The wet winter of 1950–51 delayed work, but the first houses were completed and occupied by February 1951.&lt;ref name="poplar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46490|title=The Lansbury Estate| publisher = University of London &amp; History of Parliament Trust|accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition opened on 3 May 1951 along with the other Festival exhibitions. Visitors first went to the Building Research Pavilion, which displayed housing problems and their solutions, then to the Town Planning Pavilion, a large, red-and-white striped tent.  The Town Planning Pavilion demonstrated the principles of town planning and the urgent need for new towns, including a mock up of an imaginary town called "Avoncaster".&lt;ref name="poplar" /&gt; Visitors then saw the buildings of the Lansbury Estate. Attendance was disappointing, only 86,426 people visiting, compared to 8 million who visited the South Bank exhibition.&lt;ref name="poplar"/&gt; Reaction to the development by industry professionals was lukewarm, some criticising its small scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Authority Housing|author=A. W. Cleeve Barr|page=175|oclc=3780558}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent local authorities concentrated on high rise, high density social housing rather than the Lansbury estate model. The estate remains popular with residents.&lt;ref name="poplar"/&gt;  Among the remaining 1951 buildings are [[Trinity Independent Chapel]], and The Festival Inn and Festive Briton (now Callaghans) pubs.

Misha Black, one of the Festival architects, said that the Festival created a wide audience for architectural modernism but that it was common currency among professional architects that the design of the Festival was not innovative.  The design writer [[Reyner Banham]] has questioned the originality and the Englishness of the Festival Style and indeed the extent of its influence.&lt;ref name=Banham&gt;Reyner Banham, "The Style: 'Flimsy ... Effeminate'?" in Mary Banham and Bevis Hillier, ''A Tonic to the Nation: The Festival of Britain 1951'', London, Thames and Hudson, 1976 {{ISBN|0-500-01165-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Young architects in 1951 are said to have despised the Festival of Britain for its architecture. "It was equated with the ‘Contemporary Style’, and an editorial on New Brutalism in ''Architectural Design'' in 1955 carried the epigraph, ‘When I hear the word “Contemporary” I reach for my revolver.’"&lt;ref name=powers/&gt;

===Design===
[[File:Royal Festival Hall (1951), London - geograph.org.uk - 1752283.jpg|thumb|250px|The Royal Festival Hall, showing the lettering designed for the South Bank Exhibition by the Festival typography panel.]]
The South Bank Exhibition included a Design Review that presented "an illustrated record of contemporary achievement in British industry", showing "the high standard of design and craftsmanship that has been reached in a wide range of British products."&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; The exhibits were based on the stock list of the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) and were chosen for appearance, finish, workmanship, technical efficiency, fitness for purpose and economy of production.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; In selecting and promoting designs in this way, the Festival was an influential advocate of the concept of "Good Design", a rational approach to product design in accordance with the principles of the Modern Movement. Its advocacy of Good Design had grown partly out of the standards of [[utility furniture]] created during the war ([[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], the Director of the CoID, had been Chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel) and partly out of the CoID's [[Britain Can Make It]] exhibition of 1946. The CoiD's stock list was retained and inherited by its successor, the [[Design Council]].

Design, science and industry came together in the Festival Pattern Group, which commissioned textiles, wallpaper, domestic objects and Festival exhibits based on [[x-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, L., ''From Atoms to Patterns'', Richard Dennis, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/exhibitions/from-atoms-to-patterns/festival-pattern-group.aspx |title=The Wellcome Collection |publisher=The Wellcome Collection |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. After hearing a presentation by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] to the [[Society of Industrial Artists]], Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group. Hartland Thomas was a member of the Festival of Britain Presentation Panel and was co-ordinating the CoID's stock list. He secured the Regatta Restaurant, one of the temporary restaurants on the South Bank, for an experiment in pattern design based on the crystal structure of [[haemoglobin]], [[insulin]], wareite, [[china clay]], [[mica]] and other molecules, which were used for the surface patterns of the restaurant furnishings. The designs that were sponsored by the Festival Pattern Group chimed in with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter and the Festival's emphasis on progress, science and technology

Lettering and type design featured prominently in the graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian [[Nicolete Gray]].&lt;ref name=kinross&gt;{{cite web|author=http://www.ae-pro.com |url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=151&amp;fid=645 |title=Kinross, R., "The Royal Festival hall has regained the thoroughly English lettering of its origins in the Festival of Britain – on one side only", '&amp;#39;Eye'&amp;#39;, No.65 |publisher=Eyemagazine.com |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=166684 |title=Monotype Imaging |publisher=Fonts.com |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed [[sans-serif]] capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display [[typography]].&lt;ref&gt;Berry, W.T., Johnson, A.F., and Jaspert, W.P., ''The Encyclopaedia of Type Faces'', London: Blandford Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said to bear "a vague resemblance to bunting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wharferj.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/typography-at-the-festival-of-britain/ |title=Typography at the Festival of Britain |publisher=Wharferj.wordpress.com |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping [[slab serif]] letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and [[Gordon Cullen]],&lt;ref name=kinross/&gt; illustrated in Gray’s ''Lettering on Buildings'' (1960) and derived in part from typefaces used in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/journal/2007/12/10/signs_royal_festival_hall |title=Kinross, R., '&amp;#39;Signs at the Royal Festival Hall'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hyphenpress.co.uk |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as a "turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language" that was "part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/news/design-archives-material-featured-at-festival-hall |title=University of Brighton Faculty of Arts, '&amp;#39;Design Archives material at Festival Hall'&amp;#39; |publisher=Arts.brighton.ac.uk |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Seago, ''Burning the Box of Beautiful Things: The Development of Post-Modern Sensibility'', Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis and John Brinkley, ''Graphic Design'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic designer for the Festival was [[Abram Games]], who created its emblem, the [[Festival Star]].

===The arts===
The South Bank Exhibition showed the work of contemporary artists such as [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]], including [[mural]]s by [[Victor Pasmore]], [[John Tunnard]], [[Feliks Topolski]] and [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and sculptures by [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Lynn Chadwick]], [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Reg Butler]].&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The London Season of the Arts comprised exhibitions specially arranged for the Festival of Britain. They included:
*"An Exhibition of Sixty Large Paintings commissioned for the Festival of Britain" ("60 Paintings for '51"), Suffolk Galleries, organised by the Arts Council, prize awarded to [[William Gear]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Spalding]], ''British Art Since 1900'', Thames and Hudson, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Jones (artist)|Barbara Jones]] and Tom Ingram organised "Black Eyes and Lemonade", an exhibition of British popular and traditional art, in association with the Society for Education in Art and the Arts Council. In the same year she surveyed the popular arts in her influential book, ''The Unsophisticated Arts'', which included taxidermy, fairgrounds, canal boats, seaside, riverside, tattooing, the decoration of food, waxworks, toys, rustic work, shops, festivals and funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashrare.com/barbara_jones.html |title=Ash Rare Books |publisher=Ashrare.com |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She said of the popular arts," some of it is made for themselves by people without professional training in the arts or in the appreciation of them, and some of it has been made for those people by professionals who work to their taste."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B., "Introduction", ''Black Eyes and Lemonade'', Whitechapel Art Gallery, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival was the occasion of the first performance of [[steelpan]] music in Britain by the [[TASPO (Steelband)|Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Panqueen |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y3jgxz-mYA |title=TASPO – Sterling Betancourt – The 1951 Festival of Britain |work=Youtube |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
[[Image:The National Archives UK - WORK 25-208.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Audience wearing special glasses watch a [[3D film|3D "stereoscopic film"]] at the Telekinema on the South Bank in London during the Festival of Britain]]
The [[British Film Institute]] was asked by Herbert Morrison in 1948 to consider the contribution that film could make to the Festival.&lt;ref name=easen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/publications/articles |title=Sarah Easen, Film and the Festival of Britain 1951, British Universities and Video Council |publisher=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It set up a panel including [[Michael Balcon]], Antony Asquith, [[John Grierson]], Harry Watt and Arthur Elston, which became a committee of sponsorship and distribution.  Over a dozen sponsored documentary films were made for the Festival, including,

*''Air Parade'', sponsored by the Shell Film Unit
*''Family Portrait'', made by [[Humphrey Jennings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| title =Family Portrait - A Film on the Theme of the Festival of Britain 1951| publisher =Wessex Film| year =1950| url = https://archive.org/details/family_portrait_festival_of_britain_1951_humphrey_jennings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''David'', made by Wide Pictures and the Welsh Committee (biopic of [[David Rees Griffiths]])
*''Water of Time'', made by International Realist films and sponsored by the [[Port of London Authority]]
*''Forward a Century'', sponsored by the Petroleum Films Bureau.

Several feature films were planned, but only one was completed in time, ''[[The Magic Box]]'', a biographical film about cinema pioneer [[William Friese-Greene]], made by Festival Film Productions.

There was a purpose-built film theatre on the South Bank, the Telecinema (sometimes called the "Telekinema"), designed by [[Wells Coates]], which showed documentary and experimental film exploiting [[stereophony]] and [[stereoscopy]] and the new invention of television.  It was one of the most popular attractions of the Festival, with 458,693 visitors.&lt;ref name=easen/&gt; When the Festival ended, the Telecinema was handed over to the BFI for use as a members-only repertory cinema club, re-opening in 1952 as the [[National Film Theatre]].&lt;ref name=easen/&gt;

Film was integral to the South Bank Exhibition, used to explain manufacturing, science and technology. The Dome of Discovery, the Exhibition of Science in South Kensington and the travelling Festival Exhibition made extensive use of educational and explanatory film.

Film festivals, including those at [[Edinburgh Film Festival]], Bath and Glasgow participated in the Festival of Britain, and local authorities put on film festivals, helped by a BFI pamphlet, ''How to put on a Film Show''.

Commercial cinema chains and independent cinemas also joined in, the [[Gaumont British|Gaumont]] and [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] chains programming seasons of British films.  "And finally, if the Festival visitor had not tired of the medium, they could purchase colour 16mm film of Britain’s historic buildings and pageantry and filmstrips of the Festival of Britain and London as souvenirs."&lt;ref name=easen/&gt;

One of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s contributions to the Festival was a television musical called ''[[The Golden Year (BBC TV play)|The Golden Year]]'', broadcast on 23 June and 2 July.&lt;ref&gt;''The Annual Register of World Events: A Review of the Year'', Volume 193 (Longmans, Green, 1952), p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; T

===Science===
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
A new wing was built for the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] to hold the [http://www.GoodeveCA.net/science1951 ''Exhibition of Science''].  The first part of the exhibition showed the physical and chemical nature of matter and the behaviour of elements and molecules. The second part, "The Structure of Living Things", dealt with plants and animals. The third part, "Stop Press", showed some of the latest topics of research in science and their emergence from the ideas illustrated in the earlier sections of the exhibition. They included "the penetrating rays which reach us from outer space, what goes on in space and in the stars, and a range of subjects from the electronic brain to the processes and structures on which life is based."&lt;ref&gt;''1951 Exhibition of Science, South Kensington, HMSO, 1951''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendance figures==

The Festival was highly popular in every part of Britain. Richard Weight estimates that of the national population of 49 million, about half participated.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weight, ''Patriots: National Identity in Britain 1940–2000'' (2002) p 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival largely ignored foreign tourists, with most of the visitors from the Continent being expatriate Britons.&lt;ref&gt;Mariel Grant, "'Working for the Yankee Dollar': Tourism and the Festival of Britain as Stimuli for Recovery," ''Journal of British Studies'' 45#3  (2006) PP 581-601&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over ten million paid admissions to the six main exhibitions over a period of five months:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packer34.freeserve.co.uk |title=Festival of Britain |publisher=Packer34.freeserve.co.uk |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224220538/http://www.packer34.freeserve.co.uk/ |archivedate=24 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular event was the centerpiece at South Bank Exhibition with almost 8.5 million visitors, over half of them from outside London. The Festival Pleasure Gardens had over 8 million visitors, three-quarters of them from London.  The Festival Ship Campania, which docked in ten cities, was visited by almost 900,000 people.  The Travelling Land Exhibition, which went to four English cities, attracted under half a million.  The most specialised events, in terms of attracting few visitors, were the architecture exhibition in Poplar, with 87,000 visitors and the exhibition of books in South Kensington, with 63,000.

==Political responses==
The idea of holding the Festival became a party political issue.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;  Although Herbert Morrison said that he did not want the Festival to be seen as a political venture,&lt;ref name=conekin&gt;Conekin, Becky, ''The Autobiography of a Nation: the 1951 Festival of Britain'', 2003 Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt; it became associated with the Labour Party, which had won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]], and it was opposed by the Conservative Party.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;  Hugh Casson said that, "Churchill, like the rest of the Tory Party, was against the Festival which they (quite rightly) believed was the advanced guard of socialism."&lt;ref name = conekin/&gt; Churchill referred to the forthcoming Festival of Britain as "three-dimensional Socialist propaganda."&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

In an essay on the Festival, [[Michael Frayn]] characterised it as an enterprise of "the radical middle-classes, the do-gooders; the readers of the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[The Observer]]''; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the B.B.C.," whom he called "Herbivores". In Frayn's view, "The Festival was the last, and virtually the posthumous, work of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the [[Crown Film Unit]], the sweet ration, the [[Ealing comedies]], [[Uncle Mac]], [[Sylvia Peters]]."  In making the Festival the Herbivores "earned the contempt of the Carnivores – the readers of the ''[[Daily Express]]''; the [[Evelyn Waugh]]s; the cast of the Directory of Directors".&lt;ref name=Frayn/&gt;

Some prominent members of the Labour government considered the Festival to be a Labour undertaking which would contribute to their future electoral success, and [[Clement Attlee]], the Labour Leader, wrote to Morrison saying that an election in autumn 1951 would enable the Labour Party to benefit from its popularity. In the event, Labour lost [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|the autumn election]]. Churchill's contempt for the Festival led him to make his first act as [[Winston Churchill#Second term as prime minister|Prime Minister]] in October 1951 an instruction to clear the South Bank site.

The ''Guide Book'' to the Festival described its legacy in these words: "It will leave behind not just a record of what we have thought of ourselves in the year 1951 but, in a fair community founded where once there was a slum, in an avenue of trees or in some work of art, a reminder of what we have done to write this single, adventurous year into our national and local history."&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

While the idea of the Festival was being worked out, the government and the London County Council were at the same time planning the redevelopment of the South Bank site, including "a number of great buildings, which will form part of a co-ordinated design."&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; The first of these was the Royal Festival Hall.  The Festival hastened the reclamation of four and a half acres of land from the river, which "transformed the familiar patchwork of rubble and half-derelict buildings which had for so long monopolised the propect from the North Bank".&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  The Festival site was, over the following thirty years, developed into the [[South Bank Centre]], an arts complex comprising the Royal Festival Hall, the National Film Theatre, the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], the [[Purcell Room]] and the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]].

A 1951 office building at 219 Oxford Street, London, designed by Ronald Ward and Partners (now a Grade II* [[Listed buildings|listed building]]), incorporates images of the Festival on its facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=1541497 |mname=|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival cost about £10.5 million, (apart from the loans for the Festival Gardens&lt;ref name=Frayn&gt;{{cite news|last=Frayn|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/03/britishidentity.features11|title=Festival Spirit |date=3 May 2001 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=13 December 2011}} (Extract from {{cite book|editor-last1=Sissons|editor-first1=Michael|editor-last2=French|editor-first2=Philip|title=The Age of Austerity, 1945-1951|location=London|year=1963|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with revenues of about £2.5m.&lt;ref&gt;Government White Paper, Cmd.8872, published 29 July 1953&lt;/ref&gt; The net cost was £8 million (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|8|1951}}&amp;nbsp;million today).

In 1953 the Festival of Britain Office was abolished and its records were taken over by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=427&amp;CATLN=2&amp;FullDetails=True&amp;j=1 |title=The National Archives |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the material legacy, the Festival gave rise to new traditions, in particular the performances of medieval mystery plays in [[York Mystery Plays|York]] and [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]].  There was an explosion of interest&lt;ref name=butc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/theatrecollection/projects.html |title=Bristol University Theatre Collection |publisher=Bristol.ac.uk |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=13 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218042758/http://bristol.ac.uk/theatrecollection/projects.html |archivedate=18 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in these plays, regular performance of which have continued in those cities ever since.

==Images of the Festival of Britain==
Several images of the South Bank Exhibition can be found on the internet, including many released by The [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] on the 60th anniversary of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/imagelibrary/festival-of-britain-showcase.htm |title=Festival of Britain Showcase |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A filmed retrospective of the South Bank Exhibition, ''Brief City'' (1952), with special reference to design and architecture, was made by [[Richard Massingham]] for ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/brief_city_TNA |title='&amp;#39;Brief City'&amp;#39; |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film comedy, ''[[The Happy Family (1952 film)|The Happy Family]]'', was made about working-class resistance to the demolition that the festival required. The Festival is featured in the early portion of the film ''[[Prick up your Ears]]''.

The archive of the Design Council held at the University of Brighton Design Archives includes several hundred images of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/projects/60th-anniversary 60th Anniversary of the Festival of Britain 2011] Retrieved May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They can be searched via the [http://vads.ac.uk/results.php?cmd=advsearch&amp;words=festival+of+britain&amp;field=all&amp;oper=or&amp;words2=&amp;field2=all&amp;mode=boolean&amp;submit=search&amp;DCA=1 Visual Arts Data Service] (VADS).

The '''Finnish Formula Three Championship''' was a [[Open-wheel car|single seater]] motor racing series based in Finland. The championship used small [[Formula Three]] cars, designed to give drivers experience before moving to higher levels of motor racing. The Finnish Formula Three Championship ran from 1958–1960, 1984–1986 and 2000–2009, and for its final season in 2010 it became known as the '''Nordic F3 Masters'''.

An independent championship known as the '''Scandinavian &amp; Nordic Formula Three Championship''' ran between 1984–1985 and 1992–2001.

'''Floodwall''', an [[installation art|installation]] by Jana Napoli, is composed of drawers salvaged in the aftermath of [[Hurricane katrina|Hurricane Katrina]] in [[New Orleans]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |first=Melena |last= Ryzik |title=Spare Times-Floodwall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/arts/design/05bspar.html?_r=3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=floodwall%20napoli&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin&amp; |location = New York |work=The New York Times |date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, two months after Hurricane Katrina and the collapse of the [[levee]] system, Napoli collected debris from the storm.

==Construction==

From ''Floodwall'''s first construction in 2007, Napoli has installed it in multiple ways. Sometimes installed as a monumental wall, ''Floodwall'' stands eight feet tall and stretches as long as 192 feet.&lt;ref name="NOLA.com Previously on Piety"&gt;{{cite news |first=Doug |last=MacCash |title=Doug MacCash reviews "Previously on Piety" at the Contemporary Arts Center |url=http://www.nola.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/07/doug_maccash_reviews_previousl.html |location = New Orleans |work=The Times Picayune |date=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Floodwall'' has been displayed on the floor like tombstones in a cemetery, sometimes functioning as a memorial and other times a room that envelops the spectator.&lt;ref name="US Department of State Krakow"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://krakow.usconsulate.gov/event0714floodwall.html |title = Exhibition: Floodwall at the National Museum Wroclaw |last = U.S. Department of State |publisher = U.S. Department of State |date = 14 July 2010 |work = Consulate General of the United States Krakow Poland |accessdate= 14 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation has also been used as a setting for collaborative theater performances involving singing and dance.

==Oral History==

''Drawers and Personal Stories: part of the exhibition'' is a collection of recorded oral histories from the original drawer owners. This gathering of these oral histories is an ongoing project that assembles audio recordings—interviews.

[[Image:Magnetosphere rendition.jpg|400px|thumb|Artist's depiction of solar wind particles interacting with Earth's [[magnetosphere]]. Sizes are not to scale.]]
A '''geomagnetic storm''' (commonly referred to as a '''solar storm''') is a temporary disturbance of the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] caused by a [[solar wind]] shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts with the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The increase in the solar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere. The solar wind's magnetic field interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field and transfers an increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) and an increase in electric current in the magnetosphere and [[ionosphere]].

During the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, electric current in the magnetosphere creates a magnetic force that pushes out the boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. The disturbance in the interplanetary medium that drives the storm may be due to a solar [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) or a high speed stream (co-rotating interaction region or CIR)&lt;ref&gt;''Corotating Interaction Regions,'' Corotating Interaction Regions Proceedings of an ISSI Workshop, 6–13 June 1998, Bern, Switzerland, Springer (2000), Hardcover, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-6080-3}}, Softcover, {{ISBN|978-90-481-5367-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the solar wind originating from a region of weak magnetic field on the Sun's surface. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the [[Wolf number|sunspot]] cycle. CME driven storms are more common during the maximum of the solar cycle, while CIR driven storms are more common during the minimum of the solar cycle.

Several space weather phenomena tend to be associated with or are caused by a geomagnetic storm. These include [[Solar proton event|solar energetic particle]] (SEP) events, [[geomagnetically induced current]]s (GIC), ionospheric disturbances that cause radio and radar scintillation, disruption of navigation by magnetic compass and auroral displays at much lower latitudes than normal.

==History==
In 1931, [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and Vincenzo C. A. Ferraro wrote an article, ''A New Theory of Magnetic Storms'', that sought to explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

They wrote that this [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] travels at a velocity such that it reaches Earth within 113 days, though we now know this journey takes 1 to 5 days. They wrote that the cloud then compresses the [[Earth's magnetic field]] and thus increases this field at the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Definition==
A geomagnetic storm is defined&lt;ref name="gonzalez"&gt;Gonzalez, W. D., J. A. Joselyn, Y. Kamide, H. W. Kroehl, G. Rostoker, B. T. Tsurutani, and V. M. Vasyliunas (1994), What is a Geomagnetic Storm?, J. Geophys. Res., 99(A4), 5771–5792.&lt;/ref&gt; by changes in the [[Disturbance storm time index|Dst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html] Sugiura, M., and T. Kamei, Equatorial Dst index 1957-1986, IAGA Bulletin, 40, edited by A. BerthelJer and M. MenvielleI,S GI Publ. Off., Saint. Maur-des-Fosses, France, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; (disturbance – storm time) index. The Dst index estimates the globally averaged change of the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field at the magnetic equator based on measurements from a few magnetometer stations. Dst is computed once per hour and reported in near-real-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wdc/Sec3.html] World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt; During quiet times, Dst is between +20 and −20 nano-[[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]] (nT).

A geomagnetic storm has three phases:&lt;ref name="gonzalez" /&gt; initial, main and recovery. The initial phase is characterized by Dst (or its one-minute component SYM-H) increasing by 20 to 50&amp;nbsp;nT in tens of minutes. The initial phase is also referred to as a storm sudden commencement (SSC). However, not all geomagnetic storms have an initial phase and not all sudden increases in Dst or SYM-H are followed by a geomagnetic storm. The main phase of a geomagnetic storm is defined by Dst decreasing to less than −50&amp;nbsp;nT. The selection of −50&amp;nbsp;nT to define a storm is somewhat arbitrary. The minimum value during a storm will be between -50 and approximately -600&amp;nbsp;nT. The duration of the main phase is typically 2–8 hours. The recovery phase is when Dst changes from its minimum value to its quiet time value. The recovery phase may last as short as 8 hours or as long as 7 days.

The size of a geomagnetic storm is classified as moderate (−50&amp;nbsp;nT &gt; minimum of Dst &gt; −100&amp;nbsp;nT), intense (−100&amp;nbsp;nT &gt; minimum Dst &gt; −250&amp;nbsp;nT) or super-storm (minimum of Dst &lt; −250&amp;nbsp;nT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cander|first=L.

== Historical occurrences ==
The first scientific observation of the effects of a geomagnetic storm occurred early in the 19th century: From May 1806 until June 1807, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recorded the bearing of a [[magnetic compass]] in Berlin. On 21 December 1806, he noticed that his compass had become erratic during a bright auroral event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Russell| first =Randy| title =Geomagnetic Storms| website =Windows to the Universe| publisher =National Earth Science Teachers Association| date =March 29, 2010| url =http://www.windows2universe.org/glossary/geomagnetic_storms.html| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1–2, 1859, the largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred. From August 28 until September 2, 1859, numerous sunspots and solar flares were observed on the Sun, with the largest flare on September 1. This is referred to as the [[Solar storm of 1859]] or the [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Carrington]] Event. It can be assumed that a massive [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) was launched from the Sun and reached the Earth within eighteen hours&amp;mdash;a trip that normally takes three to four days. The horizontal field was reduced by 1600&amp;nbsp;nT as recorded by the [[Colaba Observatory]]. It is estimated that Dst would have been approximately −1760&amp;nbsp;nT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsurutani | first1 = B. T. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = W.

Aurorae were seen as far south as Hawaii, Mexico, Cuba and Italy&amp;mdash;phenomena that are usually only visible in polar regions. [[Ice cores]] show evidence that events of similar intensity recur at an average rate of approximately once per 500 years.

Since 1859, less severe storms have occurred, notably the [[aurora of November 17, 1882]] and the [[May 1921 geomagnetic storm]], both with disruption of telegraph service and initiation of fires, and 1960, when widespread radio disruption was reported.&lt;ref name="Odenwald"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bracing the Satellite Infrastructure for a Solar Superstorm |journal=Sci.

The [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]] caused the collapse of the [[Hydro-Québec]] power grid in seconds as equipment protection relays tripped in a cascading sequence.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolduc|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six million people were [[power outage|left without power]] for nine hours. The storm caused [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] as far south as [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Earth dodges magnetic storm"/&gt; The storm causing this event was the result of a coronal mass ejected from the [[Sun]] on March 9, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Geomagnetic Storms Can Threaten Electric Power Grid |journal=Earth in Space |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=9–11 |date=March 1997 |url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/eiskappenman.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611174103/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/eiskappenman.html |archivedate=2008-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum of Dst was −589&amp;nbsp;nT.

On July 14, 2000, an X5 class flare erupted (known as the [[Bastille Day event]]) and a coronal mass was launched directly at the Earth. A geomagnetic super storm occurred on July 15–17; the minimum of the Dst index was -301&amp;nbsp;nT. Despite the storm's strength, no power distribution failures were reported.&lt;ref&gt;High-voltage power grid disturbances during geomagnetic storms Stauning, P., Proceedings of the Second Solar Cycle and Space Weather Euroconference, 24–29 September 2001, Vico Equense, Italy.

Seventeen major flares erupted on the Sun between 19 October and 5 November 2003, including perhaps the most intense flare ever measured on the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]] XRS sensor—a huge X28 flare,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, N. R., C. J. Rodger, and R. L. Dowden (2004), Ionosphere gives size of greatest solar flare, ''Geophys. Res.

These flares were associated with CME events that caused three geomagnetic storms between 29 October and 2 November, during which the second and third storms were initiated before the previous storm period had fully recovered. The minimum Dst values were −151, −353 and −383&amp;nbsp;nT. Another storm in this sequence occurred on 4–5 November with a minimum Dst of −69&amp;nbsp;nT. The last geomagnetic storm was weaker than the preceding storms, because the active region on the Sun had rotated beyond the meridian where the central portion CME created during the flare event passed to the side of the Earth. The whole sequence became known as the [[Halloween Solar Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/Services/HalloweenStorms_assessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728172705/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/Services/HalloweenStorms_assessment.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }} Halloween Space Weather Storms of 2003, NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR SEC-88, Space Environment Center, Boulder, Colorado, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) operated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) was offline for approximately 30 hours due to the storm.&lt;ref name="nas2008"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12507.html] ''Severe Space Weather Events - Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts – Workshop Report, ''National Research Council of the National Academies, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.

== Interactions with planetary processes ==
[[Image:magnetopause.svg|frame|center|Magnetosphere in the near-Earth space environment.]]
The solar wind also carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. This field will have either a North or South orientation. If the solar wind has energetic bursts, contracting and expanding the magnetosphere, or if the solar wind takes a southward [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], geomagnetic storms can be expected. The southward field causes [[magnetic reconnection]] of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth's magnetosphere.

During a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere's [[F region|F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer]] becomes unstable, fragments, and may even disappear. In the northern and southern pole regions of the Earth, [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] are observable.

== Instruments==
[[Magnetometer]]s monitor the auroral zone as well as the equatorial region. Two types of [[radar]], coherent scatter and incoherent scatter, are used to probe the auroral ionosphere. By bouncing signals off ionospheric irregularities, which move with the field lines, one can trace their motion and infer magnetospheric convection.

Spacecraft instruments include:

* Magnetometers, usually of the flux gate type. Usually these are at the end of booms, to keep them away from magnetic interference by the spacecraft and its electric circuits.&lt;ref name="Magnetometry"&gt;{{cite web | last = Snare | first = Robert C. | title = A History of Vector Magnetometry in Space | publisher = University of California | url = http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/ESS265/History.html | accessdate = 2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Electric sensors at the ends of opposing booms are used to measure potential differences between separated points, to derive electric fields associated with convection. The method works best at high plasma densities in low Earth orbit; far from Earth long booms are needed, to avoid shielding-out of electric forces.
* Radio sounders from the ground can [[Ionospheric sounding|bounce radio waves]] of varying frequency off the ionosphere, and by timing their return determine the electron density profile—up to its peak, past which radio waves no longer return. Radio sounders in low Earth orbit aboard the Canadian [[Alouette 1]] (1962) and [[Alouette 2]] (1965), beamed radio waves earthward and observed the electron density profile of the "topside ionosphere". Other radio sounding methods were also tried in the ionosphere (e.g. on [[IMAGE]]).
* Particle detectors include a [[Geiger counter]], as was used for the original observations of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]. [[Scintillator detectors]] came later, and still later "channeltron" [[electron multiplier]]s found particularly wide use. To derive charge and mass composition, as well as energies, a variety of [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrograph]] designs were used. For energies up to about 50&amp;nbsp;keV (which constitute most of the magnetospheric plasma) [[time-of-flight spectrometer]]s (e.g. "top-hat" design) are widely used.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Computers have made it possible to bring together decades of isolated magnetic observations and extract average patterns of electrical currents and average responses to interplanetary variations. They also run simulations of the global magnetosphere and its responses, by solving the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD) on a numerical grid. Appropriate extensions must be added to cover the inner magnetosphere, where magnetic drifts and ionospheric conduction need to be taken into account. So far the results are difficult to interpret, and certain assumptions are needed to cover small-scale phenomena.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Geomagnetic storm effects ==

=== Disruption of electrical systems ===

It has been suggested that a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the [[solar storm of 1859]] today would cause billions or even trillions of dollars of damage to satellites, power grids and radio communications, and could cause electrical blackouts on a massive scale that might not be repaired for weeks, months, or even years.&lt;ref name="nas2008"/&gt;

=== Mains electricity grid ===

When [[magnetic field]]s move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, a [[geomagnetically induced current]] is produced in the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influenced telephone and telegraph lines before fiber optics, see above) on all long transmission lines. Long transmission lines (many kilometers in length) are thus subject to damage by this effect. Notably, this chiefly includes operators in China, North America, and Australia, especially in modern high-voltage, low-resistance lines. The European grid consists mainly of shorter transmission circuits, which are less vulnerable to damage.&lt;ref name="kappenman"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/a-perfect-storm-of-planetary-proportions/0 | title=A Perfect Storm of Planetary Proportions | work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=February 2012 | accessdate=2012-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natuurwetenschap &amp; Techniek Magazine, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The (nearly direct) currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially [[transformer]]s&amp;mdash;inducing core [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]], constraining their performance (as well as tripping various safety devices), and causing coils and cores to heat up. In extreme cases, this heat can disable or destroy them, even inducing a chain reaction that can overload transformers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://192.211.16.13/curricular/ENERGY/0708/articles/solar/SolarForecast07SkyTel.pdf Solar Forecast: Storm AHEAD] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911192808/http://192.211.16.13/curricular/ENERGY/0708/articles/solar/SolarForecast07SkyTel.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/21jan_severespaceweather.htm Metatech Corporation Study]&lt;/ref&gt; Most generators are connected to the grid via transformers, isolating them from the induced currents on the grid, making them much less susceptible to damage due to [[geomagnetically induced current]]. However, a transformer that is subjected to this will act as an unbalanced load to the generator, causing negative sequence current in the stator and consequently rotor heating.

According to a study by Metatech corporation, a storm with a strength comparable to that of 1921 would destroy more than 300 transformers and leave over 130 million people without power in the United States, costing several trillion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Severe Space Weather Events: Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts : a Workshop Report. Washington, D.C.: National Academies, 2008 [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12507&amp;page=1 Web.] 15 Nov. 2011.  Pages 78, 105, &amp; 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daily Mail even claims that a massive solar flare could knock out electric power for months, but&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1313858/Solar-flare-paralyse-Earth-2013.html| title=Massive solar flare 'could paralyse Earth in 2013'| publisher=The Daily Mail| date=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; these predictions are contradicted by a NERC report that concludes that a geomagnetic storm would cause temporary grid instability but no widespread destruction of high-voltage transformers. The report points out that the widely quoted Quebec grid collapse was not caused by overheating transformers but by the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays.&lt;ref&gt;Effects of Geomagnetic Disturbances on the Bulk Power System. North American Electric Reliability Corporation, February 2012. {{cite web |url=https://www.frcc.com/Public%20Awareness/Lists/Announcements/Attachments/105/GMD%20Interim%20Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908075507/https://www.frcc.com/Public%20Awareness/Lists/Announcements/Attachments/105/GMD%20Interim%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the transformers being vulnerable to the effects of a geomagnetic storm, electricity companies can also be affected indirectly by the geomagnetic storm. For instance, internet service providers may go down during geomagnetic storms (and/or remain non-operational long after). Electricity companies may have equipment requiring a working internet connection to function, so during the period the internet service provider is down, the electricity too may not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Kijk magazine 6/2017, mentioned by Marcel Spit of Adviescentrum Bescherming Vitale Infrastructuur]&lt;/ref&gt;

By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings (e.g. by the Space Weather prediction Center; via Space Weather satellites as SOHO or ACE), power companies can minimize damage to power transmission equipment, by momentarily disconnecting transformers or by inducing temporary blackouts. Preventative measures also exist, including preventing the inflow of GICs into the grid through the neutral-to-ground connection.&lt;ref name="kappenman"/&gt;

=== Communications ===

[[High frequency]] (3–30&amp;nbsp;MHz) communication systems use the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected [[radio propagation|propagation]] paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, [[shortwave]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[amateur radio]] (mostly the bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using HF bands rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.

Military detection or early warning systems operating in the high frequency range are also affected by solar activity. The ''[[over-the-horizon radar]]'' bounces signals off the ionosphere to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Also some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and avoid unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, high levels of noise can occur on air-control radio frequencies.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This can also happen on [[UHF]] and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] satellite communications, when an Earth station, a satellite and the Sun are in [[Sun outage|alignment]]. In order to prevent unnecessary maintenance on satellite communications systems aboard aircraft AirSatOne provides a live feed for geophysical events from NOAA's [[Space Weather Prediction Center]]. AirSatOne's live feed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AirSatOne - Geophysical Alerts Live Feed|url=https://www.airsatone.com/gams}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to view observed and predicted space storms. Geophysical Alerts are important to flight crews and maintenance personnel to determine if any upcoming activity or history has or will have an effect on satellite communications, GPS navigation and HF Communications.

[[electrical telegraph|Telegraph]] lines in the past were affected by geomagnetic storms. Telegraphs used a single long wire for the data line, stretching for many miles, using the ground as the return wire and fed with [[Direct current|DC]] power from a battery; this made them (together with the power lines mentioned below) susceptible to being influenced by the fluctuations caused by the [[ring current]]. The voltage/current induced by the geomagnetic storm could have diminished the signal, when subtracted from the battery polarity, or to overly strong and spurious signals when added to it; some operators learned to disconnect the battery and rely on the induced current as their power source. In extreme cases the induced current was so high the coils at the receiving side burst in flames, or the operators received electric shocks. Geomagnetic storms affect also long-haul telephone lines, including undersea cables unless they are [[fiber optic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/storm/storms.html image.gsfc.nasa.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911073432/http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/storm/storms.html |date=2005-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to communications satellites can disrupt non-terrestrial telephone, television, radio and Internet links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Storms Could Be Earth's Next Katrina|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124125001|accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] reported in 2008 on possible scenarios of widespread disruption in the 2012–2013 solar peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Severe Space Weather Events—Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts: Workshop Report |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-309-12769-1 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12507#toc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navigation systems ===

Systems such as [[GPS]], [[LORAN]] and the now-defunct [[Omega Navigation System|OMEGA]] are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consisted of eight transmitters located throughout the world. Airplanes and ships used the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system gave navigators information that was inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators had been alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm was in progress, they could have switched to a backup system.

GPS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the GPS signals to [[Scintillation (astronomy)|scintillate]] (like a twinkling star). The scintillation of satellite signals during ionospheric disturbances is studied at [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|HAARP]] during ionospheric modification experiments. It has also been studied at the [[Jicamarca Radio Observatory]].

One technology used to allow GPS receivers to continue to operate in the presence of some confusing signals is [[Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring]] (RAIM). However, RAIM is predicated on the assumption that a majority of the GPS constellation is operating properly, and so it is much less useful when the entire constellation is perturbed by global influences such as geomagnetic storms. Even if RAIM detects a loss of integrity in these cases, it may not be able to provide a useful, reliable signal.

=== Satellite hardware damage ===

Geomagnetic storms and increased solar [[ultraviolet]] emission heat Earth's upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of [[satellite]]s up to about {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}} increases significantly. This results in increased [[Drag (physics)|drag]], causing satellites to slow and change [[orbit]] slightly. [[Low Earth Orbit]] satellites that are not repeatedly boosted to higher orbits slowly fall and eventually burn up.

[[Skylab]]'s 1979 destruction is an example of a spacecraft [[Atmospheric reentry|reentering]] Earth's atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected solar activity. During the great geomagnetic storm of March 1989, four of the Navy's navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week, the [[U.S. Air Force Space Command|U.S. Space Command]] had to post new [[orbital elements]] for over 1000 objects affected and the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] satellite fell out of orbit in December the same year.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The vulnerability of the satellites depends on their position as well. The [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] is a perilous place for a satellite to pass through.

As technology has allowed spacecraft components to become smaller, their miniaturized systems have become increasingly vulnerable to the more energetic [[solar wind|solar particles]]. These particles can physically [[radiation hardening|damage microchips]] and can change software commands in satellite-borne computers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Another problem for satellite operators is differential charging. During geomagnetic storms, the number and energy of [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s increase. When a satellite travels through this energized environment, the [[charged particle]]s striking the spacecraft differentially charge portions of the spacecraft. Discharges can [[electric arc|arc]] across spacecraft components, harming and possibly disabling them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Bulk charging (also called deep charging) occurs when energetic particles, primarily electrons, penetrate the outer covering of a satellite and deposit their charge in its internal parts. If sufficient charge accumulates in any one component, it may attempt to neutralize by discharging to other components. This discharge is potentially hazardous to the satellite's electronic systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

=== Geologic exploration ===

Earth's magnetic field is used by geologists to determine subterranean rock structures. For the most part, these geodetic surveyors are searching for oil, gas or mineral deposits. They can accomplish this only when Earth's field is quiet, so that true magnetic signatures can be detected. Other geophysicists prefer to work during geomagnetic storms, when strong variations in the Earth's normal subsurface electric currents allow them to sense subsurface oil or mineral structures. This technique is called [[magnetotellurics]]. For these reasons, many surveyors use geomagnetic alerts and predictions to schedule their mapping activities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Pipelines ===

Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce [[geomagnetically induced current]]s in [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can transmit erroneous flow information and the [[corrosion]] rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Gummow |first1 = R |title = GIC effects on pipeline corrosion and corrosion control systems |journal = Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume = 64 |page = 1755 |date = 2002 |doi = 10.1016/S1364-6826(02)00125-6|bibcode = 2002JASTP..64.1755G |last2 = Eng |first2 = P |issue = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 =Osella |first1 =A |last2 =Favetto |first2 =A |last3 =López |first3 =E |title =Currents induced by geomagnetic storms on buried pipelines as a cause of corrosion |journal =Journal of Applied Geophysics |volume =38 |page =219 |date =1998 |doi =10.1016/S0926-9851(97)00019-0|bibcode = 1998JAG....38..219O |issue =3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If engineers incorrectly attempt to balance the current during a geomagnetic storm, corrosion rates may increase even more{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. Pipeline managers thus receive space weather alerts and warnings to allow them to implement defensive measures.

=== Radiation hazards to humans ===

Intense [[solar flare]]s release very-high-energy particles that can cause [[radiation poisoning]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but [[astronaut]]s are subject to potentially lethal doses of [[ionizing radiation|radiation]]. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells can cause [[chromosome]] damage, [[cancer]] and other health problems. Large doses can be immediately fatal.

Solar [[proton]]s with energies greater than 30&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]] are particularly hazardous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tjacAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Solar+protons+with+energies+greater+than+30+MeV+are+hazardous#v=onepage&amp;q=Solar%20protons%20with%20energies%20greater%20than%2030%20MeV%20are%20hazardous&amp;f=false|title=Radiation and the International Space Station: Recommendations to Reduce Risk|last=Council|first=National Research|last2=Sciences|first2=Division on Engineering and Physical|last3=Board|first3=Space Studies|last4=Applications|first4=Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and|last5=Research|first5=Committee on Solar and Space Physics and Committee on Solar-Terrestrial|date=2000-03-25|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309068857|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Solar proton event]]s can also produce elevated radiation aboard [[Jet airliner|aircraft]] flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows the occasional exposure to be monitored and evaluated and eventually flight paths and altitudes adjusted in order to lower the absorbed dose of the [[flight crew]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/documents/documentlibrary/75331981EN6.pdf|title=Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft Crew|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, UNSCEAR 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Phillips| first =Tony| title =The Effects of Space Weather on Aviation| website =Science News| publisher =NASA| date =25 October 2013| url =https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/25oct_aviationswx/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on animals===

Scientists are still studying whether or not animals are affected by this, some suggesting this is why [[Cetacean stranding|whales beach]] themselves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170206083827.htm|title=Scientist studies whether solar storms cause animal beachings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41110082|title=Northern lights link to whale strandings|first=Matt|last=McGrath|date=5 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;Some have stated the possibility that other migrating animals including birds and honey bees, might be affected since they also use [[magnetoreception]] to navigate, and geomagnetic storms alter the Earth's magnetic fields temporarily. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-09-06/solar-storms-may-ignite-south-reaching-auroras-wednesday&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23827">The '''Gödel Prize''' is an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of [[theoretical computer science]], given jointly by [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS) and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory ([[ACM SIGACT]]). The award is named in honor of [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel's connection to theoretical computer science is that he was the first to mention the "[[P versus NP]]" question, in a 1956 letter to [[John von Neumann]] in which Gödel asked whether a certain [[NP-complete]] problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel Prize has been awarded since 1993. The prize is awarded either at STOC (ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]], one of the main [[North American]] conferences in theoretical computer science) or ICALP ([[International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming]], one of the main [[Europe]]an conferences in the field).  To be eligible for the prize, a paper must be published in a refereed journal within the last 14 (formerly 7) years.  The prize includes a reward of US$5000.&lt;ref name="Godël2017" /&gt;

The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT.

The '''Heartland Pagan Festival''' is an annual five-day [[paganism|pagan]] [[festival]] held each [[Memorial Day]] week Thursday through Monday near the [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] area, on private land near [[McLouth, Kansas]]. The festival was started by the Council of the South Winds which hosted their first festival on June 27-29th, 1986.  After the second festival was celebrated in 1987, the organizers incorporated as a non-profit organization called the Heartland Spiritual Alliance on September 19, 1988.

Each year since 1986, [[paganism|Pagans]] and people of all faiths, from all over the [[American Midwest]], gather over the Memorial Day weekend to celebrate their differences and their commonalities, and to teach and learn about their diverse spiritual paths, cultures, traditions and practices.  Among Heartland Pagan Festival's offerings are workshops in a variety of teachings and paths, activities for attendees of all ages, merchants &amp; vendors, speakers and musical performers. A special [[Memorial Day]] service is also held to honor those who have fought for freedom in service of the United States each year.

'''Here &amp; Now Tour''' was a concerts tour by American singer [[Diana Ross]] from 1991 to 1992. It was a world tour that began in Asia where her album, [["The Force Behind the Power"]] had gone gold. The tour was recorded live for a television special in Japan. The tour hit the English-speaking world in Australia with the second live recorded special from Perth. She landed in America, determined to play smaller markets like Syracuse and Poughkeepsie before sweeping across America. The summer dates were across Europe beginning in a continued 6 sold out Wembley/London across the continent as the 3rd single, "One Shining Moment" was hitting the Top 10. The Palais de Sportes in Paris was a highlight for two nights.
The album continued to do well for the holidays when her huge Japanese hit "If We Hold on Together" became a European smash supported by the airing of "Christmas in Vienna" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. Television exposure had been key throughout this tour. Earlier in the spring, Diana was invited to close the entire "Royal Command Performance for the Queen". It was there her first single from the album was destined for #1! The Royal Command Performance once again was instrumental in making the song a hit. 
She returned to America to do second round dates in major markets like New York. The tour had successfully conquered North America (Canada dates were after the first run of New York dates), Asia, the English-speaking world and Europe for over 100 dates.

'''Illegal mining''' is [[mining]] activity that is undertaken without state permission, in particular in absence of [[land rights]], mining licenses, and [[exploration]] or mineral transportation permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mining.about.com/od/OperationsManagement/a/What-Is-Illegal-Mining.htm|title=Learn What Illegal Mining Operations Are|author=Dozolme|first=Philippe|date=2018|work=The Balance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal mining can be a subsistence activity, as is the case with [[artisanal mining]], or it can belong to large-scale [[organized crime]], spearheaded by illegal mining syndicates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On an international level, approximately 80 percent of small-scale mining operations can be categorized as illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Hentschel, T., Hruschka, F., Priester, M. (2003). "Artisanal and small-scale mining: challenges and opportunities". International Institute for Environment and Development, London. http://pubs.iied.org/9268IIED/.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strategic developments towards "[[responsible mining]]," even big companies can be involved in (partially) illegal mineral digging and extraction, if only on the financing side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/the-companies-accused-of-buying-latin-america-illegal-gold|title=The Companies Accused of Buying Latin America's Illegal Gold|author=Castilla|first=Oscar|last2=Amancio|first2=Nelly|date=2015|website=InSight Crime|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Lopez|first3=Fabiola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional Issues==

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Spurred by widespread poverty and a lack of alternative income-earning opportunities, illegal artisanal mining is a well-documented phenomenon in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. While legalization opportunities for artisanal and small scale mining are often available, inefficient government bureaucracy structures can make noncompliance more appealing for workers. In addition, in an effort to attract foreign investment, many governments in sub-Saharan Africa have loosened national mining investment codes. An expansion of the large-scale mining projects fueled by foreign investment has displaced rural mining communities, many of which revert to illegal mining on concessions given to the formal mining sector.&lt;ref&gt;Banchirigah, Sadia. (2008). "Challenges with eradicating illegal mining in Ghana: A perspective from the grassroots". ''Resources Policy'', '''33'''(1), 29-38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2007.11.001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
Illegal gold mining in [[Latin America]] is a particular concern because of the scale of organized crime and significant rate of [[environmental degradation]] (through [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and other toxic chemicals routinely used in [[gold mining]]) that accompany it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/health-impact-artisanal-gold-mining-latin-america|title=Health Impact of Artisanal Gold Mining in Latin America|last=Sieber|first=Nancy|last2=Brain|first2=Joseph|date=2014|website=ReVista: Harvard Review of Latin America|publisher=Harvard University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://risk.thomsonreuters.com/content/dam/openweb/documents/pdf/risk/white-paper/illegal-mining-in-south-america-and-financial-risk-taking-the-shine-off-gold.pdf|title=Illegal Mining in South America and Financial Risk - Taking the Shine off Gold|last=Huerbsch|first=Brian|last2=Spiro|first2=Jesse|date=2016|website=Thomson Reuters: Risk Management Solutions|publisher=Thomson Reuters|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Illegal mining operations are often located in remote areas, making it more difficult to enforce [[Mining law|mining standards]]. Furthermore, mining requirements can vary substantially from region to region, further complicating adherence with labor laws, environmental regulations, and tax legislation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emissions of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] originating in artisanal mining, most of which is unregulated and illegal, are substantial, contributing to 37 percent of the atmospheric [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] emitted annually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While drug trafficking has historically been a prominent [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]], lower risks associated with illegal mining have propelled a shift toward lucrative illegal gold mining operations. In order to transfer illegal gold into the marketplace, criminal actors sometimes attempt to mask its illicit origins by melting together processed legal and illegal gold. This gold laundering task is generally facilitated by middlemen who falsify documentation to ease the transition into the legitimate international marketplace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''John Armor Bingham''' (January 21, 1815&amp;nbsp;– March 19, 1900) was an American [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Representative from [[Ohio]], an assistant to [[Judge Advocate General of the United States Army|Judge Advocate General]] in the trial of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]], and a [[prosecutor]] in the impeachment trials of [[Andrew Johnson]]. He is also the principal framer of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/onecountryonecon00bing|title=One country, one Constitution, and one people.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania]], where his carpenter and bricklayer father, Hugh, had moved after service in the [[War of 1812]], Bingham attended local public schools. After his mother's death in 1827, his father remarried. John moved west to [[Ohio]] to live with his merchant uncle, Thomas, after clashing with his new stepmother. The teenager apprenticed as a printer for two years, helping to publish the ''Luminary'', an anti-Masonic newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uscivilliberties.org/biography/3202-john-armor-bingham-18151900.html|title=John Armor Bingham (1815–1900)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Pennsylvania to study at Mercer College, after which Bingham studied law at [[Franklin College (New Athens, Ohio)|Franklin College]] in [[New Athens, Ohio|New Athens]], [[Harrison County, Ohio]]. There, Bingham befriended former slave [[Titus Basfield]], who became the first African American to graduate college in Ohio. They continued to correspond for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Erving T. Beauregard, Ohio's First Black College Graduate, available at http://www.harrisonhistory.org/Notables/Entries/2010/12/2_Ohios_First_Black_College_Graduate_from_Queen_City_Heritage_45_By_Erving_E._BeauregardUsed_with_permission_from_Cincinnati_Museum_Center_at_Union_Terminal_files/ohi-019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Hugh and Thomas Bingham were long time abolitionists as well as active in local politics. They initially allied with the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], led by Pennsylvania Governor [[Joseph Ritner]] and Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. Hugh became clerk of the Mercer County court and later a perennial Whig candidate in the county, known for opposing war with Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Aynes, The Continuing Importance of Congressman John A. Bingham and the Fourteenth Amendment, at pp. 592-593, available at https://www.uakron.edu/dotAsset/727357.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. [[John Walker (priest)|John Walker]], of the Associated Reform [[Congregational Church]], ran Franklin College and was a prominent abolitionist in Ohio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therestorationmovement.com/walker.htm |title=Archived copy |deadurl=yes |archivedate=February 3, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203030332/http://www.therestorationmovement.com/walker.htm |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mentor to Titus Basfield, who, after further studies, became a Presbyterian minister. Another of Bingham's longtime and childhood friends was [[Matthew Simpson]], who later became a bishop in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], urged [[President Lincoln]] to issue the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], and ultimately delivered funeral orations for the assassinated President at the White House and his interment at [[Springfield, Illinois]].

Bingham married his uncle Thomas' daughter, Amanda Bailey Bingham, in 1844. During 41 years of marriage, they raised three daughters, two of whom survived their parents, but one died in Japan.

==Career==
===Early legal career===
After graduation, Bingham returned to [[Mercer, Pennsylvania]] to read law with [[John James Pearson]] and [[William Stewart (Pennsylvania)|William Stewart]], and he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar on March 25, 1840 and the Ohio bar by year's end. Bingham then returned to [[Cadiz, Ohio]], to begin his legal and political career. An active [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], Bingham campaigned for President [[William Henry Harrison]]. His uncle, Thomas, a prominent Presbyterian in the area, had served as associate judge in the Harrison County Court of Common Pleas from 1825 to 1839. The young lawyer's practice extended to [[Tuscarawas County, Ohio]], and its seat, [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]]. In 1846, Bingham won his first election, as district attorney for Tuscarawas County, serving from 1846 to 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiocivilwarcentral.com/entry.php?rec=1015|title=John A. Bingham|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political career===
Bingham's political activity continued despite the Whig Party's decline. Campaigning as candidate of the [[Opposition Party (Northern U.S.)|Opposition Party]], he was elected to the [[34th United States Congress|Thirty-fourth Congress]], representing the 21st Congressional District. In [[Washington, DC]], he roomed at the same boarding house as fellow Ohio Representative [[Joshua Giddings]], a prominent abolitionist Bingham admired.&lt;ref&gt;Aynes, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Voters re-elected Bingham to the [[35th United States Congress|Thirty-fifth]], [[36th United States Congress|Thirty-sixth]] and [[37th United States Congress|Thirty-seventh Congresses]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. However, the district was one of two Ohio districts eliminated in the redistricting following the census of 1860. Bingham thus ran for re-elected from what became the 16th District. Known for his abolitionist views, he lost to Democratic peace candidate [[Joseph W. White]], and thus failed to return for the [[38th United States Congress|Thirty-eighth Congress]], in part because Union soldiers (mostly-Republican leaning), who were away from home fighting in the war, were not allowed to vote by mail in Ohio at the time. Nonetheless, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] appointed him as one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against [[West H. Humphreys]].

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Bingham strongly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and became known as a [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]]. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] appointed him [[Judge Advocate]] of the [[Union Army]] with the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] during his hiatus from Congress, and Bingham briefly became solicitor of the [[United States Court of Claims]] in 1865.

Bingham defeated White in the next congressional election (Ohio had changed its law and now allowed soldiers away from home to vote by mail) and thus returned to serve in the [[39th United States Congress|Thirty-ninth Congress]], which first met on March 4, 1865.

===Lincoln assassination===
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}
[[File:JBingham-JHolt-HBurnett.jpg|thumb|left|310px|'''John Bingham''' ''(left)'' along with [[Joseph Holt]] ''(center)'' and [[Henry Lawrence Burnett|Henry Burnett]] ''(right)'' were the three prosecutors in charge of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination trial]].]]
The following month, the capital fell into chaos as [[John Wilkes Booth]] assassinated President [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Booth's co-conspirator [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] severely injured [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] on the night of April 14, 1865. Booth died on April 26, 1865 from a gunshot wound. When the trials for the conspirators involved in the Lincoln assassination were ready to start, Bingham's old friend from [[Cadiz, Ohio|Cadiz]], [[Edwin Stanton]], appointed him to serve as Assistant Judge Advocate General along with General [[Henry Lawrence Burnett|Henry Burnett]], another Assistant Judge Advocate General, and [[Joseph Holt]], the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]].

The accused conspirators were [[George Atzerodt]], [[David Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]] (Paine), [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Samuel Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen]], [[Edman Spangler]], [[Samuel Mudd]], and [[Mary Surratt]]. The trial began on May 10, 1865. The three prosecutors spent nearly two months in court, awaiting the jury's verdict. Bingham and Holt attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The first plot was to kidnap the president and hold him hostage in exchange for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] prisoners held by the Union. The second was to assassinate the president, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[US Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and thereby throw the government into electoral chaos. The prosecution did not reveal the existence of a diary taken from Booth's body, which made clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. The defense surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court.

On June 29, 1865, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill the President. [[Edman Spangler|Spangler]] was sentenced to six years in prison; [[Samuel Arnold (Lincoln conspirator)|Arnold]], [[Michael O'Laughlen|O'Laughlen]] and [[Samuel Mudd|Mudd]] were sentenced to life in prison, and [[George Atzerodt|Atzerodt]], [[David Herold|Herold]], [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Paine]] and [[Mary Surratt|Surratt]] were sentenced to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler and Mudd were pardoned by President [[Andrew Johnson]] in early 1869.

===14th Amendment===
In 1866, during the [[39th United States Congress|Thirty-ninth Congress]], Bingham was appointed to a subcommittee of the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] tasked with considering [[suffrage]] proposals. As a member of the subcommittee, Bingham submitted several versions of an amendment to the Constitution to apply the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to the States. His final submission, which was accepted by the Committee on April 28, 1866, read, "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." The Committee recommended for the language to become [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Citizenship and civil rights|Section 1]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. It was introduced in the spring of 1866, passing both houses by June 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0332_0046_ZD.html Adamson v. California], 332 U.S. 46, 103-104 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing debate in the House, Bingham stated:

{{quote|[M]any instances of State injustice and oppression have already occurred in the State legislation of this Union, of flagrant violations of the guarantied privileges of citizens of the United States, for which the national Government furnished and could furnish by law no remedy whatever. Contrary to the express letter of your Constitution, 'cruel and unusual punishments' have been inflicted under State laws within this Union upon citizens, not only for crimes committed, but for sacred duty done, for which and against which the Government of the United States had provided no remedy and could provide none.

It was an opprobrium to the Republic that for fidelity to the United States they could not by national law be protected against the degrading punishment inflicted on slaves and felons by State law. That great want of the citizen and stranger, protection by national law from unconstitutional State enactments, is supplied by the first section of this amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0332_0046_ZD.html Adamson v. California], 332 U.S. 46, 107 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Except for the addition of the first sentence of Section 1, which defined citizenship, the amendment weathered the Senate debate without substantial change. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.

Despite Bingham's likely intention for the 14th Amendment to apply the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States, the [[US Supreme Court]] declined to interpret it that way in the [[Slaughter-House Cases]] and in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]''. In the 1947 case of ''[[Adamson v. California]]'', Supreme Court Justice [[Hugo Black]] argued in his dissent that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and he attached a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0332_0046_ZD.html Adamson v. California], 332 U.S. 46, 92-118 (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court for the next 25 years, used a doctrine of [[incorporation (Bill of Rights)|selective incorporation]] that eventually extended the protections in the Bill of Rights as well as other, unenumerated rights.

Ohio ratified the Fourteenth Amendment on January 4, 1867, but Bingham continued to explain its extension of citizenship during the fall election season.&lt;ref&gt;Aynes p. 615&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourteenth Amendment has vastly expanded [[civil rights]] protections and has come to be cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html "Primary Documents in American History"], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minister to Japan===
President [[Ulysses Grant]] then appointed his ally Bingham as [[United States Minister]] to Japan, which involved a salary increase but also economic responsibilities with respect to the small embassy. Initially, Bingham tried to switch ambassadorships with [[John Watson Foster]] of Indiana, whom Grant had appointed ambassador to Mexico, but Foster declined. Bingham thus sailed with his wife and two of his three daughters to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Hammersmith, Spoilsmen in a "flowery Fairyland": The Development of the U.S. Legation in Japan (Kent State University Press) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham ultimately served longer than any other US Ambassador to that nation, for more than twelve years and under four Republican presidents, from May 31, 1873 to July 2, 1885, when his successor, appointed by newly-elected Democratic President [[Grover Cleveland]], arrived. (The next-longest serving American ambassador to Japan would prove to be former Democratic Senate Majority Leader [[Michael Joseph Mansfield]], who served for ten years a century later).

Bingham initially moved the embassy from an unsuitable location and replaced a problematic interpreter with a Presbyterian missionary from Ohio and then mastered the art of consulting with his superiors in the State Department and trimmed the imperialistic ambitions of fellow Union veteran [[Charles Le Gendre]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammersmith pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham came to greatly respect Japanese culture, but he also presciently expressed his fear that Japan's military culture would hurt the country's development.&lt;ref&gt;Hammersmith p. 117 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concurringopinions.com/archives/2011/03/john-bingham-on-japan-1895.html|title=John Bingham on Japan (1895)|website=concurringopinions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bingham most distinguished himself from other Western diplomats by fighting against the unequal treaties imposed upon Japan by Britain, particularly provisions for extraterritoriality and tariff control by Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dare, John A. Bingham and Treaty Revision with Japan 1871-1885(University of Kentucky PhD thesis 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Bingham supported Japan's right to restrict hunting by foreigners to certain times and places and later its right to regulate incoming ships via quarantines to restrict the spread of [[cholera]]. Bingham later negotiated return of the [[Shimonoseki Campaign|Shimonoseki]] indemnity in 1877 as well as a revision of Japan's treaty with the United States in 1879, which restored some tariff autonomy to Japan, conditioned upon other treaties with Westerners.&lt;ref&gt;Erving E. Beauregard, John A. Bingham, First American Minister Plenipotentiary To Japan (1873-1885) Journal of Asian History Vol. 22, No. 2 (1988), pp. 101-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Bingham-Stevens.jpg|thumb|right|260px|John A. Bingham and [[Thaddeus Stevens]] before the [[United States Senate|Senate]] addressing the vote on [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]'s impeachment by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].]]
Bingham continued his career as a representative and was re-elected to the [[40th United States Congress|Fortieth]], [[41st United States Congress|Forty-first]], and [[42nd United States Congress|Forty-second Congresses]]. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Claims|Committee on Claims]] from 1867 to 1869 and a member of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Committee on the Judiciary]] from 1869 to 1873.

In 1868, Bingham was one of the House managers in the impeachment trial of President [[Andrew Johnson]]. Bingham was also implicated in the [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|Credit Mobilier]] scandal and in 1872, he lost the election. Three local Republican political bosses made a deal to cut out Bingham, instead selecting [[Lorenzo Danford]] as the party's candidate. Thus, Danford came to represent the 16th district in the [[43rd United States Congress|Forty-third Congress]] and was re-elected several times but with a hiatus.

Bingham died in [[Cadiz, Ohio]] on March 19, 1900, nine years after his wife Amanda. He was interred next to her in the Old Cadiz (Union) Cemetery in Cadiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8122843|title=John Armor Bingham (1815 - 1900) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1901, Harrison County erected a bronze statue honoring Bingham in Cadiz.&lt;ref&gt;"John Armor Bingham," Ohio Civil War Central, 2015, Ohio Civil War Central. 23 Jan 2015 &lt;http://www.ohiocivilwarcentral.com/entry.php?rec=1015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercer County has John Bingham's house dedicated to him and now serves as the county's Republican Headquarters.

'''Kelvin Calder MacKenzie''' (born 22 October 1946) is an English [[News media|media]] executive and a former [[newspaper editor]]. Best known for being editor of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' from 1981, the publication was by then established as the Britain's largest circulation newspaper. After leaving ''The Sun'' in 1994, he was appointed to executive roles in satellite television and other broadcasting outlets, as well as being involved in a number of publishing enterprises.

After short periods as a columnist at the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', MacKenzie returned to his old paper in the same role. His contract was terminated in May 2017 after being suspended.&lt;ref name="Sweney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/15/kelvin-mackenzie-leaves-the-sun|title=Kelvin MacKenzie leaves the Sun|work=The Guardian|date=15 May 2017|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
MacKenzie was born in [[Thanet District|Thanet]], [[Kent]], to Ian and Mary MacKenzie,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=bdnaP4FnpvNXbUQ3ZNG4dQ&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=28 April 2017|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=James |date=15 June 2008 |title=A man in search of the X factor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/15/pressandpublishing.sun |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |access-date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; both journalists working for ''The South London Observer''. When the South London Press took over their paper, Mary became press chief for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader of the [[Greater London Council]], [[Horace Cutler]]. Kelvin's father died in April 2004 at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian MacKenzie: local newspaper journalist in Kent and South London|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/28718|website=Press Gazette|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325111001/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/28718|dead-url=yes|date=28 April 2004|archive-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educated at [[Alleyn's School]] in [[Dulwich]], MacKenzie left school with one [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-level]] in [[English literature]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He joined the ''South East London Mercury'' at 17, and worked on local and then national newspapers, such as the ''[[Daily Express]]'' for the next ten years.

MacKenzie has said that he discovered early on in his career that he had little writing ability and that his talents lay in making up headlines and laying out pages.&lt;ref name=dangerfield&gt;{{cite news|author=Andy Dangerfield |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/111006/press_conference_kelvin_mackenzie |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070503065341/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/article/111006/press_conference_kelvin_mackenzie |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 May 2007 |title=Kelvin MacKenzie: Old Mac opens up |newspaper=Press Gazette |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=5 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, at the age of 32, he was managing editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'', two years after it had been purchased by [[Rupert Murdoch]].

==Editor of ''The Sun''==
After moving back to the United Kingdom and a period as night editor of the ''Daily Express'', Murdoch appointed him ''The Sun'' editor in 1981. Conflict between the two groups meant that MacKenzie performed both jobs for a time.

In 1978, ''The Sun'' had finally overtaken the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in circulation becoming the newspaper with the highest sales in the UK. It was MacKenzie though who cemented the paper's image as a right-wing [[tabloid newspaper|tabloid]], not only increasing its profile, but also making it known for its attacks on [[left-wing]] political figures and movements and its sensationalist front-page celebrity exposés.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Gold [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/kelvin-mackenzie-destroyed-reputation-years-hillsborough "Kelvin MacKenzie destroyed his own reputation years before Hillsborough"], ''The Guardian'', 28 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These often proved to be misleading or false, with many controversies in this area occurring during MacKenzie editorship.&lt;ref name=pilger&gt;{{Cite journal | author=John Pilger| title=Hidden Agendas| publisher=Vintage| year=1998| pages=445–449 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators including ''[[The Guardian]]'' contributor [[Roy Greenslade]] and journalist [[John Pilger]] have commented on the alleged 'Murdoch effect'. MacKenzie himself stated that he feels that his own spell as editor of ''The Sun'' had a "positively downhill impact on journalism".&lt;ref name=dangerfield/&gt;

MacKenzie is quoted as saying in the early 1980s (on the subject of how he perceived ''The Sun''{{'}}s target audience):
{{quote|You just don't understand the readers, do you, eh? He's the bloke you see in the pub, a right old [[fascist]], wants to send the [[wog]]s back, buy his poxy [[council house]], he's afraid of the [[trade unions|unions]], afraid of the [[Soviet Union|Russians]], hates the [[homosexual|queers]] and the weirdos and drug dealers. He doesn't want to hear about that stuff (serious news).&lt;ref name=punter/&gt;}}

The paper was frequently accused of [[dumbing down]] public discourse because of its preoccupations; Pilger blamed it for the promotion of [[jingoism]], [[racism]], [[homophobia]], and intolerance.&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt;

MacKenzie was widely criticised for his perceived cruelty to both the targets of his – sometimes false – newspaper allegations; his choice of targets frequently being not only left-wing politicians and celebrities but even ordinary members of the public, and also his alleged cruelty to his own staff and colleagues, to which MacKenzie has since responded:
{{quote|Look, I am not here to be helpful. I am here to help myself, right, so I have no regrets to how I treated some people.&lt;ref name=dangerfield/&gt;}}

===''The Sun''{{'}}s headlines===
[[File:The Sun (Gotcha).png|thumb|left|upright|The sinking of the ''Belgrano'' was celebrated on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'']]
MacKenzie was responsible for the [[The Sun (United Kingdom)#The Falklands War|"Gotcha"]] front-page headline of 4 May 1982, which reported the contentious sinking of the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[cruiser]] ''[[ARA General Belgrano|General Belgrano]]'' by a British [[HMS Conqueror (S48)|submarine]] during the [[Falklands War]]. MacKenzie was heavily condemned by some commentators who felt he was glorifying death and the headline caused a storm of controversy and protest, although MacKenzie had actually changed the front-page of later editions to "Did 1,200 Argies drown?" after it was established that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties. MacKenzie later defended his "Gotcha" headline, saying:
{{quote|Gotcha' was mine, which I'm very proud about. The fact that the enemy were killed to my mind was a bloody good thing and I've never had a moment's loss of sleep over it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/avdb/news_web/video/9012da680042b40/bb/09012da680042d98_16x9_bb.ram Video] (.ram file)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite MacKenzie's self-professed pride at having printed the "Gotcha" headline, Roy Greenslade has said that he had only chosen the headline prior to it becoming clear that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties resulting from the sinking of the ''Belgrano'' and that even he later became concerned that the headline may be seen as insensitive and distasteful.

Greenslade states that MacKenzie insisted on changing the headline to "Did 1,200 Argies Die?" for later editions because of these concerns, and that he did so against the wishes of Rupert Murdoch, present in the newspaper building at the time because of an industrial dispute, who reputedly demanded that the "Gotcha" headline remain, despite the large number of casualties and later said of the headline, "I rather liked it". This is reportedly the only occasion that MacKenzie ever disobeyed a specific order from Murdoch.

MacKenzie's coverage of the Falklands War was criticised by many commentators for being a glorification of war (Greenslade was working with MacKenzie on ''The Sun'' at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/falklands/story/0,,657850,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A new Britain, a new kind of newspaper | date=25 February 2002 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Freddiehamster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster, ''The Sun'', 13 March 1986]]
MacKenzie was responsible for the "Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster" front-page headline. The claims made in the accompanying article, that the [[comedian]] [[Freddie Starr]] had placed his girlfriend's [[hamster]] on a sandwich and proceeded to eat it, turned out to be entirely untrue and an invention of the [[publicist]] [[Max Clifford]]. The headline is often held up as the prime example of ''The Sun'''s supposedly [[celebrity]]-obsessed, sensationalist and often inaccurate journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lars Weber |url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/printversion.asp?T=A&amp;Id=1781 |title=Voyeurising the voyeurs: inside the celebrity business |publisher=Café Babel |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011101/http://www.cafebabel.com/en/printversion.asp?T=A&amp;Id=1781 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Sun''{{'}}s politics===
In the [[General Election|general election]]s which were held during his time as editor, MacKenzie's ''Sun'' strongly supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and its policies.

Although the coverage of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]] remains the best remembered,{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} there were many other vitriolic personal attacks on Labour leaders by MacKenzie's ''Sun'' during elections, such as in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 campaign]], when MacKenzie ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of [[Michael Foot]], then nearly 70 years old,&lt;!-- The election was on 9 June, but Foot did not reach his 70th birthday until 23 July 1983. --&gt; alongside the headline "Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1209115.stm "Sun still shines for Blair"], BBC News, 8 March 2001. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKenzie's coverage of the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|British miners' strike in 1984–1985]] supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] miners. The paper was accused of making misleading or even outright false claims about the miners, their unions and leader [[Arthur Scargill]].&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt; MacKenzie at one point prepared a front page with the headline "Mine [[Führer]]" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose giving the appearance of him making a [[Nazi salute]]. The print workers at ''The Sun'', regarding it as an attempt at a cheap smear, refused to print it.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Philo, ''War and Peace News'' (Open University Press, 1985), p.&amp;nbsp;138.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]] MacKenzie ran a mock-editorial entitled "Why I'm Backing Kinnock, by [[Joseph Stalin]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1987_camp.stm "1987: Three on the trot for Thatcher"], BBC News Vote 2001. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]] MacKenzie used the front-page headline "If [[Neil Kinnock|Kinnock]] Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1992_camp.stm "1992: Major confounds the polls"], BBC News Election 2001. ''The Sun'' front page is reproduced. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the paper initially supported the government of [[John Major]], because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] on [[Black Wednesday]] in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Eaton (journalist)|George Eaton]] [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/blogs/2012/06/john-major-denies-bucket-shit-story "John Major denies "bucket of shit" story"], ''New Statesman'' (Staggers blog), 12 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie has claimed his response was: "Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you."&lt;ref name=Punter&gt;Chippindale &amp; Horrie, p.&amp;nbsp;442. The precise wording varies from source to source.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invented stories===
In January 1987, MacKenzie published a totally unfounded front-page story alleging that pop singer [[Elton John]] had had sex with underage [[rentboy]]s. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard [[dog]]s removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.

MacKenzie later admitted that in retrospect he found it difficult to understand why he had believed, never mind published, the claims about the guard dogs which he later realised were self-evidently absurd. Elton John sued ''The Sun'' for libel over both these claims and was later awarded £1,000,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin McKenzie [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441297184.html "Boss applies blowtorch over rentboys"], story from ''The Guardian'' as reproduced in the ''Sydney Morning Herald'',27 April 2002. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie later said of Elton John:
{{quote|I think ''The Sun'' should have its million quid back. It hasn't damaged him at all, has it? [[Libel]] can only have a value if there has been some kind of damage, right? Where is the damage? Where? There's nothing wrong with him. So no, I don't feel bad about him, not at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/kelvin-mackenzie-old-mac-opens-up/ Kelvin MacKenzie: Old Mac opens up], ''[[Press Gazette]]'', 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were many other controversies during MacKenzie's time in charge of ''The Sun''. MacKenzie at one point ran a story about a previously unknown member of the public who had just undergone a [[heart transplant]] operation, the story denouncing the man as a "love rat", ''Sun'' journalists having been told that he had left his wife 15 years earlier. Aside from criticism about the story's highly questionable news value, the newspaper was furiously condemned as the story was run when the man's recovery was still in the balance.&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt;

MacKenzie and his team were accused of simply inventing many of the stories that appeared in the newspaper, as well as interviews, and in some instances this proved to be the case, such as when an entirely fabricated interview with the disfigured Falklands war hero [[Simon Weston]] was published, which was criticised for "inviting readers to feel revulsion at his disfigurement".&lt;ref name=punter&gt;{{Cite journal| author1=Peter Chippindale| author2=Chris Horrie| title=Stick It Up Your Punter: Rise and Fall of the "Sun"| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie himself once told his staff: "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Pimlott|Pimlott, Ben]] (2001). ''The Queen: Elizabeth II and the Monarchy''. London: HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-00-255494-1}}, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other controversies that occurred under MacKenzie include a headline describing [[Australian Aborigines]] as "The Abo's: Brutal and Treacherous" (which was condemned as "inaccurate" and "unacceptably racist" by the [[Press Council (UK)|Press Council]])&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt; and MacKenzie's sending of photographers to break into a psychiatric hospital to ask actor [[Jeremy Brett]], who was a patient in the hospital at the time and who was suffering from [[manic depression]] and dying of [[cardiomyopathy]], whether he was "dying of [[AIDS]]". The newspaper apparently suspected Brett of being a homosexual and that his mystery illness might be AIDS, which it was not.&lt;ref&gt;David McKie [https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1502251,00.html "The very best of Holmes",] ''The Guardian'', 9 June 2005. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

These incidents caused ''The Sun'' to be criticised, but the newspaper's profile increased dramatically during MacKenzie's time as editor although sales figures dipped. On the subject of the sensationalist and sometimes inaccurate reporting which appeared in ''The Sun'' during his time as editor, MacKenzie has said:
{{quote|When I published those stories, they were not lies. They were great stories that later turned out to be untrue – and that is different. What am I supposed to feel ashamed about?&lt;ref name=dangerfield/&gt;}}

==Coverage of the Hillsborough disaster==
{{Main|Hillsborough disaster#The Sun}}

[[Image:Hillsborough disaster Sun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The false allegations on ''The Sun'''s front page on 19 April 1989 caused widespread offence among Merseysiders, causing them to boycott the newspaper.]]

In April 1989, the single biggest controversy during MacKenzie's period as editor occurred, later described in a ''Sun'' editorial in 2004 as "the most terrible mistake in our history", during the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], a deadly crush which occurred during an [[FA Cup]] semi-final at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough football stadium]] in [[Sheffield]] claiming the lives of 96 [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans.

''The Sun'' printed the front-page headline "The Truth", with three sub-headings, "Some Fans Picked Pockets of Victims", "Some Fans Urinated on the Brave Cops" and "Some Fans Beat Up PC Giving Kiss of Life". The accompanying article claimed that ticketless and drunken Liverpool fans were responsible for the disaster, having supposedly tried to fight their way into the stadium by rushing the turnstiles and attacking policemen outside the ground. Further specific allegations were made that during the disaster itself Liverpool fans inside the stadium had stolen wallets and other items from the dead, had urinated over policemen and the bodies of dead fans, that they had beaten policemen, ambulance men and rescue workers attempting to save the lives of other fans and had sexually abused the body of a dead girl after shouting "throw her up and we'll fuck her" to policemen moving her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/07/pressandpublishing.football1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Gibson | title=What the Sun said 15 years ago | date=7 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources for these allegations were stated to be anonymous high-ranking police officers from Sheffield police and [[Irvine Patnick]], then [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]], who was not even present at the match. In 2007, on BBC television's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', MacKenzie additionally claimed that one of his sources was a regional news agency. The article was accompanied by graphic photographs showing Liverpool fans, including young children, choking and suffocating as they were being crushed against the [[perimeter fence]]s surrounding the terraces – this was widely condemned as inappropriate.&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt;

The coverage and the allegations caused intense uproar throughout [[Merseyside]], where ''The Sun'' was boycotted, with public burnings of the paper organised and many newsagents (including in [[Everton F.C.]]-supporting areas) refusing to stock it at all. There was widespread criticism and condemnation from many commentators. The [[Press Complaints Commission|Press Council]] described the allegations unequivocally as "lies". The official government enquiry into the disaster dismissed the allegation that drunken Liverpool fans had been responsible for the disaster and concluded that inadequate crowd control and errors by the police had been the primary cause of the tragedy.

Prior to the publication of ''The Sun''{{'}}s initial article, a number of local newspapers in [[Yorkshire]], such as the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' and ''[[The Yorkshire Post]]'', published very similar allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/history/media.shtm Hillsborough Football Disaster – The Immediate Aftermath – The Media reaction], Contrast website. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has since emerged that many British national newspaper editors were offered the same story from the same sources the day before ''The Sun'' article was published but while many national newspapers printed allegations about Liverpool fans being responsible for the disaster, only MacKenzie and his counterpart at the ''[[Daily Star (British newspaper)|Daily Star]]'' newspaper were prepared to print the more outlandish allegations about theft and abuse of dead bodies, with many editors feeling that the claims sounded dubious. Furthermore, the other national papers which printed coverage claiming Liverpool fans to be responsible for the disaster, including the ''Daily Star'', withdrew their allegations and apologised the day after publication, whereas ''The Sun'' did not.

In their book about the history of ''The Sun'', [[Peter Chippindale]] and [[Chris Horrie]] wrote:

{{quote|As MacKenzie's layout was seen by more and more people, a collective shudder ran through the office [but] MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. [Everyone] seemed paralysed, "looking like rabbits in the headlights", as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it, they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a classic smear.&lt;ref name=punter/&gt;}}
Murdoch for his part ordered MacKenzie to appear on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''The World This Weekend'' in the aftermath of the controversy to apologise. MacKenzie said on the programme: "It was my decision and my decision alone to do that front page in that way and I made a rather serious error".

In 1993 he told a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee that

{{quote|I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If he had not said it and the chief superintendent (David Duckenfield) had not agreed with it, we would not have gone with it.}}

In 1996, MacKenzie again discussed the matter on Radio 4 but this time claimed: "The Sun did not accuse anybody of anything. We were the vehicle for others".

Sales of ''The Sun'' on Merseyside have not recovered, with News International (now [[News UK]]) losing several million pounds a year in revenue.&lt;ref name=pilger/&gt; Many newsagents on [[Merseyside]] continue to refuse to stock the newspaper.

==After editing ''The Sun''==
In January 1994, MacKenzie moved to [[BSkyB]], another of Murdoch's [[News Corporation]] assets, but left within a few months.

In 1995, MacKenzie joined [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] and was appointed joint boss of its fledgling [[L!VE TV]] British [[cable television]] channel. The station had previously been headed by [[Janet Street-Porter]], who had set out to establish L!VE TV as an alternative, youth-orientated station. She clashed with MacKenzie over programme content and soon left, leaving him in sole charge.

MacKenzie later said that he would agree to indulge in a "night of passion" with Janet Street-Porter and that he would be "willing" but only if she paid him £4.7m, a figure he had arrived at after calculating how much money he would lose from "loss of reputation, the negative impact on future earnings etc".&lt;ref name=dangerfield/&gt;

MacKenzie took a radically different approach and was criticised for producing severely down-market programming. MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and [[bikini]]-clad Scandinavian woman presenting [[weather]] forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring [[dwarfism|dwarfs]] bouncing on [[trampoline]]s and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to [[tarot card readers]] and [[astrologers]]. L!VE TV's best known character was the [[News Bunny]], a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories to indicate whether or not he found them interesting or exciting.

The station had a budget of only £2,000 an hour and attracted a very small audience, with an average of 200,000 viewers, but it was well-known because of the controversy and criticism surrounding its programming, which led to the station being labelled "Tabloid TV" and even "Sun TV" (in reference to the newspaper, some critics accusing MacKenzie of doing nothing more than creating a television version of his old newspaper). MacKenzie has been accused of taking a "shamelessly tacky approach". He eventually left the station in 1997. He later said on LIVE TV:

{{quote|Bouncing weather dwarfs were a major milestone in British TV. Their weather forecasts will be five years old now. We used to shoot them in batches ... and it was just luck if the forecast actually coincided with the weather. We were really ahead of our time. If [[Five (channel)|Channel 5]] put on Topless Darts at 10&amp;nbsp;pm they would double their ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Claire Cozens| url=https://www.theguardian.com/print/0,3858,4670161-103676,00.html| title=News bunny's back, say Live TV lads| publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''| date=16 May 2003| accessdate=4 May 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The station failed and closed.

In November 1998, MacKenzie headed a consortium, TalkCo Holdings, which purchased [[TalkSport|Talk Radio]] from CLT for £24.7 million. One of the financial backers was [[News International]], News Corporation's UK subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = MacKenzie's battle of the airwaves | publisher = BBC News | date = 9 November 1998 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/210952.stm | accessdate =26 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 TalkCo was renamed [[The Wireless Group]] and in January 2000 Talk Radio was rebranded as [[TalkSport]]. The Wireless Group acquired The Radio Partnership in 1999, gaining control of its nine local commercial stations. In May 2005, it was announced that the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] media company, [[UTV plc]], had made an agreed offer to buy the company, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In June 2005, the takeover proceeded, with MacKenzie being replaced by UTV executive [[Scott Taunton]]. The station lost listeners during MacKenzie's tenure.

In September 2005, MacKenzie took over Highbury House Communications, a magazine publishing company based in [[Bournemouth]] and [[Orpington]]. HHC held a number of titles mainly in the leisure and computer games market with a '[[ladette]]' title sitting uncomfortably in its portfolio. HHC was already suffering from massive debts when MacKenzie took the reins and despite efforts on his part to broker a life-line to save the ailing company, he had inherited a poisoned legacy. This venture also failed; Highbury closed in December 2005.

MacKenzie then spent a year as chairman of one of the UK's largest marketing and communications groups, Media Square plc. This was unsuccessful and MacKenzie left in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Tryhorn [http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2045291,00.html "MacKenzie quits marketing group",] ''The Guardian'', 29 March 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aforementioned criticism of the corporation, in March 2006, MacKenzie joined [[BBC Radio Five Live]] as a presenter. He made his debut on the station over the summer, presenting a series of programmes telling the story of various scandals which have occurred at [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments over the years. He then presented a retrospective look at the year gone by on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/03_march/30/mackenzie.shtml "Kelvin MacKenzie makes his debut on Five Live"], BBC press release, 30 March 2006. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, MacKenzie returned to ''The Sun'', this time as a columnist, where he was accused using one of his columns to launch an attack on the people of Scotland (see below).&lt;ref name=tartan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/34843 |title=Sun ed and MacKenzie clash in "tartan tosspots" |publisher=Press Gazette |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=12 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705011220/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/34843 |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of the columns themselves, he has said "I want to get the [[Lonsdale Belt]] for vile and be personally rude to as many people as possible." In June 2011, it was announced that MacKenzie would leave ''The Sun'' to write a column for the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/30/kelvin-mackenzie-join-daily-mail |title=Sun's Kelvin MacKenzie to join rival Daily Mail|date=30 June 2011 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged in December 2016, during a civil case, that he had left ''The Sun'' because [[Rebekah Brooks]], then head of News International, and [[Dominic Mohan]], then editor of ''The Sun'', had not told him of the extent of the [[News International phone hacking scandal|company's phone hacking scandal]].

MacKenzie was an early investor in online video company [[Base79]], established by his son [[Ashley MacKenzie]] in 2007. They sold the firm in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/exsun-editor-kelvin-mackenzie-and-son-sell-video-business-for-50-million-9591601.html |title=Ex-Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie and son sell video business for £50 million |last1=Bentham |first1=Martin |date=8 July 2014 |website=[[standard.co.uk]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 MacKenzie launched the online TV channel [[Sports Tonight Live|Sports Tonight]], describing the channel as "Sky Sports News meets TalkSport". The channel received investment from former Conservative Party treasurer [[Lord Ashcroft]], who took a minority stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/16/kelvin-mackenzie-sports-tonight |title=Lord Ashcroft backs Kelvin MacKenzie's Sports Tonight |last1=Garside |first1=Juliette |date=16 May 2011 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKenzie joined ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as an online columnist in 2013, however he was dropped by the newspaper after one column, with [[Roy Greenslade]] reporting in ''The Guardian'' that he was let go because of upset among staff on the ''Telegraph'' sports desk at his role in reporting on the Hillsborough disaster, in particular from football columnist and ex-Liverpool player [[Alan Hansen]], who played at Hillsborough.&lt;ref name=tory&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/apr/18/kelvin-mackenzie-dailytelegraph |title=The truth – why the Telegraph dropped Kelvin MacKenzie's column |last=Greenslade |first=Roy|authorlink=Roy Greenslade|date=18 April 2013|website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the ''Daily Mail'' was being sued for libel for £200,000 over a column by MacKenzie. The claim was brought by an NHS doctor, Antonio Serrano, whom MacKenzie had criticised in the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Kelvin MacKenzie's Daily Mail column sparks £200,000 libel claim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/08/kelvin-mackenzie-libel-claim-daily-mail|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 April 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, MacKenzie was a contestant on gameshow ''[[Pointless Celebrities]]''. Angered viewers complained to host [[Richard Osman]], who said that if he had known in advance, he would not have let him appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Osman was not happy about Kelvin MacKenzie's appearance on Pointless Celebrities...|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-10-27/richard-osman-was-not-happy-about-kelvin-mackenzies-appearance-on-pointless-celebrities|accessdate=25 October 2016|work=Radio Times|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political ambitions==
MacKenzie's commitment to Conservative, [[Thatcherite]] politics has led him to argue that [[Margaret Thatcher]] is the UK's greatest post-war [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/6242715.stm#THATCHER "Your Favourite Prime Minister"], ''[[The Daily Politics]]'' official [[BBC]] website, 13 June 2007.

In May 2008, MacKenzie stood for election as a local councillor in [[Borough of Elmbridge|Elmbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/628846/part_3/why-im-standing-to-be-a-local-councillor.thtml |title=Why I’m standing to be a local councillor |last=MacKenzie |first=Kelvin |date=23 April 2008 |publisher=''The Spectator'' |accessdate=13 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529040423/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/628846/part_3/why-im-standing-to-be-a-local-councillor.thtml |archivedate=29 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the election, gaining 227 votes whereas the Conservative seat holder Glenn Dearlove won 679.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/topstories/display.var.2242241.0.tories_win_majority_in_elmbridge.php?act=login|title=Tories win majority in Elmbridge|last=Grove|first=Kerry|date=2 May 2008|publisher=''Your Local Guardian''|accessdate=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, after Conservative [[Member of Parliament|member of parliament]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] announced that he would resign his seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in order to fight a [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|by-election]] as a protest against the Labour government's plans for 42-day [[Detention of suspects|detention]] without charge for [[Terrorism|terrorist]] [[suspect]]s, MacKenzie announced that he was likely to contest the election on a pro-42-day detention platform,&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt; stating: "I have been associated with ''The Sun'' for 30 years. ''The Sun'' is very, very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and ''The Sun'' has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days".&lt;ref name=BBC130608&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7452264.stm|title=Ex-Sun editor to challenge Davis |date=13 June 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-camera, before a BBC interview, MacKenzie referred to Hull, which the [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] constituency borders, as "an absolute shocker". Asked to clarify those comments, he said it was "a joke" and that he has "never actually been to Hull".&lt;ref name=BBC130608/&gt;

MacKenzie subsequently decided not to run for the Haltemprice and Howden seat, stating: "The clincher for me was the money. Clearly ''The Sun'' couldn't put up the cash – so I was going to have to rustle up a maximum of £100,000 to conduct my campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/19/daviddavis.byelections?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media|title=MacKenzie explains decision not to stand in David Davis byelection|last=Percival|first=Jenny|date=19 June 2008|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=19 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments in the Hillsborough controversy==
{{RefimproveBLP|section|date=April 2017}}
===Incidents in 2006–7===
During an after-dinner speech to Newcastle-based law firm Mincoffs Solicitors on 30 November 2006, MacKenzie is reported to have said of his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster:
{{quote|All I did wrong there was tell the truth. There was a surge of Liverpool fans who had been drinking and that is what caused the disaster. The only thing different we did was put it under the headline "The Truth". I went on ''[[The World at One]]'' the next day and apologised. I only did that because Rupert Murdoch told me to. I wasn't sorry then and I'm not sorry now because we told the truth.}}
MacKenzie went on to compare Merseysiders with animal rights activists. "If this got out, it would blow up all over again", MacKenzie is said to have remarked.

The remarks were met with widespread incredulity and condemnation, particularly on Merseyside, where Liverpool F.C., the local ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' and numerous local MPs condemned MacKenzie, with [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Walton]] MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] arguing that the quotes confirmed that MacKenzie was "never fit to edit a national newspaper". The ''Liverpool Echo'' called for ''The Sun'' to sack MacKenzie as a columnist. ''The Sun'' issued a statement saying that they had "already apologised for what happened and we stand by that apology." However, despite reports of consternation at ''The Sun'' over MacKenzie's statements, the newspaper chose to retain him as a columnist. MacKenzie refused to comment publicly on the controversy and pulled out of a scheduled appearance on BBC television's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' later that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=ex-sun-editor--i-was-right-on-hillsborough&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18190784&amp;siteid=50061-name_page.html |title=Ex-Sun editor: I was right on Hillsborough |author=Sam Lister |publisher=''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=1 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204011259/http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline%3Dex-sun-editor--i-was-right-on-hillsborough%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18190784%26siteid%3D50061-name_page.html |archivedate= 4 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Tara Conlan| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1961898,00.html| title=MacKenzie 'reignites Hillsborough row'| publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''| date=1 December 2006| accessdate=4 May 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier that autumn MacKenzie had already provoked controversy in Liverpool by stating in a ''[[Press Gazette]]'' interview that he had never knowingly printed any lies in ''The Sun'' and that even stories which later turned out to be untrue were still "good stories". In relation to the publishing of false or misleading reports in ''The Sun'', MacKenzie asked "What am I supposed to feel ashamed about?" MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the ''Liverpool Echo'' published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a "good story").

Although there was actually little reaction to the quotes on Merseyside at the time, they did draw comment from Phil Hammond, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who said: "I can't believe that even after all these years, there is no remorse or regret for the hurt he caused".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2006/10/mackenzie_no_lies_claim_angers.html "MacKenzie 'no lies' claim angers Merseyside"], blog on ''The Guardian'' website, [no date]. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was still thought at this point however that, although MacKenzie appeared not to regret the coverage, he no longer regarded it as having any factual basis after his apparent admissions in the past that the allegations made were lies fed to him by police officers and a Conservative MP.

On 6 January 2007, a protest took place at [[Anfield]] Stadium, the home of [[Liverpool F.C.]], during the [[FA Cup]] Third Round match against [[Arsenal F.C.]]. The protest was organised by fan group [[Reclaim The Kop]], with the support of Liverpool F.C., and was directed towards MacKenzie personally and his continuing allegations about Hillsborough, and also towards the BBC (which was present at the stadium, broadcasting the game live on television) for employing MacKenzie as a radio presenter and paying him with [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licence]] payers' (and therefore public) money. Almost 12,000 people in the Kop stand held up a mosaic which spelled out the words 'The Truth' whilst Liverpool supporters chanted "Justice for the 96" for six minutes, signifying the length of time that the Hillsborough game played on for before being abandoned. MacKenzie did not publicly respond to the protest.

On 11 January 2007, MacKenzie appeared on BBC television's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' programme, broadcast from a venue in Kent. Towards the end of the programme, MacKenzie was asked by presenter [[David Dimbleby]] about ''The Sun''{{'}}s claims about the Hillsborough disaster. MacKenzie said that he stood by his allegation that ticketless fans were the cause of the disaster but that he does not know whether the other allegations about theft from the dead and fans urinating over victims and policemen were true. [[Clare Short]] MP suggested MacKenzie should apologise to the bereaved families and survivors who say that his claims cause them distress and hurt but he refused, claiming that it would make no difference anyway due to the bad blood between himself and [[Liverpool F.C.]] MacKenzie suggested that those who feel angry at him should instead direct their anger towards "someone who caused the disaster". MacKenzie was heckled by some members of the audience while Short was applauded when she repeated her suggestion that he should retract his claims and apologise, but MacKenzie remained adamant that he had nothing to apologise for.

In February 2007, ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' journalist [[Matthew Norman (journalist)|Matthew Norman]] claimed that MacKenzie was considering issuing a public apology for his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, although at the time he was "still unsure" as to whether to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2303477.ece "Matthew Norman's Media Diary",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113215705/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2303477.ece |date=13 November 2007 }} ''The Independent'', 26 February 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His former colleague at ''The Sun'', [[Roy Greenslade]] has suggested that the real reason why MacKenzie may be so hesitant to apologise and admit the inaccuracy of the coverage may be his "anti-[[Liverpool|Scouse]]" bias, which Greenslade suspects makes it difficult for MacKenzie to "bring himself to say sorry to the city's people".&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/feb/28/votevotevoteforkelvinmack "Vote, vote, vote for Kelvin MacKenzie"], blog on ''The Guardian'' website, 28 February 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fans exoneration (2012)===
On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld government papers which has exonerated the Liverpool fans present at the match, MacKenzie issued the following statement:
{{quote|Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline. I too was totally misled. Twenty three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield [White's] in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP [Sheffield Hallam MP [[Irvine Patnick]]] were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium. I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster. As the Prime Minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves. It has taken more than two decades, 400,000 documents and a two-year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline 'The Lies' rather than 'The Truth'. I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong.}}
Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as "too little, too late", calling him "lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9538782/Hillsborough-Kelvin-MacKenzie-offers-profuse-apologies-to-the-people-of-Liverpool.html |title=Hillsborough: Kelvin MacKenzie offers 'profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 12 September 2012|accessdate=1 January 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The copy from White's news agency was available to other newspapers, who reported the story as allegations – ''The Sun'' reported the allegations, on McKenzie's say-so, as 'the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade commenting on McKenzie's apology, ''Up All Night'', Radio 5 Live, 13 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Warrington Inquests verdicts, Mackenzie was door-stepped by [[Alex Thomson (journalist)|Alex Thomson]] of ''[[Channel 4 News]]''. He was filmed pleading "Please Alex, this isn't reasonable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Merrill |first=Jamie |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/tv-news-kelvin-mackenzie-gets-a-taste-of-his-own-medicine-8153544.html|title=TV news Kelvin MacKenzie gets a taste of his own medicine|work=The Indpndent|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine complaints were received by Ofcom asserting MacKenzie's privacy had been invaded, but in its adjudication, the regulator rejected the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first= |title= Channel 4 cleared by regulator over Kelvin MacKenzie doorstepping

===Comments in 2016–7===
Despite apologising on a number of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie made a joke in ''The Sun'' newspaper that if it was true that [[George Osborne]] (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC's home stadium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/james-obrien-skewers-kelvin-mackenzie-over-the-suns-hillsborough-front-page_uk_5720a371e4b0d6f7bed53bd7 | location=London | work=The Huffington Post | first=Aubrey | last=Allegretti | title=James O’Brien Skewers Kelvin MacKenzie Over The Sun’s Hillsborough Front Page | date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day before the 28th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in April 2017, MacKenzie's column in ''The Sun'' mentioned the Everton footballer [[Ross Barkley]] appearing to imply Barkley deserved to be beaten up in a nightclub incident earlier in the week. Comparing the player to a "gorilla at the zoo", MacKenzie was accused of racism (Barkley is of part-Nigerian descent). The column was removed from the newspaper's website on the afternoon of its day of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parveen|first=Nazia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/apr/14/police-investigate-sun-column-after-racial-hate-complaint|title=Police investigate racial hate complaint over Sun column on Ross Barkley|work=The Guardian|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=York|first=Chris|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-suns-kelvin-mackenzie_uk_58f0e17ee4b0da2ff8600dbc|title=The Sun’s Kelvin MacKenzie Branded ‘Racist’ For Attack On Ross Barkley|work=The Huffington Post|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, a spokesman for the newspaper apologised "for the offence caused" and said the columnist "has been suspended from the paper with immediate effect. The views expressed by Kelvin Mackenzie about the people of Liverpool were wrong, unfunny and are not the view of the paper".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockburn|first=Harry|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/kelvin-mackenzie-the-sun-liverpool-ross-barkley-hillsborough-disaster-racist-a7684591.html|title=Kelvin MacKenzie suspended from The Sun after 'racist' column on Everton footballer|work=The Independent|date=14 April 2017|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the column appeared, it was announced that MacKenzie's "contract with News Group Newspapers", the ''Sun''{{'}}s publishers, "has been terminated by mutual consent".&lt;ref name="Sweney"/&gt;

In response to MacKenzie's article, on the day of its publication Everton FC banned ''The Sun'' and its reporters "from all areas of its operation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39608149|title=Everton ban the ''Sun'' after Ross Barkley article|work=BBC News|date=15 April 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following Liverpool FC who had made such a decision about ''The Sun'' in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-38933817|title=Liverpool FC ban for ''Sun'' journalists over Hillsborough|work=BBC News|date=10 February 2017|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on Scotland==
MacKenzie made a series of attacks on the people of Scotland in 2007, although he is partly of [[Anglo-Scottish|Scottish descent]] – his grandfather was from [[Stirling]].&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/the-strange-case-of-the-ex-editor-with-scottish-blood-who-just-can-t-resist-attacking-scotland-1-695579 | title=The strange case of the ex-editor with Scottish blood who just can't resist attacking Scotland|work=The Scotsman|date=13 October 2007|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his three names are all Scottish in origin. Kelvin is the name of [[River Kelvin|one of the rivers]] that runs through [[Glasgow]], [[River Calder, Highland|Calder]] is the name of a river in the Highlands and the surname MacKenzie derives from the Scottish Gaelic "Mac Coinnich" meaning son of Coinneach, a Highland [[Clan Mackenzie|clan]].

In July 2006, MacKenzie wrote a column for ''The Sun'' newspaper referring to Scots as "[[Tartan]] Tosspots" and apparently rejoicing in the fact that Scotland has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the United Kingdom. MacKenzie's column provoked a storm of protest, and was heavily condemned by numerous commentators including Scottish MPs and MSPs.&lt;ref name=tartan/&gt;

===''Question Time''===

On 11 October 2007, MacKenzie appeared on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' TV programme and launched another attack on Scotland. During a debate about [[tax]], MacKenzie claimed that:{{quote|Scotland believes not in [[entrepreneur]]ialism like London and the south east... Scots enjoy spending [money] but they don't enjoy creating it, which is the opposite to down south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=BBC News| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7041128.stm| title=MacKenzie attack draws Scots fire| date=12 October 2007| accessdate=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The comments came as part of an attack on [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], whom MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was "a socialist Scot",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outrage over Kelvin MacKenzie's Scottish slurs|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1565931/Outrage-over-Kelvin-MacKenzies-Scottish-slurs.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 October 2007|location=London|date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist [[Chuka Umunna]] from the think tank [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] called his comments "absolutely disgraceful", and booing and jeering were heard from the [[Cheltenham]] studio audience. The BBC received around 200 complaints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|title=Fury at MacKenzie's Scots attack|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/12/pressandpublishing.bbc|accessdate=12 October 2007|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism, including comments from the Scottish [[entrepreneur]] [[Duncan Bannatyne]] who responded on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]:
{{quote|It is plainly wrong for MacKenzie to assert that Scottish people do not understand business and enterprise. There are some phenomenal Scottish entrepreneurs, I could name so many. I think Kelvin MacKenzie is a raving lunatic, I think he's a complete idiot and a racist idiot at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Akbar|first=Arifa|title=Former 'Sun' editor MacKenzie outrages Scots|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/former-sun-editor-mackenzie-outrages-scots-394723.html|accessdate=13 October 2007|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
On 13 January 2012, MacKenzie once again appeared on the BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' television programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MacKenzie: PM 'nuts' to oppose Scottish independence|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/question_time/9677111.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 January 2012|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and remarked on the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|move for Scottish independence]]: {{quote|My sense about England right now is that they wish Scotland to be independent. They want them, they want them to go out there and make their way in the world and see if they are as clever as they believe they are.}}

==Accusation of Islamophobia==
In July 2016, after the [[2016 Nice attack]], MacKenzie wrote an article for ''The Sun'' in which he queried whether it was appropriate for ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' presenter [[Fatima Manji]] to read the news wearing a hijab.&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/19/the-sun-kelvin-mackenzie-muslims-c4-news-fatima-manji||title=The Sun's Kelvin MacKenzie is trying to smear Muslims, says C4 News presenter|work=The Guardian|date=19 July 2016|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manji accused MacKenzie of attempting to "intimidate Muslims out of public life" and attempting to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in suggesting they are inherently violent. She said, "He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are helpless slaves. And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I would sympathise with a terrorist".&lt;ref name="Plunkett"/&gt;

The [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] (IPSO) received 17 complaints about Manji wearing the hijab, an objection which was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweney|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/22/complaints-channel-4-news-hijab-the-sun-kelvin-mackenzie-fatima-manji|title=Complaints about Channel 4 News presenter wearing hijab rejected|work=The Guardian|date=22 August 2016|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the IPSO received 1,700 complaints about MacKenzie's article. The IPSO ruled in October 2016 that MacKenzie was "entitled" to make his comments, and a "prejudicial or pejorative reference" to Manji's religion was not present in the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saul|first=Heather|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kelvin-mackenzie-fatima-manji-hijab-cleared-ipso-a7369736.html#gallery|title=Kelvin MacKenzie cleared by press watchdog over attack on Fatima Manji wearing a hijab during Channel 4 report|work=The Independent|date=19 October 2016|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manji said the ruling meant it was now "open season on minorities, and Muslims in particular".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37713538|title=Kelvin MacKenzie Ipso ruling 'frightening', says Fatima Manji|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
MacKenzie married Jacqueline Holland in 1968 in [[Camberwell]]. As a couple, they had a daughter (born 1969) and two sons (born 1972 and 1974). His elder son and his daughter worked at Talk Radio. In the late 1990s, MacKenzie was featured in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' holidaying in what the paper described as a "love nest" in [[Barbados]] with [[News International]] secretary Joanna Duckworth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=33688 "Axe Grinder 31.03.06",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306015338/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=33688 |date=6 March 2012 }} ''Press Gazette'' (online edition), 30 March 2006. Retrieved on 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKenzie and his wife divorced on the grounds of his [[adultery]] in 2006.{{citation needed|date= April 2017}} On 25 July 2008, he married Sarah McLean in [[Sunningdale]], [[Berkshire]]; she works for [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

MacKenzie was a supporter of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.]] for 12 years but switched allegiance to [[Queens Park Rangers]] after Charlton's relegation from [[the Championship]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2009/apr/01/charlton-athletic-kelvin-mackenzie "Good riddance, say Charlton fans as Kelvin MacKenzie deserts them",] ''Guardian'' (online edition), 1 April 2009.

The show was not renewed for a third season.

==Premise==
''Li'l Bush'' takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] version of the present day, where [[George H. W. Bush]] is president and [[George W. Bush]] ("Li'l George" on the show), along with his cronies (members of George W. Bush's real life former staff), are children attending [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]] [[Elementary School]]. Issues in which the latter [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] is involved (for example, the [[Iraq War]]) are transferred to the elder Bush, but feature the younger Bush interacting with them in various ways.

Also, just as George Bush's father is president, the parents of the other kids are members of the elder Bush's cabinet (all depicted as their real life adult counterparts, with the exception of the elder [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]], who is depicted as Cheney with a [[Darth Vader]] helmet). The show pokes fun at George W. Bush's policies in an indirect manner, and provides a criticism of his administration.

==Main characters==
* Li'l George/Li'l Bush ([[George W. Bush]]), voiced by [[Chris Parson]]; the leader of the gang, he often makes choices without thinking about the consequences and is seldom corrected by his friends. Like the real [[George W. Bush]], he enjoys giving people various nicknames. He doesn't seem to understand that Li'l Condi is in fact a girl. He has a crush on the "new girl" at school, who is the future Laura Bush. He refers to her as a "chubby nerd". Additionally, though the show is entitled ''Li'l Bush'', the character himself is always referred to by the other characters (and in the scripts) as Li'l George.
* George Sr. ([[George H. W. Bush]]), voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; the irascible [[President of the United States|Commander-in-Chief]] who acts as somewhat of a [[Double act|straight man]] to Li'l George. He is shown to be extremely weak physically, and possessing a deep love for Saltine crackers. He and Barbara are also swingers and although he loves his wife, he has a specific time scheduled at work for "old people sex" with his secretary. His morals seem to be completely based on voter opinions. He is also seen to be allergic to people who look Asian as seen in the 'Hall Monitor' episode (a reference to when Bush threw up onto the lap of Japan's Prime Minister).
* [[Barbara Bush]], voiced by [[Mara Cary]]; the sexually frustrated wife of the President, so much so that she once resorts to having a [[Courtship|tryst]] with Li'l Cheney. She has also admitted to having an affair with [[Michael Dukakis]]. She was confused with a [[polar bear]] in "Gay Friend". According to George Sr., Barbara Bush was a "Frankenstein of presidential parts" added with woman parts that he brought to life, giving her the head of [[George Washington]].
* [[Jeb Bush]], voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; the indestructible but mentally undeveloped brother to Li'l George. His family shows a general apathy towards his well-being. This could possibly be because he is able to withstand things that would kill an ordinary person, and sometimes benefits from them. In one episode, Jeb withstands a nuclear blast, and in another, climbs onto a missile about to be fired, but appears completely unharmed after the dust clears.  When Jeb is hit in the head with a frying pan, he speaks normally (then voiced by [[Colin Meloy]]) and openly criticizes his father's governmental decisions. Jeb is treated like a pet, as he is taken for walks, given flea dips, and eats from a bowl with his name on it (often next to the actual family dog Barney).
* Li'l Cheney ([[Dick Cheney]]), voiced by [[Donick Cary]]; a friend of Li'l George, he growls incoherently ("reh-reh-REH-reh!") rather than speaking, with the occasional interjection of a contextually relevant word or phrase ("reh-reh-REH-[[Dick Cheney#Health problems|massive heart attack]]-reh-reh-REH"); the rest of the characters appear to understand him, much in the tradition of the mumbling [[Kenny McCormick]] on ''[[South Park]]''. He is also an expert in foreign languages, and acts as a translator for the group. As a testament to his deranged violent tendencies, he consumes raw—sometimes living—meat and blood, matched with foods high in saturated fats. His favorite food is chicken ("reh-reh-reh-Cheney snack-reh-reh-reh"). His father appears to be [[Darth Vader]].
* Li'l Condi ([[Condoleezza Rice]]), voiced by [[Ann Villella]] in Season 1 and [[Kari Wahlgren]] in Season 2 [http://www.kariwahlgren.net/news.html], acts as the voice of reason for her friends (though they routinely ignore her sensible advice). She has a huge crush on Li'l George- so much so, that she does his homework for him and even gains an abundance of weight. She also takes piano lessons for her parents' amusement. In an unrelated episode, she becomes a drug addict (prescription pills) and requires the help of her friends to become clean.
* Li'l Rummy ([[Donald Rumsfeld]]), voiced by [[Iggy Pop]]; seems to be the only remotely intelligent character on the show aside from Li'l Condi. He also displays a sadistic side, possibly resulting from the fact that he is abused by his father. According to a video on Comedy Central, he is kept around as a scapegoat. This is verified in the show when George Sr. says one way to cover up a scandal is to blame it on Li'l Rummy.  This is the second cartoon series in which Donald Rumsfeld is depicted as a regular or semi-regular character, the first being ''[[Kid Notorious]]''.

===Supporting characters===

====Li'l Democrats====
The series antagonists (also called Li'l Dems).
* Li'l Hillary ([[Hillary Clinton]]): voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]] (in season 2) [http://www.kariwahlgren.net/news.html]; girlfriend of Li'l Bill, she works at an abortion clinic after school "just for fun" and is also suggested to be [[bisexual]] after kissing Li'l Condi.
* Li'l [[Barack Obama]]: voiced by [[Tim Meadows]]; shown laughing at Li'l George, he is "[[Nuclear weapon|nuked]]" by Li'l George when he is seen sneaking a cigarette outside of the White House. He also leads Li'l George's friends after Li'l Bush abandons them for Li'l Tony Blair. He attempts to enlist their help in building a "Home for Humanity" for a single mother, but the gang burns it down (assuming that the plan was to commit insurance fraud or turn it into a dungeon and force single mothers to fight to the death) and use the money to buy themselves scooters. He frequently says "Yes we can" to answer questions.
* Li'l [[Al Gore]]: voiced by [[Chris Parson]]; always encouraging others to be eco-friendly and shown with an extremely eco-friendly house with many inventions created by Li'l Al himself (including a time machine, and an interconnected series of ropes which create a net that "[[dreamcatcher|catches dreams]]", he calls the "[[Al Gore controversies|internet]]"). Li'l Bush constantly ridicules him for being slightly overweight (to make everyone else think so) despite the fact that Li'l George is shown to have more body weight than Li'l Al.
* Li'l [[Nancy Pelosi]]: shown sewing [[Gay pride|a flag with rainbow-colored stripes]], she is also "[[Nuclear weapon|nuked]]" by Li'l George. Voiced by production assistant Martha Cary, who is the show creator's half-sister.
* Li'l [[John Kerry]]: voiced by [[Chris Parson]], Li'l Kerry's voice bores Li'l Bush and the gang. He loves ketchup, and says that someday he might marry it, in reference to his real-world marriage to [[condiment]] heiress [[Teresa Heinz Kerry]].
* Li'l [[John Edwards]]: apparently obsessed with hair in reference to Edwards' $400 [[haircut]]s.
* Li'l Bill ([[Bill Clinton]]): voiced by [[Chris Parson]]; constantly [[Lewinsky scandal|cheats]] on Li'l Hillary.
* Tiny [[Dennis Kucinich|Kucinich]]: who wants to someday fly with doves. Sometimes has to be handled like an infant. Voiced by Jason Nash, who does a variety of other voices for the show.

====American politicians====
* Li'l [[Mark Foley]], voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; a member of Li'l Laura's prayer group, quite fond of [[Mark Foley scandal|texting]].
* Li'l [[John Ashcroft]]; shown singing the iconic "[[Let the Eagle Soar]]", to very poor reception.
* Li'l [[John McCain]], voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; says "That's the straight talk" at the end of almost every statement, loves chocolate milk. He disrespects Li'l Bush when he's hall monitor. Li'l Bush gets his vengeance by stoking fear of hippies in the school, then detaining John McCain in the back of a nearby [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Cuban restaurant]] as part of his anti-hippie security measures. Li'l Rummy then removes his brain with an ice cream scoop, after which he is a mindless zombie who does whatever Li'l Bush wants.
* Li'l [[Karl Rove]], voiced by [[Kevin Federline]]. Once the most intelligent student at Beltway Elementary, he hates the Li'l Dems more than the Cronies due to their mocking of his rap styles, which only rhymes "Rove" and "trove." Lives in seclusion and eats nothing but [[Hot Pockets]]. If you require his advice, according to Li'l Rummy, "he takes over your brain for all eternity, or at least until he retires to spend more time with his kids". This is a reference to the reasons why real-life Karl Rove retired from the Bush Administration.
* The Ghosts of the [[Founding Fathers]], later revealed to be the Li'l Dems trying to scare the gang ''à la'' ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' - except for the headless ghost of George Washington, who tried to get his head back from Barbara Bush, then used a [[Quaker Oatmeal]] container instead. All horribly murdered by some unknown curse, they tried to teach the gang a lesson about destroying the Constitution.
* Li'l [[Fred Thompson]], voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; an actor in the drama club.
* Li'l [[Rudy Giuliani]], nickname is Julie, depicted as a cross dresser (in reference to the real Giuliani's guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in which he acted in drag), uses the number 9-11 often, and will do anything "to keep the terrorists from winning today."
* Li'l [[Mitt Romney]], tends to flip-flop and tries to convert people to [[Mormonism]].

* Li'l [[Ralph Nader]] and Li'l [[Ron Paul]], were also mentioned, but not seen; tried to buy the White House.

====Others====
* Li'l Laura ([[Laura Bush]]): the pudgy object of Li'l George's desire, she never speaks (though she has grunted a few times), and at one point goes to a [[fat camp]].
* Li'l [[Kim Jong-il]], voiced by Diane Hsu; The new student at Beltway Elementary, he antagonizes Li'l Bush, who refers to him as "Kitty", as Li'l Bush's mind processes his image as a cat. He expresses a desire to be a Hollywood-type filmmaker, even kidnapping [[Kevin Costner]] (voiced by [[Chris Parson]]) to star in his latest epic (see [[Shin Sang-ok]]). He also collects [[enriched uranium]] and is followed around by 2 large thugs named Tito and Gilligan
* Li'l [[Tony Blair]], voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]; an [[effeminate]] [[United Kingdom|British]] boy who is on the same [[cheerleading]] squad as Li'l George. The two become friends, much to the consternation of both boys' families (Tony's mother is portrayed as [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]]). Barbara Bush uses "being British" as a euphemism for [[homosexuality]], and she is alarmed at the possibility of Li'l George "applying for dual citizenship" and "driving on the wrong side of the road".
* [[Neil Bush]], voiced by [[Donick Cary]]; Li'l George's [[hippie]]/[[druggie]] older brother, who he refers to as both crazy and [[bisexual]] (because Neil once brought home two [[Thai people|Thai]] [[prostitutes]] and one of them was a [[transvestite]]). When Li'l George asks for help with scaring the school with hippies, Neil gives Li'l George a sheet of [[LSD]] blotter that looks like the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]] so he and his friends can find their inner hippie. In real life, Neil is George's younger brother by more than 10 years.
* Li'l [[Dave Grohl]], voiced by himself.
* Li'l [[Anthony Kiedis]], voiced by himself.
* Li'l [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], voiced by himself.

In one episode, the adult Wolf Blitzer actually appears on CNN.
* Raul, voiced by [[Alanna Ubach]]; a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] day laborer hired by Li'l George to do his chores for him. A chemical engineer in his native Mexico, Raul has come to America because he can make more money doing manual labor for hire than he can in his chosen profession back home. Li'l George treats him as a pet, and forgets to feed him as he did with all his other pets, eventually leading to his death.
* [[God]]dy, voiced by [[Jeff Tweedy]]. He is mistaken by Li'l George for a member of [[ZZ Top]].
* [[Satan]], voice by [[Frank Black]]. Welcomed Lil Cheney to hell after his fatal heart attack but sent him back after Cheney's methods of running hell became too extreme for him.

The '''Solomiya Krushelnytska Lviv State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet''' ({{lang-ua|Львівський Національний академічний театр опери та балету імені Соломії Крушельницької}}) or '''Lviv Opera''' ({{lang-ua|Львівська оперa}}, {{lang-pl|Opera Lwowska}}) is an [[opera house]] located in [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine|Ukraine's]] largest western city and one of its historic [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centers]]. Originally built on former [[marsh]]land of the submerged [[Poltva River]], the Lviv Opera now sits at the end of Freedom Avenue ({{lang-ua|Проспект Свободи}}), the tree-lined centerpiece of Lviv's [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic Old City]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] located in the city's [[Halytskyi District, Lviv|Halych district]].

According to the inscription in the [[Lobby (room)|theater lobby]], the building was constructed between 1897 and 1900, and has remained standing throughout several changes in history. Originally built when Lviv was the capital of the [[History of Galicia (Eastern Europe)#Galician autonomy|autonomous province of Galicia]] in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Lviv Opera ({{lang-de|Lemberger Oper}}) first stood at the end of [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria|Archduke Karl Ludwig]] Avenue, was later known as the Grand Theatre ({{lang-pl|Teatr Wielki}}) of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and during the time of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], entering patrons would pass by a towering statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. For four decades, the theater was known as the ''[[Ivan Franko]] Lviv State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet'', having been renamed in 1956 after the city's famous poet and political activist on the centenary of his birth. In 2000, the Lviv Opera celebrated its own [[centennial]] with another renaming, this time after one of the city's native daughters, [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], a renowned [[soprano]] of the early 20th century.

==History==
At the end of the 19th century, local leaders felt the need for a large city theatre to be situated in the capital of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] ({{lang-uk|Галичина}}, {{lang-pl|Galicja}}). In 1895, the city announced an [[architectural design competition]], which attracted a large number of submissions.&lt;ref name=Opera&gt;The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet official website. ''History: facts'' [http://www.lvivopera.org/contents/history/facts/index.en.html History of the building of the theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929062127/http://www.lvivopera.org/contents/history/facts/index.en.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the participants were the renowned Viennese architects [[Fellner &amp; Helmer]], whose entry was rejected as too international and eclectic.&lt;ref name="Ther"&gt;Philipp Ther. ''Center Stage: Operatic Culture and Nation Building in Nineteenth-Century Central Europe''. [[Purdue University Press]]. 2014. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Victor Hugo Lane. ''State culture and national identity in a multi-ethnic context: Lemberg 1772-1914''. [[University of Michigan]]. 1999. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

An independent jury chose the design by [[Zygmunt Gorgolewski]],&lt;ref name="Ther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewinski"&gt;{{pl icon}} Jakub Lewiński. ''Między tradycją, a nowoczesnością; Architektura Lwowa lat 1893-1918''. Neriton. 2005. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markian Prokopovych. ''Habsburg Lemberg: architecture, public space, and politics in the Galician capital, 1772-1914''. Purdue University Press. 2009. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of the [[Berlin]] [[Bauakademie|Building Academy]] and the director of city's [[Engineering education|Engineering Academy]]. Gorgolewski pleasantly surprised the jury by planning to locate the building in the center of the city, despite the area having been already densely built-up. In order to solve the space problem, he boldly proposed to enclose the [[Poltva River]] underground, and instead of using a traditional [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], utilized a [[Shallow foundation|reinforced concrete base]] for the first time in Europe.&lt;ref name=Opera/&gt;

In June 1897, the [[cornerstone]] was placed. Gorgolewski oversaw [[construction]], [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] and design, employing the leading [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]] from the city and beyond. Local materials were used wherever possible, however [[marble]] elements were manufactured in [[Vienna]], special linen for painting in the foyer was imported from [[Belgium]]. The [[Austria]]n company [[Siemens]] was ran the electrical wiring and lights, while the hydraulic mechanization of the stage was built by the [[Poland|Polish]] railway workshop company in [[Sanok]].&lt;ref name=Opera/&gt;

Construction continued for three years. Funding came from the city, the surrounding communities, and from voluntary donations. The cost of the works totaled 6 million [[Austrian crown]]s.&lt;ref name="Papee"&gt;{{cite book | author =[[Fryderyk Papée]] | coauthors = | title =Historia miasta Lwowa w zarysie (Concise history of the city of Lwów) | year =1924 | editor = | pages = | chapter =Lwów nowoczesny - Okres samorządowy | chapterurl =http://www.lwow.com.pl/historia/papee3.html#24 | publisher =Książnica Polska | location =Lwów-Warsaw | id = | url =http://www.lwow.com.pl/historia/papee3.html | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories remain that despite the engineering innovations used by Gorgolewski to construct the foundation of the building, it began to slowly sink because of the Poltva river running underneath it in a tunnel. Learning of the flaw, the architect took it to heart and fell into depression, and hung himself. This is not borne out by facts, as the engineer actually died of heart disease.&lt;ref name="Gorgolewski-pl"&gt;''[http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/gorgolewski.html Zygmunt Gorgolewski, twórca gmachu Lwowskiego Teatru Wielkiego]'' ("Zygmunt Gorgolewski, the creator of the building of the Lwów Grand Theatre"), by Piotr Marek Stański. (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; After some initial settling, the building ceased 'sinking' and remains stable to this day, owing to the innovative design of Gorgolewski.

===Grand opening===

The Lviv Opera opened on October 4, 1900. The cultural elite&amp;mdash;painters, writers, and composers, as well as delegations from various European theatres&amp;mdash;attended the opening festivities. Among the guests attending the ceremony were writer [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]], the painter [[Henryk Siemiradzki]],&lt;ref name="three"&gt;The three were considered the most renowned Polish artists{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} of the epoch&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief magistrate]] of Lviv [[Godzimir Małachowski]], the [[Voivode|provincial governor]] [[Leon Piniński]] and head of the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|provincial assembly]] [[Stanisław Marcin Badeni|Count Stanisław Badeni]]. A delegation from the city of [[Prague]] was headed by mayor Vladimir Srb and former director of the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], František Adolf Šubert. Due to recent deaths of both the [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Roman Catholic]] and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] [[archbishop]]s, the building was blessed by the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] archbishop of Lviv, Izaak Mikołaj Isakowicz, alongside [[rabbi]] Ezechiel Caro and the Protestant pastor Garfel.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The grand opening gala that evening included excerpts from: 
* The [[ballet]] ''Baśń nocy świętojańskiej'' (''Tale of the [[Kupala|Midsummer Night]]'') by [[Jan Kasprowicz]] and [[Seweryn Berson]]
* The [[opera]], ''Janek'' by [[Władysław Żeleński (musician)|Władysław Żeleński]], about the life of [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] mountain-dwellers, with an [[aria]] sung by the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[tenor]], Oleksandr Myshuha, for whom it was specially written.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[File:Lviv Opera House. Project by Gorgolewski 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gorgolewski's plan for the Lviv Opera.]]

The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet is built in the classical tradition with using forms and details of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture]], also known as the Viennese [[neo-Renaissance]] style. The [[stucco]] mouldings and oil paintings on the walls and ceilings of the multi-tiered auditorium and foyer give it a richly festive appearance. The Opera's imposing facade is opulently decorated with numerous niches, [[Corinthian columns]], pilasters, balustrades, cornices, statues, reliefs and stucco garlands. Standing in niches on either side of the main entrance are allegorical figures representing Comedy and Tragedy sculpted by [[Antoni Popiel]] and [[Tadeusz Baroncz]]; figures of [[muse]]s embellish the top of the [[cornice]]. The building is crowned by large bronze statues, symbolizing Glory, Poetry and Music.&lt;ref&gt;The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet, ''Lviv Best Portal'' [http://www.lvivbest.com/en/theaters/lviv-opera-and-ballet-theatre The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet architectural description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre, beautifully decorated inside and outside, became a centrefold of the achievements in sculpture and painting of Western Europe at the end of the 19th century. The internal decoration was prepared by some of the most renowned Polish artists of the time. Among them were [[Stanisław Wójcik]] (allegorical sculptures of Poetry, Music, Fame, Fortune, Comedy and Tragedy), [[Julian Markowski]], [[Tadeusz Wiśniowiecki]], [[Tadeusz Barącz]], [[Piotr Wojtowicz]] (relief depicting the [[coat of arms of Lviv]]), [[Juliusz Bełtowski]] (bas-relief of Gorgolewski) and [[Antoni Popiel]] (sculptures of Muses decorating the façade).

Among the painters to decorate the interior were [[Tadeusz Popiel]] (staircases), [[Stanisław Rejchan]] (main hall), [[Stanisław Dębicki]], [[Stanisław Kaczor-Batowski]] and [[Marceli Harasimowicz]] ([[foyer]]). The team supervised by the abovementioned artists included further painters, among them [[Aleksander Augustynowicz]], [[Ludwik Kohler]], [[Walery Kryciński]], [[Henryk Kuhn]], [[Edward Pietsch]], [[Zygmunt Rozwadowski]], [[Tadeusz Rybkowski]] and [[Julian Zuber]]. The main [[curtain]] was decorated by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]].

'''''Miami Animal Police''''' is an American [[documentary]] [[reality TV|reality]] [[television series]] that premiered on January 5, 2004 on [[Animal Planet]]. Produced by Lion Television, the program is set in [[Miami, Florida]] and the surrounding [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], an area of more than {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2|-3}}. It depicts the everyday duties of [[Miami-Dade Police Department]] Animal Services Unit, focusing on the work of twenty ACOs (animal control officers), five civilian animal cruelty investigators, six Miami-Dade Police Department administrators, and a pitbull investigator.

The show also highlights the work of various private companies that remove wild animals from places they shouldn't be, including escaped [[exotic pet]]s which can pose a hazard to native wildlife and/or local residents if left unchecked. The most frequently featured of these private contractors is Todd Hardwick of Pesky Critters Wildlife Control.

Kevin Hefner directs the show, which is the fourth of Animal Planet's top-rated shows and is part of an "[[umbrella rotation]]" of shows known collectively as "Animal Planet Heroes".

==Comparisons to ''Animal Cops: Miami''==
The Miami-Dade Animal Services Department is currently the only agency in the ''Animal Planet Heroes'' rotation that has been featured in two different shows. ''[[Animal Cops: Miami]]'', which premiered in 2010, also focuses on Miami-Dade Amimal Services. While many of the on air staff were involved in both shows, there are several fundamental differences. For example, two television series are produced by different production companies (''Animal Cops: Miami'' is produced by Anglia Television, which produced the majority of the shows in the ''Animal Planet Heroes'' rotation. ''Miami Animal Police'' was produced by Lion Television). In addition, ''Animal Cops: Miami'' includes segments focusing on the [[Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department]]'s Venom One unit. The main difference, however, is that production of ''Animal Cops: Miami'' occurred after the unit's 2005 separation from the Miami-Dade Police Department to become a stand-alone county department.

'''Andrew William''' "'''Nicky'''" '''Barr''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|OBE|MC|DFC1}} (10&amp;nbsp;December 1915&amp;nbsp;– 12&amp;nbsp;June 2006) was a member of the [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian national rugby union team]], who became a [[flying ace|fighter ace]] in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) during World War&amp;nbsp;II. He was credited with 12 aerial victories, all scored flying the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40]] fighter.  Born in New Zealand, Barr was raised in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia in the United Kingdom in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] in September 1941. The squadron's highest-scoring ace, he attained his first three victories in the P-40 Tomahawk and the remainder in the P-40 Kittyhawk.

Barr's achievements as a combat pilot earned him the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]]. Shortly after taking command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by [[Axis powers|Axis forces]], and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fugitives to safety, receiving for his efforts the [[Military Cross]], a rare honour for an RAAF pilot. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the [[Operation Overlord|invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]]. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the [[oilseed]] industry, for which he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1983. He died in 2006, aged 90.

==Early career==
Andrew Barr was born in [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]], New Zealand, on 10&amp;nbsp;December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in [[Melbourne]], Andrew attended [[Kew, Victoria|Kew Public School]] and played [[Australian rules football]]. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the [[Lord Somers Camp]] and Power House social and sporting organisations located at [[Western Port]]. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at [[Swinburne University of Technology|Swinburne Technical College]], but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing [[rugby union]] in 1935 through a friend in the Power House club. Weighing {{Convert|80|kg|lbs}} and just under {{Convert|6|ft|cm}} tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]] the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. The tour was cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2&amp;nbsp;September, due to the outbreak of World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name="AWM 023231"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/023231|title=Item 023231|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=26 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905132449/http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/023231|archivedate=5 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; Keen to serve as a [[fighter pilot]], Barr initially tried to enlist in the [[Royal Air Force]], but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Australia on the [[RMS Strathaird|RMS ''Strathaird'']], Barr joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as an air cadet on 4&amp;nbsp;March 1940.&lt;ref name="AWM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/people_1077820.asp|title= Wing Commander Andrew William Barr, MC, DFC &amp; bar|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Barr; Stokes 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  After undergoing instruction on [[Tiger Moth]]s at [[No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Elementary Flying Training School]], [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], and on [[Hawker Demon]]s and [[Avro Anson]]s at [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;1 Service Flying Training School]], [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], he was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] on 24&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dornan 10-12"&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a reputation as something of a rebel during training, and became forever known as "Nicky", for "[[Christian teaching about the Devil|Old Nick]]", or the Devil.&lt;ref name="AWM 023231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dornan 10-12"/&gt; In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;  By November 1940, he had been posted to [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron]], flying [[CAC Wirraway]]s on patrol off the [[Queensland]] coast.&lt;ref name="AWM 023231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt; The aircraft was, according to Barr, "our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes that we were going to encounter, left much to be desired".&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt; Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was grateful to have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary [[aide-de-camp]] to the Governor, [[Leslie Orme Wilson|Sir Leslie Wilson]], and also captained the RAAF rugby union team.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 24&amp;nbsp;March 1941.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;

==Combat service==
[[File:010233Tomahawk1941.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|left|RAAF P-40 Tomahawk in North Africa|alt=Underside of single-engined monoplane in flight, with twin machine guns on each wing]]
Barr was posted to [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] on 28&amp;nbsp;September 1941, to fly with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron]] under the command of Squadron Leader [[Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)|Peter Jeffrey]].&lt;ref name="Garrisson"&gt;Garrisson 1999, pp. 113–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He converted to [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40 Tomahawk]] fighters at an RAF [[Operational conversion unit|operational training unit]] in [[Khartoum]]. There he also received his "[[goolie chit]]", a piece of paper to be shown to local tribesmen in the event he was shot down, reading in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: "don't kill the bearer, feed him and protect him, take him to the English and you will be rewarded. Peace be upon you."&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to North Africa, Barr achieved his first aerial victory, over a [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;110]], on 12&amp;nbsp;December. He followed this up with a [[Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;88]] and a [[Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;109]] the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an [[Flying ace|ace]] on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju&amp;nbsp;87 ''Stukas'']].&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas 2005, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; On 8&amp;nbsp;March, he led a [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on [[Tobruk]] by twelve Ju&amp;nbsp;87s escorted by ten [[Macchi C.&amp;nbsp;202]]s and two Bf&amp;nbsp;109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju&amp;nbsp;87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070683--1-.pdf Herington 1954, pp. 223–224]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually credited with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron's highest-scoring member.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton 1996, pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AirForceNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4811/features/feature01.htm|title=Goodbye to Aussie great|work=[[Air Force (newspaper)|Air Force News]]|date=29 June 2006|accessdate=26 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212527/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4811/features/feature01.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew a total of eighty-four combat [[sortie]]s, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16&amp;nbsp;June 1942 alone.&lt;ref name="AirForceNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070683--1-.pdf Herington 1954, p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings "could be offset by unbridled aggression", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and "overcome much better opponents by simply going for them".&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; [[Bobby Gibbes]] became No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 1&amp;nbsp;April, Barr was raised to acting [[squadron leader]] and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken ankle.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his [[adjutant]] but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the next-of-kin of casualties himself.&lt;ref name="Interview"/&gt;

}}
Three times while serving with No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf&amp;nbsp;109 and a [[Fiat G.50]], he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick up a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was "jumped" by two other Bf&amp;nbsp;109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson 2005, pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight at it in an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by fragments of rock sent airborne by impact from cannon shells. A tribe of friendly [[Senussi]] Arabs found him, dressed his wounds, and helped him return to Allied lines.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 67–73&lt;/ref&gt; For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC), the full citation being published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 20&amp;nbsp;February 1942:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35463|page=844|date=20 February 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068966/RCDIG1068966--320-.JPG|format=PDF|title=Recommendation: Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This officer, who commenced operational flying in November, 1941, has displayed the greatest keenness and skill as a fighter pilot. In December, 1941, during a patrol over the Derna area, he shot down a Messerschmitt 110; the next day, in the same area, he destroyed a Messerschmitt 110 and a Junkers 88. One day in January, 1942, his squadron formed part of an escort to bomber aircraft operating over El Agheila. Enemy aircraft were encountered and, in the ensuing engagement, Flying Officer Barr attacked 2 Italian fighters, one of which he shot down. He then observed one of his fellow pilots, who had been shot down, waving to him from the ground but, when preparing to make a landing in an attempt to rescue him, Flying Officer Barr was attacked by 2 Messerschmitt 109s. Although the undercarriage of his aircraft was not fully retracted, he immediately manoeuvred to engage the attackers, only to find that his guns had jammed. Quickly rectifying the fault he delivered an accurate burst of fire which caused one of the Messerschmitts to disintegrate in the air. A further 2 enemy aircraft joined in the combat and Flying Officer Barr was wounded and forced down. While on the ground he was further wounded by the enemy's fire but, despite this, he made his way through the enemy's lines and rejoined our own forces some 3 days later. He brought back much valuable information regarding the disposition of enemy tanks and defences. Flying Officer Barr displayed the greatest courage and tenacity throughout. He has destroyed 8 enemy aircraft.}}

On 25&amp;nbsp;May 1942, Barr had to land in the desert when his engine overheated. Having just taken off the engine [[cowling]], he spotted enemy tanks approaching and immediately took off with the engine exposed to the elements, safely landing back at base.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt; He was shot down for the second time on 30&amp;nbsp;May,&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt; when he engaged eight Bf&amp;nbsp;109s and destroyed one before being hit and forced to crash land at high speed in no-man's land. He came down in a minefield during a fierce tank battle, and was forced to remain where he was as troops of both sides slowly converged on him; British forces managed to reach him first and, after treatment for wounds, he again returned to his squadron.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;June, however, after being attacked by two Bf&amp;nbsp;109s and bailing out of his burning Kittyhawk, he was captured by Italian soldiers and taken as a prisoner-of-war, first to [[Tobruk]], and then to Italy, where he received hospital treatment for serious wounds.&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He later learned that the pilot who shot him down was Oberleutnant [[Werner Schröer|Werner Schroer]], a [[Luftwaffe]] ace credited with sixty-one victories in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt; Bobby Gibbes, having recovered from his own injuries, again took command of No.&amp;nbsp;3 Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070683--1-.pdf Herington 1954, p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt; During his incarceration, on 5&amp;nbsp;February 1943, Barr was awarded a [[medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC for "destroying further enemy aircraft".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35891 |supp=y|page=653|date=2 February 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068966/RCDIG1068966--319-.JPG|format=PDF|title=Recommendation: Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court-martialled on a charge of murder, he only avoided a death sentence when the [[Swiss Red Cross]] colonel representing him located the official and proved that he had not died. Barr was instead sentenced to ninety days solitary confinement in Gavi Prison Camp, [[Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 163–171&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1943, with Italy on the verge of surrender, prisoners of war were rounded up for transport to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Barr jumped from a moving train bound for the [[Brenner Pass]] and joined a group of Italian partisans in [[Pontremoli]], remaining at large for two months before again being captured. Taken to a transit camp just over the Austrian border, Barr and fourteen other prisoners escaped by tunnelling under the barbed wire.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 196–204&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually he managed to link up with an Allied special operations unit, which was gathering intelligence behind enemy lines, sabotaging Axis infrastructure, and helping Allied prisoners and Italian refugees escape over the [[Apennine Mountains]] along the so-called "Alpine Route".&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; He was recaptured and escaped once more before finally making it through the Alpine crossing himself, leading a group of more than twenty. After reaching friendly lines in March 1944, he was sent to a military hospital in [[Vasto]], weighing only {{convert|55|kg|lb}} and in poor health, suffering [[malaria]], malnutrition, and blood poisoning.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 222–224, 231–239&lt;/ref&gt; The assistance he rendered to fellow Allied fugitives earned him the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for "Exceptional courage in organising escapes"; the award was [[gazette#Gazette as a verb|gazetted]] on 1&amp;nbsp;December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36820 |supp=y|page=5515|date=28 November 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/items/ACCNUM_LARGE/RCDIG1068966/RCDIG1068966--318-.JPG|format=PDF|title=Recommendation: Military Cross|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is thought to be one of only five or six RAAF pilots to receive the MC during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt;

Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at [[Omaha Beach]] two days after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] as part of an air support control unit. During the [[Operation Overlord|campaign in Normandy]], he flew rocket-armed [[Hawker Typhoon]]s on operations against [[V-1 flying bomb]] launch sites.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 247, 253–257&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Australia on 11&amp;nbsp;September, Barr was promoted to acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]] and appointed chief instructor at [[No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF|No.&amp;nbsp;2 Operational Training Unit]] in [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]], Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theatre]].&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 263–264&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No.&amp;nbsp;6 RAAF Hospital, [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]]. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;ref name="AWM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 267–268&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Air Force, Barr remained in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had met on a blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF.

On 15&amp;nbsp;April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve.&lt;ref name="Garrisson"/&gt; A member of the [[Royal Air Forces Escaping Society]], Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 275–276&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Barr became General Manager of Meggitt Ltd, an [[Vegetable fats and oils|oilseed-crushing]] firm; he eventually rose to become Executive Chairman. The firm's board was joined in 1971 by the recently retired [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Marshal [[Alister Murdoch|Sir Alister Murdoch]].&lt;ref name="Dornan"/&gt; Barr's work in the industry led to his appointment in the 1983 [[New Year Honours]] as an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE).&lt;ref name="AirForceNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49213 |supp=y|page=42|date=30 December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he became Australian representative and Chairman of the International Oil Seed Group.&lt;ref name="Dornan"/&gt; In June 1987, Barr accepted an invitation to join [[John Glenn]], [[Chuck Yeager]], and fifteen other famed flyers in a so-called "Gathering of Eagles" for a seminar at the USAF [[Air Command and Staff College]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Dornan 2005, pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt; Generally reluctant to talk publicly about the war, he agreed to discuss his experiences during an episode of the television series ''[[Australian Story]]'' in 2002, appearing with his biographer Peter Dornan, and Bobby Gibbes.

[[File:TonyRaines1999NASCARCraftsmanTruckSeriesTruck.jpg|thumb|A 1999 NASCAR Truck Series pickup truck]]

'''Pickup truck racing''' is a form of [[auto racing]] which involves modified versions of [[pickup truck]]s on [[List of motor racing tracks|racing circuits]], mostly [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]]. Race pickup trucks are mechanically similar to [[coupé]]-shaped [[Stock car racing|stock cars]], with the main difference being the more boxy shape of the cab, which does not give as good aerodynamics as stock cars.

[[NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series]] vehicles have been rapidly evolving since the inception of the series in 1995, in terms of speed, aerodynamics, and engine equipment. The NASCAR series was also the first to use this type of vehicle, unveiled in 1994.

[[File:Wilky team.jpg|thumb|Pete Wilkinson's #9 British Pickup Truck Racing truck (plus his #9 SCSA Stock Car) and team]]

==History==
The concept of pickup truck racing started in 1983 when former NASCAR driver [[Buck Baker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Creek|first=Lee|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19830617&amp;id=4McsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=phMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2479,516429&amp;hl=en|title=New sport unveiled: Pickup truck racing|newspaper=[[Star-News]]|date=June 17, 1983|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19830617&amp;id=IJEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4q0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5157,7733613|title=Baker: race results exceed expectations|newspaper=[[The Sumter Daily Item]]|date=June 17, 1983|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[National Pickup Truck Racing Association]] to help [[Buck Baker Driving School]] graduates start their careers. The series, which did not plan to have a points system, had a ten-race schedule planned with intentions to sell the series to NASCAR. The trucks were built with a [[1981 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] car base; the four-barrel Cup Series [[carburetor]]s were reduced to two to decrease speeds. The series began to increase in popularity, and the schedule was increased to eleven races. After the season ended, Baker's attempted sale of the series to NASCAR was denied, and was sold to [[Dick Moroso]], with the series being rebranded the [[Moroso Performance All-Pro Pickup Truck Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nickerson|first=Alex|url=http://racersreunion.com/the-original-truck-series/|title=The Original Truck Series|publisher=Racers Reunion|date=August 4, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[SCORE International]] racers [[Dick Landfield]], [[Jimmy Smith (racing driver)|Jimmy Smith]], [[Jim Venable]] and [[Frank "Scoop" Vessels]] unveiled plans to create a pickup truck series for NASCAR. Three years later, the trucks were unveiled at the [[1994 Daytona 500]], and officially created as the SuperTruck Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rockne|first=Dick|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950508&amp;slug=2119918|title=Trucks Pick Up Fans, Sponsors|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=May 8, 1995|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hosting seven exhibition races,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.roadandtrack.com/?section_id=21&amp;crashnet_id=23027 | title = Press Snoop: NASCAR Truck Series facts. | work = [[Road and Track]] magazine | accessdate = 2007-12-14 | date = February 25, 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011063234/http://www.roadandtrack.com/?section_id=21&amp;crashnet_id=23027 |archivedate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series held its first season in 1995.

Whether any particular prediction was ''correct'' is still a matter of debate, since they give different reasons and different time frames for the Soviet collapse.

Up to about 1980, the strength of the Soviet Union was widely overrated by critics and [[Historiography of the Cold War#Revisionism|revisionists]] alike.&lt;ref name="dream" /&gt;

In 1983, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Stephen F. Cohen|Stephen Cohen]] described the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet system]] as remarkably stable.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] also badly over-estimated the internal stability of the Soviet Union, and did not anticipate the speed of its collapse. Former DCI Stansfield Turner in 1991 wrote in the US Journal ''Foreign Affairs'', "We should not gloss over the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis . . . Yet I never heard a suggestion from the CIA, or the intelligence arms of the departments of Defense or State, that numerous Soviets recognized a growing, systemic economic problem."&lt;ref&gt;Cited on page 108 of {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a symposium launched to review [[Michel Garder]]'s French book: ''L'Agonie du Regime en Russie Sovietique'' (''The Death Struggle of the Regime in Soviet Russia''), which also predicted the collapse of the USSR,  [[Yale University|Yale]] Professor Frederick C. Barghoorn dismissed Garder's book as "the latest in a long line of apocalyptic predictions of the collapse of communism." He warns that "great revolutions are most infrequent and that successful [[political system]]s are tenacious and adaptive."  In addition, the reviewer of the book, Michael Tatu, disapproved of the "apocalyptic character" of such a forecast and is almost apologetic for treating it seriously.&lt;ref name="lyons"&gt;{{cite book

==Predictions of dissolution or collapse==
Analysts, organizations and politicians who predicted that the Soviet Union would one day cease to exist included:

===Ludwig von Mises===
The Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] argued in his 1921 book ''[[Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis]]'' that the Soviet system was unsustainable and would eventually collapse. This book was published months before Lenin implemented the [[New Economic Policy]] reintroducing partial [[private property]] in agriculture. Mises' analysis was based on the [[economic calculation problem]], a critique of central planning first outlined in 1920 journal articles. His argument was that the Soviet Union would find itself increasingly unable to set correct prices for the goods and services it produced:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We may admit that in its initial period a socialist regime could to some extent rely on the preceding age of capitalism [for the purpose of determining prices]. But what is to be done later, as conditions change more and more? Of what use could the prices of 1900 be for the director in 1949? And what use can the director in 1989 derive from knowledge of the prices of 1949?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Leon Trotsky===
One of the founders of the USSR, later expelled by [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Leon Trotsky]] devoted much of his time in exile to the question of the Soviet Union's future. In time, he came to believe that a new revolution was necessary to depose the [[nomenklatura]] and reinstate [[dictatorship of the proletariat|working class rule]] as the first step to [[socialism]]. In 1936 he made the following prediction:

{{quote|In order better to understand the character of the present Soviet Union, let us make two different hypotheses about its future. Let us assume first that the Soviet bureaucracy is overthrown by a revolutionary party having all the attributes of the old [[Bolshevism]], enriched moreover by the world experience of the recent period. Such a party would begin with the restoration of democracy in the [[trade unions]] and the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]. It would be able to, and would have to, restore [[Multi-party system|freedom of Soviet parties]]. Together with the masses, and at their head, it would carry out a ruthless purgation of the state apparatus. It would abolish [[Social class|ranks]] and [[Medal|decorations]], all kinds of privileges, and would limit inequality in the payment of labor to the life necessities of the economy and the state apparatus. It would give the youth free opportunity to think independently, learn, criticize and grow. It would introduce profound changes in the distribution of the national income in correspondence with the interests and will of the worker and peasant masses. But so far as concerns property relations, the new power would not have to resort to revolutionary measures. It would retain and further develop the experiment of [[planned economy]]. After the political revolution – that is, the deposing of the bureaucracy – the proletariat would have to introduce in the economy a series of very important reforms, but not another social revolution.

If – to adopt a second hypothesis – a bourgeois party were to overthrow the ruling Soviet caste, it would find no small number of ready servants among the present bureaucrats, administrators, technicians, directors, party secretaries and privileged upper circles in general. A purgation of the state apparatus would, of course, be necessary in this case too. But a bourgeois restoration would probably have to clean out fewer people than a revolutionary party. The chief task of the new power would be to restore [[private property]] in the means of production. First of all, it would be necessary to create conditions for the development of strong farmers from the weak [[collective farm]]s, and for converting the strong collectives into producers' [[cooperative]]s of the bourgeois type into agricultural [[Joint stock company|stock companies]]. In the sphere of industry, denationalization would begin with the light industries and those producing food. The planning principle would be converted for the transitional period into a series of compromises between state power and individual "corporations" – potential proprietors, that is, among the Soviet captains of industry, the émigré former proprietors and foreign capitalists. Notwithstanding that the Soviet bureaucracy has gone far toward preparing a bourgeois restoration, the new regime would have to introduce in the matter of forms of property and methods of industry not a reform, but a social revolution.

Let us assume to take a third variant – that neither a revolutionary nor a counterrevolutionary party seizes power. The bureaucracy continues at the head of the state. Even under these conditions social relations will not jell. We cannot count upon the bureaucracy's peacefully and voluntarily renouncing itself in behalf of socialist equality. If at the present time, notwithstanding the too obvious inconveniences of such an operation, it has considered it possible to introduce ranks and decorations, it must inevitably in future stages seek supports for itself in property relations. One may argue that the big bureaucrat cares little what are the prevailing forms of property, provided only they guarantee him the necessary income. This argument ignores not only the instability of the bureaucrat's own rights, but also the question of his descendants. The new cult of the family has not fallen out of the clouds. Privileges have only half their worth, if they cannot be transmitted to one's children. But the right of testament is inseparable from the [[right of property]]. It is not enough to be the director of a trust; it is necessary to be a [[stockholder]]. The victory of the bureaucracy in this decisive sphere would mean its conversion into a [[New class|new possessing class]]. On the other hand, the victory of the proletariat over the bureaucracy would insure a revival of the [[socialist revolution]]. The third variant consequently brings us back to the two first, with which, in the interests of clarity and simplicity, we set out.&lt;ref name="undeclared"&gt;{{cite book

===World War II===
In 1941 [[Adolf Hitler]] of [[Nazi Germany]] decided to attack the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]). In June 1941 the German [[Wehrmacht]] [[Eastern Front (World War II)|invaded the Soviet Union]], and the [[Red Army]] retreated.

Military observers around the world watched closely. It appears that most of them shared Hitler's opinion, expecting Germany to win, destroy the Soviet system, and establish its [[New Order (political system)|New Order]] in Europe.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Very few American experts thought the Soviet Union would survive.&lt;ref name="herring"&gt;{{cite book

''Fateful Choices: Ten Decisions That Changed The World 1940-1941'', p. 298. Penguin Books Ltd, London, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1941, the American general staff issued memoranda to the American press that a Soviet collapse was to be expected within several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Bahm, Karl (2001).

[[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Negative predictions had an important impact on President Roosevelt; while the United States was not at the time at war, he favored the Allies (Britain and the Soviet Union), and decided to try to avert the collapse of the USSR by supplying them with munitions through [[Lend-Lease]], and also to pressure [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] not to attack while the USSR was so vulnerable. The [[Red Army]] [[Battle of Moscow|held the line]] at the outskirts of [[Moscow]] and predictions changed to "uncertain."&lt;ref name="herring" /&gt;

===Early Cold War===

====George Orwell====
[[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', wrote in 1946 that "''the Russian regime will either democratize itself or it will perish''".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. "[[James Burnham and the Managerial Revolution]]." London: 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded by US historian [[Robert Conquest]] as one of the first people who made such a prediction. According to a Conquest article published in 1969, "In time, the Communist world is faced with a fundamental crisis. We can not say for certain that it will democratize itself. But every indication is that it will, as Orwell said, either democratize itself or perish...We must also, though, be prepared to cope with cataclysmic changes, for the death throes of the more backward apparatus may be destructive and dangerous".&lt;ref name="Dragons"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''The Dragons of Expectation. Reality and Delusion in the Course of History.'', W.W. Norton and Company (2004), {{ISBN|0-393-05933-2}}, page 217; citation from New York Times Magazine, August 18, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

====George Kennan====
American diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] proposed his famous [[containment]] theory in 1946–47, arguing that, if the Soviet Union were not allowed to expand, it would soon collapse.  In the [[X Article]] he wrote:
{{quote|[T]he main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies... Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world is something that can be constrained by the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and manoeuvres of Soviet policy.&lt;ref name="kennan-x"&gt;{{cite journal

The United States would have to undertake this containment alone and [[unilateralism|unilaterally]], but if it could do so without undermining its own economic health and political stability, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet party]] structure would undergo a period of immense strain eventually resulting in "either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power."&lt;ref name="kennan-x" /&gt;

Kennan later regretted the manner in which his theory was received and implemented, but it nevertheless became a core element of American strategy, which consisted of building a series of [[military alliance]]s around the USSR.&lt;ref name="kennan-m"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Winston Churchill====
[[Winston Churchill]] made repeated claims about the imminent fall of the Soviet Union throughout his political career. In January 1920, he denounced Bolshevism as a "rule of men who in their insane vanity and conceit believe they are entitled to give a government to a people which the people loathe and detest... The attempt to carry into practice those wild theories can only be attended with universal confusion, corruption, disorder and civil war." Later, he made a similar prediction in a journal article in 1931. After World War II, speaking about the recently established Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, he stated in 1954: "The forces of the human spirit and of national character alive in those countries cannot be speedily extinguished even by large-scale movements of populations and mass education of children." And in the epilogue to the one volume edition of his World War II memoirs, published in 1957, Churchill wrote: "The natural forces are working with greater freedom and greater opportunity to fertilize and vary the thoughts and the power of individual men and women. They are far bigger and more pliant in the vast structure of a mighty empire than could ever have been conceived by Marx in his hovel... Human society will grow in many forms not comprehended by a party machine."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Spencer. (1999) ''A Philosophy of International Politics in Churchill's "Iron Curtain" Speech Fifty Years Later'', University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zbigniew Brzezinski====
[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union on several occasions.  In a 2006 interview, Brzezinski stated that in his 1950 [[Master's degree|master's]] [[thesis]] (which has not been published) he argued that "the Soviet Union was pretending to be a [[Unitary state|single state]] but in fact it was a [[federation|multinational]] [[Soviet Empire|empire]] in the age of [[nationalism]]. So the Soviet Union would break up."&lt;ref name="zb-masters"&gt;{{cite web

 | publisher = People's Daily Online
 | accessdate = 2006-04-19
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an academic at [[Columbia University]], Brzezinski wrote [[Zbigniew Brzezinski#Bibliography|numerous books and articles]] that "took seriously the option of collapse", including ''Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics'' (1969) and ''Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era'' (1970).&lt;ref name="melberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Melberg |first=Hans O. |authorlink= |year=1996 |url=http://geocities.com/hmelberg/papers/960409.htm |title=Organic explanations |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2006-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027111054/http://geocities.com/hmelberg/papers/960409.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics'' contained fourteen articles dealing with the future of the Soviet Union. Six of them, by Brzezinski himself, [[Robert Conquest]], [[Merle Fainsod]], [[Eugene Lyons]], Giorgio Galli, and [[Isaac Don Levine]], considered "collapse as a serious possibility although not immediately." &lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in 1976 Brzezinski predicted that the [[politics of the Soviet Union]] would be practically unchanged for several more generations to come:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A central question, however, is whether such [[social change]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[modernization]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is capable of altering, or has in fact already altered in a significant fashion, the underlying character of Soviet politics. That character, as I have argued, has been shaped largely by political traditions derived from the specifics of [[History of Russia|Russian]] / [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet history]], and it is deeply embedded in the operational style and institutions of the existing Soviet system. The ability of that system to resist [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)#De-Stalinization and the Khrushchev era|de-Stalinization]] seems to indicate a considerable degree of resilience on the part of the dominant mode of politics in the Soviet context. It suggests, at the very least, that political changes are produced very slowly through social change, and that one must wait for at least several generations before social change begins to be significantly reflected in the political sphere.&lt;ref name="dynamics"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Soviet power]] throughout [[Eastern Europe]], Brzezinski published ''The Grand Failure: The Birth and Decay of Communism in the Twentieth Century''.  In that work he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Marxist-Leninism]] is an alien doctrine imposed on the region by an imperial power whose rule is culturally repugnant to the dominated peoples. As a result, a process of organic rejection of communism by Eastern European societies – a phenomenon similar to the [[Human anatomy|human body]]'s [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] of a [[Organ transplant|transplanted organ]] – is underway."&lt;ref name="failure"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brzezinski went on to claim that communism "failed to take into account the basic human craving for [[Individualism|individual]] [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]]."  He argued there were five possibilities for USSR:
# Successful pluralization,
# Protracted crisis,
# Renewed [[Brezhnev stagnation|stagnation]],
# [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|Coup]] ([[KGB]], [[Military of the Soviet Union|Military]]), and
# The explicit collapse of the [[Communist state|Communist regime]].
Option #5 in fact took place three years later, but at the time he wrote that collapse was "at this stage a much more remote possibility" than alternative #3: renewed stagnation. He also predicted chances of some form of communism existing in the Soviet Union in 2017 was a little more than 50%. Finally when the end did come in a few more decades, Brzezinski wrote, it would be "most likely turbulent."&lt;ref name="failure" /&gt;

====Ferenc Farkas de Kisbarnak====

[[Ferenc Farkas de Kisbarnak]], an exiled Hungarian general and leader of the [[Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations]] (ABN), predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union due to [[nationalist]] pressures. From June 12–14 of 1950, the Convention of the ABN was held in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] under the auspices of the Scottish League for European Freedom. At the conference, Farkas gave a speech entitled "The War Against Bolshevism and the Military Factors Represented by the Subjugated Nations" where he predicted the disintegration of the USSR along [[Demographics of the Soviet Union|ethnic lines]] which would eventually leave [[European Russia]] isolated. He predicted the eventual independence of [[Ukraine]], the [[Baltic states]], [[Turkestan]], the [[Idel-Ural]] republics, and [[Siberia]]. The third resolution of the ABN convention further called for "The destruction of Russian imperialism and the guarantee of world peace by splitting the USSR up and re-establishing on ethnic principles, the independent national states of all nations living under bolshevist oppression bearing among other things, in mind that whole national groups have been forcible [sic] deported and are awaiting the moment when they could return to their native land."&lt;ref&gt;[[National Library of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]].

Accessed 06 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles de Gaulle====
Only a handful of thinkers, ranging from French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] to the Soviet dissident [[Andrei Amalrik]], foretold the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union itself, and even they saw it as likely to happen as a result of [[Sino-Russian relations#Soviet Union, Republic of China, People's Republic of China|disastrous wars]] with [[People's Republic of China|China]] or pressures from the [[Islam in the Soviet Union|Islamic]] [[Republics of the Soviet Union#Sorted by region|Soviet states]] of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="fromkin"&gt;{{cite journal

On 23 November 1959, in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe: ''[[Charles de Gaulle#1958—1962: Founding of the Fifth Republic|Oui, c'est l'Europe, depuis l'Atlantique jusqu'à l'Oural, c'est toute l'Europe, qui décidera du destin du monde.]]'' ("Yes, it is Europe, from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]], it is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.")&lt;ref name="cdg-eau"&gt;{{cite web

In 1966, at the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]]' [[party conference]], Adenauer stated his hopes that some day the Soviets might allow the reunification of Germany. Some analysts say it might be considered a prediction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not given up hope. One day Soviet Russia will recognize that the division of Germany, and with it the division of Europe, is not to its advantage. We must be watchful for when the moment comes... we must not let it go unexploited.&lt;ref name="greenberg" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Whittaker Chambers====
In a posthumously published 1964 book entitled ''Cold Friday'', Communist [[Defection|defector]] [[Whittaker Chambers]] predicted an eventual Soviet collapse beginning with a "[[satellite state|satellite]] revolution" in Eastern Europe.  This revolution would then result in the transformation of the Soviet [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the book ''Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics'', which was a collection of authors edited by [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]] in his section, "Immobilism and decay", saw "the USSR as a country where the political system is radically and dangerously inappropriate to its social and economic dynamics. This is a formula for change - change which may be sudden and catastrophic."&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;

Conquest also predicted the fall in his book, ''The Nation Killers: The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities'' (1970).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====Sun Myung Moon====
[[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church]] repeatedly predicted that Communism was inherently flawed and would inevitably collapse sometime in the late 1980s. In a speech to followers in Paris in April 1972, he stated:

"Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the borderline and afterward communism will decline; in the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tparents.org/library/unification/talks/ward/ward%2D000000.htm |title=Endowed With A Sense Of History - Thomas J Ward |publisher=Tparents.org |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andrei Amalrik====
In 1969, prominent dissident [[Andrei Amalrik]] wrote in his book ''[[Andrei Amalrik#Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?|Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?]]'':

:There is another powerful factor which works against the chance of any kind of peaceful reconstruction and which is equally negative for all levels of society: this is the extreme isolation in which the regime has placed both society and itself. This isolation has not only separated the regime from society, and all sectors of society from each other, but also put the country in extreme isolation from the rest of the world. This isolation has created for all—from the bureaucratic elite to the lowest social levels—an almost surrealistic picture of the world and of their place in it. Yet the longer this state of affairs helps to perpetuate the status quo, the more rapid and decisive will be its collapse when confrontation with reality becomes inevitable.

Amalrik predicted the collapse of the regime would occur between 1980 and 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, Anne H. (September 1998). ''Killing Détente: The Right Attacks the CIA'', Pennsylvania State University Press. {{ISBN|0-271-01791-0}}&lt;br&gt;*[[Andrei Amalrik]], ''[[Andrei Amalrik#Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?|Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970), 33. {{ISBN|0-06-090732-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year in the title was  after the [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|novel of the same name]].

Soviet authorities were skeptical. [[Natan Sharansky]] explained that "in 1984 [[KGB]] officials, on coming to me in prison" when Amalrik's prediction was mentioned, "laughed at this prediction. Amalrik is long dead, they said, but we are still very much present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Daniel Patrick Moynihan====
[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] in a series of articles and interviews from 1975 onward discussed the possibility, indeed likelihood, of the breakup of the Soviet Empire. But Moynihan also expressed the view that [[liberal democracy]], too, faced an uncertain future.&lt;ref name="dream" /&gt; He argued in January 1975 that the Soviet Union was so weak economically, and so divided ethnically, that it could not long survive.  However he said it "might have considerable time left before ethnicity breaks it up." By 1984 he argued "the Soviet idea is spent.

In her 1978 book ''L'Empire éclaté'', [[historian]] (and later member of the [[Académie française]] and the [[European Parliament]]) [[Hélène Carrère d'Encausse]] predicted that the Soviet Union's political legitimacy would be fatally strained by diverging fertility between its culturally [[Russian people|Russian]]/[[Eastern European]] parts (dominant in government and industry but with plummeting birth rates) and its culturally [[Asia]]n and/or [[Muslim]] parts (with growing birth rates but little representation in the established "[[gerontocracy]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrère d'Encausse|first1=Hélène|title=L'Empire éclaté : la révolte des nations en URSS|date=1978|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=2-08-064090-9|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Empire éclaté'' generated substantial media interest at the time, winning the 1978 [[:fr:Prix Aujourd'hui|Prix Aujourd′hui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le prix Aujourd'hui à Hélène Carrère d'Encausse pour ''L'Empire éclaté''|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1978/11/08/le-prix-aujourd-hui-a-helene-carrere-d-encausse-pour-l-empire-eclate_2997033_1819218.html|website=lemonde.fr|date=8 November 1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various essays published in [[samizdat]] in the early 1970s were on similar lines, some quite specifically predicting the end of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="dream" /&gt;&lt;ref name="samizdat"&gt;S. Zorin and N. Alekseev, Vremya ne zhdet (Frankfurt, 1970); Alexander Petrov-Agatov (manuscript), excerpts in Cornelia Gerstenmaier, Die Stimme der Stummen (Stuttgart, 1971), 156-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hillel Ticktin/''Critique''====
In 1973 the Marxist, [[Hillel H. Ticktin]], wrote that the Soviet "system is sinking deeper into crisis".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/search?query=ticktin+ussr Hillel Ticktin, 'Towards a Political Economy of the USSR'], ''Critique'' No.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 he entitled an article: "The USSR: the Beginning of the End?".&lt;ref&gt;Hillel Ticktin, ''Critique'' No.7, p88.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 he predicted that the [[Soviet Union]] would "break asunder and develop either to capitalism or to socialism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/54949537/Class-Structure-of-the-USSR-and-the-Elite-by-Hillel-Ticktin Hillel Ticktin, 'The Class Structure of the USSR and the Elite'], ''Critique'' No.9, p61.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 1983 he wrote that "the system is drawing to a close".&lt;ref&gt;Hillel Ticktin, ''Critique'' No.16, p121.&lt;/ref&gt;  (For a summary of Ticktin's approach, see Wikipedia's [[Stalinism]] entry.)

====Raymond Aron====
[[David Fromkin]] wrote of [[Raymond Aron]]'s prediction,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of only one person who came close to getting it right: Raymond Aron, the French philosopher and [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]]. In a talk on the Soviet threat that I heard him give in the 1980s at the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] in [[London]], he reminded the audience of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s observation in ''[[The Prince]]'' that 'all armed prophets have conquered and all unarmed ones failed.' But what happens, Aron asked, if the prophet, having conquered and then ruled by force of arms, loses faith in his own prophecy? In the answer to that question, Aron suggested, lay the key to understanding the future of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ravi Batra====
The economist [[Ravi Batra]] predicted the collapse of the USSR in his 1978 book ''[[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism]]''.

====Randall Collins====
In 1980 the sociologist [[Randall Collins]] presented his paper "The future decline of the Russian empire" at the [[University of South Florida]] and at [[Columbia University]] and published his predictions in the book "Weberian sociological theory" (1986).

====Robert M. Cutler====

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that concluded that the following events were likely: (1) that in the generational turnover of elites after Brezhnev died (which began when he died in 1982), the Soviet regime would seek to increase public participation (which began in 1985 via [[glasnost]], after 2 more top gerontocrats had died); (2) that the Communist Party's rule would be challenged in Central Asia (which occurred in the 1986 rioting in Kazakhstan before the Baltic republics erupted); and (3) that Party leaders at the local level would go their own way if the Party did not give them a reason to remain loyal to the Moscow center (which occurred in all republics in the late 1980s, but most dramatically when the new RCP and RSFSR sapped some of the power of the CPSU and USSR in 1990-1991).

====James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg====
[[James Dale Davidson]] and [[William Rees-Mogg]] predicted the collapse of the Soviet
Union in their book [[The Great Reckoning]] in the early 1980s.

====Robert Gates====
[[Stewart Brand]] said when introducing the work of [[Philip Tetlock]] that Brand's partner had given a talk in the 1980s to top [[Central Intelligence Agency]] people about the future of the Soviet Union. One scenario he raised was that the Soviet bloc might break up; a sign of this happening would be the rise of unknown Mikhail Gorbachev through the party ranks. A CIA analyst said that the presentation was fine, but there was no way the Soviet Union was going to break up in his lifetime or his children's lifetime. The analyst's name was [[Robert Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/13/brain-food-political-forecasting Guardian newspaper, article on political and economic forecasting, 13 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in hearings before the U.S. Senate on March 19, 1986, when Gates (then head of the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence) was asked "what kind of work the Intelligence Community was doing to prepare policymakers for the consequences of change in the Soviet Union," he responded: "Quite frankly, without any hint that such fundamental change is going on, my resources do not permit me the luxury of sort of just idly speculating on what a different kind of Soviet Union might look like."&lt;ref&gt;Cited on page 114 of {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anatoliy Golitsyn====
In 1984, [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], an important KGB defector published the book ''New Lies For Old'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premier1.net/~barkonwd/golitsyn.htm Anatoly Golitsyn, ''New Lies for Old'']&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he predicted the collapse of the communist bloc orchestrated from above.

He claimed this collapse was part of a long-term [[deception]] strategy designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, abolish all containment policies, and in time finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the [[United States]].

Among other things, Golitsyn stated:
* "The 'liberalization' [in the Soviet Union] would be spectacular and impressive. Formal pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's role; its monopoly would be apparently curtailed."
* "If [liberalization] should be extended to [[East Germany]], demolition of the [[Berlin Wall]] might even be contemplated."
* "The [[European Parliament]] might become an all-European socialist parliament with representation from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 'Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals' would turn out to be a neutral, socialist Europe."

Collaborating opinions can be found in an archive of classified documents collected by [[Vladimir Bukovsky]], a defector also.&lt;ref&gt;Bukovsky, Vladimir, Judgement in Moscow, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====John le Carré====

[[John le Carré]] is a writer of fiction, but his "spy novels" are known for their keen insights on East-West relations in general and conflicts between Western and Soviet intelligence services in particular.  In ''[[The Russia House]]'', published on May 22, 1989, there is the telling quote: "The Soviet Knight is dying inside his armour."

====Werner Obst====
In 1985 German economist [[Werner Obst]] published a book entitled ''Der Rote Stern verglüht. Moskaus Abstieg - Deutschlands Chance'' (The Red Star is Dying Away. Moscow's Decline - Germany's Chance), Munich: Wirtschaftsverlag Langen-Müller/Herbig, third edition in 1987, in which he predicted the collapse of the [[Soviet bloc]] and the reunification of [[Germany]] within the immediate future for about 1990,  based on the analysis of economical statistics and trends.

====Ronald Reagan====
[[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], throughout his 1980 election campaign and first term in office presented a public view that the Soviet Union had been growing in power relative to the United States. In 1981 he stated that "the Soviet Union has been engaged in the greatest military buildup in the history of man."&lt;ref&gt;Beth A. Fischer ''The Reagan Reversal: Foreign Policy and the End of the Cold War.'' University of Missouri Press, 2000 pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year stated that "on balance the Soviet Union does have a definite margin of superiority" compared to the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;Beth A. Fischer ''The Reagan Reversal: Foreign Policy and the End of the Cold War.'' University of Missouri Press, 2000 pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reagan administration used a perceived strength of the Soviet Union to justify a significant expansion of military spending according to David Arbel and Ran Edelist.  In their study ''Western Intelligence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union'' they argue it was this position by the Reagan administration that prevented the American intelligence agencies from predicting the demise of the USSR. Arbel and Edelist further argued that CIA analysts were encouraged to present any information exaggerating the Soviet threat and justifying the military buildup, while contrary evidence of Soviet weakness was ignored and those presenting it sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;David Arbel and Ran Edelist ''Western Intelligence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 1980-1990'' Routledge, 2003 pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Reagan expressed a long range view that the Soviet Union could eventually be defeated. On March 3, 1983, President Reagan told the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]: "I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last — last pages even now are being written."&lt;ref name="evilempire"&gt;{{cite web

In his June 1982 address to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for [[self-governance|self-rule]] – [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|1953 in East Germany]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 in Hungary]], [[Prague Spring|1968 in Czechoslovakia]], [[1981 warning strike in Poland|1981 in Poland]]. But the struggle continues in Poland. And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the [[ash heap of history]] as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen [[NATO]] even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in [[Strategic bomber|strategic]] [[ballistic missile]] [[warhead]]s.&lt;ref name="reagan-brit"&gt;{{cite web

Analyst Jeffrey W. Knopf has argued that Reagan went beyond everyone else:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reagan stands out in part because he believed the Soviet Union could be defeated. For most of the Cold War, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administrations alike had assumed the Soviet Union would prove durable for the foreseeable future. The bipartisan policy of containment aimed to keep the Soviet Union in check while trying to avoid [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]; it did not seek to force the dissolution of the Soviet empire. Ronald Reagan, in contrast, believed that the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]] was so weak that increased pressure could bring the Soviet Union to the brink of failure. He therefore periodically expressed confidence that the forces of democracy 'will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history'.&lt;ref name="knopf" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====P.R. Sarkar====
The leader of the Ananda Marga cult in West Bengal, [[P.R. Sarkar]], predicted in the 1980s that Soviet Communism would fall with "a few blows from the hammer". He cited "inner and external stasis" as major weaknesses of communism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Why were Sovietologists wrong?==
According to Kevin Brennan:

{{quote|[[Kremlinology|Sovietology]] failed because it operated in an environment that encouraged failure. Sovietologists of all political stripes were given strong incentives to ignore certain facts and focus their interest in other areas. I don't mean to suggest that there was a giant conspiracy at work; there wasn't. It was just that there were no careers to be had in questioning the conventional wisdom...

..There were other kinds of institutional biases as well, such as those that led to the...|[[Team B]]" Report."&lt;ref name="kevin"&gt;{{cite web

[[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[György Bence]] write:

{{quote|Given these judgments of the Soviet future made by political leaders and journalists, the question is why were they right and so many of our Sovietological colleagues wrong. The answer again in part must be ideological. Reagan and Levin came from rightist backgrounds, and Moynihan, much like the leaders of the [[AFL-CIO]], from a [[left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] milieu, environments that disposed participants to believe the worst. Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work. They were also for the most part ignorant of, or ignored, the basic [[Marxism|Marxist]] formulation that it is impossible to build socialism in impoverished societies.

Brzezinski's 1969 collection, ''Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics'' demonstrates this point, of "the fourteen contributors...Two-thirds (four out of six) of those who foresaw a serious possibility of breakdown were, like [[Bernard Levin|Levin]] and [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Moynihan]], nonacademics. Three quarters (six out of eight) of those who could not look beyond system continuity were scholars.&lt;ref name="b" /&gt;}}

[[Richard Pipes]] took a slightly different view, situating the failure of the Sovietological profession in the larger context of the failures of Social Science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems likely that ultimately the reason for the failure of professionals to understand the Soviet predicament lay in their indifference to the human factor. In the desire to emulate the successes of the natural scientists, whose judgments are "value free," politology (sic) and sociology have been progressively dehumanized, constructing model and relying on statistics (many of them falsified) and, in the process, losing contact with the subject of their inquiries—the messy, contradictory, unpredictable homo sapiens.&lt;ref&gt;Cited on pages 125 and 126  of {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">'''Radyo an Gernewegva''' (abbreviated as RanG; meaning in English 'radio of the Cornish-speaking area') is a radio service broadcasting through the medium of the [[Cornish language]] both online, via [[podcast]], and on several [[community radio]] stations in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is a [[not-for-profit organisation]], and receives some funding through the [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. It is produced by [[KernowPods]].&lt;ref name="Celtic Media Festival: Radio Station of the Year"&gt;{{cite web|title=Celtic Media Festival: Radio Station of the Year|url=http://www.celticmediafestival.co.uk/winner/409|publisher=Celtic Media Festival|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The service began in 2007 as 'Nowodhow an Seythun' (News of the Week). This was a short 4 minute podcast, distributed each week through a collection of Cornish cultural websites. This service was increased to half an hour each week in 2008, and adopted the new name "Radyo an Gernewegva". The format changed at this point to become a magazine programme, incorporating music, discussion and news. In 2010, Radyo an Gernewegva incorporated the original 'Nowodhow an Seythun' back into the service. In 2013 it was shortlisted for Radio Station of the Year at the [[Celtic Media Festival]].&lt;ref name="Celtic Media Festival: Radio Station of the Year"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/news-by-industry/creative-industries-in-cornwall/kernowpods-up-for-award-123 |title=Cornish language podcast shortlisted for Celtic Media Festival |publisher=Business Cornwall |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year a [[crowdfunding]] campaign was launched to raise funds for a new website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Cornish-language-station-seeks-pound-5k/story-19755002-detail/story.html#axzz2ifZ9cye8 |title=Cornish language station seeks £5k in crowdfunding for website &amp;#124; West Briton |publisher=Thisiscornwall.co.uk |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/latest-news/crowd-funding-for-new-website-123 |title=Cornish language podcast turns to crowd funding for new website |publisher=Business Cornwall |date=2013-08-09 |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was successful, raising over £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=855 |accessdate=October 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192712/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=855 |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to Radyo an Gernewegva is recommended as an aid to learning the [[Cornish language]] by the ''Say Something in Cornish'' course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://site.saysomethingin.com/communities/cornish-for-english-speakers/courses/course-1-kwen |title=SaySomethingIn |publisher=Site.saysomethingin.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts more than 500 listeners every week.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2014 the service began to be broadcast by several [[community radio]] stations in Cornwall. [[Radio St Austell Bay]] broadcasts it every Sunday, at midday, [[Source fm]] ([[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]]) broadcasts the same programme every Tuesday at 1pm,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Hub Radio [[Roseland, Cornwall]] broadcasts it every Saturday at 6am and [[Coast FM (West Cornwall)|Coast FM]] [[Penwith, Cornwall]] plays the programme 3 times a week.

The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam.

''R. sondaicus annamiticus'' once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific name ''R.s. annamiticus'' is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, which was part of its range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of [[seasonal tropical forest]] of [[Cat Tien National Park]] in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="IUCN2008" &gt;van Strien, N.J., Steinmetz, R., Manullang, B., Sectionov, Han, K.H., Isnan, W., Rookmaaker, K., Sumardja, E., Khan, M.K.M. &amp; Ellis, S. 2008.

[[File:Javan Rhino Zimmerman.jpg|thumb|left|A painting from 1861 depicts the hunting of ''R. s. sondaicus'']]

As with many other species, the two main factors in the decline of the Javan rhinoceros populations has been loss of habitat combined with over-hunting.  Poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Because the rhinoceros' final range encompassed an area of human poverty, it was difficult to convince local people not to kill an animal which could be sold for an enormous sum of money.&lt;ref name="Biotropica"&gt;

'''''Saint Joan''''' is a play by [[George Bernard Shaw]] about 15th century French military figure [[Joan of Arc]]. Premiering in 1923, three years after her [[Canonization of Joan of Arc|canonization]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her [[Trial of Joan of Arc|trial]].  Shaw studied the transcripts and decided that the concerned people acted in good faith according to their beliefs.  He wrote in his [[preface]] to the play:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Michael Holroyd]] has characterised the play as "a tragedy without villains" and also as Shaw's "only tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/14/theatre.stage | title=A tragedy without villains | work=The Guardian | authorlink = Michael Holroyd | last = Holroyd | first = Michael | date=14 July 2007 | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Fielden has discussed further the appropriateness of characterising ''Saint Joan'' as a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fielden | first=John | title=Shaw's ''Saint Joan'' as Tragedy | journal=Twentieth-Century Literature | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=59–67 | date=July 1957 | doi=10.2307/441003 | publisher=Hofstra University | jstor=441003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text of the published play includes a long Preface by Shaw.

==Plot==
Shaw characterised ''Saint Joan'' as "A Chronicle Play in 6 Scenes and an Epilogue ". Joan, a simple peasant girl, claims to experience visions of [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]], and the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], which she says were sent by God to guide her conduct.

Scene 1 (23 February 1429): Robert de Baudricourt complains about the inability of [[Poultry|the hens]] on his [[farm]] to produce [[Egg as food|eggs]]. Joan claims that her voices are telling her to lift the siege of [[Orléans]], and to allow her several of his men for this purpose. Joan also says that she will crown the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] in [[Reims Cathedral]]. De Baudricourt ridicules Joan, but his Steward feels inspired by her words. De Baudricourt eventually begins to feel the same sense of inspiration, and gives his consent to Joan. The Steward enters at the end of the scene to exclaim that the hens have begun to lay eggs again. De Baudricourt interprets this as a sign from God of Joan's divine inspiration.

Scene 2 (8 March 1429): Joan talks her way into being received at the court of the weak and vain Dauphin. There, she tells him that her voices have commanded her to help him become a true king by rallying his troops to drive out the English occupiers and restore France to greatness. Joan succeeds in doing this through her excellent powers of flattery, negotiation, leadership, and skill on the battlefield.

Scene 3 (29 April 1429): Dunois and his page are waiting for the wind to turn so that he and his forces can lay [[Siege of Orleans|siege to Orléans]]. Joan and Dunois commiserate, and Dunois attempts to explain to her more pragmatic realities of an attack, without the wind at their back. Her replies eventually inspire Dunois to rally the forces, and at the scene's end, the wind turns in their favour.

Scene 4 (June 1429): Warwick and de Stogumber discuss Joan's stunning series of victories. Joined by the Bishop of Beauvais, they are at a loss to explain her success. De Stogumber decides Joan is a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. Beauvais sees Joan as a threat to the Church, as she claims to receive instructions from God directly. He fears she wants to instill [[Nationalism|national pride]] in the people, which would undermine the Church's universal rule. Warwick thinks she wants to create a system in which the [[king]] is responsible to God only, ultimately stripping him and other [[Feudalism|feudal lords]] of their power. All agree that she must die.

Scene 5 (17 July 1429): the Dauphin is [[Coronation of the French monarch|crowned]] Charles VII at [[Reims Cathedral]]. A perplexed Joan asks Dunois why she is so unpopular at [[Court (royal)|court]]. He explains that she has exposed [[Very important person|very important people]] as incompetent and irrelevant. She talks to him, Bluebeard, and La Hire about returning [[Domrémy-la-Pucelle|home]]. Charles, who complains about the weight of his coronation robes and smell of the [[Chrism|holy oil]], is pleased to hear this. She then says to Dunois "Before I go home, let's take Paris", an idea which horrifies Charles, who wants to negotiate [[Peace treaty|a peace]] immediately. The Archbishop berates her for her "sin of pride". Dunois warns her that if she is captured on a [[Military campaign|campaign]] he deems foolhardy, no one will [[ransom]] or rescue her. Now realizing that she is "alone on earth", Joan declares that she will gain the strength to do what she must from the people and from God. She leaves, leaving the men dumbfounded.

Scene 6 (30 May 1431): deals with her trial. De Stogumber is adamant that she be executed at once. The Inquisitor, the Bishop of Beauvais, and the Church officials on both sides of the trial have a long discussion on the nature of her [[heresy]]. Joan is brought to the court, and continues to assert that her voices speak to her directly from God and that she has no need of the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|Church's officials]]. This outrages de Stogumber. She acquiesces to the pressure of torture at the hands of her oppressors, and agrees to sign a confession relinquishing the truth behind her voices. When she learns she will be imprisoned for life without hope of parole, she renounces her confession:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Joan: "You think that life is nothing but not being dead? It is not the bread and water I fear. I can live on bread. It is no hardship to drink water if the water be clean. But to shut me from the light of the sky and the sight of the fields and flowers; to chain my feet so that I can never again climb the hills. To make me breathe foul damp darkness, without these things I cannot live. And by your wanting to take them away from me, or from any human creature, I know that your council is of the devil."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joan accepts [[Death by burning|death at the stake]] as preferable to such an imprisoned existence. De Stogumber vehemently demands that Joan then be taken to the stake for immediate execution. The Inquisitor and the Bishop of Beauvais [[Excommunication|excommunicate]] her and deliver her into the hands of the English. The Inquisitor asserts that Joan was fundamentally innocent, in the sense that she was sincere and had no understanding of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|church and the law]]. De Stogumber re-enters, screaming and severely shaken emotionally after seeing Joan die in the flames, the first time that he has witnessed such a death, and realising that he has not understood what it means to burn a person until he has actually seen it happen. A soldier had given Joan two sticks tied together in a cross before the moment of her death. Bishop Martin Ladvenu also reports that when he approached with a [[crucifix]] to let her see it before she died, and he approached too close to the flames, she warned him of the danger from the stake, which convinced him that she could not have been under the inspiration of [[Devil in Christianity|the devil]].

Epilogue: 25 years after Joan's execution, a [[Retrial of Joan of Arc|retrial]] has cleared her of heresy. Brother Martin brings the news to Charles VII. Charles then has a dream in which Joan appears to him. She begins conversing cheerfully not only with Charles, but with her old enemies, who also materialise in the King's bedroom. An emissary from the present day (the 1920s) brings news that the Catholic Church is to [[Canonization|canonise her]]. Joan says that saints can work miracles, and asks if she can be resurrected. At this, all the characters desert her one by one, asserting that the world is not prepared to receive a saint such as her. The last to leave is the English soldier, who is about to engage in a conversation with Joan before he is summoned back to [[Hell]] at the end of his 24-hour respite. The play ends with Joan ultimately despairing that mankind will never accept its [[saint]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;O God that madest this beautiful earth, when will it be ready to accept thy saints? How long, O Lord, how long?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

One historian at the time (1925) reacted to the play by arguing that it was highly inaccurate, especially in its depiction of medieval society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = J. M. | last = Robertson | title = Mr. Shaw and "The Maid" | location =London | publisher = Cobdon-Sanderson | date = 1926 | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Shaw states that the characterization of Joan by most writers is "romanticized" to make her accusers come off as completely unscrupulous and villainous.&lt;ref name=preface&gt;Preface to the play&lt;/ref&gt;

More general interpretation of Joan's character is to describe her as a rebel against general institutional authority, such as that of the Catholic Church and to the feudal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jul/12/theatre2 | title=Saint Joan: Olivier Theatre, London | work=The Guardian | last = Billington | first = Michael | date=12 July 2007 | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary comments have noted her particularly strong form of religious belief and how it borders on religious fanaticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jul/03/theatre | title=The shock of the old | work=The Guardian | last = Gardner | first = Lyn | date=3 July 2007 | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Stafford discussed Shaw's use of imagery related to birds in the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stafford | first=Tony J. | title=From Hens' Eggs to Cinders: Avian Imagery in Shaw's ''Saint Joan'' | journal=Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature | volume=40 | issue=4 | pages=213–220 | year=1986 | doi=10.2307/1566575 | publisher=Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association | jstor=1566575}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frederick Boas has compared the different treatments of Joan in dramas by [[Henry VI, Part I|Shakespeare]], [[The Maid of Orleans (play)|Schiller]], and Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Boas | first=Frederick S. | title=Joan of Arc in Shakespeare, Schiller, and Shaw | journal=Shakespeare Quarterly | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=35–45 | date=January 1951 | doi=10.2307/2866725 | publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library | jstor=2866725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]], discussing the play after its premiere in London in 1924, wrote that although ''Saint Joan'' was not the masterpiece that some claimed it to be, the play "seems to illustrate Mr. Shaw's mind more clearly than anything he has written before." And although he credited Shaw with providing an "intellectual stimulant" and "dramatic delight", he took issue with his portrayal of the heroine: "his Joan of Arc is perhaps the greatest sacrilege of all Joans: for instead of the saint or the strumpet of the legends to which he objects, he has turned her into a great middle-class reformer, and her place is a little higher than [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Mrs. Pankhurst]]" (the militant leader of the British [[suffragette]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = T.

==Productions==
Shaw's personal reputation following the [[World War I|Great War]] was at a low ebb, and it is thought that he wanted to first test the play away from Britain. The play received its premiere on 28 December 1923 at the [[Garrick Theatre (New York City)|Garrick Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by the [[Theatre Guild]] with [[Winifred Lenihan]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Twentieth-century English history plays: from Shaw to Bond|last=Harben|first=Niloufer|page=31|isbn=0-389-20734-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The London première, which opened on 26 March 1924 at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]], was produced by [[Lewis Casson]] and [[star]]red Shaw's friend [[Sybil Thorndike]], the actress for whom he had written the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn3290514 |work = Digital Collections – Pictures | last = Guttenberg | first = Percy | title = Portrait of Sybil Thorndike as St. Joan in George Bernard Shaw's St. Joan |format = picture | publisher = [[National Library of Australia]] |date=c. 1924 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Costumes and sets were designed by [[Charles Ricketts]], and the play had an extensive musical score, specially composed and conducted by [[John Foulds]].

Caught between the forces of the Church and the Law, Joan is the personification of the tragic heroine and the part is considered by actresses (see below) to be one of the most challenging of roles to interpret.  It is usually played by very experienced actresses who are much older than the age of the character, a teenager.  For a film version, Joan was exceptionally played by [[Jean Seberg]], who was 19.

{{Handel operas}}
'''''Silla''''' (full title ''Lucio Cornelio Silla'', [[Händel-Werke-Verzeichnis|HWV]] 10) is an [[opera seria]] (referred to as a ''[[dramma per musica]]'') in three acts by [[George Frideric Handel]]. The Italian-language [[libretto]] was by [[Giacomo Rossi]]. The story concerns the Roman dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] (138–78 BC) as recounted by [[Plutarch]].

The opera appears to have been a ''pièce d'occasion'', which may have been performed only once. The music was recycled in Handel's later opera ''[[Amadigi di Gaula]]''.

==Performance history==
The first performance might have been on 2 June 1713. A dedication from the librettist, Rossi, to the French ambassador, the Duc d'Aumont, appears with that date in a printed copy of the libretto.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Sulla, called "Silla" in the opera.]]

===Act 1===
*Scene: Rome,at the time of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], about 81 B.C.

The military leader Silla returns victorious to Rome, having subdued both rebellious foreign populations and his own personal enemy, Mario (the historical [[Gaius Marius]]) and his army. Silla passes through a specially constructed triumphal arch as trumpets sound and the populace acclaim him. When Silla announces that he is proclaiming himself dictator and sole law-giver for Rome, however, both his wife Metella and the [[tribune]] Lepido are appalled.

Flavia, Lepido's wife, tells him of bad dreams she has been having about dangers to Rome but Lepido dismisses this as superstition.

Celia, daughter of a high-ranking statesman who also opposed Silla's enemy Mario, is in love with the senator Claudio and he with her but she cannot bring herself to accept him as he is a supporter of Mario.

Claudio confronts Silla and accuses him of destroying Roman liberty. Silla is furious and refuses to hear it, but, left alone, Claudio vows to continue to struggle against tyranny.

===Act 2===
Silla is discovered by his wife Metella attempting to seduce the lovely Celia. Metella puts a stop to this, for the moment.

Silla next attempts the virtue of Lepido's wife Flavia, at her home. Lepido discovers him and intervenes, whereupon Silla accuses Lepido of conspiring with others to overthrow him and orders both Lepido and his wife to be imprisoned, awaiting execution. Husband and wife tearfully bid farewell.

Celia has overcome her scruples about accepting a supporter of her father's enemy, Mario, and has admitted she loves Claudio. The couple are basking in their happiness when Claudio is placed under arrest for conspiring against Silla and also sentenced to death. Metella learns of her husband's cruel and tyrannical orders from her servant Scabro and vows to prevent them from being carried out.

In the tower where he is imprisoned, Claudio can see the arena where he has been condemned to be torn apart by wild beasts and says farewell to life.

Metella takes a garment she has soaked with animal blood and tells her servant Scabro to take it to Silla and tell him it is Lepido's, shed when he was executed. Silla is pleased but still wants to see Claudio torn by beasts. News is brought to Silla that the supporters of Mario are staging a new rebellion and Silla rushes off to quell it. Metella orders both Claudio and Lepido released from prison.

===Act 3===
[[File:Marte, da un originale greco del V sec ac..JPG|thumb|upright|Mars, god of war.]]
Lepido thanks Metella for rescuing him and announces his attention of assassinating Silla in order to restore Roman freedom. Metella refuses to have anything to do with such a plot against her husband. They receive word that Silla is leaving Rome. While Metella regrets that she has not been able to say good-bye to him, she seizes the opportunity to tell her servant Scabro to take Lepido to his wife Flavia in her prison cell and help her to escape.

Silla regrets the necessity of leaving Rome without satisfying his desires towards either Celia or Flavia. He attempts to seduce Celia again, but she repulses him and he informs her that her beloved Claudio has been torn alive by wild beasts and leaves her. Celia laments her lover's death and hears an echo of her words - it is Claudio himself, who has been listening. At first she thinks it must be a ghost, but she is then overjoyed to be re-united with the living Claudio.

More or less the same scenario then occurs in Flavia's prison cell where she awaits death. Silla appears with the bloodstained garment, telling her it is what her husband was wearing when he was shot by arrows, and threatens her with the same fate unless she will yield herself to his lust. She refuses, whereupon Silla storms out. Lepido appears to his wife and at first she too believes she is seeing a ghost, but he reassures her and they express their delight.

At the port where Silla is embarking to leave Rome, his wife Metella appears to bid him farewell. He expresses his regret at his treatment of her and the couple hope one day they will again be able to be together. Metella watches from the shore as the ship Silla is on flounders in a storm and sinks. Silla escapes the wreck and swims to a nearby island, Metella gets into a little boat, rows out to him and rescues her husband.

Lepido and Claudio are at the Capitol rallying their supporters for a revolt against Silla's monstrous tyranny when the god Mars appears on a cloud and announces Rome's salvation. Metalla leads in her repentant husband, who extends apologies to all for his behaviour and announces his retirement to a small estate where he will live quietly with his wife. Claudio and Celia will now marry. All rejoice in the fortunate outcome of events.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web|title=Silla|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/silla/|website=handelhendrix.org|publisher=Handel &amp; Hendrix in London|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synopsis of Silla (Sulla)|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Silla(Sulla).htm|website=Naxos.com|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and analysis==
The German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. A tremendous success, ''Rinaldo'' created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. ''Rinaldo'', a "magic" opera featuring enchantments, sorceresses and scenic ingenuity, was followed by ''[[Il pastor fido (Handel)|Il Pastor Fido]]'', a shorter and simpler opera, which was not a success with London audiences at its first performances. The occasion for which ''Silla'' was written is not known and the presence of a part for a non-singing actor (Scabro) in a Handel opera is a unique feature of ''Silla'' for which the reason is again unknown.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;
The work is scored for strings,two [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], two [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]], [[trumpet]], and [[Figured bass|continuo instruments]].

A partial [[solar eclipse]] occurred on January 4, 1639 during winter in Asia's Siberia in the Samoyed lands.  A [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.  As is shown under 0.1% obscuration, the center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 2,826&amp;nbsp;km above the area (64 N) south of the Arctic Circle.

==Description==
It was the first eclipse of [[Solar Saros 145|solar saros 145]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsaros/SEsaros145.html|title=Solar Saros 145|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the moon's penumbra touching the earth for just under 8 minutes,&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar eclipse of January 4, 1639|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSEmap/1801-1900/1862-06-27.gif|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes, it was called a micro-eclipse.  The greatest eclipse was in the land of the Samoyeds at 64.6 N and 80 E at 4:56  UTC (9:56 AM local time) at the fourth minute.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;  All of the eclipse occurred at or after sunrise.

It was the first of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the last occurred in the Southern Hemisphere on December 5, 1638, the next was on June 1.

It was the last solar eclipse that took place to date that was under the magnitude of 0.001.  The next short solar eclipse was on [[Solar eclipse of January 5, 1935|January 5, 1935]] in the Southern Hemisphere and the magnitude above 0.001.

The solar eclipse was the shortest of the 17th century.

'''''The Coo-Coo Nut Grove''''' (released November 28, 1936) is a [[Warner Bros.]] [[Merrie Melodies]] short animated film, set in the famed Cocoanut Grove of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The cartoon was directed by [[Friz Freleng]], with animation by [[Robert McKimson]] and Sandy Walker and musical score by [[Carl Stalling]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027464/ IMDB entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Master of ceremonies Ben Birdie (bandleader [[Ben Bernie]]) is accosted in the opening scene by Walter Windpipe ([[Walter Winchell]]). The short then proceeds to showcase a large number of Hollywood stars in the form of caricatures, including [[Katharine Hepburn]] (as a horse named Miss Heartburn), [[Jean Harlow]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Ned Sparks]], [[Hugh Herbert]], [[W.

Fields]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] and [[Harpo Marx]], [[Johnny Weissmuller]] (in character as [[Tarzan]]) and [[Lupe Vélez]], [[Mae West]], [[Lionel Barrymore|Lionel]] and [[John Barrymore]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[George Raft]]. Musical entertainments are provided by Dame [[Edna May Oliver]] as "The Lady in Red", the [[Dionne quintuplets]] (who were in reality only two years old at the time) and [[Helen Morgan]], sitting on the piano, turning on the tears with a torch song causing most of the guests to cry (except Ben Birdie and a few of the guests) and flooding the Grove in the process. Whereas other cartoons have cariacatured celebrities as either humans or animals,  oddly, this short does both - half are seen as human, half as animal versions of the stars.

==Notes==
*The title is sometimes mislabeled as '''''The Coo-Coo Nut Groove'''''. This cartoon was followed by ''[[The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos]]'' (1937) and ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'' (1938), both parodying Hollywood personalities.

[[File:The auditorium of the Théâtre des Funambules by Valentin - McCormick 1993 p41.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The auditorium of the theatre before a performance]]

The '''Théâtre des Funambules''' ('The Theatre of the Tightrope-Walkers') was a former theater located on the [[boulevard du Temple]] in Paris, sometimes called the [[Boulevard du Crime]]. It was located between the prominent [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], and the much smaller [[Théâtre des Délassements-Comiques]].

Originally an informal venue for acrobatics and pantomime a theatre was eventually built in 1816. Originally seating 500, it was later enlarged to accommodate 773. The Funambules became celebrated for the performances of the '[[Pierrot]]' mime [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]], between around 1819 and 1846, and also the early career of the great classical actor [[Frédérick Lemaître]].

The theatre was demolished in 1862, along with other neighboring venues such as [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], during [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]].

==''Les Enfants du Paradis''==
[[Marcel Carné]] set his 1945 film ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' in the Théâtre des Funambules to evoke the atmosphere of the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–48), including the figures of Deburau and Lemaître among the main roles.

The '''United Airlines Flight 663 incident''' was a "minor [[international incident]]" in 2010 involving  [[Qatar]]i [[diplomat]] [[Mohammed Yacoub Al Madadi]] on the leg of a [[United Airlines]] flight from [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (Washington, DC) to [[Denver International Airport]] (Denver, Colorado).&lt;ref name="deyoung2010"&gt;DeYoung, Karen and Spencer S.

United no longer uses Flight 663 as a DCA-DEN-LAS route. UA663 is now used on the Houston-Edmonton route, flown by an [[Airbus A320]].&lt;ref&gt;http://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL663&lt;/ref&gt;

Qatari Ambassador to the United States [[Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri]] issued a statement on the Embassy website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Press reports today regarding an incident aboard a commercial flight from Washington, DC to Denver, CO indicate that a Qatari diplomat was detained for suspicious behavior.  We respect the necessity of special security precautions involving air travel, but this diplomat was traveling to Denver on official Embassy business on my instructions, and he was certainly not engaged in any threatening activity.

The '''United States Bicentennial''' was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the [[American Revolution#Memory|American Revolution]]. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

==Background==
The nation had always commemorated the Founding, as a gesture of patriotism and sometimes as an argument in political battles. Historian Jonathan Crider points out that in the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan B. Crider, "De Bow's Revolution: The Memory of the American Revolution in the Politics of the Sectional Crisis, 1850-1861," ''American Nineteenth Century History'' (2009) 10#3 pp 317–332&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans for the Bicentennial began when [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] created the '''American Revolution Bicentennial Commission''' on July 4, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg259.pdf |title=Resolution Establishing the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission - P.L. 89-491 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}{{USStat|80|259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=27708 |title= Lyndon B.

On December 31, 1975, the eve of the Bicentennial Year, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] recorded a statement to address the [[Americans|American people]] by means of radio and television broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=5463 |title= Gerald R.

[[File:VAB aerial 1977.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] in 1977]]

Bruce N. Blackburn, co-designer of the modernized [[NASA insignia]], designed the logo. The logo consisted of a white five-point star inside a stylized star of red, white and blue.  It was encircled by the inscription ''American Revolution Bicentennial 1776–1976'' in [[Helvetica]] Regular. An early use of the logo was on a 1971 U.S. postage stamp.  The logo became a flag that flew at many government facilities throughout the United States and appeared on many other souvenirs and postage stamps issued by the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]].  NASA painted the logo on the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in 1976 where it remained until 1998 when the agency replaced it with its own emblem as part of 40th anniversary celebrations.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title= Restoring Old Glory and a Massive Meatball| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/vab_flag.html| date=11 January 2007| publisher=nasa.gov| accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1975 events ==
The official Bicentennial events began April 1, 1975, when the [[American Freedom Train]] launched in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] to start its 21-month, {{convert|25,388|mi|km|adj=on}} tour of the 48 contiguous states. On April 18, 1975, [[President of the United States|President]] Gerald Ford traveled to [[Boston]] to light a third lantern at the historic [[Old North Church]], symbolizing America's third century.&lt;ref name="remarks"&gt;{{cite web| title=Remarks of the President at the Old North Church| publisher=fordlibrarymuseum.gov| date=April 18, 1975 |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0248/whpr19750418-013.pdf| accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Ford delivered a major address commemorating the 200th anniversary of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] in Massachusetts, which began the military aspect of the [[American Revolution]] against British colonial rule.

==Events==
Festivities included elaborate [[fireworks]] in the skies above major American cities.  President Ford presided over the display in [[Washington, D.C.]] which was [[television|televised]] nationally. A large international fleet of tall-masted [[sailing ship]]s gathered first in [[New York City]] on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and then in [[Boston]] about one week later. These nautical parades were named [[Operation Sail]] (Op Sail) and witnessed by several million observers.  The gathering was the second of six such Op Sail events to date (1964, 1976, 1986, 1992, 2000, and 2012).  The vessels docked and allowed the general public to tour the ships in both cities, while their crews were entertained on shore at various ethnic celebrations and parties.

In addition to the presence of the 'tall ships', navies of many nations sent warships to New York harbor for an [[International Naval Review]] held the morning of July 4. President Ford sailed down the [[Hudson River]] into New York harbor aboard the [[guided missile cruiser]] {{USS|Wainwright|CG-28|6}} to review the international fleet and receive salutes from each visiting ship, ending with a salute from the British [[guided missile destroyer]] {{HMS|London|D16|6}}. The review ended just above [[Liberty Island]] around 10:30 am.

Several people threw packages labeled "[[Gulf Oil]]" and "[[Exxon]]" into [[Boston Harbor]] in symbolic opposition to corporate power, in the style of the [[Boston Tea party]].&lt;ref name=zinn&gt;{{cite book| last=Zinn| first=Howard| authorlink=Howard Zinn| title=A People's History of the United States| location=New York| publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8V7J5qm5-YC&amp;q=bicentennial#v=onepage&amp;q=bicentennial&amp;f=false| date=4 February 2003| page=562| isbn=0-06-052837-0| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johnny Cash]] was the Grand Marshall of the U.S. Bicentennial parade.&lt;ref&gt;Halloran, R. July 4, 1976. "500,000 View Capital's Bicentennial Parade" ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BettyFordNARA.jpg|thumb|First Lady [[Betty Ford]], with President Ford, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in the [[President's Dining Room]] in conjunction with a 1976 state visit during the U.S. Bicentennial.]]

Britain's [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] made a state visit to the United States to tour the country and attend Bicentennial festivities with President and Mrs. Ford.  Their visit aboard the [[Royal Yacht Britannia|Royal Yacht ''Britannia'']] included stops in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Virginia, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

While in Philadelphia on July 6, 1976, Queen Elizabeth presented the Bicentennial Bell on behalf of the British people.  The bell is a replica of the Liberty Bell, cast at the same foundry—[[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]]—and bearing the inscription "For the People of the United States of America from the People of Britain 4 July 1976 LET FREEDOM RING."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bicentennial Bell| url=http://www.nps.gov/inde/historyculture/the-bicentennial-bell.htm| work=Independence National Historical Park| accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local observances included painting mailboxes and fire hydrants red, white, and blue.  A wave of patriotism and nostalgia swept the nation and there was a general feeling that the irate era of the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] constitutional crisis of 1974 had finally come to an end.

In Washington, D.C., the [[Smithsonian Institution]] opened a long-term exhibition in its [[Arts and Industries Building]] that replicated the look and feel of the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]].  Many of the Smithsonian's museum artifacts dated from the 1876 [[World's Fair]] in Philadelphia that commemorated the 100th anniversary of the independence of the United States.  The Smithsonian also opened the new home of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] July 1, 1976.

[[NASA]] commemorated the Bicentennial by staging a science and technology exhibit housed in a series of geodesic domes in the parking lot of the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) called ''Third Century America''. An American flag and the Bicentennial emblem were also painted on the side of the VAB; the emblem remained until 1998, when it was painted over with the NASA insignia. NASA originally planned for [[Viking 1]] to land on Mars on July 4, but the landing was delayed to July 20, the anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing. On the anniversary of the [[Constitution Day (United States)|signing of the Constitution]], NASA held the rollout ceremony of the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|first space shuttle]] (which NASA had planned to name ''Constitution'' but was, instead, named "Enterprise" in honor of its [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|fictional namesake]] on the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''&lt;ref name="Rioux2005"&gt;{{Cite book |title=From Sawdust to Stardust: The Biography of DeForest Kelley, Star Trek's Dr. McCoy |publisher=Pocket Books |first=Terry Lee |last=Rioux |year=2005 |page=221 |isbn=0743457625}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).
[[Image:ONA Douglas DC-8 at Zurich - July 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Douglas DC-8]] of [[Overseas National Airways]] in U.S. Bicentennial special livery.]]

Many commercial products appeared in red, white, and blue packages in an attempt to tie them to the Bicentennial. Liberty, a brand of Spanish [[olive]]s, sold their product in glass jars replicating the Liberty Bell during that time. Products were only permitted to display the trademarked Bicentennial logo by paying a license fee to ARBA.

Many national railroads and shortlines painted locomotives or rolling stock in patriotic color schemes, typically numbered 1776 or 1976, and many military units marked aircraft with special designs in honor of the Bicentennial.

[[Disneyland]] and [[Magic Kingdom|The Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]] presented ''[[America on Parade]]'', an elaborate parade celebrating American history and culture, and featured the [[Sherman Brothers]]' song "[[The Glorious Fourth]]".  The parade featured nightly fireworks and ran twice daily from June 1975 to September 1976.

[[John Warner]], later [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Virginia]], served as ARBA director.&lt;ref name=marsh&gt;{{cite web| title=American Revolution Bicentennial Administration – Licensing/Use of Symbol and Flag| work=John Marsh files| publisher=Gerald R.

The [[New Jersey Lottery]] operated a special "Bicentennial Lottery" in which the winner received $1,776 per week (before taxes) for 20 years (a total of $1,847,040).

The overall theme of the entertainment of [[Super Bowl X]], held January 18, was to celebrate the Bicentennial. Players on both teams, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]], wore a special patch with the Bicentennial Logo on their jerseys; the Cowboys also added red, white and blue striping to their helmets throughout their bicentennial season. The halftime show, featuring the performance group [[Up with People]], was entitled "200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America's Bicentennial".

The [[United States Olympic Committee]] initiated bids to host both the 1976 Summer and Winter Olympic Games in celebration of the Bicentennial. [[Los Angeles]] bid for the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] but lost to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. [[Denver]] was awarded the [[1976 Olympic Winter Games]] in 1970, but concern over costs led [[Colorado]] voters to reject a referendum to fund the games and the [[International Olympic Committee]] awarded the games to [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], the 1964 host.&lt;ref name=76olympics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |title=Colorado only state ever to turn down Olympics |date=12 October 1999 |last=Sanko |first=John |work=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181029/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |archive-date=June 1, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, there was no Olympics in the United States in 1976 despite a last minute offer from [[Salt Lake City]] to host.  However, [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]] would host the [[1980 Winter Olympics]], Los Angeles would eventually be awarded the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 summer games]], and Salt Lake City would also eventually be awarded the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].

As site of the [[Continental Congress]] and signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[Philadelphia]] served as host for the [[1976 NBA All-Star Game]], the [[29th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1976 National Hockey League All-Star Game]], the [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1976 NCAA Final Four]], and the [[1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] at which President Ford threw out the first pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyon |first=Bill |title=Sports helped Philly celebrate Bicentennial |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20090327_Sports_helped_Philly_celebrate_Bicentennial.html |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330204525/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/20090327_Sports_helped_Philly_celebrate_Bicentennial.html |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1976 Pro Bowl]] was an exception and was played in New Orleans, likely due to weather concerns.

[[George Washington]] was posthumously appointed to the grade of [[General of the Armies|General of the Armies of the United States]] by the congressional joint resolution [[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]] passed January 19, 1976, with an effective appointment date of July 4, 1976.&lt;ref name="GEN WASHINGTON"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restored Washington's position as the [[List of United States military leaders by rank|highest-ranking military officer in U.S. history]].&lt;ref group = "Note"&gt;In {{harvtxt|Bell|2005}}, William Gardner Bell states that when Washington was recalled back into military service from his retirement in 1798, "Congress passed legislation that would have made him General of the Armies of the United States, but his services were not required in the field and the appointment was not made until the Bicentennial in 1976, when it was bestowed posthumously as a commemorative honor." [http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/5star.html How many U.S. Army five-star generals have there been and who were they?] states that with [[s:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]], President Ford specified that Washington would "rank first among all officers of the Army, past and present. "General of the Armies of the United States" is only associated with two people...one being Washington and the other being John J. Pershing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bicentennial Wagon Train Pilgrimage began a journey from [[Blaine, Washington]] on June 8, 1975 concluding at [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]] on July 4, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/asmuspapers.asp |title=Larry and Pauline Asmus Papers, 1975-77: Bicentennial Wagon Train Participants |publisher=Gerald R.

Karen Steele was the first baby born on July 4, 1976, 12 seconds after midnight, and was referred to as the "Bicentennial Baby." She was featured on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]'', and received commemorations from President Ford, New Jersey Governor [[Brendan Byrne]], and a host of other notables.

The [[Bicentennial Minute]]s were short vignettes aired on CBS from 1974 through the end of 1976 to mark the occasion.

'''Saturday morning Bicentennial programs'''&lt;br&gt;
In the months approaching the Bicentennial, ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'', a series of educational [[animated cartoon|cartoon]] shorts running on ABC between programs on Saturday mornings, created a sub-series called "History Rock," although the official name was "America Rock." The ten segments covered various aspects of American history and [[American government|government]]. Several of the segments, most notably "[[I'm Just a Bill]]" (discussing the legislative process) and "The Preamble" (which features a variant of the preamble of the Constitution put to music), have become some of ''Schoolhouse Rock'''s most popular segments.

In 1975, CBS aired a new animated [[Archie Comics|Archie]] series on Saturday mornings called ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]''; unfortunately the program was unsuccessful, and was off the air by September 1976.

===Films===
For the Bicentennial celebration, Hollywood filmmaker [[John Huston]] directed a short movie—''[[Independence (1976 film)|Independence]]'' (1976)—for the U.S. [[National Park Service]] which continues to screen at [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia to the present day (2018).

The movie ''[[Rocky]]'' cited the Bicentennial in several scenes, mostly during [[Apollo Creed]]'s entering; [[Carl Weathers]] dressed first as [[George Washington]] then as [[Uncle Sam]].

==Gifts==

A number of nations gave gifts to the US as a token of friendship.  Among them were:

[[File:Magna Carta Replica.jpg|thumb|Magna Carta Replica and display case]]

'''Canada''' through the [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced the book ''Between Friends/Entre Amis'' which was a photographic essay of life along the US-Canada border.  The book was given to libraries across the US and special editions were presented to President [[Gerald Ford]] and other officials.&lt;ref name="monk"&gt;{{cite web| title=Lorraine Monk Books| url=http://lorrainemonk.com/books.html| publisher=LorraineMonk.com| accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of '''France''' and [[Musée du Louvre]] assembled an exhibit of paintings in cooperation with the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] that traveled to [[Detroit]] and [[New York City]] after being shown in [[Paris]].  The exhibit, entitled ''French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution'', included the work of 94 French artists from that period.  Many of the 149 works in the exhibit had never been seen outside France and included ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Jupiter and Thetis]]'' by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] and a portrait of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] by [[Adélaïde Labille-Guiard]].&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;{{cite news| title= At the Institute of Arts, A Heroic Show from France| work=Detroit Free Press| page=D-1| date=2 March 1975| author=Marsha Miro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vinalia''' were Roman festivals of the wine harvest, wine [[vintage]] and gardens, held in honour of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. The ''Vinalia prima'' ("first Vinalia"), also known as the ''Vinalia urbana'' ("Urban Vinalia") was held on 23 April to bless and sample last year's wine and ask for good weather until the next harvest. The ''Vinalia rustica'' ("Rustic Vinalia") was on 19 August, before the harvest and [[grape-pressing]].

==Vinalia Urbana==
[[File:Fasti Praenestini Massimo n2.jpg|thumb|left|Fragment of the ''[[Fasti Praenestini]]'' showing the April Vinalia ''(VIN)'']]

The ''Vinalia Urbana'' was held on 23 April. It was predominantly a wine festival, shared by Venus as patron of "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#profanum|profane]]" wine (''vinum spurcum'') intended for everyday human use, and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] as patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine (''temetum''). In honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with ordinary wine, men and women alike sampled the ''vinum spurcum'' of the previous autumn's pressing. As god of the weather on which the wine-harvest depended, Jupiter was offered a special libation of the previous year's sacred wine vintage, blessed by his high priest and poured into a ditch outside Venus' Capitoline temple, probably under the gaze of Rome's higher echelons.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier de Cazanove, "Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin", Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245–265 [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhr_0035-1423_1988_num_205_3_1888 persee]&lt;/ref&gt; Common girls (''vulgares puellae'') and prostitutes (''meretrices'') gathered at Venus Erycina's Colline temple &amp;ndash; probably on separate occasions, for propriety's sake &amp;ndash; to offer the goddess myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches. In return, they asked her for "beauty and popular favour", and to be made "charming and witty".&lt;ref&gt;Staples, Ariadne, ''From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion'', Routledge, 1998, pp. 122–124, citing Ovid, Fasti, 4,863–872.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vinalia Rustica==
The ''Vinalia Rustica'' was held on 19 August. It was originally a rustic [[Latium|Latin]] harvest festival, celebrating the grape harvest, vegetable growth and fertility. At the Roman ''Vinalia Rustica'', kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to ''Venus Obsequens'', the oldest known form of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Vegetable-growers may have been involved in the dedications as a corporate guild: see Eden, P.T., "Venus and the Cabbage" ''Hermes'', 91, (1963) p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Roman mythology]], it marked the fulfillment of a vow by the ancient Latin allies of Rome's legendary ancestor [[Aeneas]], who promised all wine of the next sacred vintage to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], in return for victory against the Etruscan tyrant [[Mezentius]]. According to some sources, the warlike Mezentius had claimed this vintage as his due, not Jupiter's. Roman opinions differ on which deity presided at the ''Vinalia Rustica''; Varro insists that like the ''Vinalia Urbana'', it was sacred to Jupiter, who controlled the weather that governed the growing and ripening of grapes; moreover Jupiter's priest picked the first bunch of grapes, blessed the first sacred pressing and offered a sacrifice; these observations are borne out by Pliny the Elder.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, 18, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the festival had strong popular and cult connections to Venus as patron goddess of ordinary, religiously "impure" wine (''vinum spurcum''). Some of the rites took place at her various temples. The sacrificial victim offered by Jupiter's priest, a female lamb (''agna'') may be evidence if not of Venus herself, then of an ancient, rustic Latin goddess very much like her.&lt;ref&gt;For associations of kind between Roman deities and their sacrificial victims, see [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|Victima]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Michael, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'', BRILL, 2009, p. 42; citing Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', 6. 16; Varro's explicit denial that the festival belongs to Venus implies his awareness of the opposite opinion. Lipka offers this apparent contradiction as an example of two Roman cults that offer "complementary functional foci" within a single festival.&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the origins and rise of this festival is given by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]].

The '''FIA World Touring Car Cup''' (Known as the FIA WTCR presented by [[Oscaro]] for sponsorship reasons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiawtcr.com/its-go-for-oscaro-as-series-presenting-partner-of-wtcr-fia-world-touring-car-cup/&lt;/ref&gt;) is an international [[touring car racing|touring car]] championship promoted by Eurosport Events and sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). It has had different incarnation of a World Touring Car Cup held between 1993 and 1995. Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the [[World Touring Car Championship]] to become WTCR and use the TCR technical regulations. With titles for drivers and teams only, the WTCR series will receive 'World Cup' rather than 'World Championship' status when it runs for the first time in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.autosport.com/wtcc/news/133642/wtcr-keeps-wtcc-showpieces-on-2018-calendar&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===World Touring Car Cup (1993–1995)===
{{see also|1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup}}
In 1993, with the high popularity of the [[Supertouring]] category, the FIA hosted the FIA World Touring Car Cup&amp;nbsp;— an annual event for touring car drivers hailing from national championships all over the world. The [[1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1993 race]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] was won by New Zealand's [[Paul Radisich]], at the wheel of a [[Ford Mondeo]] ahead of [[Nicola Larini]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 155]], with no manufacturer title awarded. The race was run for two more years, (won by Paul Radisich again in [[1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1994]] at [[Donington Park]] in a Ford Mondeo, manufacturer title went to BMW, and [[Frank Biela]] in [[1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995]] at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] in an Audi A4 Quattro, and manufacturer title went to Audi). A similar event was planned for 1996 at the [[A1 Ring]], [[Austria]], but was cancelled due to a low number of provisional entries (10 cars). It was never brought back thereafter.

=== World Touring Car Championship (2005–2017) ===
{{see also|World Touring Car Championship}}

=== World Touring Car Cup (2018–present)===
On 6 December 2017, during the FIA's World Motorsport Council in Paris, it was approved the formation of the new World Touring Car Cup starting from 2018. The new series would utilize the TCR rules, which have been in use in numerous national and international touring car racing series, including [[TCR International Series]]. Cars would now have to conform to the new FIA WTCR regulations. As a result of the formation of the WTC Cup both the WTCC in its current format and the TCR International Series would be discontinued immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2017/12/06/world-touring-car-cup-made-official-wtcc-tcr-combine-two-year-deal/|title=World Touring Car Cup made official as WTCC, TCR combine in two-year deal - TouringCarTimes|date=2017-12-06|work=TouringCarTimes|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
