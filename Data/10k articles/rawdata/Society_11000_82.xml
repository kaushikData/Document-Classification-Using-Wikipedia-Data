      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Ad-Da'i Yusuf''' (died September 12, 1012) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled for two highly turbulent terms (977–999, 1002–1012).

==Struggles against Yu'firids and Ziyadids==

Yusuf bin Yahya was a son of the imam [[al-Mansur Yahya]] who died in 976. In the following year, Yusuf was proclaimed with the regnal name ad-Da'i Yusuf. His early years were filled with struggles against the [[Yufirids|Yu'firid Dynasty]] that ruled much of the Yemeni highland.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman; Its Early Medieval History''. London 1892, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The important city [[San'a]] at this time was subjected to the overlordship of the [[Sunni]] [[Ziyadid dynasty]] which ruled the [[Tihamah]] from its base in [[Zabid]]. Ad-Da'i Yusuf managed to gain recognition as prince in San'a and the surrounding province in 978, reciting the [[khutbah]] in his own name. Nevertheless, the Ziyadid governor Ibn ad-Dahhak soon fought back.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The last effective Yu'firid ruler Abdallah managed to win back the city and increase his power still by invading the Ziyadid domains and seize [[Zabid]]. After Abdallah's death in 997, Yu'firid rule collapsed.

==Contested leadership==

For ad-Da'i Yusuf, this was but a brief respite. A rival for the [[imamate]], [[al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani]] appeared in 999. With the assistance of the [[Hamdan]] tribesmen, ad-Da'i Yusuf was expelled from [[Sa'dah]], the traditional seat of the imams. A Zaidi [[Sharif]], al-Qasim bin al-Husayn, was dispatched to San'a by the new imam, and the [[Zaydiyyah]] communities submitted to him. After some years, al-Qasim bin al-Husayn changed his allegiance to ad-Da'i Yusuf again. Al-Mansur al-Qasim al-Iyyani retired from power in 1002, and ad-Da'i Yusuf ruled for a second term. However, his time was filled with petty fighting over San'a, where the tribesmen of [[Banu Hamdan|Hamdan]] and [[Khwlan District|Khawlan]] played a major role.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, 1892, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had to fight al-Mansur's son who posed as imam under the name [[al-Mahdi al-Husayn]]. This uneasy situation persisted until the death of ad-Da'i Yusuf in 1012, after an extremely turbulent reign.

'''Afro-Guatemalans''' are [[Guatemala]]ns of African descent. Afro-Guatemalans comprise 1-2% of the population. They are of mainly English speaking [[West Indian]] ([[Antilles|Antillean]]) and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] population. They are found in the Caribbean coast, in [[Livingston, Guatemala|Livingston]] (a Garifuna settlement), [[Puerto Barrios]] and Santo Tomas. During the colonial period, African slaves were brought in, but have mixed with the general population and can be referred to them as Afro-mestizos. So, due to [[miscegenation]], the majority of black people became in [[Mulatto]] (50% black-50% white) and [[Zambo]] (50% black-50% Amerindian) and these in turn became in [[Quadroon]] (75% white and 25% black) and Cambujos (75% Amerindian and 25% black). Due to centuries of miscegenation, Afro-Guatemalans (aside from the Garifunas) today form part of the country's mixed race, non-indigenous [[Ladino people|ladino population]].

== Origins ==
Due to the difficulty of slave ships arriving in Guatemala, buyers of the Kingdom of Guatemala depended on the vagaries of the market they did not control. For shipping list, we know that slaves came between the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly from [[Senegambia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]]; in the seventeenth century, they came from the Gold Coast and the [[Bight of Benin]]. And in the eighteenth century, they came from [[Biafra]] ([[Nigeria]]), [[Congo Republic]], [[Angola]], [[Guinea]] and [[Benin]] (from [[Kingdom of Whydah]]). In this  century also arrived slaves [[Aja people|Aja]] (who were known as ''Arará'', coming from [[Allada]], [[Benin]]) and "creole", from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Jamaica]]. Also arrived [[Kalabari tribe|Calabari]], from [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5ZCJ2ubD-cC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=esclavos+angole%C3%B1os+en+Jamaica&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XMogjVgJ7r&amp;sig=tmEtpWA-ahWE5OG4cFxWrfu95m0&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=06IPUde0Ec-YhQf29IDICg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=esclavos%20angole%C3%B1os%20en%20Jamaica&amp;f=false Google Book: Rutas de la Esclavitud en África Y América Latina] (in Spanish: Routes of Slavery in Africa and Latin America). Page 202. Posted in 2001, by Rina Cáceres Gómez.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the blacks slaves who worked in rural areas came, usually of Senegambia. In Addition, there were also many slaves bought in [[Luanda, Angola]]. There were also at least 30 other African ethnic groups - from the  [[Central Africa]] - in Guatemala, chief among them the [[Kongo people|Kongo]], and the mongiolos and anchico. Also, there was at least a dozen of slaves from [[West Africa]], some them were [[Brong-Ahafo Region|bran]] (ethnic group from west of Ghana), [[Bainuk people|Banyun]] (who were known as ''Banon'', are established in [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea Bissau]]) and [[biafada people|biafadas]] (ethnic group of Guinea Bissau) people.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Slavery ===
The first Afro-Guatemalan arrived in Guatemala in 1524 with [[Pedro de Alvarado]] (the “Conqueror of Guatemala”). Also in the 1530s are mentioned in the records of the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] of [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago]], in [[Almolonga, Quetzaltenango|Almolonga]], some enslaved blacks. This first city, founded in 1527 with 150 Spanish residents, was destroyed in September 1541 by an avalanche of water and mud of the Volcán de Agua (Volcano of Water) that buried the Spanish sector of the capital with a large number of Native Americans and a small number of enslaved blacks. However, the first significant costs that are reporting data from 1543, when an estimated "150 pieces pig" of Santo Domingo, were taken to the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. African slaves arrived in Guatemala to replace the indigenous population as labor, as these had been reduced drastically from diseases such as [[measles]], [[smallpox]] or [[bubonic plague]], they were infected by the Spanish conquerors, and reduced to about a third of its population. African slaves were used in the sugar, indigo, and cochineal plantations. They were also used in the [[hacienda]] or large cattle ranch. Since Santiago was the political and economic center of Guatemala (and throughout the Spanish Central America), many of the slaves brought to the region, were bought and sold there, and were baptized in their churches and parishes and possibly also in their monasteries. Between 1524 and 1620, a total of 10,000 African slaves were brought to Guatemala. So, because of the rise In power in the Middle East at the end of the sixteenth century, a large number of people started and to be identified as [[mulatto]]. According to Robinson Herrera, of 250 Africans bought and sold in Santiago, about 40% came directly from África. Eighty slaves came from West Africa, particularly in [[Senegambia]] and the Central - Western Africa. For the other 50 people, 20% were criollos (slaves born in Spain, Portugal or America), and the other ten were mulattoes. Although there were few free mulattoes in the region at this time, their number was greater than the mulattoes enslaved. Between 1595 and 1640 there is an increase in the importation of slaves to Guatemala, but after 1640, imports sharply declined&lt;ref name="olvimemy"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qHwlcfhkkq8J:unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001838/183846s.pdf+&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=es&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESggXuSeAvmRnnjHQPmFgLjMiRR2tljUXyRvRmgzPx1jdAj64k-6d5wsVNZSbhXtzxIUFhB4eMpSNtP9O3m7d8bjr_zcd_DmNo8b-f5R2s1a0aNRzcOfxWmemcdueVwEnjSIZLLL&amp;sig=AHIEtbRGILgKscreZoYJdu7RZN6IWNYNaA Del olvido a la memoria: africanos y afromestizos en la historia colonial de Centroamérica] (in spanish: From Oblivion to Memory: Africans and Mulattoes in the colonial history of Central).&lt;/ref&gt; (some authors indicated even that the importation of slaves ceases&lt;ref name="demomul"&gt;[http://democraciamulticultural.blogspot.com.es/2009/10/sobre-la-influencia-africana-en.html#!/2009/10/sobre-la-influencia-africana-en.html Influencia africana] (in Spanish: African influence)&lt;/ref&gt;). The first free black of Santiago first appeared already in the second half of the sixteenth century. Because of its small population, free blacks had to marry with other more numerous socioracials groups.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt; Between 1595 and 1640, the Spanish crown signed a series of contracts with Portuguese traders to dramatically increase the number of African slaves in America. So many slaves came from the [[Angola]]n port of [[Luanda]]. Also, during the 17th century, some slaves could buy their freedom, forming a small community of free blacks. Runaway slaves formed [[Cimarrons]] societies, living among the population. Founded in 1590, the ingenuity of Asís, who became the most important in the seventeenth century, had more than 200 slaves and in 1633, the ingenuity of San Geronimo, north of Santiago, in Verapaz, was home to hundreds of slaves "of different nations" and became the largest in Central America. In 1821 there were more than 500 slaves.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

In the late seventeenth century, the Afro - descendant was scattered to the south and east of Guatemala and El Salvador. The impact of African immigration in early colonial times was deeper in the sugar mill in [[Amatitlán]] and mint of [[Escuintepeque]] shores, where is San Diego de la Gomera. The Afro - descendants lived in nearly two dozen locations between Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1823, after independence, arrived to Guatemala [[Garifuna people|Garífuna]] groups from [[Honduras]]. They occupied the Caribbean lowland.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

=== Miscegenation and growth of social status ===
During colonial times and until the abolition of slavery in Guatemala (liberal government after independence) was important to the African population. Most Spanish houses of the time in Guatemala, especially in [[Antigua Guatemala|Santiago]], had Indian servants and African slaves. In both cases, most of them were female. Because most Spanish who emigrated to Latin America at this time were men, looking rich and did not carry with them their wives, often had sex with her maids and female slaves, causing racial mixtures, increasingly abundant while growing the Spanish settlers in the territory, racial mixture which was maintained until the destruction of Santiago by severe earthquakes in 1773 and the jurisdiction of the new capital in [[Guatemala City]] in 1770. With racial mixtures, mulattoes, eventually came to outnumber blacks enslaved. On one side were those black and mulatto slaves who worked in houses and estates and on the other hand, a large population of free blacks who scattered in towns and cities. The growing miscegenation between black slaves and free mulattoes increasingly increased the population of free mulattoes. The drastic reduction in the importation of slaves to Guatemala and increased free slaves eventually prompted some places that have a predominance of slaves pass to have a predominance of free blacks. Moreover, the mixture of mulattoes and [[mestizos]] caused higher incomes and a higher position for those with lighter skin. While some roads were blocked for people of African descent, especially in college and in the church. While miscegenation and learning the Spanish language and standards were increased, more Afro - Guatemalans have access to jobs.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt; So also, the slave population was mixed also with indigenous and white populations of Guatemala and the whole group of African people in the colony, were not "pure black", to call that.&lt;ref name="demomul"/&gt; Many slaves were hired to work in various jobs such as in the carnage. The mulattoes were often involved in the illegal killing of livestock. Although we know little about Afro - Guatemalans working in the agricultural sector, several sources in the last third of the sixteenth century, identified Afros farming communities in the present [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]], [[El Progreso Department|El Progreso]], [[Santa Rosa Department (Guatemala)|Santa Rosa]] and [[Jutiapa Department|Jutiapa]] departments, and in the area surrounding the city of Sansonante, in the current [[El Salvador]]. Many of these slaves were born in Africa, usually in the region of Senegambia. However, it also had African slaves born in America. The Pacific coast was also home to many blacks and mulattoes free sticking by his great abilities as vagueros, to the extent that the laws of the sixteenth century forbidding them riding on horses or have weapons were almost always ignored because their skills were as necessary as feared, skills that would later valuable recruits from colonial militias and gave opportunity for upward social mobility. Free people of African descent and slaves also worked on the production of indigo in the Pacific coast of Guatemala and, especially, of El Salvador.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt; People of African descent tended to work in the mills, usually doing the work of supervision during Xiquilite harvest. This station lasted only one or two months a year, making it unprofitable to maintain a permanent workforce only enslaved workers to produce indigo. Some owners of mills, hired more slaves of which them needed to produce indigo since used for other activities, such as livestock.

Between 1595 and 1640, the Spanish crown signed a series of contracts with Portuguese traders to dramatically increase the number of African slaves in America. So many slaves came from the [[Angola]]n port of [[Luanda]], mostly slaves who were used as laborers in the sugar cane, since in these years were enormously developing sugar production in the territory.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

===  Afro-Guatemalan militias ===
In 1611, when the free mulattoes helped defeat the Maroons of Tutale, not allowed people of African descent officially participate in militia companies, but Africans and their descendants, even enslaved, had fought with Spanish forces from time to time since the conquest. However, in the 1630s, a wave of attacks Centre - America, by [[Privateer|corsairs]] Dutch, French and British persuaded to the Audiencia to enlist free people of African descent in regular militia companies, although segregated. In 1673 there were 6 companies browns in Guatemala and two in El Salvador. Soon there were also places like chivalry in [[Sonsonate Department]] and [[Chiquimula]]. After early struggles against the corsairs, the browns requested exemption of Laborío Tribute, threatening not to serve if they are not granted the exemption. Because of that, several companies of militia were temporary tax exemptions Laborio during the 1690s, including the [[San Diego de la Gomera]]. The militants claimed this success and soon new Exemptions requested when aspirated initials. Soon, the rest of the Afro - descendants also expected to be relieved Laborío tribute, and prepared to face the authorities on the subject, rebelling them.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

=== San Diego de la Gomera: a community of free Mulattoes ===
In the first decades of the seventeenth century, some free people of African descent living in Chipalaga, founded a new community directed only to the Cimarron (or Maroon) communities, the Village of San Diego de la Gomera, founded by Count de La Gomera, president of the audience of Guatemala between 1611 and 1626, to solve the problems of the Maroons of Tulate living illegally in Indian Territory. Several free mulattoes fought the Maroons (who had a duty to arrest the runaway slaves and came to their territories, to give to their owners in exchange for legal recognition) and could have won the right to establish an independent community as a reward . They were given the saline control along the Pacific coast in the borders of [[Coyolate River]] and [[Sipacate]], which produced the revenue needed to pay the Laborío ld

LowkktrrrrTribute to the crown that people needed. They had their own mayor, town councils and councilors. Spanish officials who were to perform site visits, prevented him when they could, so that the common people are accustomed to ignoring outside authorities, refusing even priests pay or go to church. So when the saline control was threatened, they did their best to defend it, even took up arms in 1700 against the forces of the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]]. Ironically, they fought and showed their military experience to the same Audiencia that  before had trained to they militarily (and others free slaves of African descent) for decades as militants. According to Ann Jefferson, Guatemalan slavery was clearly in decline in the eighteenth century and the commercial development and production in the agricultural converted many mulattoes from Guatemalan east, some of them very prominent in landowners. In addition, at the end of the colonial period, over 50% of the militiamen were mulatto, struggling to improve their situation and refusing to pay the taxes that were required to the crown. Although most slaves were engaged in sugar production, freed slaves, who expanded their business in the region, eventually be dedicated in producing cochineal, which will acquire a dominant role.&lt;ref name="olvimemy"/&gt;

== Communities ==

=== Afro-Mestizos ===
They are the mix black with white or Amerindian and form the majority of the descendants of slaves now Guatemala. They were mainly settled in the Pacific southern and inland areas. Marimba a type of [[xylophone]], created in Guatemala is believed to be of African roots.

=== Garifuna and Antillean ===
The Garifuna entered Guatemala in 1823, after independence. They occupied the Caribbean lowland. They were later joined by free blacks of the colonial era. In the latter part of the 20th century, West Indian workers were brought in to work the banana plantations. A few made Guatemala home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=2559&amp;tmpl=printpage Guatemala Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their differences and independence, through the years the Garifuna have been feared and discriminated by Guatemalans and accused of devil-worship, voodoo, polygamy and speaking a secret language.&lt;ref Name="eripere"&gt;[http://www.eripere.com/html/garifuna.html Eripere: Garífunas].

'''Air Tamajeq''' (''Tayiṛt'') is a variety of [[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]], one of the [[Tuareg languages]]. It is spoken by the [[Tuareg people]] inhabiting the [[Aïr Mountains]], in the [[Agadez Region]] of [[Niger]].

''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists two dialects: ''Air (Tayert)'' and ''Tanassfarwat (Tamagarast/Tamesgrest)''. Blench (2006) considers these two varieties to be distinct languages. He lists ''Ingal'' and ''Gofat'' as dialects of Air/Tayirt and Azerori as a dialect of Tamesgrest.

'''Anti-environmentalism''' refers to the way that various groups in society have sought to counter the effects of [[environmentalism|environmental ideology and movements]], to redirect and diminish public concern about the environment, to attack [[left-leaning]] [[environmentalists]], and to persuade politicians against increased environmental regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uow.edu.au|title=University of Wollongong, Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uow.edu.au|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmentalists argue that the only solutions to [[climate change]] will come from humans interfering less with the Earth, or to stop interfering altogether. In the eyes of many anti-environmentalists, environmentalism is radical and "anti-human".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Big Questions: Ethics|last=Baggini|first=Julian|publisher=Quercus Editions Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=122–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-environmentalists argue that the Earth is not as fragile as some environmentalists maintain, as Earth maintained itself long before humans arrived, and it will continue to maintain itself long after humans are gone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another significant argument made by anti-environmentalists is that it is in the interest of the economy, and more specifically job creation, to be anti-environment. Groups which are notoriously anti-environment include oil producers and [[mining]] companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As the nature of anti-environmentalism is a polarizing subject, it has resulted in a variety of conflicts throughout North America, including the [[Dakota Access Pipeline|Dakota Pipeline]] in [[Standing Rock]], [[North Dakota]] and the [[Athabasca oil sands|Alberta Oil Sands]]. The Dakota Pipeline, a four-state crude oil pipeline which would transport 470,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to [[Illinois]], evoked backlash from environmentalists, as well as the Indigenous communities residing in South Dakota, primarily the [[Standing Rock Sioux Tribe]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-dakota-access-pipeline-protests/story?id=43131355|title=Timeline of the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests|last=Thorbecke|first=Catherine|date=October 28, 2016|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups had concerns about the ethicality of the pipeline as well as the pollutants the pipeline would release into the water supply of South Dakota inhabitants. Environmentalists had similar complaints regarding the Alberta Oil Sands. Anti-environmentalists argued that the economic benefits that would result from both projects outweigh the negative effects on the environment and these people living in these areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History in North America ==
Concern about the impacts of human activity on the environment in Canada started in the 1960s and pollution was one of the main concerns at this time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/environmental-and-conservation-movements/|title=Environmental and Conservation Movements|last=Hummel|first=Monte|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the 1960s, more emphasis was put on nature conservation, as the natural environment started to be seen not only as scenic, but important to human survival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Public concern for the environment turned into action with the development of activist groups such as Greenpeace. This concern was later reflected in decisions made by the Canadian government, as was seen with Canada ratifying the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 2002 under the leadership of [[Jean Chrétien]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Critics of the environmental movements described [[Greenpeace]] as a radical group, displaying an act of “domestic extremism".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During his time as President of the United States, [[Bill Clinton]] made strides towards environmentalism and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/|title=Welcome To The White House|website=clinton4.nara.gov|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the 1990s, Clinton signed various executive orders committing to the preservation of many facets of the environment including [[Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area|animals]], forests and wetlands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In 1993, Clinton and Gore hosted the Forest Conference which was considered to be the beginning of developing a comprehensive, long term policy in which workers, businesses and communities dependent on timber sales would be supported.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In the same year, Clinton issued executive orders for federal agencies to increase the use of alternative-fueled vehicles and reduce the use of materials which deplete the ozone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As well, Clinton spearheaded an environmental justice movement, ensuring that low-income citizens and minorities did not disproportionately feel the impacts of industrial pollution, and minimizing the hazards associated with the construction of pipelines.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Clinton’s successor, President [[George W. Bush]] stated in his campaign platform that he would “ensure that the federal government, which is the country’s largest polluter, complies with all environmental laws” and that the United States would even exceed the set standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://georgewbush.com/issues/index.html |title=George W. Bush for President Official Site: Issues |date=2000-11-09 |access-date=2017-04-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109011500/http://georgewbush.com/issues/index.html |archivedate=2000-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though once elected, Bush verged from what he had promised during his campaign, and instead reversed Clinton administration initiatives on drinking water, and advocated for oil exploration in protected regions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment-jan-june01-bushenv_3-29/|title=Bush and the Environment|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bush’s administration also moved forward in withdrawing its support of the Kyoto Protocol, a worldwide global warming agreement created in 1997.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Bush stated that he would work with allies to the United States to reduce greenhouse gases, but would not carry out a plan that would harm the economy and hurt American workers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

From the 1980s, [[Mexico]] experienced rampant deforestation to create room for pastures. Tropical forests covered 50% of the state of Tabasco in 1940, which then was reduced to 10% in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/|title=Country Studies|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this has been mass soil erosion nationwide. By 1985, 17% of Mexico’s land was classified as totally eroded, while almost 50% of land was classified as experiencing an accelerated erosion, or signs of impending erosion.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The coastline of Mexico experiences other problems, such as the exploitation of petrol as there are relaxed regulations concerning petrol.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  In 1992, this resulted in 1,000 barrels of gasoline leaking into municipal sewer systems in [[Guadalajara]], where the gases and chemicals produced an explosion killing almost 200 people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Following this event, in 1994, President Bill Clinton issued executive orders demanding that the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation and the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Mexican States Concerning the Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission be enforced so that it aligns with American environmental policy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/mexico/oecdpraisesmexicosenvironmentalpoliciesbutencouragesbetterenforcementandfunding.htm|title=OECD Praises Mexico's Environmental Policies but Encourages Better Enforcement and Funding|last=|first=|date=October 30, 2003|website=OECD|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study conducted in the mid-1980s of twelve urban areas around the world concluded that residents of [[Mexico City]] had the highest levels of cadmium in their blood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The concentration of pollutants was impacting surrounding ecosystems, as well as residents in the area These impacts included birth defects and high levels of gastrointestinal disease.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Also in the 1980s, the Mexican government implemented various anti-pollution policies in Mexico City. These policies included vehicle emission inspections, introducing unleaded gasoline, and the installation of converters on vehicles to help reduce pollution created by buses and trucks.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another study in Mexico determined that five million tons of contaminants were released into the atmosphere each year; ten times more than in the previous decade.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Vehicles and industrial plants were found to be the main contributors of contaminants into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  As well, fecal matter becomes airborne in Mexico during the winter months, resulting in residents being diagnosed with a variety of respiratory illnesses.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Denial machine===
{{See also|Climate change denial|Fossil fuels lobby}}
There are many scientific studies, which have analyzed the organized campaigns to sow doubt among laymen and politicians, which has been done by the so-called "denial machine".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Climate and environmental science denial: A review of the scientific literature published in 1990-2015 |first=Karin Edvardsson et al. |last=Björnberg |journal=[[Journal of Cleaner Production]] |volume=167 |year=2017 |pages= 229–241 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.066 |url= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of creating doubt within a community is difficult and requires many moving parts in order for it to be effective. If it is done correctly the influence a denial machine has on the public is enormous. These types of machines have previously been used in the [[tobacco industry]], and in today’s world it can be found in the climate change discussion. It all starts with large corporations and trickles down to politicians, cover organizations, the media, and into the laps of ordinary citizens.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dryzek|first1=John|last2=Norgaard|first2=Richard|last3=Schlosberg|first3=David|title=The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press.|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsYr_iQUs6QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+of+climate+change+and+society&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9tKy0p8bSAhVS1WMKHX4RCY8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=machine&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Koch Industries]] is a prime example of this. Since 1997 the [[Koch Brothers]] have spent over a hundred-million dollars funding alternative theories of meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koch Industries: Secretly Funding the Climate Denial Machine|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/climate-deniers/koch-industries/|website=GreenPeace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These groups are masked as think tanks and their purpose is to spread false ideals and attack climate change scientists.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press" /&gt;  Large corporations do not only funnel money into denial groups, but they also pay off politicians. Politicians like [[Mitch McConnell]] have been paid millions of dollars from oil and gas industries to prevent pro-environmental legislation from being passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sen. Mitch McConnell|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=n00003389|website=OpenSecrets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This combination of politicians and denial groups spreading propaganda causes a lot of uncertainty within the public community.

=== Conflicts ===
====Alberta oil sands====
The [[Alberta oil sands]] has also been a point of contention between environmentalists and anti-environmentalists. Anti-environmentalists maintain that the oil sands have improved Canada’s relations with the United States as Canada is their number one foreign supplier of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/66591/pros-and-cons-alberta-oil-sands/|title=Pros and Cons: Alberta Oil Sands|last=Terry|first=Ashley|date=August 31, 2009|work=Global News|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the oil sands have brought a secure source of energy to Canada, as well as tremendous economic gains for Alberta.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/campaigns/Energy/tarsands/|title=Stop Tar Sands Expansion {{!}} Greenpeace Canada|website=Greenpeace Canada|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are some environmental efforts in place to mitigate the effects that the mining involved in operating the Oil Sands has on animal species, though environmentalist groups are not satisfied. Environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace are concerned with the environmental, social and health impacts of the Oil Sands, particularly on First Nations communities in Alberta.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Standing Rock====
{{See also|Dakota Access Pipeline protests}}
The source of this conflict is that on January 25, 2016, Dakota Access announced that it received permit approval to move forward with the construction of a four-state crude oil pipeline which would transport 470,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Anti-environmentalists defended the construction of the Pipeline as it would create thousands of jobs, make the United States more energy independent and create a more cost-effective method of transporting oil to major refining markets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe took issue with this as the pipeline would run through their communities, tainting their sacred land as well as contaminating their water supply.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/business/energy-environment/environmentalists-blast-bankers-behind-dakota-pipeline.html|title=Environmentalists Target Bankers Behind Pipeline|last=Tabuchi|first=Hiroko|date=2016-11-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What followed in the next ten months was a response from Sioux communities, protestors and environmentalist groups in the form of peaceful protests in which over 400 arrests were made by local law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 26 Environmentalist groups responded to the event with an open letter condemning the actions of the North American banks who helped fund the pipeline, and encouraged them to stop any future payments contributing to it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

====Effects of climate change====
{{Off topic|Effects of global warming|date=July 2017}}
Climate change has been in effect for some time now. Scientific evidence in the last 50 years has proven climate change to be both real, and dangerous by giving scientific evidence for connection between human carbon emissions and indefinite climate change. Examples of the increasingly dangerous effects of this climate change can be seen in many different parts of the world. These effects are seen in Arctic regions as the loss of ice volume is increasing rapidly. In the mid-1970s there was a shift as the annual volume loss was about 147&amp;nbsp;mm.yr-1 in water equivalent, followed by more rapid loss in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyurgerov|first1=Mark B.|title=Twentieth century climate change: Evidence from small glaciers|date=February 15, 2000|publisher=The National Academy of Sciences|pages=1406–1411|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As heat continues to rise dangerous effects can also be seen in warmer regions of the world. For example, these hot areas consumed by agricultural fields have increased in the numbers of fires, vector-borne diseases, and have ultimately created a decline in agricultural production. The droughts and below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures in 2010 and 2011, affected four regions: the southern United States, western Russia, Western Australia, and East Africa, and the entire continental US was affected. In all these cases droughts reduced crop yields and led to increased wild fires. The Southern half experienced extreme and persistent drought from mid 2010 to September 2011, with the greatest impact in Texas. The Texas drought epicenter had historic rainfall lows of up to 66% below normal, coupled with one of the hottest summer on record in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Compton J|first1=Tucker|title=Recent Weather Extremes and impacts on Agricultural Production and Vector Borne Disease Outbreak Patterns|publisher=NASA|accessdate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global warming helped fuel 2005's destructive hurricane season, researchers said. Their study adds to a roiling scientific debate over the role of climate change in spurring more intense hurricanes. About half of the previous year's extra ocean warmth was due to global warming said the co-author of the study Kevin Trenberth. According to the study, the 2005 hurricane season was a record one with 28 named storms. The season extended beyond its normal November close, lasting until December 30th. It was the first year on record with three category 5 storms. Researchers with the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] said there's an 80% chance of an above average hurricane season with four to six major hurricanes that year. Sea- surface temperatures are key because hurricanes are essentially heat engines. They draw energy from warm ocean waters and release it in tremendous storms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vergano|first1=Dan|title=Global warming stoked '05 hurricanes, study says; Storms forecaster takes exception, points instead to natural cycles|publisher=USA Today|date=June 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global relations===
Since the early 1990s, key issues across the world regarding how nations should address the concept of climate change have created several tensions. As a result, from these tensions, global relations (specifically between developed and developing nations) have diminished in quality. For example, the Kyoto and Copenhagen Conferences in the late 2000s brought up issues revolving nuclear power energy use in Japan and the nuclear radiation detected on the coast of other countries of the Pacific.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kythreotis|first=Paul|date=December 7, 2011|title=Progress in global climate change politics? Reasserting national state territoriality in a ‘post-political’ world|url=|journal=Progress in Human Georgraphy|volume=36|pages=457–474|doi=10.1177/0309132511427961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the argument was settled between Japan and its oppositional forces of the United Nations, led by key large nations of the West such as the United States, in the [[Copenhagen Accord]]. The Copenhagen Accord itself hosts large controversy, headed by promises of both developed and developing nations to mitigate advocations for action against climate change. In other words, in an attempt to create a regime that compliments the United Nation's core beliefs that often correlate to Western society's beliefs, attitudes of past imperialism were implemented on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; An earlier occurrence reflects the same concept, when [[Indonesia]] experienced widespread drought between the years 1993 and 1997. During this time period, rice, Indonesia's staple crop and food source, experienced major detriment in its production, causing riots resulting from a dramatic increase in price of rice and political instability.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caruso|first=R|date=2016|title=Climate change, rice crops, and violence: Evidence from Indonesia|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=53|pages=66–83|doi=10.1177/0022343315616061}}&lt;/ref&gt; China played a key part during this period, being that the country made settlements on subsidies for rice, as China experienced an abundance of rice yield during the same period. This furthered Indonesia's debt to China, cancelling out any progress made by the two nations during the Settlement of Indonesia's Debt Obligation to China conference of 1990.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Recent anti-environmentalism ==
In recent decades, conservative political parties in North America have been supportive of an anti-environment agenda. In Canada, a main proprietor of this agenda in the past has been [[Stephen Harper]], the former Prime Minister of Canada.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/support-for-harpers-environmental-record-increasing-poll-shows/article22205337/|title=Support for Harper’s Environmental Record Increasing, Poll Shows|last=Wingrove|first=Josh|date=December 24, 2014|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, [[Environment Canada]] released its annual emissions trends report, which showed that Canada was not going to meet emission reduction targets as was promised in 2009. In fact, Canada is on track to increase its emissions up until 2020.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While Harper’s government originally committed to reducing emissions, Harper later stated it would be “crazy” to limit oil and gas emissions as the price of oil rose higher&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

This was consistent with Harper’s decision to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The main reason given for this by Harper was that Canada was not having success in meeting the protocol’s targets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In the following years, Harper’s administration made it difficult for environmental groups to operate in Canada. Environmental charities experienced frequent audits by the federal government which resulted in less productivity and being at risk of losing their charitable status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In addition; scientific institutions were eliminated, or were faced with obstacles such as reduced government funding, and rules put into place which made it increasingly difficult for government scientists to discuss their work with media outlets.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Scientific positions including the [[National Science Advisor (Canada)|National Science Advisor]] who is the point-person between the scientific community and the government, were phased out in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Harper also repealed a significant environmental policy which had previously been in place; the [[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]]. Later, a new version of the act was created, which critics argue allows the government to select which projects are assessed for their ecological impact and which are not.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2015, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] made climate change a primary concern during his first months of leadership.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In 2016, Trudeau signed the [[Paris Agreement]] which outlines the avenues the international community will pursue to keep global warming to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C above pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Trudeau also changed the name of Environment Canada to [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] which was an important milestone for environmentalists, as it acknowledges that climate change exists, and is of equal importance to other environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Recently, President [[Barack Obama]] promised to make the United States more environmentally conscious, and implemented the [[Clean Power Plan]], invested significantly in clean energy, and improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles; this reduced pollution and was also economical.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4564224/donald-trump-climate-change/|title=Donald Trump's Victory Could Mean Disaster for the Planet|last=Worland|first=Justin|date=November 9, 2016|website=Time|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Obama also made a joint agreement with China to reduce the emissions of both countries, and to reduce emissions in the United States by 27% by 2025.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The current state of environmental affairs in the United States has changed drastically once again with the new [[Donald Trump]] administration. Trump has been open about his plans to alter or withdraw entirely from many climate change and environmental agreements the United States is currently involved in, such as the Paris Agreement.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  As this agreement is voluntary, the United States would face no penalty if they declined to participate. However, as the United States is the second largest emitter of carbon after China, their lack of participation in the agreement would greatly impact global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; While in 1999, President Bill Clinton announced that the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) would enforce the toughest standards to date, Trump's administration recently instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to remove the climate change page from its website.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3203689/trump-epa-climate-change/|title=Donald Trump’s Administration Orders EPA to Pull Climate Change Page Off Website|last=Volcovici|first=Valerie|date=January 25, 2017|work=Global News|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EPA employees have stated that if the page is taken down, years of research on global warming will be gone, as well as detailed data on emissions and links to scientific global warming research.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; On June 1, 2017, Trump announced that the U.S. would [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|cease all participation]] in the Paris Agreement on [[climate change mitigation]]. Trump stated that "The Paris accord will undermine (the U.S.) economy," and "puts (the U.S.) at a permanent disadvantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/01/trump-u-s-to-withdraw-from-paris-climate-pact-calls-it-unfair-for-america.html|title=Paris Agreement on climate change: US withdraws as Trump calls it 'unfair'|date=June 1, 2017|publisher=Fox News|last1=Chakraborty|first1=Barnini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, the economy and population are putting a strain on the environment which has led to increased pollution and natural resources being depleted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Mexico has implemented an environmental, legal and institutional framework to minimize their negative impact on the environment, and it is now commonplace for sustainable development to be incorporated into policymaking.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This has resulted in improvements in air quality in urban areas, where previously many more individuals were seeing the negative impacts of pollution on their health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  As well, water management has become more decentralized, which has assisted municipalities in developing their own water and waste water infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This has also resulted in safer drinking water for residents of Mexico.

However, there are challenges that persist for Mexico in trying to become more sustainable. One of these challenges is that policymaking needs to be accompanied by capacity building within communities to be able to put policy into practice.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Deforestation is also still rampant in Mexico, occurring at one of the highest rates in the world.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The [[OECD]] recommends strengthening the implementation of legislation concerning nature conservation and reducing pollution using inspections. OECD also recommends increasing the funding Mexico receives from private, public and international sources so that infrastructure, mainly concerning waste water, can be more effectively implemented.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Investment in water infrastructure makes up approximately 50% of what Mexico requires, as only one quarter of urban waste water is treated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A recent collaborative development between all three North American countries is that of the North American Climate, Energy, and Environment Partnership.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/29/north-american-climate-clean-energy-and-environment-partnership-action|title=North American Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership Action Plan|last=|first=|date=June 29, 2016|website=The White House|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership was announced by Justin Trudeau, President Barack Obama, and President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] on June 29, 2016, at the North American Leaders Summit in Ottawa, Canada. The central pillars to this partnership include; advancing clean and secure energy; reducing climate pollutants; promoting clean and efficient transportation; protecting nature and advancing science and showing global leadership in addressing climate change.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4169">The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045529/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/ Australian Women's History Forum] (AWHF) is an organisation that exists to enhance the understanding of the role of women in the [[history of Australia]].

== Goals ==
Through its web presence and its sponsorship of [[Women's History Month]] (WHM), the AWHF aims to:
 
* recognise and promote awareness of and provide information on the history of women's contribution to [[Australia]];
* provide a focus for activities on women's history through its website, especially in WHM;
* stimulate women's history initiatives across educational and community sectors; and
* encourage institutions and organisations to hold local activities during WHM.

== Women's History Month ==
WHM, which is celebrated each year in March to coincide with [[International Women's Day]], was initiated in 2000 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110312112620/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/image.asp?iID=198 Helen Leonard], working with the National Women’s Media Centre and the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]].

Since 2005, each WHM has highlighted a particular area of women's achievement with a different theme celebrated each year. Organisations, institutions and community groups are encouraged to use this theme for their own WHM events through promotional material on the website and are supported by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100630125007/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/events.asp online calendar] where events are listed.

Past themes, such as ''Racy Women'' and ''Musical Belles''; and more recent themes, such as  ''Arm in Arm: Indigenous and non Indigenous Women Working Together'', can be explored in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045529/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/ online Gallery].

It was Helen's vision, drive and commitment, supported by the technical expertise of Gillian Pollack, which made the establishment of WHM in Australia possible.  After Helen’s untimely death in 2001, a group of committed women have continued and developed the work she had begun.  In 2007, the original WHM website was upgraded and renamed the AWHF to indicate a more interactive role with its membership – one  which would operate not only in March but throughout the entire year.  A Historians Reference Group, which was established to provide specialist advice and support to WHM, has continued in this role since the inception of the AWHF.

== Website ==
The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626045529/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/ AWHF website] is a gateway to online information on women who have shaped Australian history.  It is developed as a useful resource for teachers, students, journalists, professional historians, family and local historians, authors, librarians, archivists, curators and collectors. It is an interactive site and it will continue to grow as people add their own histories of not only well known women but also, perhaps more importantly, those thousands of women who have been the unsung trailblazers in our society.

It features a [https://web.archive.org/web/20081025074056/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/timeline.asp timeline] of key events, a [https://web.archive.org/web/20100726074800/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/whoswho.asp who's who list] and a list of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626062922/http://www.womenshistory.com.au/historicplaces.asp historic places] of significance to in Australian women's history.

WHM websites from 2002 are archived on the [[Pandora Archive|Pandora website]] and can be accessed through the [[National Library of Australia]].

'''Bārakzai''' ({{lang-ps|بارکزی}}, ''bārakzay'', plur. ''bārakzī'') is the name of a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe from present-day, [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]. '"Barakzai" is a common name among the Pashtuns and it means "son of [[Barak]]" in Pashto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Mike|title=An Intimate War: An Oral History of the Helmand Conflict, 1978-2012|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199387984|page=321|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OENeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=Barak,+Alak+and+Popol&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtjbe205DOAhXGuhoKHfI8AsgQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Barak%2C%20Alak%20and%20Popol&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2016|quote=In Pushtun folklore, Barak, Alak and Popol were brothers who went their separate ways to found tribes in their own namesake with the addition of the—zai (son of) suffix, for example, Barakzai.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven distinct Pashtun tribes named Barakzai, with the [[Zirak]] branch of the [[Durrani]] tribe being the most important and largest tribe with over 4 million people.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;

==History==
[[Ludwig W. Adamec]] wrote that the Barakzai are "an important section of the Zirak branch of the Durrani to which the former Barakzai/Muhammadzai ruling family belongs. In numbers, economic, and political strength, the Barakzai were the paramount tribe of Afghanistan...They were soldiers in the service of Nadir Shah, founder of the short-lived Afsharid dynasty in Iran, and were settled on land seized from the Ghilzai. They continued to hold jagirs, fiefs, in exchange for their military services to Ahmad Shah Durrani. When Painda Khan, leader of the Barakzais, was assassinated, the Barakzai chiefs under Dost Muhammad ousted and replaced the [[Sadduzai]] dynasty. The Barakzai continue to possess large areas of agricultural land and extensive flocks in the area between Herat and Kandahar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AAHna6aqtX4C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Barak+barakzai&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcvKSb0pDOAhXG2hoKHaAbDEIQ6AEIQjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Barak%20barakzai&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of Afghanistan 4th revised edition|date=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=978-0810878150|location=|page=81|pages=|quote=|via=|last1=Adamec|first1=Ludwig W.|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohammadzai==
'''[[Mohammadzai]]''' are the most prominent &amp; powerful sub-tribe of Barakzai, they belong to the [[Zirak]] branch of the [[Durrani]] confederacy, and are primarily centered around [[Kandahar]]. They can also be found in other provinces throughout Afghanistan as well across the border in the Pakistan's Balochistan Province.

[[Mohammadzai]] Barakzai are closely related to [[Amanullah Khan]].

'''Payendah Khel''' are descendants of Payendah Khan, head of the Mohammadzai branch of the Barakzai tribe during the reigns of Timur and Zaman Shah, who became rulers with the decline of the [[Sadozai (Pashtun tribe)|Sadozai dynasty]].

The '''[[Tarzi]]''' family is a branch of the [[Mohammadzai]] of [[Afghanistan]].  The founder of Tarzi family was [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalark.net/Afghanistan/tarzi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
From 1826 to 1978, most rulers of Afghanistan belonged to the two branches of one [[Barakzai dynasty]] descending from the chiefs of the Barakzai tribe (belonging to the [[Mohammadzai]] sub-tribe).&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us" /&gt;

The '''Bolton 7''' were a group of [[gay]] and [[bisexual]] men who were convicted on 12 January 1998 before Judge Michael Lever at [[Bolton]] Crown Court of the offences of gross indecency under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956]] and of [[age of consent]] offences under the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Although [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was partially decriminalised by the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]], they were all convicted under section 13 of the 1956 Act because more than two men had sex together, which was still illegal. One of the participants (Craig Turner) was also six months under the statutory [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] which was 18 at the time. 

==Offences==
Under the provisions of the 1967 Act, the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] was different from that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] of 16, and had only been reduced from 21 to 18 by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]. Equivalent [[heterosexual]] behaviour was not a crime.&lt;ref name=Dearden1999 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Dearden | first = Nick | title = The Queen and the 'Bolton Seven' | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 317-332 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1009218800557 | date = October 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009218800557 | quote= This note examines the case of a group of gay men who, having engaged in consensual sexual acts together, became known as the `Bolton Seven’ following their conviction in 1998 for offences of buggery and/or gross indecency. More particularly the note scrutinises the implications of the ages of the participants (one of whom, at 17 , was unable to give lawful consent to sexual intercourse with a man) in the light of the enactment of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which introduces a system of compulsory registration by some convicted and cautioned sex offenders with the police (including men convicted of, or cautioned for, buggery or gross indecency). The note explores the justification for inclusion of these offences within the remit of the 1997 Act together with the cultural construction of gay men as predatory and as constituting a risk to younger members of society. It also analyses some of the effects of the registration requirement in terms of it constituting a potential violation of fundamental rights such as equality and respect for private life. This discussion is located particularly within the context of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the U.K. | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offences only came to light after police seized videos of the men having sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All the men were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.

==Sentences==
During [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] on 20 February 1998 Gary Abdie, David Godfrey, Mark Love and Jonathan Moore (all of whom were in their early 20s), and Craig Turner (17 at the time of the offences but 18 when he appeared in court) were given [[probation]] and [[community service]] orders. The Judge gave Norman Williams a two-year [[suspended sentence|suspended prison sentence]] and Terry Connell received a nine-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay £500 towards the cost of the prosecution. Moore (20), Williams (33) and Connell (55) were also required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for the [[age of consent]] offences committed with Turner. Estimates of the overall cost of the prosecution were in the region of £500,000.

Despite their convictions, none of them received custodial sentences possibly as a  result of a high-profile campaign led by gay [[human rights]] group [[OutRage!]]. Over 400 letters were presented to the court in support of the men including those from MPs, Bishops and [[human rights]] groups. The letters urged the judge not to impose a custodial sentence, with one group, [[Amnesty International]], pledging to declare the men prisoners of conscience should they be imprisoned.

==Aftermath==
In 2000, six of the men appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] arguing that the prosecutions against them had violated their rights under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by interfering with 'the right to respect for a private family life' enshrined in article 8  of the Convention. They were subsequently awarded compensation. As Williams was not part of the litigation, he was not deemed eligible by the Home Office for the compensation.

Legislation subsequently introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government has broadly equalised the treatment of [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] behaviours in criminal law. The [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] equalised the [[age of consent]] for [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]] with that of the [[heterosexual]] [[age of consent]] which is now 16 for both. The [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], though subject to some controversy, introduced an overhaul in the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions that date as far back to the 1956 legislation. The offences of gross indecency and [[buggery]] have been repealed and sexual activity between more than two men is no longer a [[crime in the United Kingdom]].

Specifically, ''mensalão'' typically referred to the practice of transferring taxpayer funds as monthly allowances to members of congress from other political parties in consideration for their support and votes in congress. Politicians used the state-owned and state-run oil company [[Petrobras]] to raise hundreds of millions of reais for political campaigns and personal enrichment.

Corruption was cited among many issues that provoked the [[2013 protests in Brazil|2013 protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-988431 What's REALLY behind the Brazilian riots?] [[CNN]] June 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption reduced public investments in health, education, infrastructure, security, housing, among other essential rights, expanding [[social exclusion]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Definition==
All types of corruption exist. [[Clientelism|Clientilism]], [[cronyism]] and [[nepotism]] are widespread in Brazil, and many critics mention how some of the members of Brazilian Supreme Court are seen openly mingling with politicians. Bribery (called ''propina'' or ''suborno'' in Portuguese) is also rife in the police force and throughout the Brazilian bureaucracy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} But one of the most common types of corruption in Brazil is embezzlement of public funds through [[overbilling]], called ''superfaturamento'' in Portuguese (literally "super invoicing"). This technique allows individuals to make financial gains, and also finance political campaigns (as seen in the Petrobras scandal), and is closely linked to public contracts with private enterprises.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Construction is a prime example, for example in building roads, sewage, and public buildings. It is estimated that 30% of all Brazilian public funds are embezzled this way each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/opiniao/fz0903201001.htm|title=Folha de S.Paulo - Editoriais: O custo da corrupção - 09/03/2010|website=www1.folha.uol.com.br|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrobras president Aldemir Bendine in 2015 estimated the companies losses to corruption scandals at $2 billion US. The company's stock declined, although it later began to recover.

==Measurement==
The scale of corruption in Brazil is immense, but largely under-reported in the media and historically not investigated, prosecuted or punished, so it is difficult to estimate just how large the problem is. The Car Wash (Lava Jato) investigation may be changing this trend. Corruption in Brazil increases the already enormous Brazilian shadow economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etico.org.br/user_file/shadowEconomy/03_Artigo_Tanzi_Shadow_Economy.pdf|title=Brazilian Shadow Economy|last=Tanzi|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some sources estimate at 16.1% of the [[gross domestic product]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-business/brazils-informal-economy-was-worth-r826-billion-in-2014/|title=Brazil's Informal Economy was Worth R$826 Billion in 2014 {{!}} The Rio Times {{!}} Brazil News|last=Reporter|first=Contributing|date=2015-06-26|newspaper=The Rio Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number that probably needs to be adjusted up considerably if corruption as such is included as part of the shadow economy. Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 79th place out of 176 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015|title=Transparency International - The Global Anti-Corruption Coalition|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|date=|website=www.transparency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political corruption==

Political corruption is considered to be widespread in Brazil. A series of sources documenting historical corruption have only recently started to be published, some of them with references up to Colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Romeiro |first1=Adriana |title=Corrupção e poder no Brasil: uma história, séculos XVI a XVIII |date=2017 |publisher=Editora Autentica |location=Belo Horizonte |isbn=9788551302682}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martins |first1=Fernando |title=Pequena história da corrupção no Brasil |url=https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vida-publica/pequena-historia-da-corrupcao-no-brasil-9y0cqugk561vl4rrhkgaz4fqo/ |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=Gazeta do Povo |publisher=Grupo Paranaense de Comunicação |date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A unique complex network analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Haroldo |last2=Alves |first2=Luis |last3=Martins |first3=Alvaro |last4=Lenzi |first4=Ervin |last5=Perc |first5=Matjaz |title=The dynamical structure of political corruption networks |journal=Journal of Complex Networks |date=2018 |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01869}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed associations between those involved in corruption scandals included not only active (elected and non-elected) politicians, but also companies, both state-owned and private companies which had been favored in selection processes for execution of large infrastructure projects, some of which were cited both in the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]]. 
The complexity of such corruption networks has been compared to the mafia, drug traffic networks and terrorist networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Por trás do verdadeiro mecanismo de corrupção do Brasil |url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/03/28/politica/1522247105_599766.html |accessdate=20 October 2018 |work=El Pais |date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of "superfaturamento"—overbilling—in Brazil is considered to be extremely common in contracts and purchases for public institutions. Recent examples have been reported in small primary schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ovale.com.br/psdb-ve-superfaturamento-em-compra-de-kits-escolares-1.500920|title=PSDB vê superfaturamento em compra de kits escolares|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where products like pencils and notebooks were bought with padded invoices, as well as in grand-scale construction projects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,para-lembrar-o-escandalo-de-superfaturamento-na-construcao-do-forum-trabalhista-de-sao-paulo,10000001753|title=Para lembrar o escandalo de superfaturamento na construcao do Forum Trabalhista de Sao Paulo|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/ap/amapa/noticia/2016/08/tcu-identifica-superfaturamento-na-obra-do-aeroporto-de-macapa.html|title=TCU identifica superfaturamento na obra do aeroporto de Macapa|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2016/11/tcu-ve-indicios-de-superfaturamento-de-r-34-bi-em-obras-de-belo-monte.html|title=TCU vê indícios de superfaturamento de R$ 3,4 bi em obras de Belo Monte|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; roads,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/mato-grosso/noticia/2017/01/governo-investiga-7-servidores-por-superfaturamento-em-obra-de-rodovia.html|title=Governo investiga 7 servidores por superfaturamento em obra de rodovia|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;(not least in connection with large scale events such as the [[Olympics]] and FIFA's [[World Cup]]). A particularly sad example is the city of Brasilia itself, which historians believe was systematically overpriced when built in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historiabrasileira.com/brasil-republica/governo-de-juscelino-kubitscheck/|title=Governo de Juscelino Kubitscheck|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military Era ===
Little evidence of corruption became public during the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|Military Dictatorship era]] (1964-1988). However, several cases increasingly are becoming public and were reviewed in books including [[Elio Gaspari]]'s series, historical analyses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campos |first1=Pedro Henrique Pereira |title=Estranhas Catedrais.

British documents pointed out a number of other cases which were muffled in the 1970s referring to overpriced purchase of UK equipment for construction of ships in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ditadura abafou apuração de corrupção dos anos 70, revelam documentos britânicos |url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/06/ditadura-abafou-apuracao-de-corrupcao-dos-anos-70-revelam-documentos-britanicos.shtml |accessdate=21 October 2018 |work=Folha de S. Paulo |date=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarney Government ===
With the fall of the Military dictatorship, with the start of redemocratization process, accusations of corruption started to hit the news and receive attention, involving all levels of government, including then-president [[José Sarney]], although the accusations ceased to be processed in the National Congress. The main citations referred to overbilling and irregularities in public infrastructure projects in collaboration with private companies, such as the case of the [[Ferrovia Norte-Sul]] (Norte-Sul Railway).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desempregozero.org.br/editoriais/ferrovia_nortesul_entre_a_prioridade_e_a_ideologia.php Editorial sítio ''Desemprego Zero'']&lt;/ref&gt; Sarney was also accused of practicing [[nepotism]], favouring relatives and friends in radio and TV concessions. The dissatisfaction led part of the [[Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro]] (PMDB) to leave and establish the [[Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira]] (PSDB). The apex of the political crisis occurred during the production of the new Constitution, at the [[Assembleia Nacional Constituinte de 1987]], where the length of Sarney's government was put in check, and in the end kept at 5 years, as opposed to 4.

A Parlamentary Investigation Commission (CPI) was started in 1988 to investigate the corruption accusations, and several requests for impeachment were filed.&lt;ref name="Videos e fotos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/infograficos/rede-escandalos/perfil/jose-sarney.shtml|title="Tesoureira da Igreja Universal nos Estados Unidos é condenada"| publisher=''Rede de escândalos''|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collor Government ===
One of the most notorious cases of corruption scandals resulted in the fall of President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], indicated as the first Latin American president to suffer an actual impeachment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/historia-brasil/impeachment-collor-foi-primeiro-alvo-de-impeachment-na-america-latina.jhtm|editor=Uol Educação|title=Collor foi o primeiro alvo de impeachment na América Latina|author=Carlos Ferreira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first accusations appeared right in the second semester of Collor's government. The then president of [[Petrobras]], Luís Octávio da Motta Veiga, quit, allegating he was under pressure from the former financial secretary of Collor's campaign, [[Paulo César Farias]] ("PC Farias"), and the president's brother-in-law, ambassador Marcos Coimbra, to offer loans to the airline company [[VASP]], which had been recently privatized. In 1991 the First Lady [[Rosane Malta|Rosane Collor]] was accused of irregularities at the charity Legião Brasileira de Assistência (LBA). In May 1992, Pedro Collor, the president's brother, accused PC Farias of illicit enrichment and being a "goon" for the president in his business in an interview to [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]].&lt;ref name="oglobo.globo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/a-incomoda-companhia-dos-escandalos-casos-de-corrupcao-estouraram-em-todos-os-governos-15598762#ixzz5FLUKNBcWstest |title=A incômoda companhia dos escândalos: casos de corrupção estouraram em todos os governos|publisher=Uol|date=March 16, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandals piled up until 1993, when another Parliament Investigation Committee (CPI) was established, which became popularly known as the "[[Anões do Orçamento|CPI do Orçamento]]", presided by then-senator [[Jarbas Passarinho]]. However, in 2014, the accusations were removed by the [[Supremo Tribunal Federal]] and Collor was exculpate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2014/04/28/apos-absolvicao-collor-pergunta-quem-me-devolvera-o-que-me-foi-tomado.htm|title=Após absolvição, Collor pergunta: 'Quem me devolverá o que me foi tomado?'|publisher=Uol|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fernando Henrique Cardoso Government ===
[[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s government led by the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) was also hit by a series of corruption accusations, firstly regarding federal "help" offered to banks such [[Banco Nacional|Nacional]] and [[Banco Econômico|Econômico]], and the creation of the [[Programa de Estímulo à Reestruturação e ao Fortalecimento do Sistema Financeiro Nacional]] (Proer).

Many of the issues were identified in privatization of State companies. One of the people cited in accusations was former director of [[Banco do Brasil]], Ricardo Sérgio de Oliveira, which was on charge of financial resources for FHC's campaign, and who would have favored business with a consortium formed with [[Telecom Itália]] and [[Daniel Dantas (entrepreneur)|Daniel Dantas]]' Opportunity Asset bank. Phone call recordings were central to several accusations regarding [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party|PSDB]]. Conversations between the minister of Communiations, [[Luiz Carlos Mendonça de Barros]], and the then-president of the Brazilian Development Bank, [[BNDES]], André Lara Resende, demonstrated the efforts to bennefit the Opportunity consortium.&lt;ref name="oglobo.globo.com"/&gt;

Probably the worst accusations referred to the purchase of Congress votes to introduce a [[constitutional amendment]] to allow for the [[reelection]] of Executive roles, namely the President's. Telephone recordings leaked by [[Folha de S.Paulo]] in 1997 revealed conversations between representative [[Ronivon Santiago]] ([[Progressistas|Progressistas Party]] - State of [[Acre]]) and a ''Senhor X'', where Santiago reports to have received, along with another four representatives, 200 thousand reais to vote for the reelection amendment, which had been paid by the then governor of the state of Acre, [[Orleir Cameli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/80anos/marcos_do_jornalismo-01a.shtml|autor=RODRIGUES, Fernando|título=Deputado diz que vendeu seu voto a favor da reeleição por R$ 200 mil|publicado=Uol|obra=Folha de S.Paulo|data=13 de maio de 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2000-2001, the attentions in FHC's government had moved from the corruption accusations to the energy crisis ("Crise do Apagão"), which happened right after the wave of [[1999 Southern Brazil blackout|blackouts started in 1999]]. The 1999 blackout was blamed on a lightning strike, although researchers at the [[National Institute for Space Research]] (INPE) demonstrated the official version to not hold. FHC tried to awart a similar crisis in 2001 by imposing [[energy rationing]].

=== Lula Government ===
{{main|Mensalão scandal}}
While Lula was in office reports surfaced of payments made to deputies in return for a pledge to support the government with their votes in Congress. According to investigators more than a dozen construction companies bribed or gave kickbacks to corrupt politicians in return for profitable contracts with state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. Former president of {{ILL|Grupo OAS|pt}} Jose Aldemario Pinheiro and OAS executive Agenor Medeiros each were sentenced to 16 years incarceration on 6 August 2015. Three other OAS employees received shorter sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil businessmen sentenced to 16 years over Petrobras scandal|publisher=BBC|access-date=July 26, 2017|date=August 6, 2015|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-33798557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation Car Wash ===
{{main|Operation Car Wash}}
Operation Car Wash is an investigation being carried out by the [[Brazil Federal Police|Federal Police of Brazil]], Curitiba Branch, and judicially ordered by Judge [[Sérgio Moro]] on March 17, 2014. Initially a [[money laundering]] investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at the state-owned oil company [[Petrobras]], whose executives took [[kickback (bribe)|kickbacks]] for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. The operation has issued more than a hundred search warrants, and ordered temporary and preventive detention and coercive measures in its investigation of a money laundering scheme suspected of moving more than {{R$|38.1 billion|link=yes}}" (approximately {{USD|11.3bn|link=yes}}) as of November 22, 2016. Because of the unusual nature of its actions, defendants' lawyers accuse the operation of "selectivity" and "partiality", and of being "a criminal case that violated minimum rules of defense for a large number of defendants".&lt;ref&gt;http://pradella.jusbrasil.com.br/noticias/297190364/leia-o-manifesto-dos-advogados-que-comparam-lava-jato-a-inquisicao Pradella, Thiago de Carvalho. Leia o manifesto dos advogados que comparam Lava Jato à Inquisição. JusBrasil. January, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the investigation, former Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]], who chaired the board of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, denied knowledge of any wrongdoing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costas|first1=Ruth|title=Petrobras scandal: Brazil's energy giant under pressure|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30129184|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=BBC|date=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian Supreme Court authorized the investigation of 48 current and former legislators, including former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], in March 2016.

Operation Car Wash has greatly impacted Brazilian politics, resulting in the arrest of many important political figures, including:
* Treasurer of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], [[João Vaccari Neto]], arrested for receiving "irregular donations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jelmayer|first1=Rogerio|title=Brazil Police Arrest Workers' Party Treasurer Joao Vaccari Neto|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-police-arrest-workers-party-treasurer-joao-vaccari-neto-1429100123|accessdate=27 August 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
To counteract widespread corruption in the private and public sector, Brazil enacted the Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12, 846), which held companies responsible for the corrupt practices of their employees and liable without a finding of fault. [[Bid rigging]] and [[fraud]] are prohibited in public procurement, as well as bribery of Brazilian public officials. If found guilty of corruption the companies can be suspended, dissolved or fined.

== Ranking of corruption ==
Based on data released by the [[Superior Electoral Court]], the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption released a balance on 4 October 2007 with the parties that include the largest number of parliamentarians quashed by electoral corruption since 2000. The [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]]  appeared in third place on the list with 58 cases, behind only the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]].&lt;ref name="O Globo 04-10-2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Desde 2000, 623 políticos foram cassados.

According to analysis released on 8 September 2012, of 317 Brazilian politicians who were barred from running in elections by the [[Ficha Limpa|Clean Record Act]] the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] is the party that has the largest number of barred candidates with 56 party members.&lt;ref name="FichaLimpa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Talita Abrantes|title=PSDB tem o maior número de barrados pelo Ficha Limpa|work=Exame|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/noticias/psdb-tem-o-maior-numero-de-barrados-pelo-ficha-limpa|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Croats}}
'''Croats of Belgium''' are an [[ethnic group]] in [[Belgium]]. About 10,000 of Belgians stated that they have [[Croats|Croatian]] roots, according to the Croatian associations and Catholic missions. They appeared in Belgium for the first time during the [[Thirty years' war]], as a part of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] and [[Early modern France|French]] cavalry. Even today, the exact number of Croats in Belgium is unknown, mostly because they were considered as [[Yugoslavs]] by Belgian government. During the last years, number of Croats in Belgium is increasing because of immigrants from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The number of Croats didn't pass the number of 10,000 since the [[World War II]] when Croatia was part of a larger country [[Yugoslavia]].

== History ==
[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] had settled Croats in [[Flanders]] around the [[Dunkerque]] (then ''Duinkerken'') to serve him as soldiers. Later, [[Croats|Croatian]] travel writer, [[Feliks Gladić]], in 17th century found that there are still Croats in Belgium, who still speak [[Croatian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Josip Horvat: Povijest i kultura Hrvata kroz 1000. godina: od velikih seoba do 18. stoljeća, Knjigotisak, Split, 2009. str. 239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hic.hr/dom/376/dom05.htm HIC-Dom i svijet br.379/2002.] Croats of France&lt;/ref&gt; Those Croats were [[Uskoks]] from [[Senj]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/p1povjesthrvatao06klaiuoft/p1povjesthrvatao06klaiuoft_djvu.txt Archive.org] Vjekoslav Klaić: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svretka XIX. stoljeća&lt;/ref&gt;

In that time, [[Dunkerque]] was part of [[Netherlands]] as whole [[Belgium]] also. In year 1662 town of [[Dunkerque]] became part of [[Early modern France|France]] as King of England, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] sold it to the [[French people|French]].

=== Early 20th century===
As [[Belgium]] was one of the most developed states in Europe in early 20th century, part of Croats emigrated in it searching for better life. Moreover, the first wave of emigration started with creation of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and because of anti-Croatian politics of that state in 1918. Most of emigrants were peasants and workers from [[Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Lika]].
Croats were mostly workers at steel foundry, ironworks, mines of coal and such. At first, Croats done the hardest jobs, but they were highly respected for their famous devoted work and cleverness. Soon, Croats become employers and chiefs to some Belgians.

After the [[assassination of Stjepan Radić]] and of Yugoslav King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] in 1928-1929, and the consequent repression against Croatian nationalism, the number of Croats in Belgium increased, including many members of the [[Ustaše]] movement, secretly active also in Belgium, among which the Herzegovinian Croat general [[Rafael Boban]], later [[US Army]] officer. 

At the time, the number of Croats in Belgium was 25,000 to 30,000. Most of Croats resided in [[Wallonia]] in the cities of [[Liège]] and [[Charleroi]] and in their surroundings. 

In 1932, under the influence of the brothers [[Antun Radić|Antun]] and [[Stjepan Radić]], Belgian Croats founded the first branch of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] abroad in [[Jemeppe-sur-Sambre]] near [[Liège]]. The branch was later registered as the Mutual Aid Association "Croatian Peasant Party" ({{lang-hr|"Hrvatski seljački savez"}}). They couldn't act like a political organization because of Belgian laws and the protests of the Yugoslav government.

Before [[World War II]] only a small number of Croats had university degrees - among them dr. [[Ivan Puljić (politician)|Ivan Puljić]] and economist [[Ante Klarić]]. In time of [[World War II]] most of Croats had stayed in Belgium, only the members of [[Ustaše]] left the country for [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]]. After the war, big part of Croats leaves industrial sector and employees in the trade sector, where they have big successes. Also, big number of Croats arrives in new, communist [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], but soon, disappointed with communist policy, they again leave the country, but this time they emigrate to overseas. Croats that remained in Belgium married with Belgian women, because number of Croats in Belgium at the time was very small.

===Post-war migration wave===
The first part of the second wave of immigration was composed of political emigrants. Thousands of Croats flees [[SFR Yugoslavia]], big part of them were former [[Ustaše]] and [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Domobran]] soldiers. Most of those Ustaše emigrants soon left Belgium for other destinations overseas ([[Canada]], [[United States]], [[Australia]]). Those political emigrants who stayed in Belgium received asylum from [[United Nations]].

Also thanks to this new influx, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] in Belgium saw a revival; the party leader, [[Vladko Maček]], resided in exile in Paris until death in 1964. The branch organised ceremonies, cultural programs and celebrations on the anniversary of the death of [[Stjepan Radić]]. There was also a [[Croatian National Committee]] in Belgium. They convened a Second Assembly in [[Brussels]] in 1977, which was met with fierce criticism from the Yugoslav government. Assemblies of Croats were also organized by the priests who gather them on ceremonies and mass.

The Croatian Peasant Party also organised a trade union, the  Croatian Worker's Union (''Hrvatski radnički savez''), with headquarters in [[Charleroi]]. There were also few sport and cultural societies, of which some are still active today. Among others, there were also few Yugoslav clubs under the patronage of the Yugoslav embassy, which served for espionage of Croats in Belgium.

Except for a few newsletters, there was also a monthly newspapers ''Hrvatski glas'' ("Croatian voice") that had been published in the 1950s and 1960s as formal newspapers of [[Croatian Peasant Party]] in Europe. They were edited by Oton Orešković, who was a former quartermaster of Croatian National Theatre. Those newspapers were printed on their own linotype which was a gift from the American trade union [[AFL-CIO]] to the Croatian Worker's Union. Oton Orešković, in cooperation with Delonoy published a comprehensive study in the review ''Historia'' on [[Ante Pavelić]]'s rise to power until his life in exile.

A further wave of immigration started after the quelling of the [[Croatian Spring]] by the Yugoslav communist regime in 1971. Thousands of Croats fleed again to Belgium, some of them individually and some with their family. Most of them Croats soon left Belgium for [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], smaller part went in [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South America]]. Also, some of them scattered all around Europe. Soon Croats with higher education also moved from Belgium.
After the 1970s and the death of communist dictator [[Josip Broz Tito]], only Croats who worked for Yugoslav companies arrived in Belgium.

The real political life of Belgian Croats started with the foundation of [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and arrival of [[Franjo Tuđman]] on the Croatian political scene. The first Croats of Belgium registered as HDZ members even before the first democratic elections. With sequence of events, Croats of Belgium founded branches of Croatian Democratic Union (in 1990 and 1991) in [[Antwerp]], [[Brussels]] and [[Liège]]. The founders were later immigrants who came after World War II, and in less numbers, heirs of immigrants from the first wave of immigration. Croats in Belgium mostly helped financially by sending money to hospitals, charities and military budget. The money came mainly through HDZ branches.
At the start of [[Croatian Homeland War]], Belgian Croats founded Croatian Supplementary School, under patronage of the [[Croatian Ministry of Education]].

== Croats in Belgium today ==
Croatian political organizations that are still active are branches of Croatian Democratic Union, Croatian Peasant Party and [[Croatian Liberation Movement]]. Other active Croatian organizations are the Sport and Cultural Society "Croatia" from Antwerp, "SOS-Croatia" from [[Merchtem]] near [[Brussels]], "HNK Croatia" (Croatian National Theater "Croatia") in Liège, association of Croatian students "AMAC" in Brussels, charity organization "Edmond Jardas" (they are mostly helping children of killed Croatian soldiers), Cultural society "Vatroslav Lisinski" from Liège, "Hrvatski radio sat" ("Croatian Radio Hour") from Liège (founded by members of HSK and Belgian-born Croats, promoting Croatian culture, tourism and return of Croats back to homeland). The head organization is the Croatian World Congress of Belgium led by Dr. [[Miroslav Klarić]]. 

One of the most important factors in saving of Croatian identity in Belgium is the Catholic Church. Because of misunderstanding of Croatian emigration and Government in Croatia those organizations and societies are being reduced.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Demography==
It is difficult to determine with certainty the number, age structure of Croats in Belgium, their economic status and level of national identity, especially among the descendants of the first settlers. The biggest number of Croats, 5,000-6,000 from first and third generation, still live in [[Wallonia]] in area [[Liège]]. Croatian immigrants from the first wave of immigration who moved to Belgium in the late 1920s are almost all dead, so their children and later immigrants represent the Croats of Belgium. A very small number of Croats have returned to their homeland, especially the heirs of the first immigrants. 

Later, most Croatian immigrants settled around the area of [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]] in [[Flanders]] where the economic situation is nowadays better. The Croatian national identity is still strong, even with the third generation of immigrants, even though there is a small number of those who know they are Croats, but Croatia doesn't mean much to them. Also, there are increasing applications at Croatian schools and interest in the [[Croatian language]]. The first generation were mostly workers, while the second and third generation had better education and employment.

==Notable Croats in Belgium==
{{further information|:Category:Belgian people of Croatian descent}}
The contribution of Croats to development of Belgium is mostly due to hard-working Croats who worked in Belgian factories and mines. After World War II, Croats of Belgium had three university professors: Dr. [[Zvonimir Pintarović]], geneticist; Dr. [[Miroslav Radman]], sociologist; [[Danilo Klarić]] and other few doctors, professors, lawyers, economists, academic painters and architects.

Besides, Croats also contributed to the Belgian sports. The most famous sportsmen are [[Tomislav Ivić]], [[Mario Stanić]], [[Robert Špehar]], [[Josip Weber]] and others. Few Croats also successfully imported canned fish, medicinal plants and vines (Fabris, Divić, Vunić). Croats also work in catering, radios and various Belgian ministries.

Though neither she nor her husband underwent a [[coronation]], a consort crown was specially created for her on the occasion of the 1855 [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]]. It is set with emeralds and diamonds in eagle and [[honeysuckle]] vine motifs.

After her husband was overthrown in 1870, following the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Napoleon and Eugénie lived in exile in the [[United Kingdom]]. She died in 1920.

Though most of the [[French Crown Jewels]] were sold by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 1885, the Crown of Empress Eugénie was kept and is on display in the [[Louvre]] museum in [[Paris]].

'''David Isaac Bruck''' (born 1949) is an American [[criminal defense attorney]], clinical professor of law at [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]], and director of the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse. Bruck has represented several high-profile defendants.

==Early life and education==
Bruck was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to an affluent family.&lt;ref name=people&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cerio|first1=Gregory|title=Death on Trial|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20101053,00.html|website=people.com|publisher=People|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruck is one of three children of Gerald, a retired textile executive, and Nina, a photographer.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

While an undergraduate at [[Harvard College]], Bruck became involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; Bruck was a contributor to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David I. Bruck Profile|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/2454/David_I._Bruck/|website=thecrimson.com|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one piece, he called on students to refuse to take their finals in protest of [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keller|first1=Morton|title=Making Harvard Modern: The Rise of America's University|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BefhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT334&amp;lpg=PT334&amp;dq=david+bruck+harvard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3opBQF5P7f&amp;sig=_6ewDJuRjGi572iJ1Ia4s3ysbq0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i9smVbuvD4LksAXor4DgBQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20bruck%20harvard&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruck earned a Bachelor of Arts ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard College]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=wlu&gt;{{cite web|title=David Bruck Profile|url=http://law2.wlu.edu/faculty/profiledetail.asp?id=143|website=law2.wlu.edu|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Bruck attended [[University of South Carolina School of Law]]. He went to law school at the University of South Carolina so that he could advise reluctant inductees at the Army's [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]].&lt;ref name=people/&gt; During law school, Bruck worked as a welder to pay for his schooling because he didn't want to be beholden to his family.&lt;ref name=people/&gt; While at the University of South Carolina, he met his friend and colleague [[Judy Clarke]]. He earned his law degree ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1975. Before beginning his law practice, he travelled throughout the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=truecrime&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Scott|title=True Crime: 12 Most Notorious Murder Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dC-CBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT580&amp;lpg=PT580&amp;dq=david+bruck+travelled+canada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2B531uKkVV&amp;sig=4GkR2iQ29l7alUFDeC4fXA1sDIg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=19smVY_eAYixsAXa1ICQCg&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20bruck%20travelled%20canada&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
Bruck eventually returned to South Carolina to represent clients facing the death penalty because he did not believe these defendants were receiving adequate representation.&lt;ref name=truecrime/&gt; Bruck was also disturbed that the death row population consisted mostly of poor black men.&lt;ref name=truecrime/&gt; One fellow law school classmates said of Bruck: "He wanted to assist people who were defenseless. Many of us felt that way in school, but David was one of the few who devoted his career to it."&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

From 1976-1980, Bruck worked as a public defender in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt; From 1980-1988, Bruck worked in private practice.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt; From 1989-92, Bruck was the Chief Attorney of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt; From 1992-2004, Bruck returned to private practice.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt; Since 1992, Bruck served as Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel to the federal defender program.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt; Bruck represented Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Masud al-Safarini who received a life sentence for his role in the 1986 hijacking of [[Pan Am Flight 73]] in Pakistan in which 22 people were killed.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Travis|title=Tsarnaev legal team asks to add a lawyer|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/15/tsarnaev-legal-team-wants-add-death-penalty-specialist/8LX3x32Mkm3CyUW7kNqtBO/story.html|website=newyorktimes.com|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bruck handled as many death penalty cases as he could in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=deathrow&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=The Lawyers of Death Row|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/14/magazine/the-lawyers-of-death-row.html?pagewanted=1|website=newyorktimes.com|publisher=NYT|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruck represented dozens of people charged with capital murder before juries or on post-conviction.&lt;ref name=truecrime/&gt; Before his representation of Susan Smith in 1995, Bruck had only lost three to death sentences.&lt;ref name=truecrime/&gt; Bruck saved many of his clients by winning new trials that resulted in life sentences and in one case, an acquittal.&lt;ref name=truecrime/&gt; Bruck has argued several cases before the [[United States Supreme Court]], prevailing in six of them: Kelly v. South Carolina (2002), [[Shafer v. South Carolina]] (2001), Ramdass v. Angelone (2000), Simmons v. South Carolina (1994), Yates v. Evatt (1991), Yates v. Aiken (1988), [[Skipper v. South Carolina]] (1986).&lt;ref name=oyez&gt;{{cite web|title=David I. Bruck - Oyez Profile|url=https://www.oyez.org/advocates/b/d/david_i_bruck|website=oyez.org|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

===Susan Smith===
In 1995, Bruck and [[Judy Clarke]] served as co-counsel for [[Susan Smith]], the [[South Carolina]] woman who faced the death penalty in [[South Carolina Circuit Court]] for killing her two sons. Bruck became friends with Clarke during law school, and recruited her for the case.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bragg|first1=Rick|title=Arguments Begin in Susan Smith Trial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/19/us/arguments-begin-in-susan-smith-trial.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their opening statement, Clarke argued Smith was deeply troubled and suffered from severe depression.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; Clarke told the jury: "This is not a case about evil.This is a case about despair and sadness."&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; The defense's theory of the case was that Smith drove to the edge of the lake to kill herself and her two sons, but her body willed itself out of the car.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; The prosecution, on the other hand, believed Smith murdered her children in order to start a new life with a former lover.&lt;ref name="Smith Trial"/&gt; It only took the jury two and a half hours to convict her of murdering her two sons. During the penalty phase, Tommy Pope, the lead prosecutor in the Smith case, argued passionately in favor of sentencing Smith to death. But the jury ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neill|first1=Ann|title=Lawyer keeps even the most loathed criminals off death row|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/12/arizona.judy.clarke.profile/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law professor===
In 2002, he began teaching at [[Washington &amp; Lee University School of Law]]. Since 2004, he has been a clinical professor of law and director of the Virginia Capital Case Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name=wlu/&gt;

===Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev===
In 2014, Bruck was appointed to the defense team working with [[Boston Marathon bombing]] suspect [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=David|title=David Bruck added to Tsarnaev defense team|url=http://masslawyersweekly.com/2014/02/20/death-penalty-expert-added-to-tsarnaev-defense-team/|website=masslawyersweekly.com|publisher=MA Lawyers Weekly|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke described Bruck as "one of the most experienced and well-regarded capital defense attorneys in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Travis|title=Tsarnaev legal team asks to add lawyer|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/07/15/tsarnaev-legal-team-wants-add-death-penalty-specialist/8LX3x32Mkm3CyUW7kNqtBO/story.html|website=bostonglobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal jury convicted Tsarnaev of all 30 charges against him and found him responsible for the deaths of the three people killed in the 2013 attack and the killing of an MIT police officer three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavoie|first1=Denise|title=Tsarnaev’s lawyer faces perhaps her biggest challenge yet|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/tsarnaevs-lawyer-faces-perhaps-her-biggest-challenge-yet/|website=seattletimes.com|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same jury sentenced Tsarnaev to death.

===Dylann Roof===
[[Dylann Roof]], the killer of nine people in the [[Charleston church shooting]], represented himself in federal court, with Bruck as stand-by counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Meet Dylan Roof's Defender|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/07/29/meet-dylann-roof-s-defender|publisher=The Marshall Project|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof was convicted by jury on all 33 counts on December 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hersher|first1=Rebecca|title=Jury Finds Dylann Roof Guilty In S.C. Church Shooting|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/15/505723552/jury-finds-dylann-roof-guilty-in-s-c-church-shooting|website=npr|publisher=NPR|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10th, 2017, after three hours of jury deliberation Dylann Roof was sentenced to death.

==Views==
Bruck opposes capital punishment. He said of the practice: "I find the cold-bloodedness of the whole ritual appalling. To take somebody...and so premeditatedly set about exterminating them."&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

'''Wichian Klanprasert''', a Thai police officer, allegedly was killed by '''Vorayuth Yoovidhya''', grandson of billionaire [[Red Bull]] co-founder [[Chaleo Yoovidhya]], in a [[hit-and-run]] incident in Bangkok, Thailand, on 3 September 2012.

Vorayuth was charged with speeding, fleeing the scene of an accident, and reckless driving causing death, but has never been arrested. The statute of limitations on the speeding charge expired in September 2013, and on the fleeing the scene of an accident charge in September 2017.

The case is widely seen as an example of how the affluent in Thai society are able to escape the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=AP-20170328&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bull heir enjoys jet-set life 4 years after hit-and-run| url=https://apnews.com/7737b2dc823145b0a835ed66bdaeea7b/Red-Bull-heir-enjoys-jet-set-life-4-years-after-hit-and-run|accessdate=3 April 2017|agency=Associated Press|date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-20170402&gt;{{cite news|last1=Head|first1=Jonathan|title=The untouchable Red Bull heir in Thailand|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39427291|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=BBC News|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TS-20170330&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/03/30/prosecutors-in-thailand-postpone-appearance-for-red-bull-heir-vorayuth-boss-yoovidhya|title=Spoiled brat Red Bull heir wins new delay|first1=Brad|last1=Hunter|work=Toronto Sun|date=2017-03-30|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BP-20170401&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rithdee|first1=Kong|title='Boss' Strides Atop Pyramid of Justice|url=https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20170401/281831463574815|accessdate=6 January 2018|work=Bangkok Post|via=Pressreader|date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 hit-and-run==
Wichian, a Thai police senior sergeant-major, was riding a motorcycle when he was hit by a speeding Ferrari which dragged his body along the road for over 100 metres before it fled the scene. The Ferrari was later found to have been driven by Vorayuth, a grandson of billionaire [[Red Bull]] co-founder [[Chaleo Yoovidhya]]. Vorauth's lawyer later claimed that Vorayuth's high blood alcohol levels were due to his drinking at home due to stress following the accident and that he had left the scene to inform his family of what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murdoch|first1=Lindsay|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/red-bull-heir-vorayuth-yoovidhya-stonewalls-prosecutors-years-after-alleged-hitandrun-20170402-gvbq30.html|title=Red Bull heir Vorayuth Yoovidhya stonewalls prosecutors years after alleged hit-and-run|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 April 2017|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorayuth initially claimed that Suwet Hom-ubol, Vorayuth's aide and chauffeur, had been behind the wheel during the incident, but later admitted to driving the car himself. Suwet would later be charged with making [[false statements]] to the police. An investigating police officer, Pol Lt Colonel Pannaphol Nammueng, allegedly urged Suwet to pretend to be the Ferrari driver in the fatal hit-and-run.&lt;ref name=Nation-20120905&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/aec/30189780|title=Red Bull heir may face manslaughter charge|work=The Nation|date=2012-09-05|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has caused continuing outrage in Thailand.&lt;ref name=BP-20170401/&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Despite assurances by then-Police Commissioner Comronwit Toopgrajank that the case would be taken seriously, as of April 2017 Vorayuth had yet to be indicted, as his lawyers had repeatedly postponed summons by the attorney-general, claiming illness, overseas business and unfair treatment, and the [[statute of limitations]] expired for several charges.

In April 2017, Vorayuth failed for the eighth time to appear in court to answer the charges against him, citing work commitments.&lt;ref name="Coconuts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/845852/ |title=As latest deadline passes today, Red Bull heir a no-show...again|work=Coconuts Bangkok|agency=Reuters|date=2017-04-27|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2017 the criminal court approved an arrest warrant for Vorayuth, however he had already fled to [[Singapore]], where he abandoned his private jet. Interpol confirmed that Vorayuth left Singapore on 27 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1243862/boss-leaves-private-jet-in-singapore|title='Boss' leaves private jet in Singapore|work=Bangkok Post|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thai police requested that his Thai passport be cancelled and this was done in early-May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39802351|title=Wanted Thai Red Bull heir Vorayuth 'not in Singapore'|work=BBC|date=4 May 2017|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/thailand-police-arrest-warrant-red-bull-heir-170428115617593.html|title=Thailand police get arrest warrant for Red Bull heir|work=Al Jazeera|date=28 April 2017|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/red-bull-fugitive-yoovidhya-1.4098805|title=Fugitive Red Bull heir abandons private jet, disappears|accessdate=4 May 2017|agency=Reuters|work=CBC News|date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-06/thailand-revokes-passport-of-fugitive-red-bull-heir-vorayuth/8503426|title=Thailand revokes fugitive Red Bull heir's passport|date=6 May 2017|work=ABC|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2017 [[Interpol]], at the request of the Thai police, issued a [[Red Notice]] for the arrest of Vorayuth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4919664/red-bull-heir-vorayuth-yoovidhya-thailand-interpol-red-notice/|title=Interpol Arrest Notice Issued for Fugitive Red Bull Heir|first=Jerry|last=Harmer|agency=AP|work=Time|accessdate=30 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829215506/http://time.com/4919664/red-bull-heir-vorayuth-yoovidhya-thailand-interpol-red-notice/|archive-date=29 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BP-20170505"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1244334/boss-passport-revoked|title=Vorayuth's passport revoked, but location unknown|work=Bangkok Post|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=5 May 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domestic violence in [[South Africa]]''' has been viewed as a private matter until the last few decades. In the 2012 financial year, just over one-third of the crimes against women that had been reported were prosecuted in court. Legislation has been passed to help improve the quality of life for those being abused and to prevent further abuse. Although the movement against domestic violence is a relatively new movement, it has making great strides in the country since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/a424c0804af19b5e9583fd7db529e2d0/SouthAfrica,-worlds-rape-capital:-Interpol-20121904|title=SABC News - South Africa, worlds rape capital: Interpol :Thursday 19 April 2012|author=SABC|publisher=Sabc.co.za|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic violence==
The South African Domestic Violence Act 1998 defines domestic violence as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1998-116.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nicky Hartery |website=Justice.gov.za |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Physical abuse]]; [[sexual abuse]]; emotional, verbal and psychological abuse; [[economic abuse]]; [[intimidation]]; [[harassment]]; [[stalking]]; damage to property; entry into the complainant's residence without consent, where the parties do not share the same residence; or any other controlling or abusive behavior towards a complainant, where such conduct harms, or may cause imminent harm to, the safety, health or wellbeing of the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;Bendall, Charlotte. "The Domestic Violence Epidemic in South Africa: Legal and Practical Remedies." ''Women's Studies'' 39 (2010): 100&amp;ndash;18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
The South African Medical Council released a study in 1998 saying that out of the 1,394 men [[interviewed]], 50% physically abused their female partners at their homes.&lt;ref name=jewkes&gt;Jewkes, Rachel, Jonathan Levin, and Loveday Penn-Kekana. "Risk factors for Domestic violence: findings from a South African cross-sectional study." Social Science &amp; Medicine'' 55 (2002): 1603–17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering how recently domestic violence has come to light, it is still considered an early movement. The [[United Nations]] found that violence against women was a universal problem.&lt;ref name="UN stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW2010%20Report_by%20chapter(pdf)/violence%20against%20women.pdf|format=PDF|title=Violence against women|publisher=Unstats.un.org|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done in 2010 found that a majority of men and over half of women that were surveyed believed that women should obey their husbands.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/will-the-pistorius-case-change-south-africa.html|title=Will the Pistorius Case Change South Africa?|date=16 February 2013|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breetzke, G.D. "Understanding the magnitude and extent of crime in post-apartheid South Africa." Social Identities 18.3 (2012): 299–315.

'He forced me to love him': putting violence on the adolescent sexual health agenda. Social Science and Medicine, 47, 233–242.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for women to tolerate the abuse they are receiving because it is such a common practice in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, K., Jewkes, R. (2001). 'Dangerous' love: reflections on violence among Xhosa township youth. In R. Morrell (Ed.). Changing men in Southern Africa. University of Natal Press: Pietermaritzburgand Zed Books Ltd, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In a study done by the World Health Organization, it was found that 60,000 women and children are victims of domestic violence in South Africa.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt; It is hard to gather accurate [[statistical data]] in South Africa because domestic violence is rarely reported. On average, in a [[cross-sectional study]] conducted in 2002, the women who were abused came from a lower secondary education and were [[unemployed]].&lt;ref name=jewkes/&gt; The same study indicated that 9.5 percent of women reported being abused within the past year (working back from 2002); in some areas of the country it rose to 28.4 percent of women who reported being abused. In 2013, 50 percent of the women surveyed reported that they had suffered emotional and verbal abuse. Of the women who were in violent relationships, 45.9 percent of them reported injury. In the same study it was found that typically the women who do witness and feel the violence come from a rural childhood compared to those raised in an urban area.&lt;ref name=jewkes/&gt; Although there are many places that do offer help to those suffering from domestic violence, those resources are more available in urban areas. In rural areas it is harder to access proper resources. Nearly half of the female murders that happened in 1999 in South Africa resulted from domestic violence. The percentage of women who reported experiencing domestic violence at least once in their lifetime is as high as 59 percent.&lt;ref name="UN stats"/&gt;
[[File:South Africa 2011 population density map.svg|thumb|South Africa 2011 population density map]]
In a study conducted in 2002 by R. Jewkes et al. 24.6% of all women, and 24.3% of black African women, experienced physical violence during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=jewkes/&gt; Black African women were less likely to ever experience physical violence or to experience physical violence in the past year than were women of other races. The women in this sample were from the province of Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and Northern Province with a mean age of 31.

Recent research has found that binge drinking was associated with intimate partner violence perpetration, and that problematic alcohol use can be a predictor of intimate partner violence and domestic violence perpetration. Additionally, men with a history of exposure to violence were more likely to have difficulty with self-control as it relates to violence towards a partner in certain situations compared to men without a history of exposure to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelman AM, Bellamy SL, Jemmott JB 3rd, Icard L, O'Leary A, Ali S, Ngwane Z, Makiwane M. Childhood sexual abuse and sociodemographic factors prospectively associated with intimate partner violence perpetration among South African heterosexual men. Annals of Behavioral Medicine. 2017;51(2):170-178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape and sexually transmitted diseases===
{{further|Sexual violence in South Africa|HIV/AIDS in South Africa}}
In 2012 South Africa was called the "[[rape]] capital of the world" when less than 1% of rapes that occur are reported to the police.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The [[South African Medical Research Council]] did an electronic anonymous survey, interviewing just over 1,700 men, that found that one in four males had raped; 73% of those men surveyed had raped before the age of 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8107039.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - South African rape survey shock|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within rural South Africa there is a higher rate of [[HIV]] between partners. In [[Limpopo]], a team of researches traveled to rural villages to implement a three-part trial to test if intervention within relationships that had domestic violence and/ or HIV prevalence in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=eca02ad6-28d2-44b3-91e0-53f213187ec0%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=123|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|publisher=Web.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homes where the researchers just assisted with the problems of domestic violence were able to reduce the prevalence by 55%, but did not effect those who had unprotected sexual intercourse with a non-spousal partner. Although the rate of domestic violence within these small villages did get reduced; the rate of those having unprotected intercourse after being exposed, and diagnosed with HIV, did not go down. According to reports by the U.N., South Africa has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS. (2009) AIDS Epidemic Update. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Geneva, Switzerland 2009: 1–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions==
Until South Africa established multiracial democracy in the 1990s, no law to define domestic violence or protect those who are victims of domestic violence ever existed.&lt;ref name="Usdin, Shereen 2000"&gt;Usdin, Shereen, et al. "The Value of Advocacy in Promoting Social Change: Implementing the New Domestic Violence Act in South Africa." Reproductive Health Matters 8.16 (2000): 55-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within South Africa, the 1996 Constitution says in section 12c that: "Everyone has the right to freedom and security of person, that includes the right to be free from violence from either public and private sources." The constitution also takes time to highlight that South Africa is based on "non-sexism" values.

Many successful policies have been put in place to help, mostly women, find help escape or refuge from the violence. Human rights throughout the world have viewed sexual violence as a negative situation. After the United Nations held multiple human rights conventions (including the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] (1993), [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (1994), and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] (1995) the global agenda for violence against women changed.&lt;ref&gt;Carrillo, R. "Overview of inter nation human rights standards and other Agreements and responses of judicial system to violence against women.” International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics 78 (2002): 15-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group Soul City broadcast a show on TV and radio in 1995 that highlighted the issues associated with domestic violence. Soul City, along with the National Network on Violence against Women, set up a 24-hour crisis telephone line to help vulnerable women who are struggling with domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Usdin, Shereen 2000"/&gt;

===Domestic Violence Act===
In 1998, South Africa introduced the Domestic Violence Act to try and protect those who are being abused or might be forced into a situation that could become harmful in the future. At the time, the biggest assistance to women came from the Protection Order that derives from the Domestic Violent Act. The Protection Order permits the courts to prevent the accused from continuing abuse. The collaboration process between representatives of the Department of Justice, Safety and Security, Health Education, Welfare, Correctional Services and the National Directorate for Public Prosecution was a delaying factor that slowed down the process of changing the policies. Within the first year of the Domestic Violence Act being created, 1,696 applications were submitted for protective orders.&lt;ref name=vet&gt;{{cite web|author=Vetten, Lisa|title="Addressing domestic violence in South Africa: Reflections on strategy and practice."|publisher=Un.org|date=28 April 2014|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw-gp-2005/docs/experts/vetten.vaw.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report done by the United Nations Division of the Advancement of Women, they discovered about the protective orders that women were able to fill out, that the forms were only available in two out of the eleven languages that are spoken in South Africa.&lt;ref name=vet/&gt; Other reforms that were created were to sentence mandatory minimal time for specific types of rape under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Bendall, Charlotte.

'''''Exit, Voice, and Loyalty''''' (1970) is a treatise written by [[Albert O. Hirschman]] (1915—2012).  The work hinges on a conceptual ultimatum that confronts consumers in the face of deteriorating [[quality (business)|quality]] of goods: either ''[[Exit (economics)|exit]]'' or ''voice''.

== Summary ==
The basic concept is as follows: members of an organization, whether a business, a nation or any other form of human grouping, have essentially two possible responses when they perceive that the organization is demonstrating a decrease in quality or benefit to the member: they can ''exit'' (withdraw from the relationship); or, they can ''voice'' (attempt to repair or improve the relationship through communication of the complaint, grievance or proposal for change).  For example, the [[citizens]] of a country may respond to increasing [[political repression]] in two ways: emigrate or protest.  Similarly, [[employees]] can choose to quit their unpleasant job, or express their concerns in an effort to improve the situation.  Disgruntled [[customers]] can choose to shop elsewhere, or they ask for the manager.

Exit and voice themselves represent a union between economic and political action.  Exit is associated with [[Adam Smith]]'s [[invisible hand]], in which buyers and sellers are free to move silently through the [[Market (economics)|market]], constantly forming and destroying relationships.  Voice, on the other hand, is by nature political and at times confrontational.

While both exit and voice can be used to measure a decline in an organization, voice is by nature more informative in that it also provides reasons for the decline.  Exit, taken alone, only provides the warning sign of decline.  Exit and voice also interact in unique and sometimes unexpected ways; by providing greater opportunity for [[feedback]] and [[criticism]], exit can be reduced; conversely, stifling of dissent leads to increased pressure for members of the organization to use the only other means available to express discontent, departure.  The general principle, therefore, is that the greater the availability of exit, the less likely voice will be used.  However, the interplay of ''[[loyalty]]'' can affect the cost-benefit analysis of whether to use exit or voice.   Where there is loyalty to the organization (as evidenced by strong [[patriotism]] politically, or [[brand loyalty]] for consumers), exit may be reduced, especially where options to exit are not so appealing (small job market, political or financial hurdles to emigration or moving). Loyal members become especially devoted to the organization's success when their voice will be heard and when they can reform it.

By understanding the relationship between exit and voice, and the interplay that loyalty has with these choices, organizations can craft the means to better address their members' concerns and issues, and thereby effect improvement.  Failure to understand these competing pressures can lead to organizational decline and possible failure.

== Applying the theory to membership organizations ==
[[Membership organization]]s, whether they be professional, community-based or business-oriented, face the perpetual challenge of knowing how engaged members are; how likely they are to remain members; and when they might cease to be members. Exit, Voice and Loyalty can be observed, reviewed and addressed as a matter of course, and in a learning organization, can result in reduced member "churn" and increased growth in member satisfaction, loyalty, referrals and growth. This usually entails some sort of survey efforts, social media inquiries, polling and individual interviews and/or group to maintain the necessary information for the organization to adapt to its members' needs.

Some studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Elizabeth A.|title=Exit and Voice: Organizational Loyalty and Dispute Resolution Strategies|journal=Social Forces|date=2006|volume=84|pages=2301–2318|doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dowding|first1=Keith|last2=John|first2=Peter|last3=Mergoupis|first3=Thanos|last4=Van Vugt|first4=Mark|title=Exit, voice and loyalty: Analytic and Empirical Developments|journal=European Journal of Political Research|date=2000|volume=37|pages=469–495|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.00522}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirm Hirschman's assertion that greater exit and entry costs heighten the likelihood of voice.  Particularly when examining dispute resolution in  contexts with limited exit opportunities, increased entry costs make workers' voice more likely.

Those in the military are sometimes faced with things that they might not morally agree with. They have a sense of "patriotic obligation" to their country, even if they feel the war they are fighting is "unjust." This patriotic obligation stems from their loyalty to their government and country. They feel that they need to do as they're told in order to be a loyal citizen.

== Applying the theory to emigration ==
A key application of Hirschman's scheme of exit, voice and loyalty has been emigration. Drawing on the analogy of discontent consumers buying elsewhere, "exit" translated into leaving a country and migrating to a different nation-state, while "voice" described the option of articulating discontent, which as Hirschman (1970: 16) noted, "can be graduated, all the way from faint grumbling to violent protest". Hirschman modeled these options as mutually exclusive and postulated a seesaw mechanism: the easier available the exit option, the lower the likelihood of voice. For rulers, emigration served as a safety-valve, by which the discontent renounced on their possibility to articulate protest. "Latin American powerholders have long encouraged their political enemies and potential critics to remove themselves from the scene through voluntary exile. The right of asylum, so generously practiced by all Latin American republics, could almost be considered as a ‘conspiracy in restraint of voice’." (Hirschman 1970: 60f.) However, not always did "exit subvert voice", as Hirschman himself acknowledged in a 1993 article:&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, Albert O. (1993): Exit, Voice, and the Fate of the German Democratic Republic: An Essay in Conceptual History, in: World Politics, 45(2): 173-202&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, in the GDR it was the escalating dynamic of out-migration that led those who wanted to stay to take to the streets to demand change. Exit triggered voice, and both worked in tandem.

Moreover, Hirschman's scheme assumes a model of nation-states as a jigsaw puzzle of clearly delimited "containers", and migration as the process of unidirectionally moving from one container to another. The emergence of transnational migration diagnosed since the 1990s has challenged this assumption. As emigrants increasingly maintain strong social ties (loyalty) to their country of origin, including a claim to have a say in its public affairs (voice) - Hoffmann (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Bert (2010): Bringing Hirschman Back In: "Exit", "Voice", and "Loyalty" in the Politics of Transnational Migration; in: The Latin Americanist, 54, 2010, 2, 57-73&lt;/ref&gt; argues- in transnational migration exit, voice and loyalty are no longer exclusive options; the nature of migrant transnationalism is defined precisely by the overlapping and simultaneity of these categories.

According to Dako-gyeke 2016, Ghana students intended to migrate for a chance at an overall better quality of life, more career options, and a possibility of continuing their education. These students hope to ‘exit’ their current situation due to their lack of resources, lack of income, or lack of job opportunities. They are ‘withdrawing their relationship’  with their current community/home country to try and prosper somewhere new.

==Special problems==
Hirschman provides an example simplified here: Consider a publicly funded school where the quality of education declined. Quality-conscious parents would increasingly remove their child to a privately funded school, given that they are relatively indifferent to the cost. A price-conscious parent, being similarly indifferent to the quality, would not notice that decline. At some point then, the school would know there was a problem, having been abandoned, but have no parents left who cared sufficiently about the quality to point to exactly where it had failed, locking the school into that state. Hirschman notes that in this and similar fields ("connoisseur goods"), a "tight monopoly could be preferable", preventing parents from moving. This would be better for the school, if not the child, by keeping an active voice among the parents.

Research is limited on whether exiting is a strategy for those who hold powerful positions. Holbein 2016. In China, the middle-class people did not voice their opinions for political change, and instead used an approach called "remonstrations." They instead pledge their loyalty and blame the lower level officials.

==Applying the theory to political situations==
''Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game'' offer a new framework which views exit, voice, and loyalty as inherently political responses of citizens to their governments. Exit, Voice, and Loyalty are three general responses citizens employ to negatively construed state policy changes. Exit is seen as acceptance that change has occurred as semi-permanent and the citizen response follows a negation of the change through the alteration of the citizen's behavior. Voice is seen as a citizen response exemplified through complaints, protests, lobbying, and other forms of direct action taken to change the environment. Loyalty is presented as an acceptance of current change produced by the state policy and no behavioral change to it. All responses are political even when citizens do not deliberately choose a response. For example, some people do not consider the employing the use of voice because they do not believe it would be effective in producing the change they are seeking leading them to still ultimately employ either exit or loyalty. The response citizens choose remains implicitly political because it is dependent on what they construe their claim will be valued as from the state. The role of power can be seen through the responses of the exit, voice, and loyalty game theoretic model when applied considered politically.&lt;ref&gt;''Power in politics: insights from exit, voice, and loyalty game''. William Roberts Clark, Matt Golder, Sona N. Golder. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit need not be physical, but can be mental or emotional. For example, in totalitarian countries, many could not physically exit the country, but did not want to participate in the system either. In these cases, citizens could be said to exit from civic or political participation, as they were neither loyal to the government nor were they willing to voice their dissatisfaction because doing so could lead to imprisonment, exile, or even death. Many thus mentally and emotionally exited their countries for the duration of a repressive regime they did not agree with but felt they could not fight or topple. The consequences of this exit can sometimes provide an explanation for why voter turnout is often low in countries where free elections are being held for the first time in years (or ever).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The exit, voice, loyalty model can be used to explain relationships between nation states and their citizens. The model predicts that when citizens have a credible exit threat and states are dependent on their citizens, states are less likely to take actions that the citizens would object to.  For the case of increased [[taxation]] by the state, examples of credible exit threats include having the economic resources to flee or the ability to easily [[Tax evasion|evade taxes]]. States are said to be dependent on their citizens if they value citizen loyalty more than they value the benefits that would result from a policy change. When both of these criteria are met, the model would predict that the state would not pursue a policy that would encourage citizens to exit or to use voice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.” Unpublished manuscript, University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the choice between using voice and exiting depends on which method has the least amount of costs and most benefits. In the case of [[Africa]] in [[History of Africa|precolonial and early colonial times]], citizens often chose to exit in response to unfavorable policy changes and this exiting took the form of [[Emigration|emigrating]] away from a state. Even when citizens could use voice, exiting was a better option because there was a large amount of open land that could yield benefits that were similar to the benefits obtained by living within the state. However, in the last hundred years there has been a shift in strategy away from migration (exit) and towards [[protest]]ing (voice) because it is no longer as easy to find open land to exit to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Jeffrey|date=1990-01-01|title=Migration, the Politics of Protest, and State Consolidation in Africa|jstor=722241|journal=African Affairs|volume=89|issue=355|pages=183–203|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a098284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model also predicts the impact of citizen voice on state action. There is a cost for citizens to use their voice. There is also a cost to the state as a result of citizen voice. The relative sizes of these costs can be used to infer the outcome when citizens decide to use their voice. When citizens can easily [[Mass mobilization|mobilize]], the cost of mobilization is low for the citizens but the impact of using voice in a mobilized manner can lead to a large cost for the state. When this cost to the state is greater than the benefits it receives from a policy, the state is predicted to change that policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There was a point in time when women were not able to voice their political opinion. Their ‘voice’ was shut down because they were not able to vote or take part in political positions. Interjurisdictional competition played a role in helping women with property rights where they would be able to seek education, occupations, and investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemke|first=Jayme|date=2016|title=Interjurisdictional Competition and the Married Women’s Property Acts|journal=Public Choice|volume=166|issue=3|pages=291–313|doi=10.1007/s11127-016-0323-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting can be considered a type of voice for citizens. Their vote can affect who has power in political positions. When a government is showing signs of downfall, people may use both voice and exit strategies. Exiting seems to be a stronger strategy when it comes to democratic accountability. High numbers of exiting can be detrimental for government officials. It is shown as a sign of incompetency, and those officials are less likely to be re elected. Exiting can have crucial impact on government officials.

==Applying the theory to employment relations==
Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty analytical framework has underpinned important research within employment relations. Hirschman's insights that exit and voice are often, but not always, mutually exclusive and that loyalty will moderate a consumer's chances of voicing any misgivings (Hirschman 1970: 77-78) are useful in explaining the link between workplace policies and outcomes.

There are different forms of employee voice, including individual voice, such as employee surveys, and collective voice, typically  unions, as well as combinations of them. Contrasting forms of voice have different degrees of power (Allen 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M. M. C. (2014), ‘Hirschman and Voice’, in A. Wilkinson, J. Donaghey, T. Dundon and R. Freeman (eds), The Handbook of Research on Employee Voice, Cheltenham and New York: Edward Elgar Press, pp. 36-51. {{doi|10.4337/9780857939272.00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An assumption that consumers have power underpins Hirschman's original framework. For instance, Hirschman (1970: 4, 40-1) argued that, in most instances, once consumers or ‘customer-members’ of an organization had voiced their concerns, decision makers within the selling organization could be expected to search for the sources of those misgivings and attempt to remedy the situation.

In comparison to competitive consumer markets, the employment relationship requires a different approach to power as managers have more authority than lower level employees (Hamilton and Feenstra 1997),&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, G.G. and Feenstra, R.C. (1997) ‘Varieties of Hierarchies and Markets: An Introduction’, in M. Orru, N.W. Biggart and G.G. Hamilton (eds) The Economic Organization of East Asian Capitalism, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 55-96.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to important implications for how exit, voice, and loyalty are treated within the employment context. For instance, in sharp contrast to Hirschman's (1970: 77) argument that, where exit is possible, voice is likely to be determined by ‘the extent to which customer-members are willing to trade off the certainty of exit against the uncertainties of an improvement in a deteriorated product’, within the context of employment, how willing employees are to trade off the uncertainties and costs of exit against the certainties of staying will strongly influence employees’ decisions to quit as well as to voice their opinions (Allen 2014). Similarly, loyalty and voice are not positively related in the employment context. In Hirschman's original formulation, consumers with higher levels of loyalty are more likely to voice their preferences to the selling organization rather than stop buying a product or service (exit). However, employees who voice their concerns may be seen as disloyal or as a disruptive influence by managers (Upchurch et al., 1996),&lt;ref&gt;Upchurch, M., M. Richardson, Tailby, S. Danford, A. and Stewart, P. (2006) ‘Employee Representation and Partnership in the Non-Union Sector: a Paradox of Intention?’ Human Resource Management Journal, 16(4): 393-410.&lt;/ref&gt; leading loyal employees to remain silent. For this and other reasons, a concept of ‘neglect’ needs to supplement Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty framework within the employment context (Donaghey et al. 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Donaghey, J., Cullinane, N., Dundon, T. and Wilkinson, A. (2011), ‘Reconceptualising Employee Silence: Problems and Prognosis’, Work, Employment and Society, 25(1): 51-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell 1983&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, D. (1983) ‘Exit, Voice, Loyalty, and Neglect as Responses to Job Dissatisfaction: a Multidimensional Scaling Study’, The Academy of Management Journal, 26(4): 596-607.&lt;/ref&gt;). Alternatively, 'toleration' is sometimes applied to situations in which employees remain with the organization, aware of problems, yet do not voice concern or grievance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Elizabeth|title=Exit and Voice: Organizational Loyalty and Dispute Resolution Strategies|journal=Social Forces|date=2006|volume=84|pages=2301–2318|doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Choi &amp; Chung 2016 some feel as though the competent wages given in teacher unions are responsible for fewer turnovers. Unions provide a platform for their employees to voice their concerns, and in turn, employees are able to voice how they feel rather than try to retreat from or ‘exit’ their union. The findings show, that the schools with greater policies for voicing concerns have lower rates of turnover. The article used a 2014 Bureau of Labor report to find that 2.5 million of teachers were covered by unions. With that number being so large, this information would be useful to those who want insight on how to keep their union workers happy. This information would also be useful for those looking for better grievance policies. According to Gunnarsdóttir, 2016, middle managers in welfare positions are feeling emotional tension in their duties from having to receive and enforce organizational change.  This leaves them susceptible to having their loyalty doubted. Due to this they feel like they aren’t able to ‘voice’ their concerns. They were able to execute strategies that evenly dispersed opposing outlooks while remaining autonomous during a radical change. O'Meara, Bennett &amp; Neihaus. 2016, discuss what might "pull" staff members away from their job, one example being better wages. They also discuss what might "push" them away from their job, one example being that they are unhappy with their current work circumstances. These faculty members are leaving for a number of reasons. Money and uncomfortable working circumstances are examples. Some might not be able to tolerate new leadership, or changes in the way they are expected to work. Saifullah &amp; Shahida 2016 suggests that both professional respect and employer-employee relation influenced the employees’ loyalty, but the effect of employer-employee was larger. Having a good relationship with employees has real reactions on their loyalty. To conclude, voice mechanisms have influence on turnover. New York State teacher unions were used for this specific data. Some feel as though the competent wages given in teacher unions are responsible for fewer turnovers. Unions provide a platform for their employees to voice their concerns, and in turn, employees are able to voice how they feel rather than try to retreat from or ‘exit’ their union. The findings show, that the schools with greater policies for voicing concerns have lower rates of turnover. Choi, Yujin and Il H. Chung. 2016

'''Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen''' (July 26, 1895&lt;ref name="fn_1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Allen, age 4 years, born July 1895. U.S. Census, June 1, 1900, State of California, County of San Francisco, enumeration district 38, p. 11A, family 217.&lt;/ref&gt; – August 27, 1964) was an American vaudevillian and [[comedian|comedienne]] who became internationally famous as the zany partner and comic foil of husband [[George Burns]], her [[straight man]] appearing with her on radio, television and film as the duo [[Burns and Allen]]. 

For her contributions to the television industry, Gracie Allen was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6672 [[Hollywood Boulevard]],&lt;ref name="HWOFDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwof.com/stars?recipient=Gracie_Allen|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame database|publisher=HWOF.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while she and Burns were inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988.

Co-star [[Bea Benaderet]] said of Allen in 1966: "She was probably one of the greatest actresses of our time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/137162674/|title=She Was Jack Benny's Turkey|first=John|last=Heisner|work=[[Democrat &amp; Chronicle]]|page=207|date=April 24, 1966|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Allen was born in [[San Francisco, California]], to George Allen and Margaret Theresa ("Molly") Allen (née Darragh; later Mrs. Edward Pidgeon), who were both of [[Irish Catholic]] extraction. She made her first appearance on stage at age three and was given her first role on the radio by [[Eddie Cantor]].&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=George|title=Gracie: A Love Story|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|date=November 1988|location=New York|isbn=0-399-13384-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–95}} She was educated at the Star of the Sea Convent School and during that time became a talented dancer.

She soon began performing [[Irish dance|Irish folk dances]] with her three sisters, who were billed as "The Four Colleens".&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|28}} In 1909, Allen joined her sister, Bessie, as a [[vaudeville]] performer. At a performance in 1922, Allen met [[George Burns]] and the two formed a [[comedy duo|comedy act]]. They were married on January 7, 1926, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20264365|title=Say good night, Gracie! : the story of George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen|last=Cheryl.|first=Blythe,|date=1989|publisher=Prima Pub.|others=Sackett, Susan.|year=|isbn=1559580194|location=Rocklin, CA|pages=10|oclc=20264365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was born with [[heterochromia]], giving her two different color eyes; one blue and one green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=James C.|date=2017-05-01|title=From the Sylvia Plath Effect to Social Justice: Moving Forward With Creativity|url=https://doaj.org/article/6089a1fcbbb9404185cb08f36fa60e27|journal=Europe's Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|issn=1841-0413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth date myth===
Depending on the source, Allen is alleged to have been born on July 26 in 1895, 1896, 1902 or 1906. All public records held by the City and County of San Francisco were destroyed in the [[San Francisco Earthquake|earthquake and great fire of April 1906]]. Her husband, George Burns, also professed not to know exactly how old she was, though it was presumably he who provided the date July 26, 1902, which appears on her death record. Her crypt marker also shows her year of birth as 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=0-DxbHoPIIAC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=gracie+allen+crypt+1902&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1gc3hkaPeAhWPJTQIHXttC8QQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gracie%20allen%20crypt%201902&amp;f=false ''Why Rattlesnakes Rattle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Allen's signature jokes was a dialogue in which Allen would claim that she was born in 1906, her [[Comic foil|foil]] would press her for proof or corroborating information; she would say that her birth certificate had been destroyed in the earthquake, her foil would point out that she was born in July but the earthquake was three months earlier in April, and Allen would simply smile and reply "Well, it was an ''awfully big'' earthquake." The most reliable information comes from the [[U.S. Census]] data collected on June 1, 1900. According to the information in the Census records for the State of California, City and County of San Francisco, enumeration district 38, family 217, page 11-A, one Grace Allen—daughter of George and Maggie Allen, and youngest sister of Bessie, Hazel and Pearl Allen—was born in [[California]] in July 1895.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/index.htm |title=Ancestry of Gracie Allen|publisher=Genealogy.com|date=2002-07-18|accessdate=2010-08-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503085054/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/d0/i0000001.htm#s1|archivedate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the census taken on April 15, 1910, however, for San Francisco's 39th Assembly District, Enumeration District 216, Page 5A, Grace Allen is listed as being 13 (instead of 14), indicating a birth year of 1896, but this is not definitive and census records do occasionally vary from year to year based upon numerous factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestry.com|title=Genealogy, Family Trees and Family History Records online|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double act==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The Burns and Allen act began with Allen as the [[Double act|straight man]], setting up Burns to deliver the punchlines—and get the laughs. In his book ''[[Gracie: A Love Story]]'', Burns later explained that he noticed Allen's straight lines were getting more laughs than his punchlines, so he cannily flipped the act over—he made himself the straight man and let her get the laughs. Audiences immediately fell in love with Allen's character, who combined the traits of naivete, zaniness, and total innocence. The reformulated team, focusing on Allen, toured the country, eventually headlining in major vaudeville houses. Many of their famous routines were preserved in one- and two-reel [[short film]]s, including ''Lambchops''
(1929), made while the couple was still performing onstage.

Burns attributed all of the couple's early success to Allen, modestly ignoring his own brilliance as a straight man. He summed up their act in a classic quip: "All I had to do was say, 'Gracie, how's your brother?' and she talked for 38 years. And sometimes I didn't even have to remember to say 'Gracie, how's your brother?'{{-"}}

==Radio==
In the early 1930s, like many stars of the era, Burns and Allen graduated to radio.  The show was originally a continuation of their original "flirtation act" (as their vaudeville and short film routines had been). Burns realized that they were simply too old for that material ("Our jokes were too young for us," he later remarked)&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|165}} and changed the show's format in the fall of 1941 into the situation comedy vehicle for which they are best remembered: a working show business married couple negotiating ordinary problems caused by Gracie's "illogical logic," usually with the help of neighbors Harry and Blanche Morton, and their announcer, [[Bill Goodwin]] (later replaced by [[Harry von Zell]] during the run of their television series).

==Publicity stunts==
[[File:Burns allen 1952.JPG|left|thumb|[[Burns and Allen]] in 1952]]
Burns and Allen frequently used running gags as publicity stunts. During 1932–33, they pulled off one of the most successful in the business: a year-long search for Allen's supposedly missing brother.&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|100–105}} They would make unannounced cameo appearances on other shows, asking if anyone had seen Allen's brother. Gracie Allen's real-life brother was apparently the only person who did not find the gag funny, and he eventually asked them to stop. (He dropped out of sight for a few weeks, at the height of the publicity.)

In 1940, the team launched a similar stunt when Allen announced she was running for [[President of the United States]] on the Surprise Party ticket.&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|184–193}} Burns and Allen did a cross-country [[Whistle stop train tour|whistlestop]] campaign tour on a private train, performing their live radio show in different cities. In one of her campaign speeches, Gracie said, "I don't know much about the [[Lend-Lease]] Bill, but if we owe it we should pay it." Another typical Gracie-ism on the campaign trail went like this: "Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house." The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo; the motto was "It's in the bag." As part of the gag, Allen (in reality, the Burns and Allen writers) published a book, ''Gracie Allen for President'', which included photographs from their nationwide campaign tour and the Surprise Party convention. Allen received an endorsement from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourecho.com/story-4739-THE-GRACIE-ALLEN-PRESIDENTIAL-RUN.shtml|title=The Gracie Allen Presidential Run|last=Mazel|first=Henry F.|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen was also the subject of one of [[S. S. Van Dine]]'s [[Philo Vance]] mystery novels, ''[[The Gracie Allen Murder Case]]''. Typically, she could not resist a classic Gracie Allen review: "S.S. Van Dine is silly to spend six months writing a novel when you can buy one for two dollars and ninety five cents."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Another publicity stunt had her playing a piano concerto at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] (and later at [[Carnegie Hall]]).&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|182}} The Burns and Allen staff hired a composer to write the Concerto for Index Finger, a joke piece that had the orchestra playing madly, only to pause while Allen played a one-finger scale, with a final incorrect note.

The orchestra would then play a musical piece that developed around the "wrong" note. On her final "solo", Allen would finally hit the right note, causing the entire orchestra to applaud. In fact, the actual index-finger playing was done off-stage by a professional pianist. The concerto was featured in the film ''[[Two Girls and a Sailor]]'' (1944), with orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Television==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the fall of 1949, Burns and Allen became part of the [[CBS]] talent raid. Their good friend (and frequent guest star) [[Jack Benny]] had decided to jump from NBC over to CBS. [[William S. Paley]], the mastermind of CBS, had recently made it openly clear that he believed talent and not the network made the difference, which was not the case at NBC. Benny convinced Burns and Allen (among others) to join him in the move to CBS. The ''Burns and Allen'' radio show became part of the CBS lineup and a year later they also brought their show to television. They continued to use the formula which had kept them longtime radio stars, playing themselves, only now as television stars, still living next door to Harry and Blanche Morton. They concluded each show with a brief dialogue performance in the style of their classic vaudeville and earlier radio routines.

Allen retired in 1958, and Burns tried to soldier on without her. The show was renamed ''[[The George Burns Show]]'' with the cast intact except for Allen. The locale of the show was changed from the Burns home to George Burns' office, with Blanche Morton working as Burns' secretary so she could help Allen keep an eye on him. Allen's absence was only too obvious and impossible to overcome. The renamed show barely lasted a year.

==Films==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2016}}
In the early 1930s, Burns and Allen made several short films, preserving several of their classic vaudeville routines on celluloid. They also made two films with [[W. C. Fields]]—''[[International House (1933 film)|International House]]'' (1933) and ''Six of a Kind'' (1934). In 1937, Burns and Allen starred with [[Fred Astaire]] in ''[[A Damsel in Distress (1937 film)|A Damsel in Distress]]'', a musical with an original score by [[George Gershwin]], which introduced the song "[[A Foggy Day]]". It was Astaire's first RKO film without dancing partner [[Ginger Rogers]].

Astaire's co-star [[Joan Fontaine]] was not a dancer, and he was reluctant to dance on screen alone. He also felt the script needed more comic relief to enhance the overall appeal of the film. Burns and Allen had each worked in vaudeville as dancers ("hoofers") before forming their act, and when word of the project reached them, they called Astaire and he asked them to audition.

Burns contacted an act he had once seen that performed a dance using brooms. For the next several weeks, he and Allen worked at home to learn the complicated routine for their audition. When they presented the "Whisk Broom Dance" to Astaire, he was so taken by it, that he had them teach it to him and it was added to the film. Their talents were further highlighted as they matched Astaire step by step in the demanding "Funhouse Dance". Throughout the picture, Burns and Allen amazed audiences and critics as they "effortlessly" kept pace with the most famous dancer in films, as many did not know either of them could dance.&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|205}}

=="Say good night, Gracie"==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The legend was born of their vaudeville routine and carried over to both radio and television. As the show wrapped up, Burns would look at Allen and say "Say good night, Gracie", to which she would usually simply reply "Good night." Popular legend has it that Allen would say, "Good night, Gracie." According to George Burns, recordings of their radio and television shows, and several histories of old-time radio (John Dunning's ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', for example), Gracie never used the phrase. The confusion may have been caused by ''[[Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In]]''.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Stars [[Dan Rowan]] and [[Dick Martin (comedian)|Dick Martin]] used a similar sign-off routine wherein Rowan would tell Martin to "Say good night, Dick." Martin's reply was always "Good night, Dick." It seemed like something Gracie Allen would have said.{{whom|date=October 2018}}

George Burns himself said as much in an interview years later, adding that, surprisingly enough, no one ever thought of having Allen say "Good night, Gracie". However, the former ''Burns and Allen'' head writer, [[Paul Henning]], did use the "say good night" bit in at least one episode of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' ("The Richest Woman", aired January 5, 1966, two years before ''Laugh-In'' premiered.  JED: "Say good night, Jethro." JETHRO: "Good night, Jethro.")

==Private life==
In the 1930s, Burns and Allen adopted two children, Sandra Jean and [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronald Jon]], after discovering they could not conceive on their own. They agreed to raise the children as Catholics, then let them make their own religious choice as adults. Ronnie eventually joined the cast of his parents' television show, playing George and Gracie's son, a serious drama student who disdained comedy. Sandy, by contrast, made only occasional appearances on the show (usually as a telephone operator, waitress, secretary, or clerk), and left show business to become a teacher.

As a child, Allen had been scalded badly on one arm, and she was extremely sensitive about the scarring. Throughout her life, she wore either full or three-quarter length sleeves to hide the scars. The half-forearm style became as much a Gracie Allen trademark as her many aprons and her illogical logic. When the couple moved to Beverly Hills and acquired a swimming pool, Gracie put on a bathing suit and swam the length of the pool to prove to her children that she could swim. (She fought a longtime fear of drowning by privately taking swimming lessons.) She never put on a bathing suit or entered the pool again.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Allen was said to be sensitive about having one green eye and one blue eye ([[heterochromia]]), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of ''The Burns &amp; Allen Show'' in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, "You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again. I could use a new centerpiece."&lt;ref name="ALoveStory"/&gt;{{rp|306}}

==Death==
[[File:Gracie Allen Grave.JPG|thumb|Crypt of Gracie Allen, in the Freedom Mausoleum, Forest Lawn Glendale.]]
Gracie Allen fought a long battle with heart disease, ultimately dying of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[Hollywood]] on August 27, 1964, at age 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gracie Allen Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/29/gracie-allen-dead.html|quote=Gracie Allen, whose zany comedy helped make Burns and Allen a top show business act for years, died of a heart attack last night at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. She was 58 [sic] years old. ... Miss Allen was born in San Francisco on July 26, 1906 [sic]. Her father, Edward Allen, was a song‐and‐dance man. ...|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=August 29, 1964|accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her remains were interred in a crypt at the Freedom Mausoleum at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California]].

Burns' remains were interred at her side in 1996 when he died 32 years later at the age of 100; the marker on the crypt was changed from "Grace Allen Burns—Beloved Wife And Mother (1902–1964)" to "Gracie Allen (1902–1964) and George Burns (1896–1996)—Together Again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-09-01/michaels-foreverland|title=Michael's Foreverland|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hu Wanlin''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|胡|万|林}}}}, born 1949, [[Mianyang]], China) was suspected of killing 146 people.&lt;ref name="Tru"/&gt;

==Background==
Hu Wanlin was born in the city of [[Mianyang]], [[Sichuan Province]] and only completed primary education.&lt;ref name="Tru"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/male_nurses/11.html True TV, "Angels of Death: The Male Nurses"]&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned for homicide in the 1980s &lt;ref Name="Mystic"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/08/johngittings?INTCMP=SRCH "China accuses 'mystic healer' of killing 150 of his patients" 8 January 1999 ''Guardian'', "China accuses 'mystic healer' of killing 150 of his patients"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as swindling, and abducting and trafficking in women.&lt;ref name="Tru"/&gt; While in prison in 1993, he opened a medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the minds of healthcare serial killers: why they kill |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine M. |page=112 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-275-99422-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was acquitted on a retrial in 1997. On release he continued practising medicine illegally in the northern [[Shanxi Province]] and northwestern [[Shaanxi Province]] where he allegedly started two hospitals. &lt;ref Name="Doctor"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/shipman/Story/0,,192665,00.html ''Guardian'' 1 February 2000 "Doctor's name joins ranks of world's worst murderers"]&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until February 1998, when he was banned by local authorities. Hu then went to [[Henan]] in June 1998.

Hu's 'treatments' were thought to have resulted in the death of at least 146 people.&lt;ref Name="Doctor"/&gt; The “treatments” involved herbal preparations which were proved to contain high amounts of [[sodium sulphate]] which is poisonous in large doses.&lt;ref name="Tru"/&gt; He also employed the traditional practice of [[qigong]], in which the healer is said to emit [[qi]] from his body, which allegedly has curative powers without physical contact being necessary.&lt;ref name="Tru"/&gt; Hu became well-known, having his medical practice and “medical miracles” described by a well-known Chinese novelist, Ke Yunlu. It seems that his malpractice continued for many years due to bribes paid to officials. &lt;ref Name="Mystic"/&gt;

Hu was arrested on January 18, 1999 in [[Shangqiu]],&lt;ref Name="Doctor"/&gt; aged 50, on suspicion of causing nearly 150 deaths. He was convicted of practising medicine without a license on October 1, 2000, receiving 15 years imprisonment, suspension of voting rights for five years and a 150,000 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] fine.&lt;ref name="Tru"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i4PjlaAOEHEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22Hu+Wanlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NJWvTtTWDMKv8AOToK2cAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hu%20Wanlin%22&amp;f=false ''Inside the minds of healthcare serial killers: why they kill''] (2007)  Katherine M. Ramsland" Greenwood Publishing Group, p112
{{ISBN|978-0-275-99422-8}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, shortly after Hu received an early release from imprisonment, state-run media reported that he had been responsible for another death: a 22-year old college student attending another one of his "health retreats"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title=Chinese ‘quack’ doctor whose patients died was freed from jail to kill again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/20/chinese-quack-doctor-patients-jail-hu-wanlin|work=The Guardian|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]] in places such as in southern Germany, in [[Saxony]] and in [[Austria]] the word meant inhabitants of a [[town]] or a village who generally did not possess real property and therefore did not enjoy full civic rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/zrgga.1882.3.issue-1/zrgga.1882.3.1.199/zrgga.1882.3.1.199.xml |title=Weisthum und Gerichtsordnung der Gemeinde Ellerstadt vom Jahr 1555 |author=Friderich von Flerssheim |journal=Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte.

Likewise, similarities exist to the expression ''Einlieger'' for day labourers without [[real property]] who rented living room from farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/K/meyers-1905-005-0461 |title=Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon |chapter=Einlieger |page=461 |year=1905 |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Inwohner'' must be distinguished from a member of the household who was either related to the home owner or was a direct employee (e.g. a [[maid]] or a [[servant]]) of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/19316364.pdf |chapter=Inwohner&amp;nbsp;— Problem der Familienzugehörigkeit |page=198 |title=Familie und Arbeitsteilung.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional variations ==

In [[Mecklenburg]], inhabitants of towns were called ''[E]inwohner'' or ''Einlieger'' if they did not possess the status of a burgher nor any other specific privileges. According to the old country laws of Mecklenburg, burghers could only have one main occupation in trade, crafts, or services. Thus, special organisations similar to those of craftsmen also formed for those "farmer-burghers" who lived in the towns, but whose main occupation was agriculture. Their number, however, remained comparatively low in all Mecklenburg country towns.

In south-western Saxony, it became common around 1700 to speak of "propertied ''Inwohner''". This could mean [[Hufner]]s and other inhabitants of the villages who held real property, or home owners in towns. In this region as well as in the [[Vogtland]], the sense of the word shifted towards today's ''Einwohner'', meaning any inhabitant of a populated place.

In northern and north-eastern Germany, ''Instleute'' were day labourers contracted to work for certain landowners in exchange for living quarters, payment and wages [[in kind]]; they also had to provide a second labourer and acted thus as a kind of  sub-contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/K/meyers-1905-009-0876 |title=Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon |chapter=Instleute |page=876 |year=1905 |volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]], so-called ''osabeniki'' were allocated living quarters in the wineyards where they worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41039938 |author=Method Dolenc |journal=Jahrbücher für Kultur und Geschichte der Slaven. Neue Folge |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1929 |pages=299–368 |title=Die niedere Volksgerichtbarkeit unter den Slovenen von Ende des 16. bis Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Switzerland]], the expressions ''Beiwohner'', ''Beisasse'', ''medewohner'' and ''non-positus'' also refer to inhabitants of a municipality who do not possess full civic rights there, but have certain duties and enjoy certain rights according to the relevant regulations. These persons may nevertheless be of prominent financial standing.

== Rights and duties ==

Unpropertied inhabitants of medieval towns without full civic rights were called ''Inwohner''. They were bound to work as day labourers for a master, e.g. a brewery, without being permanently employed. ''Inwohner'' in villages were dependent on the farmers in whose households they lodged, and were bound to perform a set amount of work for their landlords, thus providing a reserve of workers for busy times. Some earned an additional income from domestic trades such as shoe repair, broom making, or basket making.&lt;ref name = messerer2008/&gt;

Since the domicile of an ''Inwohner'' was not defined by real property, special rules had to be observed as to which clergymen were to perform marriage ceremonies among this class of inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johann N. Schneid |title=Das Brautexamen, die Eheeinsegnung, die Jubelehe und das Verfahren der katholischen Kirche bei Aufnahme eines fremden Religionsgenossen in ihre Gesellschaft: ein Hilfsbuch zunächst für angehende Geistliche und Seelensorger: mit einer Zugabe von Tauf-und Leichenreden. |publisher=G. Joseph Manz, Regensburg und Landshut |year=1835 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VEBFAAAAcAA |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional laws fixed the duties of ''Inwohner'' and their landlords. For instance, the 1635 [[urbarium]] of [[Lustenfelden]] stipulates that, if a subject of the local lord had taken a person (''Inman'') as a tenant, both had to appear before the lord within a fortnight to record the ''Inman'' for whom the landlord had to pay a bond. An ''Inman'' who had left another lordship had to bring a letter of leave, to swear allegiance to the new lord, and to pay a fee of acceptance. After the ''Inman'' moved into the house of the landlord, a certain tax was payable every year which the landlord had to guarantee. An ''Inman'' who left had to request cancellation of the record, and had to pay a leaving fee, otherwise both landlord and tenant were liable to prosecution. Likewise, certain taxes were due upon the death of an ''Inman''. Concealing the ''Inman'' status by a pretended employment was prohibited. However, the ''Inman'' was not liable for country taxes levied by the prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Franz Wilfingseder |title=Geschichte der Herrschaft Lustenfelden bei Linz (Kaplanhof) |series=Sonderpublikationen zur Linzer Stadtgeschichte |publisher=Buchverlag der Demokratischen Druck- und Verlags-Gesellschaft |place=Linz |year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing number of ''Inman'' relationships in the 17th and 18th centuries led to the erection of numerous [[tenement]]s, e.g. in [[Linz]], and to the development of an urban proletariat even under preindustrial circumstances.

'''Jakun''' people or '''Orang Ulu''' / '''Orang Hulu''' (meaning, "people of the upstream") are an ethnic group recognised as [[Orang Asli]] ([[indigenous people]]) of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in [[Malaysia]]. 

The Malaysian government officially distinguishes 18 different ethnicity of the [[Orang Asli]] group, uniting them into three categories namely the [[Negrito]] ([[Semang]]), [[Senoi]] and aboriginal Malays ([[Proto-Malay]]). The Jakun people belong to the third of them. They are the largest group of the [[Orang Asli]]; in the [[Proto-Malay]] division, and the second-largest [[Orang Asli]] group overall after the [[Semai people|Semai]].

It should be noted that in the past, the name ''Jakun'' is used as a term that encompasses all native Malays, including the [[Temuan people]], [[Orang laut]] ([[Orang Seletar]], [[Orang Kuala]]) and [[Orang Kanaq]]. At the same time they were divided into two groups, the actual Jakun people living in the interiors and the [[Orang laut]] living by the coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jakun |title=Jakun people |author= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year= |accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of anthropological characteristics, the [[Proto-Malay]] differs from other [[Orang Asli]] groups. Just like the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]; they belonged to the southern [[Mongoloid]], where they are noticeably higher in height and have a lighter skin.

They are closely related to the [[Malay people]] and are probably a branch of the [[Proto-Malay]], whom the 19th century researcher [[A. R. Wallace]] called "savage Malays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volume 15|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also related to the [[Orang Laut]], another indigenous group that lives along the coasts and depends on fishing.

Ordinary Malaysians know little about the [[Orang Asli]] and the Jakun people in particular. Traditionally, they are perceived as backward and primitive tribes, and the very name itself, "jakun" carries a derogatory connotation meaning "slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Nicolaisen &amp; Jens Yde|title=Folk: dansk etnografisk tidsskrift, Volumes 28-29|year=1986|publisher=Dansk etnografisk forening|isbn=|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orang Asli [[Malay language]] speakers occasionally use the word "Jakun" as an insult for an unsophisticated person. This is considered by some as derogatory and racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Elangaiyan|title=Vital voices: endangered languages and multilingualism : proceedings of the Tenth FEL Conference, CIIL, Mysore, India, 25-27 October, 2006|year=2007|contribution=Foundation for Endangered Languages|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages|isbn=978-09-538-2488-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] toward the Jakun people is ambiguous. On one hand, they consider them to be benighted people and dabbles in black magic. On the other hand, the Jakun people are part of the [[Proto-Malay]] and is evidenced that the [[Proto-Malay]] have always been inhabiting the country and is therefore a justification of the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Malay rights]] and the special status of the indigenous people of [[Malaysia]].

==Settlement areas==
[[File:Pagan races of the Malay Peninsula (1906) (14781200422).jpg|thumb|right|The area circled in red indicates the location of the Jakun people in southern [[Peninsula Malaysia]].]]
Jakuns are mostly located in the southern region of the [[Malay Peninsula]], in the interior of the southwest [[Pahang]] and north [[Johor]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://coac.org.my/codenavia/portals/coacv2/code/main/main_art.php?parentID=11497609537883&amp;artID=11533782664236 Origins, Identity, and Classification], Centre for Orang Asli Concerns &lt;/ref&gt; All Jakun settlements are located near the jungle, and their population is more or less dependent on jungle resources. The geography of this region varies from a wet swampy area to dense tropical jungles. The local climate is determined by high humidity and seasonal monsoons.

Jakun live in villages belonging to different categories. This development is the ''Rancangan Pengumpulan Semula'' (RPS, "Regrouping Plan") settlement, a regrouping scheme for undeveloped settlements and those that are developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jakoa.gov.my/en/orang-asli/pembangunan-orang-asli/program-pembangunan-penempatan-tersusun/ |title=Structured Settlements Development Programme |author= |publisher=Department of Orang Asli Development |date= |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In RPS settlements, all residents have individual house, built by the government where they are provided with electricity and water supply, communication facilities, public halls, shops, schools, children's and medical institutions, asphalted roads are laid for them.&lt;ref name="TDOTOACIPM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-kerajaan.com/kklw/temp_laporan/38151_Paper%20JHEOA.doc |title=The Development Of The Orang Asli Community In Peninsular Malaysia: The Way Forward |author= |publisher=Ministry of Rural and Regional Development Malaysia |year=2005 |accessdate=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; People from different settlements located in or near the jungle were moved to such villages. Much of the people still continue to live in old settlements. Usually there is no electricity there, water is taken from natural sources, and there are only a few houses built out of durable building materials. Access to these villages are through earthen roads and jungle paths.

Some of the settlements that the Jakun people are located includes:-

Demographic data obtained during fieldwork among the Jakun people near [[Chini Lake]], showed that the local population was relatively young people aged 30 to 40 years (30%) outnumbering the age group of 40 to 50 years (15%) and the largest age group was the 5 to 12 years old. There were also more women than men. Most of the respondents were married, the size of the family ranged from 8 to 12 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a424/6690f18e41690010388f5966e3b2ed712ff2.pdf |title=Sustainable Livelihood of the Community in Tasik Chini Biosphere Reserve: the Local Practices |author=A.

==Appearance==
The Jakuns are taller than the other aboriginal peoples of the Malay Peninsula, the [[Semang]] and [[Sakai (tribe)|Sakai]] tribes. Jakun people typically have olive-brown to dark copper skin color. Some have [[Interracial marriage|intermarried]] with ethnic Malays or Chinese. Those who marry or assimilated with Malays usually adhere or largely convert to [[Islam]]; families with Chinese ancestors may practise [[Chinese folk religion]] in addition to Jakun customs.

==Language==
Jakuns speak [[Jakun language]], a [[Malayic languages|Malayic language]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] group, closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamila Ghazali|title=What is the UN Academic Impact?|chapter=National Identity and Minority Languages|year=2010|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-110-1231-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it should be considered as one of the archaic dialects of the [[Malay language]]. It does not have its own written language, is gradually replaced by Malay and is under threat of disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/jak |title=Jakun |author= |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaysian radio on the [[Asyik FM]] channel broadcasts separate Jakun programs daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.elpublishing.org/docs/1/11/ldd11_06.pdf |title=The Aslian languages of Malaysia and Thailand: an assessment |author=Geoffrey Benjamin |journal=Language Documentation and Description |date=July 2014 |accessdate=2018-09-27 |issn=1740-6234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:CO 1069-484-118 (7886260798).jpg|thumb|right|A group of Jakun people at Blanja, [[Perak Tengah District]], [[Perak]], June 1874.]]
It is traditionally believed that the ancestors of Jakun people, like other [[Proto-Malay]] people, arrived in the [[Malay Peninsula]] from the southern Chinese province of [[Yunnan]] some 5,000 years ago. The ancestors of the other two groups of [[Orang Asli]] were living here are the [[Semang]] and [[Senoi]] people.

The first [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] arrived on the peninsula much later, probably around 1,500-2,000 years ago, and this was due to the expansion of the Malay empire of [[Srivijaya]], and with its center located on the island of [[Sumatra]]. Initially, the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] initially established trade relations with the local population, but later began to dominate the land. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] often mixed with the Jakun people, and the aborigines became part of the Malay population. Those indigenous people who opposed the outsiders were eventually moved to the interior regions and retained a significant part of their traditional culture.

For a period of long time the Jakun people continued to live mostly in isolation from the outside world.

Jakun people living along the [[Endau River]] in [[Johor]] recall with horror how during the [[Second World War]], pillars of Japanese soldiers were passing their jungle.&lt;ref name="LOTP"/&gt;

The active penetration of the state government and individuals into traditional Jakun areas began in the mid-1980s, and intensified in the 1990s. In 1987, there was a land conflict between local Jakun settlers and the other settlers in Pasir Asam, near [[Kota Tinggi]], [[Johor]]. The state government was favouring the settlers and offered the Jakun settlers to move to a new settlement specially built for the indigenous people.&lt;ref name="TOAATCFR"/&gt;

The state government regards the [[Orang Asli]] as poor and marginalized ethnic minorities that are far from center of developments. Their socioeconomic activity, which is closely linked to the surrounding natural resources, is considered to be backward. For a better life, they are offered to move to permanent residence in villages based on the model of Malay peasants. As a result of the implementation of government programs under the resettlement scheme, most Jakun people were forced to leave their traditional villages and found themselves in specially constructed for them new state-owned so-called RPS (''Rancangan Pengumpulan Semula'', the "Regrouping Plan") sites whose settlers are provided with basic amenities.&lt;ref name="TDOTOACIPM"/&gt; Although they were placed in new state-funded houses in already existing villages, the provision of amenities and infrastructure is noticeably lagging behind. Jungles that are cut down near Jakun villages were replaced with other commodity crop plantations that are not theirs, but the Jakun people still receive revenues from these plantations.

The resettlement of Jakun people to new settlements has often occurred in relation with some natural disasters.

Now their villages are far from the forest, they are deprived of their native environment, where they collected rattan, root crops, looked after their forest plants. This is also added with a significant depletion of the remaining natural resources.

There are areas of Jakun settlements that found themselves in the areas of attention in the tourism industry. Tourists are attracted primarily by "untouched nature" of the locals. A popular place for ecotourism, particularly [[Lake Chini]], with its legend about the immersion of an ancient city of [[Khmer Empire]] under water. However, due to the depletion of the local natural resources, the flow of tourists has decreased. In 2007, they managed to attract only 17,000 people.&lt;ref name="LOTP"/&gt;

==Traditional economy==
[[File:Jakun Hunting Party Blowpipe Malaysia Mongoloid.png|thumb|Jakun [[blowgun]] hunting party, 1906.]]
In the past, the Jakun people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s. The nutritional diet are based on fish and wild animals. Animals such as wild boars, indigenous deer species (''[[Greater mouse-deer|pelandok]]'', ''[[Chevrotain|kancil]]'' and ''[[Muntjac|kijang]]''), lizards, monkeys and other small animals are hunted. [[Blowgun]]s (''sampit'') are employed in hunting; which is usually made of bamboo tubing with sharpened tip bamboo darts that are pre-dipped in poison. Jakun hunters can shoot their [[blowgun]] with deadly precision of 30 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/30618/3/IntroductionToHumanEcologyResearchOnAgriculturalSystemsInSoutheastAsiaPartIII1984%5Bpdfa%5D.PDF |title=Chapter 15: Orang Asli Interactions With The Malaysian Tropical Rain Forest System |author=A. Terry Rambo |publisher=University of Hawai'i at Manoa |year=1984 |accessdate=2018-10-11 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cage traps (''bubu'') made of bamboo and bounded by rocks are used to catch fish in rivers or streams. The type and shape of the cage trap depends on the size and type of fish they are going to catch.&lt;ref name="PCOTOAJAKP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.uthm.edu.my/5827/1/15._Siti_Aminah.pdf |title=Practice Cultural of Orang Asli Jakun at Kampung Peta |author=Siti Aminah Mohd Sam &amp; Seow Ta Wee |publisher=University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia |year=2013 |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jungle produce such as wild fruits, rattan, wood, rubber, wax, camphor and herbs are gathered. A significant portion of these produce are then exchanged for other commodities.&lt;ref name="ALAP793"/&gt;

In some areas, the Jakun people also engage in primitive agriculture. They had small farms in the jungle. For this purpose, the land was cleared by [[slash-and-burn]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bela C. Maday|title=Area Handbook for Malaysia and Singapore, Volume 550, Issue 45|year=1965|contribution=American University (Washington, D.C.). Foreign Areas Studies Division, United States. Dept. of the Army|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|isbn=|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice and tuber-based crops like sweet potatoes are grown. They practice [[shifting cultivation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.D. Hill|title=Agriculture in the Malaysian Region|year=2013|contribution=|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=99-716-9601-0|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; where after two seasons of land cultivation had passed, they would move on to another plot of land and start everything again from the beginning. They will only returned to the old plot of land after many years.

However, most Jakun people prefer not to engage in farming but to exchange foods from the [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] and [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] people with their jungle produce such as [[kemenyan]], [[gaharu]], [[dammar gum]] and rattan by [[barter]]. Thus they also received clothing, tobacco, salt, [[Gambier (extract)|gambier]] and [[Areca catechu|areca nut palm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Khor Manickam|title=Taming the Wild: Aborigines and Racial Knowledge in Colonial Malaya|year=2015|contribution=|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=99-716-9832-3|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALAP793"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ajit K. Danda|title=Asia, land and people|year=2004|contribution=|publisher=Asiatic Society|isbn= 81-723-6140-8|page=793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In using natural resources, the Jakun people must take into account the ownership of specific communities in a certain territory. Although they do not physically demarcate it, everyone knew well the limits of the possessions of their neighboring communities. People hunted animals, caught fish, cultivated farms, or collected grass only within their own territory. In addition, they do not take anything superfluous in regards to using natural resources, because they understood that the jungle should not be harmed.

The traditional house of the Jakun people is hut made of bamboo flooring, tree bark or wooden plank walls and [[Nypa fruticans|Nipah]] roofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245586235 |title=Strategi Tradisional Komuniti Jakun Tasik Chini, Pahang Mengurus Sumber Semulajadi Secara Lestari |author=Mustaffa Omar; Zanisah Man; Ishak Yussof |publisher=Jurnal e-Bangi, Volume 6, Number 2 |date=January 2011 |accessdate=2018-10-11 |issn=1823-884X |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Jakun people wore loincloth around the hips made from the bark of trees with their own hands and did not buy clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Thomas Athol Joyce &amp; Northcote Whitridge Thomas|title=Women of All Nations: A Record of Their Characteristics, Habits, Manners, Customs and Influence, Volume 1|year=1911|contribution=|publisher=Cassell|oclc=314475794|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Pagan races of the Malay Peninsula (1906) (14801493803).jpg|thumb|right|A group of Jakun men from the Langkap Pass, [[Negeri Sembilan]], 1906.]]
Most Jakun people adhere to their animistic beliefs that are closely related to their natural surroundings. They believe that not only people have souls but animals, plants, and even inanimate objects (mountains, hills, settlements, rivers, rocks, caves, and so on) as well.&lt;ref name="TNEB475"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert P. Gwinn|title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica: Micropaedia, Holderness - Krasnoje, Volume 6|year=1987|contribution=|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=08-522-9434-4|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personality of [[Orang Asli]] is closely linked to the nature and the land on which they live. It is the basis of their material and spiritual being, as well as the source of their physical and emotional nourishment. Jakun people do not consider themselves as a higher being higher than animals. They speak with animals too, as if they can understand them. There is great respect for every living thing, from the big elephant to the tiny cicada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Insight|title=Malaysia|year=1993|contribution=|publisher=APA Publications|isbn=03-956-6237-0|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakun people are very superstitious,&lt;ref name="EAAOMHCAAP"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ukm.my/geografia/images/upload/8x.geografia-dec15-vivien-bi-edam.pdf |title=Education and awareness of modern health care amongst aboriginal people: The case of the Jakuns of Peninsular Malaysia |author=Vivien W.C.

Jakun people believe that the forces that "live" in natural objects are so powerful that they can bring about inconceivable things at first glance. In their beliefs, one could only just touch a leaf of a certain plant, and it can heal a sick person or make one crave a certain desire, because that leaf has the power of the spirit. For that reason, the Jakun people believe in the strength found in traditional medicine based on herbs and roots that they find in the wild.&lt;ref name="PCOTOAJAKP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=|title=Malayan Naturalist, Volumes 39-40|year=1985|contribution=|publisher=Malayan Nature Society|isbn=|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that souls can leave their hosts, and they can be tempted or coerced by magic.&lt;ref name="TNEB475"/&gt; A Jakun ''bomo'' (''bomoh'' in [[Malay language]] meaning, "healer" or "sorcerers") are able to "communicate" with spirits, and because of this they are respected and revered by society. Sometimes they are more influential than rural heads. In order to communicate with supernatural forces or ancestral spirits, the ''bomo'' would hold special ceremonies.

In carrying out the policy of Islamization of the indigenous population; which became intensified after 1980, Muslim missionaries began to operate in [[Orang Asli]] communities. As a result, a certain part of the Jakun population was converted to [[Islam]]. According to JHEOA statistics in 1996, a total of 16,637 Jakun people totaled 1,324 Muslims (8%). In the state of [[Johor]], the results of Islamization were more prominent with 20% of the Jakun people are Muslims, while in [[Pahang]] there are only 5%.&lt;ref name="LOTP"/&gt;

It should be noted that the Islamization of the Jakun people is often superficial. They regard themselves as Muslims only to receive certain benefits.&lt;ref name="LOTP"/&gt; There is also a psychological factor involved. Jakun people who live in close contact with the Malay people, would almost always say that they are Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Johannes Nicolaisen &amp; Jens Yde|title=Folk, Volume 29|year=1987|contribution=|publisher=Dansk etnografisk forening|isbn=|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they usually do not know any Muslim prayer, nor do they go to a mosque, and do not adhere to the laws of [[Islam]].

==Changes under the influence of the present==
[[File:Pos Brooke - rumah Orang Asli.jpg|thumb|A typical village house for the Orang Asli.]]
Under the influence of integration into modern economy, the life of the indigenous peoples of Malaysia experience a transformation. Before the colonial era, many Jakun people would enter the jungle on a seasonal basis to harvest [[forest product|jungle produce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jin-Bee Ooi|title=Land, people, and economy in Malaya|year=1963|contribution=|publisher=Longmans|oclc=468563551|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter William Skeat &amp; Charles Otto Blagden|title=Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula|year=1906|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jakun people are now torn off from the jungle, although from time to time they would still harvest jungle produce. Traditional activities are no longer a source of income for them. Most Jakun communities in the modern age have a settled lifestyle and live in permanent villages practicing agriculture.&lt;ref name="IPAED"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Katia Iankova; Azizul Hassan; Rachel L'Abbe|title=Indigenous People and Economic Development: An International Perspective|year=2016|contribution=|publisher=Routledge|isbn=13-171-1730-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Jakun people are collective owner of the rubber and oil palm plantations; the main commodity produced in the region.&lt;ref name="IPAED"/&gt; From these plantations, they receive monthly earnings. These funds, as well as government monetary assistance, are fully used to cover their daily expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237719223_Entrepreneurship_among_The_Orang_Asli_Proto-Malays_A_Malaysian_Aboriginal_Tribe_In_Rompin_Pahang_Are_they_progressing_in_entrepreneurship |title=Entrepreneurship among The Orang Asli Proto-Malays (A Malaysian Aboriginal Tribe) In Rompin, Pahang: Are they progressing in entrepreneurship? |author=Abu Bakar Sedek Abdul Jamak; Nuradli Ridzwan Shah Bin Mohd Dali; Dr. Abu Bakar Bin Mohd Yusof; Syed Zamberi Bin Ahmad |publisher=Kolej Pengurusan Bisnes, Universiti Tenaga Nasional |date=26 March 2016 |accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people have plots of land in the village where groats (yams, lemongrass, cassava, bananas) are grown and animals are raised.

Nowadays, Jakun people do not hunt animals. Even when they come across wild birds or monkeys in plantations, they do not kill them for meat. The reason includes some psychological basis, that the Jakun people do not want to be perceived as uncivilized because they consume exotic meat. It is easier for them to buy chicken, beef or other meat from grocery stores or from mobile dealers who come to their villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45718359_SUSTAINABLE_LIVELIHOOD_OF_THE_COMMUNITY_IN_TASIK_CHINI_BIOSPHERE_RESERVE_THE_LOCAL_PRACTICES |title=Sustainable Livelihood Of The Community In Tasik Chini Biosphere Reserve: The Local Practices |author=Habibah Ahmad; Hamzah Jusoh; Mushrifah Idris |publisher=Canadian Center of Science and Education |journal=Journal of Sustainable Development, Vol. 3, No. 3 |date=September 2010 |accessdate=2018-11-13 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, hunting or catching wild animals is now banned in jungles belonging to the territory of national parks.

At the same time, due to the increased demand for jungle produce, some Jakun people have resumed harvesting of rattan, bamboo, wood, wild bush, roots and medicinal plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Premilla Mohanlall|title=Green Malaysia: Rainforest Encounters|year=2002|contribution=|publisher=Malaysian Timber Council|isbn=98-140-6853-5|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected products are for sale.

Jakun people still use traditional traps for fishing. Although they are familiar with fishing rods, they only perceive their use for leisure. Unless there is really a need to catch fish, they would still use fish traps.&lt;ref name="PCOTOAJAKP"/&gt;

Some of the Jakun people work in the tourism field, especially among those that lived in the national park territories. They conduct excursions or services for tourists. Some of the locals began to organize tourist attractions in their villages with elements of local traditions such as arranging traditional greetings, selling traditional handmade products, provide training classes on local ways of hunting for tourists, fishing and jungle trekking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/jom/2018/08/404081/day-jakun-tribe |title=A day with the Jakun tribe |author=Zulkifly Ab.

Most children would go to school. Their parents have a positive attitude towards schooling, because they believe that education will improve the chances of children to have a better life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebpj.e-iph.co.uk/index.php/EBProceedings/article/view/1288 |title=Impacts of Resettlements on Orang Asli Community |author=Jamalunlaili Abdullah; Siti Aisyah Abd Samat; Che Bon Ahmad |publisher=Environment-Behaviour Proceedings Journal, Vol. 3 No. 7 |year=2018 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; But like many other Orang Asli groups, however, they suffer from inadequate access to public schools, which can be far away from the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2015/05/24/sk-tasik-chinis-meteoric-rise/ |title=SK Tasik Chini’s meteoric rise |author=Ann-Marie Khor |publisher=The Star |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the young people work in cities. If the work brings them good income, then they will not settle back in their native villages.&lt;ref name="EAAOMHCAAP"/&gt;

Jakun people are becoming more and more modernized and they are no longer seen as a stereotypical indigenous people as they are dressed as like any ordinary Malaysians, watch television, listen to radio, drive cars, ride motorcycles and speak the [[Malay language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmad A Nasr &amp; Jamil Farooqui|title=Development and Its Diverse Aspects|year=2015|contribution=|publisher=Partridge Publishing Singapore|isbn=14-828-5354-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the security of Jakun people's everyday amenities is still insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/features/2014/01/02/poverty-hope-beyond-handouts/ |title=Poverty: Hope beyond handouts |author=Lim Chia Ying |publisher=The Star |date=2 January 2014 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Jakun villages do not have water supply and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysianbar.org.my/bar_news/berita_badan_peguam/visit_to_the_jakun_tribe_at_bukit_radan_muadzam_shah_in_pahang.html |title=Visit to the Jakun tribe at Bukit Radan, Muadzam Shah in Pahang |author=Anthony Chua |publisher=The Malaysian Bar |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poverty rate in many of their communities is one of the highest in the country. Young people also do not have enough business opportunities.

==Society==
[[File:Pagan races of the Malay Peninsula (1906) (14779272764).jpg|thumb|right|A group of Jakun people in [[Batu Pahat District|Ulu Batu Pahat]], [[Johor]], 1906.]]
A Jakun village usually consists of several families. Those families are grouped into a village community headed by a village head, chieftain, leader or elder called, ''Batin''.&lt;ref name="COIAOEASA133"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Edward Green Balfour|title=Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific|year=1873|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Malaysian Malay|Malay people]], the Jakun community is an informal association of fully autonomous families. In the past, the village head often headed the group only during their wanderings in the jungles and hunting.&lt;ref name="COIAOEASA133"/&gt; At the same time, in a areas closer to [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] settlements, such a leader gradually turned into a hereditary ''Batin'' leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter William Skeat &amp; Charles Otto Blagden|title=Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula|year=1906|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nucleus family; which usually consists of five or six individuals, predominates. The Jakun people live in close contact with their relatives, brothers and sisters, parents and children are usually standing next to each other. Here they attach special importance to the institution of the family, such as values of respect for the elders, as well as the character of each person. The family is very stable and intact. Before marriage, children live with their parents, until they would start their own new family. Although they live separately, they would often visit their parents.

Family life begins about 17 years old. When a boy chooses a girlfriend, his family sends a matchmaker to arrange a marriage and set the value of the dowry for the young. According to Jakun's customs, the bride's family later in the form of a gift returns to the bridegroom's family for about half of the dowry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Carlisle; Yvonne Deutch; Nigel Rodgers|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mankind, Volume 8|year=1990|publisher=M. Cavendish|isbn=18-543-5040-4|page=993}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dance is performed during the wedding day, in the middle of which the bride would dash off into the jungle followed by the bridegroom to chase her. Should he failed to return without the bride, the wedding would be called off and he would be jeered by the attendees of the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Neville Hutchinson|title=Marriage Customs in Many Lands|year=1897|publisher=Seeley and Company, limited|oclc=468504996|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the wedding ceremony, young couple must feed each other with rice.

Usually after a marriage, when the young couple do not have their own house, the husband goes to live with his wife's parents. According to tradition, every wife must visit their husband's parents for at least three days each year. This event is celebrated injunction with traditional holidays.

Jakun people are usually monogamous, and divorces occur extremely rarely among them. In cases of adultery, punishment may even be death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Edward Green Balfour|title=Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific|year=1873|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the man would have his wife; who have committed the offence tied to a tree in front of his house, and then hides in the bushes with three spears. Her lover; whom she had committed the offence with should try to free her and bring her into her husband's house. At this point, the husband throws the spear out in ambush and to take the life of either his wife or her lover. If the lover can manage to bring woman into the house, then she cannot be killed anymore, but she can still be driven out of her husband's house. A wife in the same way cannot punish her unfaithful husband in an event of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/p_code3/1526.html |title=The Jakun of Malaysia |author= |publisher=Bethany World Prayer Center |year=1997 |accessdate=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the man divorces his wife, then he will lose his dowry unless if the woman divorces her husband, then she must return the dowry to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Étienne Lazare Favre|title=An Account of the Wild Tribes Inhabiting the Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, and a Few Neighbouring Islands: With A Journey in Johore and A Journey in the Menangkabaw States of the Malayan Peninsula|year=1865|publisher=Printed at the Imperial Printing-office|oclc=906108258|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men and women in Jakun society are equal. The husband is the head of the household, therefore it is he who is responsible for ensuring the material needs of the family, which in most cases he works outside of the home. The woman on the other hand mainly deals with housework, including cooking, washing and taking care of children. In the field, there are representatives of both sexes. Besides housework, women are engaged in rubber tapping, collecting wild fruits, herbs and oil palm fruits. Despite the fact that men dominate the economic field, the role of women here is also gradually increasing. There are already female entrepreneurs.  If in regards to the outside world, Jakun communities are predominantly men, whereas decision making at the family level is usually carried out by women. Women are not silent and reduced here, as it is with Malay Muslim women, they are actively involved in all conversations and discussions.

The birth of a child changes the identity of the child's parents and grandparents; of which they move up to a more respectable category. Their name changes accordingly, since this time the parents are called by the name of their eldest child with the addition of "father" or "mother". A new name is also given to newly-born's grandmother and grandfather, now that their name is named after their grandson in the same manner.

Usually Jakun people are referred to as quiet, kind and timid people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Nicholas|title=The Orang Asli and the contest for resources: indigenous politics, development, and identity in Peninsular Malaysia|year=2000|publisher=International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|isbn=87-907-3015-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have dislike of strangers and try to avoid contact with them. The Aboriginal Peoples Act of 1954, which, with some changes, continues to operate today, contributes to the preservation of the barrier between [[Orang Asli]] and other groups of the population. The law defines the criteria by which a person may be considered [[Orang Asli]], the main of which one belongs to an indigenous community and their adherence to traditional customs, language, beliefs and lifestyles. However, Jakun people often interact with other [[Orang Asli]] groups, as well as Chinese and Malay people, and residents of the surrounding villages. Occasionally, there are mixed marriages.

==Preservation of traditional knowledge==
[[File:Pagan races of the Malay Peninsula (1906) (14594971319).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Three Jakun boys, [[Batu Pahat District|Ulu Batu Pahat]], [[Johor]], 1906.]]
The [[Orang Asli]], living in wet tropical jungles, have formed a distinctive and unique culture. They have a high level of knowledge about the environment, formed on the basis of empirical experience. This knowledge is inherited from their ancestors, and passed through the ages from generation to generation. Loss of jungles, degradation of the natural environment and change in the way of life of the Jakun people lead to the loss of their traditional knowledge and skills, and with them, to the loss of their identity as a separate people. The wanderings through the jungle still brings moral satisfaction and pleasant memories to the older generation, but for the young people it is forgotten traditions.

Some international and Malaysian organizations are attempting, on a commercial basis, to introduce activities based on traditional knowledge and skills of the people in Jakun communities. An example could be the introduction of cultivation of local medicinal plants of commercial value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/malaysia/docs/EnE/13477_Peatswamp/Asli_Jakun_Heritage_Garden.pdf |title=Asli Jakun Heritage Garden |author= |publisher=UNDP - United Nations Development Program |year= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the production of mats for sale, rugs from [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|Pandan]] leaves, baskets handbags and so forth.&lt;ref name="PCOTOAJAKP"/&gt;

The Jakun people, possessing traditional knowledge and having the appropriate experience, can make a significant contribution to the conservation of jungles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Local Understanding of Forest Conservation in Land Use Change Dynamics |author=Muhammad Adha Shaleh; Miriam Karen Guth; Syed Ajijur Rahman |year=2016 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, they have a positive attitude to these processes, but it is specific. On one hand, the jungle is in their blood, they perceive it as a refuge of their traditional knowledge, as their heritage. On the other hand, the jungle for them is a source of livelihood. Therefore, they consider the conservation of jungles as a guarantee of the well-being of their future generations.&lt;ref name="LUOFCILUCD11-12"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Local Understanding of Forest Conservation in Land Use Change Dynamics |author=Muhammad Adha Shaleh; Miriam Karen Guth; Syed Ajijur Rahman |year=2016 |pages=11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Jakun people do not perceive nature conservation in the sense of restricting activities in the jungle. They refer to these problems purely from practical considerations and the conservation of jungles is considered from the point of view of quantitative assessment of the benefits that they will derive from.&lt;ref name="LUOFCILUCD11-12"/&gt;

'''Jonathan Dube''' is a digital media executive.

He currently serves as Senior Vice President and General Manager, AOL News &amp; Information. Dube leads the News content division, which includes the AOL News, Technology, Finance, and Sports groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL Names Jonathan Dube SVP/General Manager|url=http://corp.aol.com/2010/10/28/aol-names-jonathan-dube-svp-general-manager-news-and-information/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He previously served as the Vice President in charge of ABCNews.com, responsible for the strategic planning, business strategy, editorial content, and production of the network's 24-hour online news service. Dube has served twice as President of the international [[Online News Association]] and currently serves on ONA's Board of Directors.

He's been described as "a web reporting pioneer" by The [[Poynter Institute]], "a major figure in the online-news business" by [[Editor &amp; Publisher]] and "one of the first journalists to use an online ([[blog]]) journal" by [[The New York Times]].

In 1998, while working at The Charlotte Observer, he helped write a Weblog covering Hurricane Bonnie in 1998, the first time a news site used the Weblog format to cover breaking news.

As a national producer for [[ABCNEWS]].com, he was one of the first true multimedia reporters, covering stories such as the [[Columbine High School]] shooting and the [[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]] by shooting digital photos and video, creating interactive graphics, filing reports for ABC Radio and working with ABC News correspondents and producers. In February 2000, he and ABC News correspondent [[Brian Ross (journalist)]] jointly broke the news online of the arrest of a hacker known as "[[Mafiaboy]]" for attacks that took down major Web sites, such as Yahoo and CNN. It was one of the first times a major online news site broke an investigative story online and one of the earliest examples of joint reporting by an online and network TV journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mafiaboy Arrested |work=ABCNews.com |date=2000-04-18 |url=//www.abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/webattacks000418.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815084952/http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/webattacks000418.html |archivedate=August 15, 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Dube founded CyberJournalist.net, a site about how technology is transforming journalism. In addition, he serves on the board of the Online Publishers Association, the advisory board of the Center for Citizen Media and is a founding member of the [[Media Bloggers Association]].

Dube writes a Web Tips column for The [[Poynter Institute]], the premier professional training institute for journalists, and has served as visiting faculty for the institute.

He has also worked as the Director of Digital Media for CBC News, the news division of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]; the editorial director for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s award-winning website, CBC.ca; technology editor and managing producer for [[MSNBC.com]]; and a freelancer for The New York Times.

A native New Yorker, Dube has a bachelor's degree from [[Wesleyan University]] in Middletown, Conn., and a master's degree in journalism from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], where he lived with George Miller (now a Temple University journalism professor) and Doug Black. He studied new media and now serves on the school's Annual Fund Committee.

==Awards==
Dube won the first national Online Journalism Award for Breaking News for his coverage of the [[World Trade Organization]] protests in Seattle. He has also won four online journalism awards and two investigative reporting awards from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]], as well as the first-ever new media award from Columbia University.

While at MSNBC.com, the site won every major online journalism award, from [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] Awards to [[Edward R. Murrow]] Awards.

At the CBC, he led the company's website to every major online award in Canada, including multiple RTNDA Canada Awards, an EPpy Award and the Canadian New Media Award.

[[File:MinusinskTatars.jpg|thumb|A group of Khakas at [[Minusinsk]]]]
The '''Khakas''', or '''Khakass''' ([[Khakas language|Khakas]]: {{lang|tut|Тадарлар}}, {{lang|tut-Latn|Tadarlar}}), are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people, who live in [[Russia]], in the republic of [[Khakassia]] in southern [[Siberia]].  They speak the [[Khakas language]].

The origin of the Khakas people is disputed. Some scholars see them as descendants of the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]],&lt;ref name="Skutsch2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Skutsch|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXYKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA705&amp;dq=khakas+tatar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgKahUKEwjyj-u74MjIAhXDPz4KHTyPCH4#v=onepage&amp;q=khakas%20tatar&amp;f=false|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-19388-1|pages=705–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedrich1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Friedrich|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures: Russia and Eurasia, China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc4ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=khakas+tatar&amp;dq=khakas+tatar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgKahUKEwjyj-u74MjIAhXDPz4KHTyPCH4|date=14 January 1994|publisher=G.K. Hall|isbn=978-0-8161-1810-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that, at the behest of the medieval [[Mongol]] Khans, the Yenisei Kirghiz migrated to Central Asia. It is believed that the '''Khakas people''' and [[Fuyu Kyrgyz language|Fuyu Kyrgyz]] are closer to the ancient Yenisei Kirghiz, who are both Siberian Turkic peoples (Northeastern Turkic), rather than the Kyrgyz people of modern Kyrgyzstan, who are Kipchak Turkic people (Northwestern Turkic).

== History ==
The Yenisei Kirghiz were made to pay tribute in a treaty concluded between the Dzungars and Russians in 1635.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dzungar Oirat Kalmyks coerced the Yenisei Kirghiz into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&amp;pg=PA611&amp;dq=kirghiz+kipchak+dzungars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAWoVChMIq9uerNHIyAIVwmk-Ch2EVABb#v=onepage&amp;q=kirghiz%20kipchak%20dzungars&amp;f=false|date=6 April 2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-087775-4|pages=611–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrownAsher2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=E.

Some of the Yenisei Kirghiz were relocated into the [[Dzungar Khanate]] by the [[Dzungars]], and then the Qing moved them from [[Dzungaria]] to northeastern China in 1761, where they became known as the [[Fuyu Kyrgyz language|Fuyu Kyrgyz]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AzG5llo3YCMC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Tchoroev (Chorotegin) 2003], p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pozzi &amp; Janhunen &amp; Weiers 2006, p. 113.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StaryPozzi2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giovanni Stary|author2=Alessandra Pozzi|author3=Juha Antero Janhunen |author4=Michael Weiers |title=Tumen Jalafun Jecen Aku: Manchu Studies in Honour of Giovanni Stary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbmP_1KIQ_8C&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05378-5|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibe Bannermen were stationed in Dzungaria while Northeastern China (Manchuria) was where some of the remaining Öelet Oirats were deported to.&lt;ref name="Janhunen1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juha Janhunen|title=Manchuria: An Ethnic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfJiAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=pacified|year=1996|publisher=Finno-Ugrian Society|isbn=978-951-9403-84-7|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nonni basin was where Oirat Öelet deportees were settled.

In the 17th century, the Khakas formed Khakassia in the middle of the lands of Yenisei Kirghiz, who at the time were [[vassal]]s of a [[Mongolia]]n ruler.  The [[Russians]] arrived shortly after the Kirghiz left, and an inflow of Russian agragian settlers began.  In the 1820s, [[gold]] mines started to be developed around [[Minusinsk]], which became a regional industrial center.

The names Khongorai and Khoorai were applied to the Khakas before they became known as the Khakas.&lt;ref name="Balzer1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer|title=Culture Incarnate: Native Anthropology from Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6iqnD-NX5EC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=khakas+tatar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwB2oVChMI0tXTx9_IyAIVxWk-Ch095gQV#v=onepage&amp;q=khakas%20tatar&amp;f=false|year=1995|publisher=M.E.

During the 19th century, many Khakas accepted the Russian ways of life, and most were converted en masse to [[Russian Orthodox]]  Christianity.

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|Revolution of 1905]], a movement towards autonomy developed.  When Soviets came to power in 1923, the Khakas National District was established, and various ethnic groups (Beltir, Sagai, Kachin, Koibal, and Kyzyl) were artificially "combined" into one&amp;mdash;the Khakas.  The National District was reorganized into [[Khakas Autonomous Oblast]], a part of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], in 1930.&lt;ref name="Forsyth1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Forsyth|title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony 1581-1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzhq85nPrdsC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=khakas+tatar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMI0tXTx9_IyAIVxWk-Ch095gQV#v=onepage&amp;q=khakas%20tatar&amp;f=false|date=8 September 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47771-0|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Khakassia|Republic of Khakassia]] in its present form was established in 1992.

The Khakas people account for only about 12% of the total population of the republic (78,500 as of 1989 Census)&lt;!--need 2002 Census numbers here--&gt;. The Khakas people traditionally practiced nomadic herding, agriculture, hunting, and fishing.  The Beltir people specialized in handicraft as well. Herding sheep and cattle is still common, although the republic became more industrialized over time.

The '''Lao Theung''' or '''Lao Thoeng''' (Lao: [[wikt:ລາວເທິງ|ລາວເທິງ]] {{IPA-lo|láːo tʰə́ŋ|}}) is one of the traditional divisions of [[ethnic group]]s living in [[Laos]] (the others being the [[Lao Loum]] and the [[Lao Soung]]). It literally indicates the "midland Lao", and comprises a variety of different ethnic groups of mostly [[Austro-Asiatic]] origin.  In 1993, the Lao Theung formed 24% of the country's population.

==History==
Lao Theung are largely of [[Mon-Khmer]] stock, and are believed to be the [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] population of mainland [[Southeast Asia]], having migrated south in pre-historical time. Their legendary origin is related in the "Pumpkin Story" in [[Lan Xang#McCarthy.27s account of 1894|James McCarthy's account of 1894]].  Although they now live in the higher uplands of Laos, they were originally [[paddy field|paddy rice]] farmers, until displaced by the influx of [[Lao Loum]] migration into southeast Asia from Southern China. See [[Upland rice#Upland rice farmers.27 challenges|upland rice farmers' challenges]].

==Culture==
Within Laos, the Lao Theung are sometimes referred to by the pejorative term ''khaa'' (Lao: [[wikt:ຂ້າ|ຂ້າ]]), meaning "slave", reflecting the fact that they were traditionally used for labour by the lowland Lao.&lt;ref name="JSS_062_1e_Murdoch"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Layap''' ([[Dzongkha]]: ལ་ཡཔ་) are an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] inhabiting the high mountains of northwest [[Bhutan]] in the village of [[Laya, Bhutan|Laya]], in the [[Gasa District]], at an altitude of {{convert|3,850|m|ft}}, just below the [[Tsendagang]] peak. Their population in 2003 stood at 1,100. Ethnically related to the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], they speak [[Layakha]], a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lya |title=Layakha |publisher=[[SIL International]] |work=[[Ethnologue]]: Languages of the World |editor=Lewis, M. Paul |year=2009 |edition=16 (online) |location=[[Dallas, Texas]] |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tribe/tribes/layap/index.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] online |title=Tribe – Layap |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layaps refer to their homeland as ''Be-yul'' – "the hidden land."&lt;ref name=Kuensel1/&gt;

==Dress==
The dress of the Layap is similar to the Tibetan costume, except for a few differences. While men wear the Bhutanese costume, which consists of a silk or linen garment that is typically colored saffron and red (cf. ''[[gho]]''), the women wear black woolen jackets, which reach right down to the ankles. A blue pattern band may also be found at the bottom of their long sleeves. They also adorn themselves with silver jewelry and beads.

The most distinctive feature of the Layap women's dress is their [[Pointed hat|conical hat]]. Made out of darkened bamboo strips, the conical hat ends with a sharp point to the sky, a cross similar to the Christian cross inverted to an upside down position.

==Religion==
Owing to Tibetan influence, the Layap practice a mixture of [[Bon]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. According to legend, Laya village is the spot where [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the founder of Bhutan, first entered the country.&lt;ref name=Kuensel1/&gt;

Particularly unique among the Layap is the extensive tradition of "living defilements" ([[Dzongkha]]: ''soen drep''), whereby a ritually impure person is ostracized from social activities. The Layap shun "living defilements" in order not to anger deities, and to avoid physical maladies and livestock plagues. Among ritually impure acts are birth, divorce, and death, including the death of a horse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13064 |title=Laya's "Living Defilements" |first=Tashi |last=Dema |date=2009-07-25 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Located near the Tibetan border, the Layap have traditionally engaged in trade. Nowadays that includes the smuggling of bootleg Chinese blankets and plastic goods which are embargoed by the Bhutanese government, but in much demand by Bhutanese villagers.&lt;ref name=Kuensel1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/article.php?sid=3432 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031207122252/http://www.kuenselonline.com/article.php?sid=3432 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |title=Laya: Not Quite a Hidden Land |first=Kencho |last=Wangdi |date=2003-11-04 |archivedate=2003-12-07 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

Traditionally, the Layap lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, who rearing [[yak]]s and [[dzo]]s, although in recent times small ponies may also be found in the area. Owing to the cold weather at this altitude, few crops can be planted, except for some grasses.&lt;ref name=Kuensel1/&gt; Layaps also traditionally pick [[cordyceps]], valuable traditionally medicinal and magical fungi native to the region.&lt;ref name=Kuensel2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=20042 |title=A Life-Changer for the Highlanders |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |first=Tashi |last=Dema |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bhutan's increased environmental protection, Layaps and rural farmers face more challenges protecting their livestock from natural predators, particularly [[leopard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human-Wildlife Conflict Losers |url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13555 |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13552 |title=Layaps Livid with Leopards |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |first=Gyem |last=Thinley |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layap people also participate in the heavy labor to drain [[Thorthormi]], a [[glaciers of Bhutan|glacial lake]] prone to [[GLOF]] flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=14185 |title=A Slice of the Adaptation Pie |date=2009-12-10 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |first=Tenzin |last=Namgyel |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flooding is a particularly serious threat to the Layap way of life, heavily dependent on livestock and sparse water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=12684 |first=Tenzing |last=Lamsang |title=Laya – The Hardest Hit Dzongkhag |date=2009-06-08 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13178 |title=High and Dry in Laya |first=Tashi |last=Dema |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, the Layap lived in near-complete isolation from the world, except for occasional visits to [[Thimphu]] or [[Punakha]], which was a five-day walk. Since the new millennium, Laya has been visited by tourists from all over the world. One can see beautifully painted houses fitted with solar panels, and the construction of new schools for the impoverished children. Most villagers are now able to abandon the village in the winter and return in the springtime.&lt;ref name=Kuensel1/&gt; Many Layaps now live in permanent settlements complete with modern amenities – from toilets to mobile phones and televisions – thanks to disposable incomes from business and trade.&lt;ref name=Kuensel2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=14180 |date=2009-12-10 |title=Cleaning up Laya Valley |first=Gyem |last=Thinley |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13178 |title=Laya Link Up |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, Layap children are attending Bhutanese schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/the-first-emerging-ray-of-hope/ |title=The First Emerging Ray of Hope |first=Eshori |last=Gurung |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119140820/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/the-first-emerging-ray-of-hope/ |archivedate=2011-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though somewhat modernized, Layaps and other tribal peoples of Bhutan remain a curiosity to the majority of the native population, many of whom lead much more modernized lives. The government encourages pride among Bhutan's tribal groups, and cites them as an example of humans successfully living in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=14329 |title=Beyond the Highlander Festival |date=2009-12-28 |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional Layap culture, casual sex is commonplace and accepted among both males and females, unmarried and married. As a consequence, Layap communities face enormous exposure to [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhoea]], and [[hepatitis B]]. Although [[condom]]s were somewhat available, almost no Layaps reported safer sex practices through 2009, a trend the government hopes to buffet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13529 |title=Layaps at High Risk |first=Gyem |last=Thinley |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
The Layap are known for their tradition of [[polyandry]], practiced to keep families and property together, although the custom now in decline.&lt;ref name=Kuensel1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt; The Layap also have a tradition of [[child marriage]], with brides as young as 10 years old. Layap women speaking to media anticipate the increase in schooling among their daughters will result in a decline in child marriages. Many Layap women find [[health in Bhutan|healthcare]] difficult to access during pregnancy due to isolated settlements and nomadic lifestyles. Among the foremost concerns for Layap women is prenatal care.&lt;ref name=Kuensel3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=13052 |title=The Child-Brides of Laya |first=Tashi |last=Dema |publisher=[[Kuensel]] online |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [https://lcra.org.co '''Liga Colombiana de Radioaficionados''' ('''LCRA''']) (in [[English language|English]] '''Colombian Amateur Radio League''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Colombia]].  The organization was founded in 1933 by Italo Amore, Gustavo Uribe, Roberto Jaramillo Ferro, and other radio enthusiasts.  At the time, all radio transmissions were authorized by the Ministry of Posts, who opposed a private amateur radio service.  With LCRA lobbying efforts, private radio broadcasts were authorized in Colombia in 1936, and amateur radio was first licensed in Colombia in 1939.&lt;ref name="lcra_history"&gt;Liga Colombiana de Radioaficionados (2008). [http://www.lcra.org.co/html/reshist.html "Reseña Histórica"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205810/http://www.lcra.org.co/html/reshist.html |date=2008-07-08 }}.  Retrieved Aug. 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key membership benefits of LCRA include the sponsorship of [[amateur radio operating award]]s and radio [[contesting|contests]], and a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those members who regularly communicate with [[amateur radio operator]]s in other countries.  LCRA represents the interests of Colombian amateur radio operators before Colombian and international telecommunications regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name="lcra"&gt;Liga Colombiana de Radioaficionados (2008).

'''MIPTV''' (Marché International des Programmes de Télévision) is an event which takes place annually in [[Cannes]], France, using the facilities and infrastructure which the town has developed over the years to host other important events such as the [[Cannes Film Festival]] amongst other events.

It is essentially a content market for co-producing, buying, selling, financing and distributing entertainment content. It provides the people involved in the TV, film, digital and audiovisual content, production and distribution industry a market conference and networking forum to discover future trends and trade content rights on a global level.

This event is very closely related to the [[MIPCOM]] event, but retains its distinct focus. The MIPCOM event takes place in the same venue in October each year.

== History ==
MIP-TV was started in [[Lyon]], France, in 1963 three years after [[MIFED]], the world’s first audiovisual market, had started in [[Milan]], Italy. The first MIP-TV was attended by 119 companies from 19 countries.

In 1965, after a one-year hiatus, MIP-TV moved to Cannes, using the town’s “old” Palais for the exhibition floors. In 1982 the market moved to the new Palais, while the old one became a hotel.
In 1987 the company that organized the market, [[MIDEM]], was sold to the UK’s [[Television South]] (TVS) for £5 million. Two years later, TVS sold MIDEM to [[Reed Exhibitions]] (for a reported $20 million), which renamed it [[Reed MIDEM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.videoageinternational.com/articles/2013/04/mip50.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Major Israel McCreight''' ([[Oglala Lakota]]: ''Cante Tanke'' ("Great Heart")(Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka) in [[Lakota language|Standard Lakota Orthography]]) (April 22, 1865 – October 13, 1958) is notable in American history as a [[Progressive Era]] banker, conservationist and expert on Native American culture and policy. McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association, and authored President Theodore Roosevelt's conservation policy on public education and [[Cook Forest State Park]], the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark. McCreight dedicated his life to public education about Native American culture and was a nominee for [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs]]. McCreight's relationship with the Lakota people began as a young man in the Dakota Territory in 1885 when he lived with them during a period of great sorrow. He returned to [[Du Bois, Pennsylvania]], became a successful banker, and led the region into prominence as the biggest bituminous coal producers in the United States between 1890 and World War I. McCreight collaborated with [[Flying Hawk]], an [[Oglala Lakota]] Chief, to write a Native American's view of U.S. history and classic accounts of the [[Battle of the Little Big Horn]], [[Crazy Horse]] and commentaries on Native American philosophy.  [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], McCreight's home in [[Du Bois, Pennsylvania]], was a Native American heritage center and once the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota "''Oskate Wicasa"'' [[Wild Westers]]. McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Banker's Association and member of the [[Pennsylvania Society of New York]]. McCreight was an ardent student of the Indian, a lover of fair play and an author of books and articles.

== Early years ==
[[File:Israel McCreight, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|M.I. McCreight, Age 17, 1883]]
Major Israel McCreight was born April 17, 1865, on a farm in Paradise, [[Winslow Township, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania]] and raised with siblings by pioneer parents John Winslow McCreight&lt;ref&gt;John Winslow McCreight (July 11, 1821 – July 23, 1900) was born and lived at the family farm in Paradise, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, son of Andrew McCreight and Ann Sharp, one of 13 children. The McCreights are Scottish of origin, living in Ireland, coming to America in the 1750s.  John Winslow McCreight, known as "Honest John", was a successful farmer and timber merchant.  McCreight was elected Justice of the Peace, never adopting a docket or having a trial.  Disputes or complaints were adjusted without formal hearing and without fee. McCreight died on July 23, 1900 and is buried a short distance from his birthplace in the McCreight family cemetery. His tombstone is inscribed: "The Law of Truth was in his Mouth." M.I. McCreight, "Autobiography:  A 70-Year Old Record of Tchanta Tanka and Squaw, p. 4 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; and Eliza Uncapher McCreight.&lt;ref&gt;See Eliza's Diary http://manycoups.net/ElizasDiary_page1.html&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Major" was a nickname given to Israel as a child and he preferred to be called "Maj", "Maje" or simply "MI."&lt;ref&gt;Israel McCreight was named for his mother's brother, Israel Uncapher who was through the Mexican War and also the Civil War; he became a Major in and after the Civil War; and, because of his then title was known as Major Uncapher. Some self-styled clever neighbor thought it bright to call the babe Major, too. It was always a troublesome and distasteful cognomen. But the name stuck through life. Always called Maje McCreight. M.I. McCreight, Biography Sketch of a Family of Noted Pioneers (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;  At age 16, McCreight attended Eastman Business College in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], to learn accounting and banking. After graduation, he returned to Du Bois, Pennsylvania and entered the banking profession as a night clerk and assistant cashier.&lt;ref&gt;"Major I.

== Devil's Lake Dakota Territory ==
[[File:Major Israel McCreight and Chief Little Shell, Devil's Lake, N.D. 1885.jpg|thumb|right|Major Israel McCreight and Chief [[Little Shell Band of Chippewa Indians|Little Shell]], [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devils Lake]], [[Dakota Territory]], 1885]]

In 1885, the twenty-year-old McCreight, seeking adventure, took the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to its farthest point west, [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devils Lake]], [[Dakota Territory]].  McCreight's two years in the Dakota Territory were filled with classic [[American Old West|Wild West]] adventures. He was immediately hired by a livestock business supplying food to local Indian tribes and the U.S. Army garrison at [[Fort Totten, North Dakota]].  At Fort Totten, McCreight met with Indians trading buffalo bones to be sold as fertilizer in the lucrative St. Louis market.

===Arrival at Devils Lake===
McCreight began his lifelong kinship with Native Americans in Devils Lake. The first people to meet and greet him as he stepped down from the platform of the train were a small band of [[Sioux]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;They were a fine healthy lot; and as the travel-worn youth with his carpet-bag and lunch basket looked about for someone from whom he might ask directions, the Chief stepped up and with extended hand, said: "How cola!" Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town.  He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth began to think that Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, Buffalo Bone Days: A Short Story of the Buffalo Bone Trade, P.13–14 (1939), Nupp. Printing Co, Sykesville, PA (hereinafter Buffalo Bone Days).  The name of the chief is unknown.  There were many from different tribes in the vicinity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Buffalo Bones, 1885.png|300px|thumbnail|left|Indians unloading Buffalo Bones, Devils Lake, Dakota Territory, Major Israel McCreight, 1885]]

=== Chief Little Shell ===
Known as the "Indian Man" because of his friendships,
McCreight prevented a confrontation between the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry Regiment]] and aggrieved [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwe]] from [[Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation]]. In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell's Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers.  McCreight was the "Indian Man" in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying:  "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, and see what you can do with them!"  McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] to intercede for and protect the rights of these abused natives.&lt;ref&gt;Puffs from the Peace Pipe, "Little Shell-Ojibway", p.33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== James J. Hill and the Great Northern Railway ===
McCreight also worked for [[James J. Hill]] the legendary " Empire Builder" of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]].  Hill's vision included the introduction of cattle into the [[Great Plains]] to replace the buffalo as a food source, fatten them in the West, and ship them back to the East. Hill began his cattle promotion with the 'Great Fat Stock Show', July 4, 1886 in Devil's Lake, then the far western terminus of the Great Northern Railway.  The Great Fat Stock Show was a gala midsummer fair of bronco-busting, horse races, Indian war dances and festivities.&lt;ref&gt;"Long trains of excursionists came with blaring brass bands, from as Far East as St. Paul, and the steamboat brought capacity loads of troopers, traders and Indians from the forts; settlers and ranch-hands came in wagons and on horse-back from the north and west Between Little Fish, Sioux Chief from the Cut Head Reservation; Chief Little Shell, from the Chippewa country at the north' and the Grand Old Chief Wanata, once head chief of the Sioux, wielding more power than any Indian on the North American Continent, McCreight had a busy time seeing to it that they were well taken care of during the parades and band-contests, and all had complimentary tickets to the big show in the afternoon." M.I. McCreight, "[http://manycoups.net/GoWestYoungMan_page1.html Go West Young Man]", 1941, at p.19, Nupp. Printing Co., Sykesville, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hill needed someone with banking experience to manage the show, and McCreight was "commandeered" to serve as "ticket seller, money counter and banker."  The show was a success and Hill later invited McCreight to shovel the dirt to lay the first railroad tie to the Great Northern Railway transcontinental system from Devils Lake to [[Seattle]], Washington.&lt;ref&gt;The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:James J. Hill at 35.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[James J. Hill]], "The Empire Builder", The Great Northern Railway, at 35.]]

=== Chief Wa-na-ta ===
[[File:Chief Waanatan II.jpg|thumbnail|left|Chief Waanatan II, also called [[Wanata]] (Wa-na-ta)II, 1828-1897. McCreight forever remembered his kindness and generosity. ]]
McCreight became friends with many Native Americans and Chief [[Wanata|Wa-na-ta]] (Waanatan II) visited McCreight's office regularly to smoke tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight mistakenly believed Wa-na-ta (Wanata) to be Waanatan I.  McCreight notes, "In a report of a government expedition, which visited his tribe in 1845 Wanata, was referred to as the head chief who then had more power than any Indian in the North American continent." Go West Young Man, P.23.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCreight was impressed with the old chief's dignity and bearing. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day he signed that he wished a private interview, when he drew from his blanket a package which he exhibited as something he held more precious than any other treasure.  It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief.  Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly [[Squatting position|squatted]] on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, "Firewater and Forked Tongues:  A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History", p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Chief Wa-na-ta's smoking pipe was his most precious possession.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money.  But when I squatted beside him on the floor, where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving next week for a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.&lt;ref&gt;M.I.

[[File:Major Israel McCreight opening the safe after the great fire.jpg|thumb|left|M.I. McCreight opening the bank vault after the Great Du Bois Fire of 1888]]

In 1886, McCreight returned to Du Bois, Pennsylvania from the Dakota Territory and accepted a position as assistant cashier and director of the First National Bank. McCreight maintained relationships with friends in the Dakotas. Among them was the legendary U.S. Army Scout, Colonel William Frederick "Buffalo Bill" Cody.

In 1886 Buffalo Bill, accompanied by Oglala companions from his Wild West, passed through Du Bois on the way home to [[North Platte, Nebraska]]. After meeting McCreight's childhood sweetheart Alice Humphrey, Cody prompted for an immediate wedding, and McCreight and Alice were married in July, 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois PA, newspaper stories incorrectly reported that Buffalo Bill was a witness to the marriage.  Buffalo Bill was in Europe from May to October, 1887, and could not have attended. They would be married for over seventy years and raise seven children:  Donald, born May 10, 1888; Catharine, born August 6, 1892; twins Jim and Jack, born November 8, 1896; Martha, born November 3, 1900; M.I. McCreight, Jr., born June 18, 1906, and Rembrandt (Rem), born February 25, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1888, seeing an opportunity to manage his own bank, McCreight purchased the Du Bois Deposit Bank.  However, just two weeks later a catastrophic fire raged out of control in the center of the town's wooden structures. McCreight joined a bucket brigade to fight the inferno but the new bank was destroyed. Fortunately, the contents of the safe were recovered and McCreight quickly resumed banking operations.

By 1898, Du Bois Deposit Bank was the only bank in town and McCreight was the treasurer, secretary or director of most local institutions and businesses. McCreight was a "One-man Chamber of Commerce"  and partnered diverse business enterprises.
He successfully acquired land in north central Pennsylvania for coal and railroad interests, and brought the [[Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railroad]], the [[Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad]] and the [[Erie Railroad]] to Du Bois.  McCreight led the Du Bois region into prominence as the biggest [[bituminous coal]] producer in the United States between 1890 and World War I.

McCreight was also "First Citizen of Du Bois".  He led the development of light-rail transportation, public electricity, a public water system and other urban infrastructure, and held leadership positions with the school board, draft board and local board of trade.  McCreight was a founder of the Pennsylvania Banker's Association and a member of the [[Pennsylvania Society of New York]].

== Unexpected visitors ==
[[File:Chief Lone Bear, 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Lone Bear, [[Oglala Lakota]], 1900. An unexpected visitor to DuBois, Pennsylvania, in 1901. Chief Lone Bear was a [[United States Army Indian Scouts|U.S. Army Indian Scout]] during the [[American Indian Wars|Great Plains Wars]].]]
Buffalo Bill and his Wild West was back in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam.  "At the opening of the 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer.  Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief [[Flying Hawk]] was in the party.  The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and swung open their richly covered blankets.  It was a surprise visit from old-time western friends.  Don [McCreight's eldest son] was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver same to the back door, to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside.  Don was thirteen, and full of business.  At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the platter, and another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes.

[[File:Chief Lone Bear, The McCreight Twins.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Fighting McCreight twins boxed for Chief Lone Bear and Chief [[Flying Hawk]].]]

Don set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief.  As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket.  The boy was "game," and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time." 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the [McCreight] twins, aged five. More signals indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves.  But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. All smiles, the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout.  Dad called "time" and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience.  No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted.  When they were exhausted and their dad stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe as worthy of membership in "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Wigwam ==
[[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], McCreight's home in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was part of a 1,300 acre estate with heavily forested lands. The Wigwam sits at 2,140 feet atop Prospect Knob in [[Sandy Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania|Sandy Township, Clearfeld County, Pennsylvania]], near the [[Goschgoschink Path]] where the [[Eastern Continental Divide|Great Divide of the Alleghenies]] was once visible 18 miles to the East.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Divide of the Alleghenies is defined by [[Anderson Creek (Pennsylvania)|Anderson Creek]] and the [[Great Shamokin Path]]  These paths converged at [[Big Spring (Pennsylvania)|The Big Spring]], near [[Brady Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania|Luthersburg, Brady Township]], Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wigwam is located in the wilds of north central Pennsylvania and once had an electric beacon for navigation of New York to San Francisco Air Mail flyers.

[[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]] was a well-spring of images and narratives of Oglala Lakota [[Wild Westing|Wild Westers]] during the early 20th century. The Wigwam was a retreat for Progressive Era politicians, businessmen, journalists and adventurers; the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota "''Oskate Wicasa''"; Chief Flying Hawk's second home for 30 years and a Native American heritage center.&lt;ref&gt;MI's progressive friends included Robert M. LaFollete, Booker T. Washington, Elbert Hubbard and John Wanamaker.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois, Pennsylvania, a northcentral railroad hub on the Eastern Continental divide, had two active passenger rail stations, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Railroad, and was always a welcome rest stop for weary travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Fifty-nine passenger trains arrived and departed from Du Bois until c.1940. See Hughes, Twentieth Century History of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania (2006) at 562.&lt;/ref&gt; For "Old Scouts" Col. William F. "[[Buffalo Bill]]" Cody, [[Robert Edmund Strahorn]] and Captain [[John Wallace Crawford|Jack Crawford]], from the Great Sioux War, the Wigwam was a place to relax, smoke and talk about the Old West. The Old Scouts were adventurers and masters of American Wild West images and narratives.

Wild Westers needed a place to relax, and The Wigwam was a warm and welcome home where Indians could be Indians, sleep in buffalo skins and tipis, walk in the woods, have a hearty breakfast, smoke their pipes and tell of their stories and deeds. On one occasion 150 Indians with Buffalo Bill's Wild West camped in the forests of The Wigwam. Oglala Lakota Chiefs [[Iron Tail]] and Flying Hawk considered The Wigwam their home in the East. Oglala Lakota Chiefs [[American Horse]], [[Chief Blue Horse|Blue Horse]], [[John Grass]], Black Thunder, Whirlwind Horse, Turkey Legs, Lone Bear, Iron Cloud, Bear Dog, Yellow Boy, [[Rain-In-The-Face]], [[Hollow Horn Bear]], Kills-Close-To-Lodge, Red Eagle, Good Face (Eta Waste), Benjamin Brave (Ohitika) and Thunder Bull visited The Wigwam. Legendary Crow Chief [[Plenty Coups]] was also a welcome visitor.

An "old-time" [[Mohawk people|Mohawk Council House]] of the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations]] was erected for ceremonies and visits, and on one occasion 150 Indians camped in the forests of The Wigwam. The sound of [[tom-tom drums]] was frequently heard from The Wigwam.
Surprise visits, parties and gala celebrations were common at The Wigwam.  In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk. [[File:Three Greatest American Scouts.png|450px|thumbnail|right|The "Old Scouts" were frequent guests at [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]]. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Sioux War, in later years they would not talk of it. All expressed remorse.

== The Old Scouts ==
"Old Scouts"  Robert E. Strahorn, Captain Jack Crawford and Col. Buffalo Bill Cody shaped the popular vision of the American West through their images and narratives. At [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], the home of their friend Major Israel McCreight("''Cante Tanke''")  in [[Du Bois, Pennsylvania]], they could relax, smoke and talk about the Old West. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]], in later years they would not talk of it. All expressed remorse.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, "The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.15-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Edmund Strahorn]] (1852 -1944) is notable in American history as a war correspondent with the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' during the Great Sioux War, a scout and publicist for the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and a builder of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Strahorn was a journalist and adventurer who shaped the vision of the American West. "No man knew the West as he knew it" and "few persons had a more active or important if less prominent part in the building of the West."

[[John Wallace Crawford|John Wallace (Jack) Crawford]] (1847-1917), known as "The Poet Scout", was an adventurer, educator and author. "Captain Jack" was a master storyteller about the Wild West and is known in American history as one of America's most popular performers in the late nineteenth century. His perilous ride to tell the news of the great victory by Gen. George Crook against the camp of Chief American Horse at the Battle of Slim Buttes during the Great Sioux War made him a national celebrity.

[[Buffalo Bill Cody|William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody]] (1846 – 1917) was a [[Pony Express]] rider, soldier, buffalo hunter and showman.  Buffalo Bill received the Medal of Honor in 1872 for service to the U.S. Army as a scout.  Cody's images and narratives of the American Wild West and Native Americans are nonpareil. During the [[Progressive Era]], Buffalo Bill was one of the most popular entertainers in America and Europe.

Old Scouts Strahorn, Crawford and Cody found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. Captain Jack's race with [[Frank Grouard]] and perilous ride to tell the news of the great victory at Slim Buttes made him a national celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Jack was terminated as a military scout on September 15, 1876. "Buckskin Poet", p. 61-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Strahorn remarked that his service in the Sioux War won him undreamed of laurels.&lt;ref&gt;Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Cody's fight with the young Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hand and "First Scalp for Custer" launched his theatrical career with a force never before experienced in the relationship between the press and the fledgling world of show business.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Bridger, "Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull: Investing the Wild West", (2002), p.295. Strahorn knew that war a war with the Indians would settle for all time the Indian troubles, open the American West and was excited to join the adventure. "The excitement over war preparations at Cheyenne was mingled with joy that knew no bounds. The belief was general that, whether this campaign was successful or not, it would be the final opening wedge which would for all time settle the Indian troubles.  This would quickly result in the opening up of the Black Hills and Big Horn regions with the adjacent territory, altogether an empire of vast extent and untold resources." Strahorn was sympathetic to the plight of the Indians and reported that the Indians were provoked by the breach of The Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 and the white invasion of the Black Hills.  "The sudden and wanton destruction of the buffalo, deer, antelope and fur animals left the once opulent Indian virtually a pauper was unquestionably the chief cause of the Indian wars on the plains.  Their hunting ground, which the government had sworn by treaty to respect, was overthrown with white hunters, settlers, trappers, gold-seekers and the riff-raff of the plains, who killed off the game without regard to its use or the consequence of such a slaughter to the Indians."  Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 50, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Slim Buttes ===
The [[Battle of Slim Buttes]] and the destruction of Oglala Lakota Chief [[American Horse (elder)|American Horse]]'s village epitomized the excesses of U.S. Army and Indian warfare of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indian villages were attacked at dawn, sacked and burned.&lt;ref&gt;From a purely military standpoint the shock of the dawn attack and the attendant ruin of their homes, food and material goods forced the Indians to choose between the grim realities of starvation and ultimate surrender. "Advantage lay with the concept of the strike at dawn: indeed, one army maxim held that any large body of Indians would scatter before a well-implemented cavalry charge." Greene, p.57, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Warriors were killed, captured and dispersed; food, lodges and supplies were destroyed; ponies were seized or killed; and many women and children were killed in the confusion.&lt;ref&gt;"This tactic, though never formally stated, was in part an extension of the annihilation philosophically fostered by Generals Sherman, Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War.  On the plains the maneuver of surprise and destruction, augmented philosophically by the "total-war" concept, worked best against elusive tribesmen who seldom stood and fought.  The most successful assaults occurred at daybreak, with three or more columns of soldiers striking a sleeping camp simultaneously.  Against such disconcerting thrusts defense was futile, and warriors rushed from their lodges only to be cut down in the charge.  Tragically, large numbers of women and children often died in the confusion of a dawn strike.  Once sacked, the village with its supplies was burned, and the ponies were killed.  Tribesmen subjected to the tactic of surprise at dawn experienced psychological shock and abjectly surrendered." Greene, p.57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The major military objective was to hit Indian commissaries and starve them into submission. "Humanistically speaking, the tactic was immoral, but for an army charged with subjugating the Sioux and other dissident Plains tribes, it was justified for the simple reason that it worked." &lt;ref&gt;Greene, p.57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Sioux War, in later years they would not talk of it. Captain Jack and Strahorn were with General [[George Crook]] at the Battle of Slim Buttes and expressed remorse.  Crawford declined to give any details of his observations at Slim Buttes.  He said it was something he neither wanted to discuss or hear of; he said it hurt him even to have to think about it.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, "The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Jack said he had taken "one top-knot" at the Battle of Slim Buttes during a fight in which he "came near losing" his own hair. He later regretted his bloody deed and never spoke of it in his public performances &lt;ref&gt;Darlis A. Miller, "Captain Jack Crawford: Buckskin Poet, Scout and Showman", (1993), p. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strahorn was always reticent when attempts were made to get him to relate his experiences with Crook's army.  Like Crawford, he wished that the Slim Buttes affair could be stricken from historical records; it was too painful for him to talk of it at all.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, "The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Strahorn later recalled Chief American Horse and the ravine at Slim Buttes. "The yelling of Indians, discharge of guns, cursing of soldiers, crying of children, barking of dogs, the dead crowded in the bottom of the gory, slimy ditch, and the shrieks of the wounded, presented the most agonizing scene that clings in my memory of Sioux warfare."   &lt;ref&gt;Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo Bill would not discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He just shook his head and said it was too bad to talk about.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, "Buffalo Bill As I Knew Him", ''True West Magazine'', July–August (1957). M.I. McCreight, "The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; While Cody did not participate in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the [[Battle of Warbonnet Creek]] on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair.&lt;ref&gt;Around August 15, 1876, Cody grew bored by the progress of the campaign, resigned from the expedition and continued his theatrical career in the East. "Buckskin Poet", p. 55-56.  Greene, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The engagement, often referred to as the "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act.  Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects.  However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.
&lt;ref&gt;On a visit to The Wigwam in 1908, Buffalo Bill told McCreight that he did ''not'' kill Yellow Hair and said earnestly that he had ''never'' knowingly killed any Indian. M.I.

Hedren, "The Contradictory Legacies of Buffalo Bill Cody's First Scalp for Custer", ''Montana: The Magazine of Western History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (Spring 2005), p. 16-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grand reception of 1915 ==
[[File:Grand Reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk, The Wigwam, Du Bois, PA, 1915.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|Grand Reception for Chief [[Iron Tail]] and Chief [[Flying Hawk]], [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], Du Bois, Pennsylvania, 1915]]
In 1915, McCreight hosted a grand reception for Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk at [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Chief Iron Tail was finished with greeting the long line of judges, bankers, lawyers, business men and neighbors who filed past in a receiving line just as the President is obliged to receive and shake the hands of multitude of strangers who call on New Years, the chief grasped hold of the fine buffalo robe which had been thrown over a porch bench for him to rest on drawing it around his shoulders, walked out on the lawn and lay down to gaze into the clouds and over the hundred mile sweep of the hills and valleys forming the [[Eastern Continental Divide]]. He had fulfilled his social obligations when he had submitted to an hour of incessant hand-shaking, as he could talk in English, further crowd mixing did not appeal to him. He preferred to relax and smoke his redstone pipe and wait his call to the big dining room.  There he re-appeared in the place of honor and partook of the good things in the best of grace and gentlemanly deportment.  His courteous behavior, here and at all places and occasions when in company of the writer, was worthy of emulation by the most exalted white man or woman!&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

After Chief Iron Tail had shaken hands with the assembled guests he gathered the big buffalo hide about his shoulders, waived aside the crowd and walked away.  He spread the woolly robe on the grass, sat down upon it and lit his pipe, as if to say, "I've done my social duty, now I wish to enjoy myself."&lt;ref&gt;Puffs From the Peace Pipe, p.10., Firewater and Forked Tongues, p.xxiii–xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Flying Hawk long remembered the gala festivities. "Here he himself and his close friend Iron Tail had held a reception once long ago, for hundreds of their friends, when bankers, preachers, teachers, businessmen, farmers, came from near and far along with their ladies, to pay their respects and say, How Cola!" 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The historian Chief Flying Hawk reminded that when dinner was served, Iron Tail asked to have his own and Flying Hawk's meals brought to them on the open porch where they ate from a table he now sat beside, while the many white folks occupied the dining-room, where they could discuss Indians without embarrassment.  This, he remembered, was a good time, and they talked about it for a long time together, but now, his good friend had left him and was in the Sand Hills.&lt;ref&gt;Firewater and Forked Tongues, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Chief Flying Hawk ==
[[File:Chief Flying Hawk, The Wigwam, 1929.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Chief [[Flying Hawk]], [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], Du Bois, Pennsylvania, 1929]]
The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk's second home for nearly thirty years. Traveling with [[Wild West Shows|Wild West shows]], pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk's health. Chief Flying Hawk could have rest and relaxation at The Wigwam.  Here he could rise with the morning sun for a walk in the forest, enjoy a breakfast of bacon and eggs, with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and have a glass of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk, "refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets.  With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight." McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk's grace and dignity, and described Chief Flying Hawk's meticulous grooming. "The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur.  From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear's oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions.  His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey.  In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they didn't always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies. He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground."  However, even in the relaxed atmosphere of The Wigwam, there was a formality to the visits. Of importance, Flying Hawk was an Oglala Lakota Chief and it was his duty to display his beautiful eagle feather "Chief's Wand" during visits to The Wigwam.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;At sun-up the Chief was missing.  Breakfast was delayed. Presently, Chief Flying Hawk was seen coming from the forest which nearly surrounds The Wigwam. In his hand he carried a green switch six feet in length.  From his traveling bag he took a bundle which he carefully unfolded and laid out, a beautiful eagle feather streamer which he attached to the pole at either end.  After testing it in the breeze he handed it to McCreight with gentle admonishment to keep it in a place where it could always been seen.  It was the Chief's "wand," and he said it must always be kept where it could be seen, else people would not know who was Chief.  Having disposed of this, to him, important duty, the Chief was ready for breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;Firewater and Forked Tongues at pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Who has not seen this has not seen Indians!&lt;ref&gt;Firewater and Forked Tongues, p.xx.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Joseph Blue Horse ==
[[File:Joseph Bluehorse, The Wigwam.jpg|350px|thumbnail|right|Joseph Blue Horse, [[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]], Du Bois, Pennsylvania, 1929]]
Joseph Blue Horse, the grandson of Chief Blue Horse, was a friend of Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and full-time resident of The Wigwam for three years. A veteran of [[World War I]], Blue Horse went Wild Westing with [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] and for many years was billed as "The World's Champion Rider". Later, Blue Horse was billed as a musician with the show.  During his years at The Wigwam, Blue Horse preferred a traditional [[tipi]] to a bedroom in the home and was known affectionately as "Teddy". Joseph Blue Horse assisted McCreight with estate duties and frequently visited local schools talking to children about Oglala Lakota heritage, singing songs and performing stunts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Blue Horse (January 24, 1899 – November 1984), the son of Baldwin ("Bali") Blue Horse (1867 – May 5, 1937), attended the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] from November 1916 through August 1918 and was a bugler and a member of the debating society.  In August 1918, he was transferred to the [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Institute]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] when the Carlisle Indian Industrial School closed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Native American Heritage Center ==
[[File:The Wigwam Staircase.jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|[[Wigwam (DuBois, Pennsylvania)|The Wigwam]] in DuBois, Pennsylvania, was the home of Major Israel McCreight's famous Native American collection.]]
From 1906 to 1958, over 50 years, The Wigwam was a Native American heritage center dedicated to educating the public about Native American history and culture; displaying a collection of gifts and tokens left by Native American friends to thousands of visiting school children, politicians and businessmen; and inviting visiting Native Americans to receptions and to speak at public schools. McCreight dedicated his life to educating the public about Native American history and culture.

The Wigwam was the home of Major Israel McCreight's famous Native American collection. The collection was considered to be among the best-documented Native American collections in the nation and contained hundreds of historically significant items.&lt;ref&gt;See Chet Baranowski, ''The Texas Gun Collector'', p.29, Fall 2005. Mr. Baranowski is Senior Advisor of Native American Studies Niagara Falls Museum, Niagara Falls, NY. See See Louis Garcia, "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Waanatan%27s+pipe+and+tobacco+bag.-a0229897146 Waanatan’s Tobacco Bag]", Whispering Wind, Issue #270, Vol. 39, #2 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Many artifacts were gifts and tokens of personal adornment left by Native American visitors in gratitude and friendship. McCreight carefully recorded the names, dates and occasions, later detailing the events in books he authored during the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. During the fall of 1886, while residing in [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devils Lake, Dakota Territory]], McCreight a young man of 21, was given a special gift of a pipe and tobacco bag by Chief [[Wanata|Wa-na-ta]]. McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.  These gifts marked the beginning of a collection of Native American artifacts to grow in national prominence and number during the next seven decades. McCreight was an historian and the collection served as an educational tool for the study of Native American heritage. The collection was publicly displayed at The Wigwam to local residents, school children, politicians, businessmen and Native Americans for over fifty years.  The Wigwam was a treasure house of relics and thousands of school children, scouts and others interested in Indian lore had the opportunity of viewing the collection. McCreight dedicated his life to educating the public and "Young America" about Native American history and culture, giving many speeches and inviting visiting Native Americans to speak at public schools.  Joseph Blue Horse from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, resided at The Wigwam for three years and frequently visited local schools talking to children about Oglala Lakota heritage, singing songs and performing stunts.

McCreight knew many of the great Native American chiefs whose personal adornments filled The Wigwam, many of whom had been visitors to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and he spoke of their stories with great eloquence, esteem and kinship. [[Plenty Coups]], Grand Chief of the [[Crow Nation|Crows]], was an occasional visitor to The Wigwam during President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s term.  "The tall and dignified Chief took a lively interest in looking over the collection of Indian relics at the Wigwam." "Flying Hawk related a time when he and Iron Tail spent an evening in the Indian room of the Wigwam going over all of the items there including pipes, war bonnets, moccasins, and other paraphernalia once belonging to Wanata, Red Cloud, [[Sitting Bull]] and other of their old-time friends. He said that Iron Tail told him it made him sad when he looked at all these things." Chief Flying Hawk contributed his personal adornments and possessions to McCreight's collection.  "When my brother [[Kicking Bear]] died he was put in a grave on a hill.  All his things are put in a grave with him.  I will see his son, Kicking Bear, if they will let us dig open the grave and take out the arrow-head and send it to this wigwam to put along with my things."  When Chief Flying Hawk passed to the "Sand Hills" on December 30, 1930, McCreight expressed his kinship and esteem with a public announcement and exhibit in the Du Bois Public Library displaying chief Flying Hawk's beaded jacket, pouch and pipe. Chief Flying Hawk was well known to the people of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and McCreight remarked, "The schools are much interested in the exhibit as well as others of the town who had met him on other occasions."  In his later years, McCreight attempted to donate the collection to museums, but without any success. McCreight cared for these national heritage treasures in The Wigwam until his death at the age of 94 in 1958. After his death, McCreight's Native American Collection at The Wigwam was sold and is now with private collectors and museums around the world.

== Buffalo Bill at The Wigwam ==
 [[File:Cody-Buffalo-Bill-LOC.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Buffalo Bill]] was a frequent visitor to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania.]]

=== A welcome home ===
McCreight knew Col. Cody as a U.S. Army Cavalry Scout and Buffalo Bill visited Du Bois on many occasions.  Buffalo Bill presided over McCreight's adoption as ''"Cante Tanke"'', honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota, on June 22, 1908. Both had enduring lifetime friendships with Native Americans and special bonds to Chief Iron Tail and Chief Flying Hawk. The Wigwam in Du Bois was always a welcome rest stop from exhausting travels and a chance to relax, smoke and talk about the Old West times. The Wigwam was a Native American heritage center and once the Eastern home of Oglala Lakota traveling with [[Wild West Shows]].

=== McCanles incident ===
[[File:Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail in Du Bois, PA (cropped).jpg|400px|thumbnail|left|[[Buffalo Bill]] and Chief [[Iron Tail]], Du Bois, 1908]]
Buffalo Bill's visit to The Wigwam on June 22, 1908, was an event in Wild West history. On this occasion, Monroe McCanles was McCreight's houseguest and told Buffalo Bill about his father Dave McCanles having been shot by [[Wild Bill Hickok]].  The [[McCanles Gang|"McCanles Incident"]] was the subject of controversy and debate by Wild West historians.  Monroe McCanles disclosed that at the age of twelve he had stood beside his father Dave McCanles when Wild Bill Hickok shot him dead behind a curtain. For the first time, Buffalo Bill heard the facts of the historic event and remarked that he would include the story in his projected autobiography.  McCreight wrote articles about the McCanles Incident the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;"The driver in the front seat is Donald McCreight. The small boys are Don's twin younger brothers, Jack &amp; Jim. The man standing is Monroe McCanles, son of Dave, whom Wild Bill Hickok shot. Monroe was twelve years old at the time and saw the shooting. Dave stood in the doorway while Hickok hid behind a blanket hanging to divide the room into two sections. Bill took down Dave's rifle from the wall and shot through the blanket. Monroe saw his father fall. Then Hickok started after the boy and actually killed two other men. Monroe, in desperation, ran to his home several miles to tell his mother. Monroe is reciting to Cody the details which he had never heard before. The photo was taken in front of my home in DuBois. This rare scene was caught in the camera, and has become a noted picture, the Saturday Evening Post having paid $50 for a copy."
The Nebraska Historical Society later published a volume on the details.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Iron Tail ===
[[File:Chief Iron Tail, Informal, Profile.jpg|thumb|200px|right| Chief [[Iron Tail]] considered The Wigwam in Du Bois his home in the East. ]]
Chief [[Iron Tail]] was an international personality and appeared as the lead with Buffalo Bill at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, France and the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, Italy. In France, as in England, Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail were feted by the aristocracy.  Iron Tail was one of Buffalo Bill's best friends and they hunted elk and bighorn together on annual trips. On one of his visits to The Wigwam, Buffalo Bill asked Iron Tail to illustrate in pantomime how he played and won a game of poker with U.S. army officials during a Treaty Council in the old days. "Going through all the forms of the game from dealing to antes and betting and drawing a last card during which no word was uttered and his countenance like a statue, he suddenly swept the table clean into his blanket and rose from the table and strutted away. It was a piece of superb acting, and exceedingly funny." Buffalo Bill regarded Chief Iron Tail as one of the greatest men he ever knew. McCreight and Buffalo Bill grieved over the death of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, Buffalo Bill said he was going to put a granite stone on Chief Iron Tail's grave with a replica of the [[Buffalo nickel]] (for which Chief Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento.

However, Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on [[Lookout Mountain (Colorado)|Lookout Mountain]], west of [[Denver]], Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran [[Show Indians]] placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the Buffalo, and the Scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West.

=== Last meetings with the Colonel ===
McCreight next saw the Colonel in the main dining room of the [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was surprised at the Colonel's appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. "We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject." "He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about at the end of the long trail."  McCreight's last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. "He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep."  Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on [[Lookout Mountain (Colorado)|Lookout Mountain]], west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West.&lt;ref&gt;Pageant organizers took a contingent of Show Indian veterans to Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver. Denver's Chevrolet dealers provided the automobiles that carried the troupe to [[Buffalo Bill Historical Center|Buffalo Bill's Historical Museum]]. All the press-agentry in Denver, however, could not replicate the genuine outpouring of emotion. A number of veterans spoke in Lakota. Johnny Baker, the former "Cowboy Kid" and Cody's foster son, translated. Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Speaking slowly, Spotted Weasel recited at length the virtues of his deceased friend. He told how Buffalo Bill, once an enemy of the Lakota, became in time their best friend among the Wasichus. Pahaska ("Long Hair") had clothed, fed, and given money to many of them, in friendship and the generosity that obliges it. To many others, he provided good jobs. "With his voice shaking with emotion which he made no effort to conceal," a reporter for the ''[[Denver Post]]'' wrote, Spotted Weasel "ended his eulogy with an appeal to his benefactor's spirit to be with him and his tribe."

=== Eulogy to Buffalo Bill ===
McCreight grieved for Buffalo Bill and wrote two poems in his honor.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Dear Bill, I s'pose this roundup is the last for you; Guess th' band 's all in the corral for good. 'Hardly think a stray got past your lariat 'n steady gun and yell.
But if they did't won't do no harm at all for brand'n season aint worth now'days
Anyhow they ain't goin' to call on rustlers such as you, there's other ways.
'Reckon th' scout'n days 's over too, th' days when red and white men disagreed,
when red ones wondered what to do to live when the white men stole away their feed. Then pony ridin's past and gone and buffalo killin's gone the rounds,
Th' bones whereof some men got rich upon sending owners to th' happy hunting grounds. Looks as if your work was done Bill, since th' Overland is paved with steel 'stead of oxen painting over plain and hill all gone for good, there's a new deal. I hate to say good bye but guess it's true that you have quit us all f'r good, can't see how we're goin' t' see an' do th' things that seem's you only could.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Salute at last the Great Commander; thou; With flowing curls, sombrero low in hand. Steed firm and steady, trained to bow in time and grace to loving master's wand.  We hail thee!  Pioneer of all the West.  Man of the World who knew world-making. We honor thee, a leader 'mongst the best.  Mourn in thy sleep that knows no waking.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Felix Flying Hawk ==
[[File:Felix Flying Hawk Home, Manderson, South Dakota.jpg|thumbnail|Home of [[Felix Flying Hawk]], [[Manderson, South Dakota]], c.1908]]
Sometime in the early 1900s McCreight received a scrawled hand written letter in pencil reading: "Please send me three hundred dollars.  I am in jail.  I will send it back to you when I get out of jail."  The letter was signed [[Felix Flying Hawk]].&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flying Hawk (1881–1944) was an Oglala Lakota interpreter, photographer, rancher and only son of the Chief Flying Hawk and Goes Out Looking. Felix accompanied Chief Flying Hawk as an interpreter traveling throughout the United States with Buffalo Bill's Wild West.  He was a professional photographer and his most circulated image is of Chief Red Cloud taken in 1905.  Felix married Clara c.1899 and they had four children, David, Robert, Lucille and Eva.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no date, heading or return address.  However, the postmark showed [[Chadron, Nebraska]], a few miles south of the Dakota line just off the Indian reservation. McCreight knew Chief Flying Hawk, but did not know that he had any relatives, much less a son. McCreight tells the story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Memories of old Indian days came thick and fast.  First hand knowledge on how white neighbors regarded the Indian's property as legitimate prey for trickery or even theft.  Never having known an Indian to lie or steal or in anyone misrepresent a thing to him, the writer decided to investigate this strange case.  What to do to learn the facts!  A telegram was addressed to the sheriff of the county in which the town of Chadron was located: 'Please wire me the facts in the case of Felix Flying Hawk in jail.  I demand his immediate release and will honor your draft for actual costs. Two days passed and a letter from the sheriff explained that the Indian had been arrested for stealing horses and was held under three hundreds dollars in lack of bail.  But that on receipt of the telegram had released the prisoner and drew a draft for $50.00 to cover costs.  Next day a draft came in and was paid.  A month passed and the mail brought a letter postmarked Chadron.  On slitting it to find what?  No letter at all, but a U.S. Treasury warrant payable to and duly endorsed by the Indian Felix Flying Hawk, for the sum of fifty dollars.  That was all.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[File:Children of Felix Flying Hawk.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Children of [[Felix Flying Hawk]], Buffalo Bill's Wild West, DuBois, Pennsylvania, June 22, 1908. Left to right: David, Robert, Lucille and Eva.]]

{{quote|The Indian, as always, had kept his word.  It would have been the same had the sum advanced been the three hundred dollars he had asked for.  Another month passed and a full page of penciled scrawl came in to thank and to explain.  He told of the 640 acre ranch he owned bordering the state of Nebraska, that he had some fifty head of cattle and fifteen ponies.  One day his ponies could not be found.  They had mysteriously disappeared from their pasture.  He had tracked them to Chadron and found them installed in a livery and sales barn.  He identified his property, started back with them to his ranch, and was overtaken by the sheriff and arrested and jailed.

Held under three hundred dollars for stealing his own horses-twenty miles from home-in the white man's prison-without friends and means to reach them.  But he got out of the clutches of white thieves finally for fifty dollars instead of the three hundred which they had decided to mulct him of. He had sold a fat steer and had to wait the month to get his check and that delay he was 'sorry' for.  Had the Indian collected a drove of ponies from a white man's ranch and tied them in a livery 20 miles away, and tried the same kind of ruse on the owner, do we guess that he would escape with a chuckle, as these whites did?  No indeed, the law would make good the white man's claims against the Indian, sure and to the limit, but laws were made by the white man for the white man!

Years passed.  In the course of strenuously building a bank and buying up coal lands for incoming railroads, for the development of his home town in the east, the horse-stealing incident was allowed to rest, and in truth almost forgotten, when another letter came to the writer from this, still unknown, Indian.  This time, he desired a loan of thirty-five dollars.  Was going to [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] to work on the railroad.  No good ranching, white man steal all time.  A check went to him next mail.  No record, no questions, no note, rush of business, and the incident was soon forgotten.

Months went by, summer, fall, to midwinter with its deep snows and blizzards that constantly rage across the west [[Bad Lands|Dakota Bad Lands]].  Then Felix wrote to ask why he had not received a letter to tell him that the thirty-five dollars had been received.  No recollection of having received any refund, the files were examined, the record checked.  Nothing to indicate it and a letter went back to his home address to say so.  Within ten days, the money order, dated [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], three months old, dropped from an envelope and the loan was repaid.}}

[[File:Elbert Hubbard - Project Gutenberg eText 12933.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Elbert Green Hubbard]] (June 19, 1856 – May 7, 1915) was an American writer, publisher, artist and philosopher. The ''Story of Felix Flying Hawk'' was to be the new ''[[A Message to Garcia]]''.]]

{{quote|Days later another letter told of how he had bought the money order out of his first pay, mailed the letter, and returned to his home and family south again beyond the Bad Lands.  Not having received acknowledgement, he wrote to know why, and on receipt of notice to the contrary, he immediately left for the hundred mile trip through the wild wastes in Arctic weather to the post office at Rapid City to learn what had happened to his long-lost letter.  There, he found it still lying.  He failed to put on the name of the state to which it was to be forwarded.  'Pa.' soon was added to the registered envelope, and Felix turned away for his hundred miles of return trip through the deep snows and wicked winds of winter.  He had made good his word.

Sometime in 1915, McCreight told the story of Felix Flying Hawk to the famous American writer, publisher, artist and philosopher [[Elbert Hubbard]]. Hubbard, a frequent visitor to The Wigwam in Du Bois, was the author of the best-selling inspirational essay ''[[A Message to Garcia]]''.  It was widely popular, selling over 40 million copies and translated into 37 languages.  The book was about the Cuban insurrection against the Spanish and "to take a message to Garcia" was for years a popular American slang expression for taking initiative.&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent public television documentary on the life of Elbert Hubbard see https://www.pbs.org/wned/elbert-hubbard/&lt;/ref&gt;

Elbert Hubbard and the writer sat at the small table in [[The Pennsylvania Society]] rehashing mutual old time experiences in the west, particularly, relating tales. He had himself been adopted into the Sioux tribe, but recently. Memory may be slightly at fault, but as now recalled, there were a couple of champagne glasses, partly full, on the same table. The letter from Felix, apologizing for the delay (of repaying a $30 loan) and explaining how he had made a trip to Rapid City and found the letter which had lain in the post office for months, how he had corrected the address, got it on its way to discharge his obligation, this letter had just come in the afternoon mail. The writer drew it from his pocket and handed it to Hubbard to read. When he had completed the reading, and asked a few pertinent questions about the author, he folded it and deliberately placed it in his own pocket, saying it would be the subject of a new ''A Message to Garcia'' which he was going to write. Before he had accomplished this planned project for the thrill and edification of his world-wide fraternity of readers, the ''[[RMS Lusitania]]'' took America's greatest modern writer and philosopher to the bottom of the sea on May 17, 1915."&lt;ref&gt;Major Israel McCreight, "The Story of Felix Flying Hawk: Rustler Victim" in "The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe",  p.36–38, Nupp Printing Co, Sykesville, Pa (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Theodore Roosevelt's conservation policy on public education ==
[[File:Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt 1908.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gifford Pinchot]] and President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], 1908]]
McCreight is noted in American history for authoring President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s conservation policy on public education.&lt;ref&gt;See footnote 1, supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCreight brokered the purchase of land in north central Pennsylvania for coal and railroad interests, and saw millions of acres of forests reduced to a desolate waste of blackened stumps. He realized the great Eastern forests could have produced lumber for generations if care had been exercised and advocated a conservation policy based upon public education in the schools.

Beginning in 1906, McCreight argued that President Roosevelt's conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why: A Thirty-Four Year Moratorium on Unpublished Records (1940), Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, at p.12, Hereinafter cited "Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why".&lt;/ref&gt; McCreight urged President Theodore Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests.  Conservationist [[Gifford Pinchot]], Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], embraced McCreight's recommendations and asked the President speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation.  On April 15, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt issued an [https://books.google.com/books?id=oWgjAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=theodore%20roosevelt%20proclamation%20to%20school%20children%201906%201907&amp;pg=RA4-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States] about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in our schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, "we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion."&lt;ref&gt;"Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why".  In 1908, McCreight founded the first high school forestry club in Pennsylvania, the "Du Bois Forestry Club. "At the end of the term the grammar grades and the high school spent a day in recreation and nature study in the Luthersburg Grove, all at the expense of one of our interested and generous minded citizens. Mr. Frank Hahne chartered a special train and furnished refreshments and entertainment for about 350 pupils and citizens. In the judgment of the pupils it was the greatest school day in the year. The principal purpose in view was the study of Forestry.  [[S. B. Elliott State Park|Hon. S. B. Elliott]] of the Pennsylvania Forestry Department addressed the audience and awakened unbounded interest among pupils and citizens. During the day the Du Bois Forestry Club was organized, the first of its kind in connection with the Pennsylvania schools which has for its aim the study and preservation of our forests. Hon. M. I. McCreight, President of the Du Bois Board of Education, deserves the credit and honor for this special work in Forestry, and he proposes to continue such instruction from year to year."

== The Forest Cathedral ==
McCreight was creator and steward of [[Cook Forest State Park]], the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association.&lt;ref&gt;"The idea of making this timberland a public park originated with Major I. McCreight of DuBois, who gave liberally of his time and money to interest others, and presented the cause to the State Legislature in 1911."  See Forest County Genealogy, History of Cook Forest at http://www.pa-roots.com/forest/history/historyofcookforest.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies.  Once called the "Black Forest," the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks.

[[File:Height 'n' Width.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cook Forest State Park]], the Forest Cathedral, was authored and stewarded by Major Israel McCreight.]]

The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated with McCreight on his first visit to the "Forest Cathedral" near the [[Clarion River]] in northwest central Pennsylvania.  "It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinebiographies.info/pa/forest/cook-a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent 'temple of the gods', and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered.  Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment.  It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them. The writer said to him: 'Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity's sake."&lt;ref&gt;"Cook Forest Park Story" at p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCreight was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark. In 1910, McCreight and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association&lt;ref&gt;The Pennsylvania Conservation Association was headed by A.B. Farquhar, the great farm machinery manufacturer, philanthropist and writer of York, J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg, Bishop Darlington, the University of Pennsylvania's Dean and other prominent Philadelphians.  Farquhar was President and McCreight Secretary-Treasurer. Cook Forest Park Story p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the Cook Forest Association was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight, [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/digitalbks2/id/9473/rec/1 “Cook Forest Park: Story of the Sixteen Year Battle to Save the Last Stand of Historic Penn's Woods: The when, the why and how of it” (1936)](hereinafter "Cook Forest Park Story") at p.14.  McCreight's Cook Forest Park Story is "a brief history compiled from the records by one of the many thousands comprising the great army of patriotic citizens who fought to preserve the giant pines for future generations to enjoy."&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1927, a bill was signed by Governor [[John Stuchell Fisher]] appropriating $450,000 on condition that the Cook Forest Association raise the remaining $200,000 to purchase the 6,055 acres. On December 28, 1928, the funds having been raised, the [[Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|Secretary of the Department of Forests and Waters]] announced the formal purchase.

In January 1929, just a year after the purchase of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the Clarion River.  The Seneca people of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight envisioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also a wonderful opportunity for McCreight's Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam.  The project was supported by Pennsylvania Governor [[John S. Fisher]] and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Cook Forest State Park stands as a monument to the memory and vision of Major Israel McCreight.&lt;ref&gt;"Major I. McCreight, 94, Local Pioneer Dies", Du Bois Courier-Express, October 13, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cante Tanke "Great Heart" (Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka) ==
[[File:Five Chiefs Du Bois, PA, 1908.jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|From left to right: Lone Bear, [[American Horse]], [[Iron Tail]], Iron Cloud, Whirlwind. All Sioux Chiefs, taken by M.I. McCreight in Du Bois, June 1908.]]
On June 22, 1908, "Buffalo Bill" Cody visited Du Bois with his Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. Twelve thousand people a day attended Cody's Wild West performances and 150 Oglalas were in town with 150 ponies. After knowing the Oglala Lakota for almost twenty years, McCreight was adopted as an honorary Chief and named "Cante Tanke" ("Great Heart")(Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka). The ceremony was performed by Chief Iron Tail assembled at Buffalo Bill's tent and attended by Chief American Horse, Chief Whirlwind Horse, Chief Lone Bear and 100 Oglala Lakota members of the Wild West Congress of Rough Riders. The Oglala Lakota chiefs formed a small circle around McCreight and Alice, and Chief Iron Tail began the ceremony with a speech in Oglala Lakota, a hearty handshake all around, and then placed a war bonnet McCreight's head and moccasins upon his feet. Chief Iron Tail presented McCreight with a tepee on which an owl had been traced with yellow chalk and told this was for him and Alice to live in.  Tom-tom drums were then beaten and tribal songs put up vigorously. Concluding remarks were made by Chief Iron Tail ending with hearty handshakes. Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail were loaded into a new 1908 Rambler touring car and driven to McCreight's town house for the banquet which followed.  There Chief Iron Tail was presented with a new Winchester rifle as a souvenir of the event. McCreight was forever moved by the solemnity of the occasion, and carried the honor proudly and with distinction the rest of his life. McCreight later remarked that the title, honorary Chief of the Oglala Lakota, was a far greater tribute than could have been conferred by any president or military organization. McCreight celebrated and honored Oglala Lakota culture, signing correspondence Tchanta Tanka or Tchanti Tanka, the phonetic equivalence of "Chann-Tey-Tonk-A", the Lakota pronouncement of his adopted name Cante Tanke.&lt;ref&gt;Chet Baranowski, Senior Advisor of Native American Studies at the Niagara Falls Museum, Niagara Falls, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCreight was impressed with the intelligence, honesty and generosity of Native Americans. He studied Native American culture and languages, recorded his life events, wrote books and articles and maintained lifelong personal relationships. Photographs of McCreight's wearing traditional dress portray his identification with the Oglala Lakota people. In 1929, McCreight's nomination for U.S. Indian Commissioner was supported by the Oglala Lakota people.&lt;ref&gt;Frank C. Goings, a Carlisle Wild Wester, was a performer, interpreter, chaperon and recruiting agent for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows. He held various leadership positions in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, including interpreter, chief of police, mayor and judge. Oskate Wicasa, p.101-103. Goings was a friend of "Čhaŋté Tȟáŋka" and led a petition representing 8,300 Oglala Lakota people in support of McCreight's nomination for U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Iron Tail ==

In May 1916, Iron Tail became ill with pneumonia while performing with the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West]] in Philadelphia and was placed in St. Luke's Hospital.  Buffalo Bill was obliged to go on to Baltimore with his show the next day and Iron Tail was left alone in a strange city with doctors and nurses who could not communicate with him.  McCreight learned about the Chief's admission to the hospital in the morning Philadelphia paper, and immediately sent a telegram to Buffalo Bill to send Iron Tail by next train to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, for care at The Wigwam. No reply was had and the wire was not delivered or forwarded to Baltimore. Instead the hospital authorities put Chief Iron Tail on a [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]], ticketed for home to the [[Black Hills]].  On May 28, 1916, when the porter of his car went to wake him at [[South Bend, Indiana]], Iron Tail was dead, his body continuing on to its destination. Buffalo Bill expressed regret that the Chief was sent to the hospital and that he had not received the telegram.&lt;ref&gt;Puffs From the Peace Pipe", p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Tail's body was transferred to a hospital in [[Rushville, Nebraska]], then to [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], where he was buried at [http://iggy.jesuit.org/node/589 Holy Rosary Mission Cemetery]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on June 3, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Green, "I dream of the elk:  Iron Tail's Muslin dance shield, Whispering Wind, March–April, 2009, at http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%22I+dreamed+of+the+elk%22%3A+Iron+Tail%27s+muslin+dance+shield.-a0203954925&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firewater and Forked Tongues.jpg|thumb|left]]

For nearly 30 years, Chief Flying Hawk made periodic visits to McCreight at The Wigwam.  McCreight collaborated with Flying Hawk, an Oglala Lakota Chief, to write a Native American's view of U.S. history and classic accounts of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, [[Crazy Horse]] and commentaries on Native American philosophy.  Flying Hawk was a profound historian and philosopher. After Chief Flying Hawk died in December 1931, McCreight dedicated his life to telling the Old Chief's story.
In 1936, at the age of 72, and after eight years of effort, McCreight published ''Chief Flying Hawk's Tales: The True Story of Custer's Last Fight''.  McCreight followed with '''The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe'' at http://manycoups.net/PUFFS%20FROM%20THE%20PEACE%20PIPE_page1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, at the age of 82, McCreight published ''Firewater and Forked Tongues: A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Chief Flying Hawk's Tales'' at http://manycoups.net/ChiefFlyingHawksTales_page1.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

== David Flying Hawk ==
David Flying Hawk was the eldest son of [[Felix Flying Hawk]]. David was a Wild Wester and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk.&lt;ref&gt;In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named "King Tut."  "King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas.  The real King Tut's tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying quite a bit of news about it, therefore the name King Tut.  The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse.  A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924.  This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders.  Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil.  The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in.  King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first.  There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume—fringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells—the whole works.  While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn't been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut's back.  When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk.  The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit.  It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey—the crowd went wild.  They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on.  That was the funniest thong I've ever seen happened at a rodeo.  We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year.  I heard a few years ago that they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I'm sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board." Bill King and Wanda Ellis, "Those Old King Bucking Horses", ''True West'', December 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 25, 1927, Chief Flying Hawk wrote McCreight for assistance, reporting that David had been arrested and jailed for horse stealing.
McCreight well recalled the story of David's father Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight's considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David's family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix's farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight.  "And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings." McCreight reported that, "My investigation shows that he was charged with stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands.  It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials.  There seems little or no legal remedy for it." David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;David Flying Hawk (June 5, 1903-April, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sun Dance at Rosebud ==

=== Summons to Rosebud ===
[[File:William Spotted Tail, 1928 .jpg|200px|thumb|right|Chief William Spotted Tail, 1928]]
In the Fall of 1928, McCreight ("''Cante Tanke''") was notified by Chief William Spotted Tail of the coming big gathering of western tribes for the last Sun Dance at [[Rosebud Agency|Rosebud Agency, South Dakota]]. "The notice was rather a command than an invitation."  &lt;ref&gt;Puffs, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; "There was to be a "fifty-years'" celebration at the old Rosebud Agency where the ceremony of the Sun Dance, stopped by the Government forty-five years ago, was to be performed. All the old-time Indians were to be there." &lt;ref&gt;Chief Flying Hawk's Tales: The True Story of Custer's Last Fight as Told by Chief Flying Hawk to M. I. McCreight (Tchanta Tanka): New York, Alliance Press, 1936.  This version of the Last Sun Dance has additional information than the later printing in ''Puffs from the Peace Pipe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chief Black Thunder ===
[[File:Chief Black Thunder, Du Bois, PA, 1908 .jpg|300px|thumb|left| Mrs. McDonald, Chief Black Thunder and Rembrandt "Rem" McCreight, Old Army Barracks, Rosebud Reservation, Sept. 18, 1928.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stepping out on the wobbly porch for a look around the old agency compound, a wrinkled old man in a slouch hat and white man's discarded coat stood leaning on a long staff. He had part of a loaf of stale bread enclosed in his left arm, held closely as if it was precious, and from it he tore off chunks with his right hand and stuffed them into his mouth and ravenously gulped them down. It was pathetic to see. Turning to the landlady for an explanation, she said the man was Chief Black Thunder, and she had given him the bread because she could not bear to see him suffering from hunger and cold. He was eighty-four and nearly blind from trachoma. In the brick building across the parade ground, a short distance from the eating place, stood the agency office, and nearby was the commissary and storehouses of the government, representing the nearly two billions of money and property belonging to the Indians, administered by the more than five thousand agents, employees, superintendents and welfare experts of the Indian Bureau, on salaries high and low, much of which was taken from the
Indians' funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Puffs from the Peace Pipe'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Sun Dance of 1928 ===
[[File:Sun Dance, Rosebud Agency, SD, 1928.jpg|300px|thumb|right| "The Sun Dance evolved into a War Dance to protest the white man invasion." Sun Dance, Rosebud Agency, South Dakota, 1928. M.I. McCreight, 1928.]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was an amazing sight.  Here encamped over a great saucer-like basin were twenty thousand Indians, with nearly as many more horses and dogs, covering an area of two to five miles.  The tepees scattered singly and in villages over a whole region." &lt;ref&gt;Puffs, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; "Like the Red Man's formula for religious guidance, there were four days of the Sun Dance, four musicians to sing and drum, the music-dancing in sets of four, eight or sixteen; four big speeches, four dips in the councils-east, west, north and south.&lt;ref&gt;''Puffs from the Peace Pipe'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Old friends ===
McCreight delighted in seeing his old friends. "In wandering about the wide spaces, several old time acquaintances were met, [[John Grass]], Lone Feather, White Rabbit, Kills-Close-to-Lodge, Bear Dog, Frank Goings, [[American Horse]], William Spotted Tail, president of the great meeting, Eta Waste, a Custer fight survivor who reminded us that he had once been at the writer's wigwam some thirty years ago." &lt;ref&gt;Puffs, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; "Here a short call on the agent and to inquire for Chief Flying Hawk who had failed to get to the Sun Dance.  But to learn he had just left for a visit to Sitting Bull's grave at the northern agency."
&lt;ref&gt;''Puffs from the Peace Pipe'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying Hawk explained, "I heard you was at Rosebud Fair.  But I wasn't there.  I had tried to be there but my son broke his car so we couldn't get there." &lt;ref&gt;Chief Flying Hawk, Letter of September 28, 1928, "Major Israel McCreight Archives", Du Bois Area Historical Society, Du Bois, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five warrior cousins===
[[File:Chief Flying Hawk, Gertrude Kasebier, 1898.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Chief Flying Hawk's glare is the most startling of Käsebier's portraits. Other Indians were able to relax, smile or do a "noble pose." [[Gertrude Käsebier]], 1898, [[U.S. Library of Congress]]]]
Chief Flying Hawk was one of the five warrior cousins who sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1877.
The Last Sun Dance of 1877 is significant in Lakota history as the Sun Dance held to honor Crazy Horse one year after the great victory at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and to offer prayers for him in the trying times ahead. Crazy Horse attended the Sun Dance as the honored guest but did not take part in the dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Kadlecek and Mabell Kadlecek, "To Kill An Eagle: Indian Views on the Last Days of Crazy Horse" (hereinafter "Kadlecek"), 1981, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Five warrior cousins sacrificed blood and flesh for Crazy Horse at the Last Sun Dance of 1887. The five warrior cousins were three brothers, Flying Hawk, [[Kicking Bear]] and Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox"), all sons of Chief Black Fox, also known as Great Kicking Bear, and two other cousins, Eagle Thunder and Walking Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;"Young Black Fox was the half brother of Kicking Bear and Flying Hawk.  On September 4, 1877, Young Black Fox commanded Crazy Horse's warriors in his absence.  The courage displayed on that occasion earned him the respect of both Indians and whites alike.  In the same year Young Black Fox sought sanctuary in Canada, but he was killed on his return to the United States in 1881 by Indians of an enemy tribe.  See McCreight, ''"Firewater and Forked Tongues: A Sioux Chief Interprets U.S. History"'', (1947), p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The five warrior cousins were braves and vigorous battle men of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Kadlecek, p.314.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Big hullabaloo ===
[[File:Charles Curtis-portrait.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Charles Curtis]], of [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Potawatomi]], [[French people|French]] and British ancestry, was 31st&amp;nbsp;Vice President of the United States, 1929-1933.]]
The Sun Dance evolved into a War Dance to protest the white man invasion. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A big hullabaloo came with the arrival of [[Vice President of the United States]] [[Charles Curtis]] and a long line of motor cars loaded with newspaper reporters, camera men and politicians.  They interrupted the ceremonies, offending the performers so that they refused to continue for the gratification of the movie-men. They were many Indian votes short in the following election.  This white man invasion disturbed things for the rest of the session, resulting in the [[Omahas]] and [[Potawatomi|Pottowattomies]] joining in an "exhibition" war dance.  Soon, the [[Ute people|Utes]], [[Cheyennes]], [[Arapahos]], [[Crow Nation|Crows]], [[Blackfeet]], [[Pawnees]] and the rest all collected for a grand intertribal dance on the vacant section behind the show grounds.  Qualified observers said there were ten thousand taking part in this mammoth demonstration.  It was kept up until darkness shut it from view.  It was a strange, an altogether unheard of thing to witness, thrilling to a degree to turn one's head and leave him atremble between joy and sorrow.  It was marvelous to behold!&lt;ref&gt;''Puffs from the Peace Pipe'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Wounded Knee ===
[[File:Woundedknee1891.jpg|300px|thumb|right| Wounded Knee, 1891]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rosebud is the district where bones turn to stone.  Even in recent years, as when the father of Crazy Horse went to examine his son's tomb, the custom of Indians in old times, he sound the skeleton had petrified.  He had placed the body in a secret cave so that white men could never know where his body was or contaminate it by so much a white man's touch.  Past He Dog's Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green.  Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set in a field of little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated "reservation" by a "charitable" government.  Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation.  But it was good enough for Indians by the white man's laws.  Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear was the little monument at the head of the trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls.  When tearing the heap of frozen dead apart to be loaded into army wagons for transport to the big ditch, the two babes were found to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;Puffs, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was the 'revenge' of the troops for the wiping out of Custer's army at the Little Big Horn fourteen years before, but it was a discreditable show for the great United States Army to thus turn Hotchkiss machine guns on a crowd of starving and helpless and wholly harmless women and children!  History has not, even to this late day, justified it.  Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Puffs, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, shivering in cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon. &lt;ref&gt;''Puffs from the Peace Pipe'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of all McCreight's colorful accounts, none show his essence more than the Sun Dance at Rosebud Agency.  He had been summoned to Rosebud by the great Chiefs. McCreight connected to the red man and disdained the white man's ignorance and utter destruction.  He too one day would go to the Sand Hills to join the Ancient Ones. But not before he fulfilled all of his responsibilities as ''Cante Tanke''. A few months later, McCreight was nominated for U.S. Indian Commissioner of the Department of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;"M.I. McCreight a leading banker of Du Bois, one of the state's better known business men and a national figure in Indian lore, is being prominently mentioned as the next Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, and is believed has excellent prospects of receiving the appointment from Secretary William Wilbur, of the Interior Department, to succeed Commissioner Burke, who retired with the Coolidge administration…. He is perhaps better known in the West, particularly in that state where there are large Indian reservations.  In fact, he is an adopted chieftain of the Sioux tribe, and has been known among the Indians for many years as the Chief Tchanta-tanka, the English for which is Chief Great Heart.  Mr. McCreight spent his youth in the Dakota Territory, where he became interested in Indians.  After leaving their proximity, he did not permit his zeal to wane, but rather increased his studies of their conditions and his efforts to improve their welfare, until he has become recognized as a leading authority upon Indians and their affairs.  He has maintained intimate contact, not only with the Sioux of the Dakotas, but also with the Indians of the Southwest and the Northwest, as well with those tribes in the Allegheny reserve to the North.  It was long after his departure from the Dakota Territory that the Indians adopted him as one of their own and crowned him with the feather insignia of chieftain in appreciation of his work in their behalf. McCreight, his friends say, is probably better known in the West than in Pennsylvania.  In his youth he went West and is credited with being the author of the Roosevelt conservation program.  The Sioux tribe has recommended he be appointed commissioner from their association with him." "Du Bois Man May be named Indian Commissioner: M.I. McCreight in Van of Hundred Seeking Important Place in Hoover Cabinet, Is Peculiarly Fitted to Look After Interests of America's Charges," ''Du Bois Courier'', April 2, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

See http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~paicgs/markers/fisher.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In April 1929, McCreight was nominated for U.S. Commissioner for Indian Affairs by [[Ray Lyman Wilbur]], [[United States Department of the Interior|Secretary of the Department of the Interior]].  McCreight was considered a national figure in Indian lore and among the two or three men in the United States having the best knowledge of the American Indian and their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. McCreight has made an intensive study of Indian affairs covering a long period of time and is considered by those who know as among the two or three men in the United States having the best knowledge of the American Indian.  He has written considerably about Indians.  McCreight is a banker or prominence and president of the Deposit National bank of Dubois." "Du Bois Banker May Get Federal Post, M.I. McCreight Being Considered by President for Appointment as Indian Commissioner: Has Made Intensive Study of Indian Affairs", ''Williamsport Sun'', April 2, 1929. "That the new commissioner of Indian Affairs may be a Pennsylvanian became more than a possibility today when it was revealed that Secretary of Interior Wilbur had a lengthy conference this morning with M.I. McCreight, president of the Deposit National Bank of Dubois.  McCreight's visit was at Wilbur's invitation. McCreight, his friends say, is probably better known in the West than in Pennsylvania.  In his youth he went West and is credited with being the author of the Roosevelt Conservation Program.  The Sioux Tribe has recommended he be appointed commissioner from their association with him." "McCreight May Get Indian Job: Du Bois Man Confers with Wilbur In Washington", ''Pittsburgh Post Gazette'', April 2, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;  McCreight received many endorsements including the [[Zitkala-Sa|National Council of American Indians]] of the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in South Dakota and the [[Oglala Sioux Tribe]] representing "eight thousand and 300 Indians." McCreight was not to receive the appointment and President [[Herbert Hoover]] chose Philadelphia financier Charles James Rhoads. McCreight noted: "My education being red school house and hard knocks, did not measure up to Hoover's class. Rhoads is a fine fellow, Quaker, College-bred and rich.  However, I value the endorsement of the Indians more than I would have the endorsement of Mr. Hoover, so there you have it."

== Lakota at Cook Forest ==
[[File:Clarion River from I-80.gk.jpg|300px|thumbnail|left|The [[Clarion River]] winds through [[Cook Forest]] in the wilds of northcentral Pennsylvania, once home of the [[Seneca people]]. McCreight proposed to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home.]]
In January 1929, just a year after the purchase of Cook Forest by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, McCreight proposed to the Bureau of Indian Affairs that Native Americans return to live in their historic natural home in Cook Forest along the [[Clarion River]]. The [[Seneca people]] of the Iroquois Confederacy once inhabited the great forest, and McCreight visioned man once again living in harmony with nature. It was also wonderful opportunity for McCreight's Lakota friends to regularly visit The Wigwam, and he proposed that Good Face, William Spotted Tail, John Sitting Bull and Flying Hawk, with their families, be invited to live in Cook Forest. McCreight explained his proposal to the U.S. Indian Field Service of the Department of the Interior in [[Wood, South Dakota]]:  

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wish you would see Good Face and talk with him about the Cook Forest Park.  It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am sure it would more than pay too.  The Clarion River runs through the property, and he could have his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists.  It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The project was supported by Pennsylvania Governor [[John S. Fisher]] and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [[File:Cook Forest Lakota.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|In 1929, McCreight invited his friends John Sitting Bull, Flying Hawk, William Spotted Tail, and their families, to live and work in Cook Forest near The Wigwam.]] Both were "farm-boy" bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;McCreight dedicated his account of the history of Cook Forest to Governor Fisher: "Without his constant cooperation and support through the trying years from 1910 to 1925; Without his vigorous strokes for justice and fair play; as Chief Executive of the Commonwealth in 1926, there would not now be the Cook Forest Park." McCreight, "Cook Forest Park:  Story of the Sixteen Year Battle to Save the Last Stand of Historic Penn's Woods.  The When, The Why and How of It.", p.101-102 (1936).&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Fisher supported McCreight's proposal. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested in the use of the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out.  My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford." McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for "Young America". "The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them.  Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there.  Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them.  Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means.  I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs [[Charles H. Burke]] and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways.  I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it.  Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too.  Good Face has been here before.  He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago.  Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan." In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that "two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

McCreight's vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.

== The Great Depression and final days ==
[[File:Major Israel McCreight at Age 90.jpg|thumb|right|Major Israel McCreight, ''Cante Tanke'', "Great Heart", Age 90,  The Wigwam, Du Bois, 1955]]
McCreight was hit hard by the market crash of October 29, 1929, on the onset of the Great Depression and sold timber and land surrounding The Wigwam for income.  He dedicated the rest of his life to public education about Native American culture.
In 1957 McCreight wrote, I "have been getting old for several years, a day at a time." At the time he was 92 years old and would soon become ill. Ray Fadden, known as [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leader Chief Aren Akweks, a frequent Wigwam visitor, wrote McCreight in 1958:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Brother your message tells us that soon you will take the Sunset Trail where our ancient Fathers will welcome and greet you as one of themselves. It will make our hearts unhappy when you leave us.  You will be remembered by the truths you have written in your many books and articles about the Indians and though your body may pass on your thoughts will continue to live, will speak for us. During your life on this Earth, you have done many good things and our hearts are with you. You are an Indian born again in a white body, sent here by our creator to tell the world today the true story of our people. When you leave Mother Mother Earth and the Ancient Ones will welcome you with outstretched arms. The prairies and forests will look golden and green to you and your moccasins will walk on smooth grasses. The sky will be blue and from the bark lodges you will see smoke rising into the sky. Your ears will hear the good music of singing and the tom toms and those you see will be smiling at you as you walk to greet them. Remember this, Brother, this is how it will be for you. Your brother, [http://www.sixnationsindianmuseum.com/features.html Aren Akweks].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Malik''', '''Melik''', '''Malka''', '''Malek''', '''Malick''', or '''Melekh''' ({{lang-phn|[[wikt:𐤌𐤋𐤊#Phoenician|𐤌𐤋𐤊]]}}; {{lang-ar|[[wikt:ملك#Arabic|ملك]]}}; {{lang-he-n|[[wikt:מלך#Hebrew|מֶלֶךְ]]}}) is 
the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] term translating to "[[king (title)|king]]", recorded in [[East Semitic]] and later [[Northwest Semitic]] (e.g. [[Aramaic]], [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

Although the early forms of the name were to be found among the Pre-Arab and Pre-Islamic [[Semitic people|Semites]] of [[The Levant]], [[Canaan]], and [[Mesopotamia]], it has since been adopted in various other, mainly but not exclusively [[Islamization|Islamized]] or [[Arabization|Arabized]] non-Semitic [[Languages of Asia|Asian languages]] for their ruling princes and to render kings elsewhere. It is also sometimes used in derived meanings.

The female version of Malik is '''Malikah''' ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:ملكة#Arabic|ملكة]]}}) (or its various spellings such as '''[[wikt:ملکه#Persian|Malekeh]]''' or '''Melike'''), meaning "queen".

The name Malik was originally found among various pre-Arab and non-Muslim Semitic peoples such as the indigenous ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of [[Iraq]], [[Amorites]], [[Jews]], [[Arameans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Assyrian people|Syriacs]], and pre-Islamic [[Arabs]]. It has since been spread among various predominantly Muslim and non-Semitic peoples in [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[South Asia]]. Malik is also an angel in the Quran that never smiled since the day the hellfire was created.

The last name "Malik" or "Malík" may also be of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] origin, most predominantly [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[Slovakian language|Slovakian]], as it comes from a Polish word "mały" meaning "small". It's comparable with surnames such as "Malicki", "Maliczek", or "Malikowski".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baby-names.familyeducation.com/name-meaning/malik|title=Meaning and Origin of Malik  - FamilyEducation|website=baby-names.familyeducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last name "Malik" also refers to [[jaat]] or people belonging to the [[Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] region in [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]

==Etymology==
{{further|Moloch}}
The earliest form of the name ''Maloka'' was used to denote a prince or chieftain in the [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] language of the [[Mesopotamian]] states of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Chaldea]].&lt;ref&gt;F.Leo Oppenheim - Ancient Mesopotamia&lt;/ref&gt; The Northwest Semitic ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic *malk-|mlk]]'' was the title of the rulers of the primarily [[Amorite]], [[Suteans|Sutean]], [[Canaan]]ite, [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Arameans|Aramean]] city-states of the [[Levant]] and [[Canaan]] from the [[Late Bronze Age]].
Eventual derivatives include the Aramaic, Neo-Assyrian, Mandic and Arabic forms: ''Malik'', ''Malek'', ''Mallick'', ''Malkh''a, ''Malka'', ''Malkai'' and the [[Hebrew]] form ''Melek''.

''[[Moloch]]'' has been traditionally interpreted the epithet of a god, known as "the king" like [[Baal]] was an epithet "the master" and [[Adon]] an epithet "the lord", but in the case of Moloch purposely mispronounced as ''Mole&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;'' instead of ''Mele&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;'' using the vowels of Hebrew ''bosheth'' "shame".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Molech | encyclopedia = Britannica Online Encyclopedia | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year = 2008 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053271/Moloch | accessdate = 2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malik''' is also an unrelated [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic Inuit]] name meaning "wave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Special:Search?search=Malik&amp;fulltext=Search|title=Search results for "Malik" - Nordic Names Wiki - Name Origin, Meaning and Statistics|website=www.nordicnames.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Primarily a ''malik'' is the ruling monarch of a [[Monarchy|kingdom]], called ''mamlaka'', title used by the former slaves aka [[Mamluk]]s (مملوك) royal [[dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}; that term is however also used in a broader sense, like realm, for rulers with another, generally lower titles, as in [[Sahib|Sahib al-Mamlaka]]. Malik is also used for tribal leaders, e.g. among the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]].

Some [[Arab]] kingdoms are presently ruled by a Malik:
* [[Bahrain]], formerly under a ''[[Hakim (title)|hakim]]'', or "ruler", until 16 August 1971, then under an ''[[emir]]'', or "prince", and since 14 February 2002 under a ''malik''.
* [[Jordan]], formerly the [[Emirate]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]];
* [[Morocco]], formerly a [[Sultanate]];
* [[Tunisia]], formerly ruled by maliks, title still worn by descendants of the [[royal family]];
* [[Saudi Arabia]]. On 10 June 1916 the [[Grand Sharif]] of [[Mecca]] assumed the title of King of the [[Hejaz]]; from 29 October 1916 "King of the Arabs and [[Commander of the Faithful]]"; from 6 November 1916 recognized by the allied powers only as King of the [[Hejaz]], [[Commander of the Faithful]], [[Grand Sharif]] and [[emir]] of Mecca; also assumed the title of [[Caliph]] on 11 March 1924; from 3 October 1924: King of the Hejaz and Grand Sharif of Mecca. In 1925 [[Nejd]] conquered Hijaz, so the Sultan of Nejd added the title "King of Hijaz". On 22 September 1932 Nejd and Hejaz were renamed as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, full style: ''Malik al-Mamlaka al-'Arabiyya as-Sa'udiyya'' ("King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"); from 1986 prefixed to the name: ''[[Khadim al-Haramayn ash-Sharifayn]]'' ("Servant (i.e. [[Protector (title)|Protector]]) of the Two Exalted Holy Places [Mecca and Medina]").

Other historic realms under a Malik include:
* [[Egypt]] — the former [[Khedivate of Egypt|khedivate]] and subsequently [[Sultanate of Egypt|independent sultanate]] was ruled by ''Malik Misr'' ("[[King of Egypt]]") from 1922 to 1951; and ''Malik Misr wa's Sudan'' ("[[King of Egypt and the Sudan]]") from 16 October 1951 until the proclamation of the republic on 18 June 1953
* [[Iraq]] — between 23 August 1921 and 2 May 1958, Iraq was ruled by a Hashemite ''[[List of Kings of Iraq|Malik al-'Iraq]]'' ("King of Iraq"). Among the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and  [[Kurdish Jews]], the term has been (and still is) used since pre Arab and pre Islamic for the title of tribal chief, for example [[Malik Khoshaba]] of the Bit-[[Tyareh]] tribe.
* [[Libya]] — [[Idris I of Libya|Idris I]] (1890–1983) (Sayyid Muhammad Idris [[as-Sanusi]], heir of a Muslim sect's dynasty) reigned as ''Malik al-Mamlaka al-Libiyya al-Muttahida'' ("King of the United Libyan Kingdom") from 24 December 1951 through 25 April 1963 and ''Malik al-Mamlaka al-Libiyya'' ("King of the Libyan Kingdom") until 1 September 1969
* [[Maldives]] — between 1965 and 1968, [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]] ruled Maldives as ''Jala'ala ul-Malik'' ("King" and the style of "His Majesty"); previous rulers were styled: Sultan of Land and Sea and Lord of the twelve-thousand islands, holding both the Arabic title of Sultan and the more ancient [[Dhivehi language|Divehi]] title of [[Maha Radun]] or [[Ras Kilege]]
* [[Oman]] — the [[Nabhani dynasty]] ruled Oman between 1154 and 1470, later it was an [[imamate]]/ Sultanate
* [[Yemen]] — between *1918 and 27 September 1962, and in dissidence to March 1970, the imamate of Yemen was ruled by ''[[List of Kings of Yemen|Imam al-Muslimin, Amir al-Mu'minin, Malik al-Mamlaka al-Mutawakkiliyya al-Yamaniyya]]'' ("Imam of the Muslims, [[Commander of the Faithful]], King of the Mutawakkilite Yemeni Kingdom")
* [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] - The [[Muslim]] rulers bestowed the title of ''Malik'' on loyal tribal leaders and chieftains in [[South Asia]]. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and colonial [[India]], the princely state of [[Zainabad, Vanod]] was ruled by a '''Malek Shri''' ([[Sri|Shri]] is an emphatical [[honorific]]).

The '''title Malik''' has also been used in languages which adopted Arabic [[loanword]]s (mainly, not exclusively, in Muslim cultures), for various [[prince]]ly or lower ranks and functions.
* In [[Armenia]], the title of Melik was bestowed upon princes who ruled various [[Principality|principalities]], often referred to as Melikdoms.
* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], among the numerous Grandees, often related to Armenia:
** In the fourth class, (''[[tavadi|Sul-didibuli-tavadi]]'') of the [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484–1762)|Kingdom of Kartli]], commanders of banners (''[[sadrosho]]''), sixth and last in that class, the Malik of [[Somkhiti]] (''Somkhiti is the name of Armenia in Georgian'').
** In the sixth class, Grandees of the second class (''[[mtavari]]'') of the Kingdom of Kartli, ranking first of the second subclass, Grandees under the Prince of [[Baratashvili|Sabaratiano]]: the [[Loris-Melikov|Malik of Lori]] ([[Lori Province|Lori]] - region in Armenia), head of the house of [[Melikishvili]].

The word Malik is sometimes used in Arabic to render roughly equivalent titles of foreign rulers, for instance the chronicler [[Baha al-Din Ibn Shaddad]] refers to King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] as ''Malik al-Inkitar''.
* In Pakistan Tanoli head of Village are called Malik in Villages

==Compound and derived titles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
*''Malika'' is the female derivation, a term of Arabic origin used in Persia as the title for a [[Queen consort]]. Frequently also used as part of a lady's name, e.g. ''Malika-i-Jahan'' 'Queen of the World'.
*''[[Sahib]] us-Sumuw al-Malik'' (female Sahibat us-Sumuw al-Malik) is an Arabic title for His/Her [[Royal Highness]], notably for Princes in the dynasty of the Malik of Egypt.

The following components are frequently part of titles, notably in Persian (also used elsewhere, e.g. in India's Moghol tradition):
*'''- ul-Mulk''' (or '''ul-Molk'''): - of the kingdom; e.g. Malik Usman Khan, who served the [[Sultan]] of [[Gujarat]] as Governor of [[Lahore]], received the title of ''Zubdat ul-Mulk'' 'best of the kingdom' as a hereditary distinction, which was retained as part of the style of his heirs, the ruling [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]]s (only since 1910 promoted to [[Nawab]]) of [[Palanpur]].
*'''- ul-Mamaluk''' (plural of ''ul-mulk''): - of the kingdoms.

In the great Indian Muslim [[salute state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], a first rank- vassal of the Mughal [[padshah]] (emperor) imitating his lofty Persian court protocol, the word '''Molk''' became on itself one of the titles used for ennobled Muslim retainers of the ruling [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]]'s court, in fact the third in rank, only below [[Jah]] (the highest) and [[Umara]], but above [[Al-Dawla|Daula]], [[Khan (title)|Jang]], [[Nawab]], [[Khan (title)|Khan Bahadur]] and [[Khan (title)|Khan]]; for the Nizam's Hindu retainers different titles were used, the equivalent of Molk being Vant.

==Usage in South Asia==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
{{further|Kakazai|Malik (Punjab)|Malik (Bihar)|Malik (Jat)|Malik  (Gujarat)}}

=== Pashtun usage===
The Arabic term came to be adopted as a  term for "[[tribal chieftain]]" in [[Afghanistan]] and the [[tribe|tribal]] areas of [[Pakistan]], especially among [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], for a [[Tribal chief|tribal leader]] or a chieftain. In tribal Pashtun society the Maliks serve as ''de facto'' arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national ''jirgas'' as well as to Parliament.
Malik is a common surname among  every Pashtun family leader to solve the problem at the time of conflict with another family.

===Punjabi usage===
In the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], "Malik", literally meaning "King" is a title used by some well-reputed specific Punjabi aristocrat families with special lineage, more formally known as [[Zamindar]]s. The Malik clan is also associated with different aspects throughout different generations and periods of history, It is believed that they originated as a clan of warriors who later on settled as wealthy landlords. The Malik clan holds significant historical importance &amp; are considered as royalty among the Punjabi caste system. They are well known for their way of life as well as their martial traditions and customs. In the Hierarchy of Malik Clan the Malik-Awan or [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]] tribe ranks supreme due to their tribal status.The [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]]-Malik tribe resides predominantly in northern, central, and western parts of Pakistani Punjab. As per historical interpretations the [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]] tribe traces its bloodline to a well known Arab Conqueror [[Sayyed]] [[Qutb Shah]]  ibn Ya‘lā, al-Gilani, Who is also a recognised descendant of the [[fourth caliph]] [[Ali]] ibn Abi Talib.

===General Usage===
Malik or Malek is a common element in first and family names, usually without any aristocratic meaning, However Malik is a large community and a well known clan of the [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]] tribe in [[Pakistan]] with [[Arab]] heritage.

Some Maliks (Urdu: ملک) are also a clan of Hindu [[Rajput]] Sikh [[Rajput]] and Muslim [[Rajput]], [[Hindu]] [[Jaat]], [[Muslim Jatt]] and a few [[Sikh Jatt]], found primarily in Haryana and Pakistan and parts of Punjab (There also exist Hindu [[Punjabi Maliks]] that are part of the [[Khukhrain]] or [[Arora]] communities but they are entirely different from Jats). The Muslim Malik Jat community is settled all over Pakistan and the Sikh, mainly in the [[Punjab, India|Punjab province]]. The Malik are also known as the Ghatwala. They are descended from [[Mann Jats]]. The Gathwala are now designating themselves as Maliks. Due to popularity of the Malik title many low-tier Punjabi sub-casts such as [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Teli]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and many others have adapted the title to gain acceptance in the [[Punjab]]i caste system.

'''Maras Taun''' is a [[thanksgiving]] [[festival]] and [[harvest festival]] celebrated by [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]s in [[Belitung|Belitung Island]] and its surrounding smaller islands.

''Maras'' in Malay Belitung dialect means "cutting" and ''taun'' means "year." Maras Taun occurs once a year after the harvest of rice from dry-field [[paddy field]]s ('''padi ladang''' or [[Oryza montana]]).

== Maras Taun in Mendanau ==

For the [[Mendanau]] islanders, [[rice]] is the main foodstuff. Rice trading connects people from island to island. The festival is celebrated by [[fishermen]] in addition to [[farmers]]. The farmers celebrate their harvest; the fishermen celebrate their successful [[fish]] [[hauling]].

== Rites ==

The festival is opened with a farmer dance. They sing a Maras Taun song together to accompany the dance. After the dance ends, a village chief (a [[Muslim leader]]) appears and leads the people in prayer. The chief burns a piece of [[agarwood]] which causes a fragrant smell; then, he says the prayers and blesses two pieces of sacred leaves called ''daun hati-hati'' or ''daun kesalan'', a variety of medicinal mint also known as [[Plectranthus amboinicus|Asian oregano]]. Afterward, the sacred leaves are given to the people. The islanders spread the leaves around their homes and boats because they believe that the sacred leaves bring luck.

== Lepat ==

Before the harvest festival, people gather pounded rice that will be cooked as lepat. Lepat is a variety of steamed [[cake]] made from [[red rice]], which is filled with a piece of fish or meat and wrapped with young coconut leaves. Hundreds of lepats will be distributed to the villagers at the end of the festival.

In 1989, Kleiman wrote ''Marijuana: Costs of Abuse, Costs of Control'', in which he attacked the conventional reasoning of national drug enforcement and the logic behind interpretations of the economics of drug markets. The book included a critique of the "Just Say No" rhetoric of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] administrations, and suggested an alternative policy of "grudging toleration" of drug use.

In 1993, Kleiman wrote ''Against Excess: Drug Policy for Results'', where, he argued that drug enforcement agencies should view arrest and incarceration of offenders as a loss not a win. He maintained that by concentrating resources on ensuring certain arrest for the worst offenders rather than a small risk of arrest for all, agencies could create environments with less drug abuse, less incarceration, and safer streets.

In 2010, Kleiman wrote ''When Brute Force Fails: How to Have Less Crime and Less Punishment''.

In 2011, Kleiman co-wrote ''Drugs and Drug Policy: What Everyone Needs to Know'' with [[Jonathan Caulkins]] and [[Angela Hawken]]. That year, Kleiman also co-edited ''Encyclopedia of Drug Policy'' with James Hawdon.

Kleiman's book ''Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know'' co-written with Jonathan Caulkins, Angela Hawken, and Beau Kilmer, was published in 2012. The book is written in question-and-answer format, covering over 100 questions relating to marijuana.

In a ''[[Huffington Post]]'' interview,  Kleiman, the "Pot Czar" of [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], said he was concerned that the [[National Cannabis Industry Association]] would favor profits over public health. He also said that it could become a predatory body like the lobbying arms of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Kleiman said: "The fact that the National Cannabis Industry Association has hired itself a [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]] [[Lobbying in the United States|suit [lobbyist]]] is not a good sign."&lt;ref name=huffpo2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/18/weed-legalization_n_5169750.html | work=Huffington Post | title=7 Things That Could Totally Kill Weed Legalization's Buzz | date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==

Kleiman is the organizer of a group blog, ''The Reality-Based Community''. His writing has also appeared on CNN, ''The American Prospect'', ''Foreign Affairs'', and ''Washington Monthly''.

Kleiman was a legislative aide to Congressman [[Les Aspin]] (1974-1975) and a special assistant to [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] CEO [[Edwin Land]] (1975-1976). From 1977 to 1979, he was deputy director for management and director of program analysis for the Office of Management and Budget of the city of [[Boston]]. From 1979 to 1983, Kleiman worked for the Office of Policy and Management Analysis in the Criminal Division of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], and in 1982-1983 he was its director and a member of the National Organized Crime Planning Council.

'''''Melong''''' is a Tibetan term that means "mirror", "looking glass". The melong is a [[wikt:polyvalent|polyvalent]] symbol, divine attribute, and quality of the enlightened [[mindstream]] or [[bodhicitta]].

==Nomenclature, orthography, etymology==
Mirror (Sanskr. ādarśa, darpaṇa; Tib. me long)

==Discussion==
The mirror is an ancient symbol throughout [[Indian religions]]. In Indian iconography it may be understood as a symbol for clarity, wholesome or complete perception and 'primordial purity' (Tibetan: ''ka dag'') of the mindstream or consciousness.  The mirror is often depicted as an [[accoutrement]]&lt;ref&gt;Accoutrement is herein employed in the sense of its [[etymon]]:  refer, [[:wikt:accoutrement|accoutrement]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[hagiographical]] signification of fully realised [[Mahasiddha]], [[Dzogchenpa]] and [[Mahamudra]] [[sadhaka]]. The mirror may be understood as a quality of the mindstream that denotes perceiving experience as it is without obscuration formed by ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]'', etc.

The mirror may be engaged in the advanced Tantric [[sadhana]] of the ''[[Gyulu]]''. As the mirror, so the mind. The mirror ''as'' the mind, following [[Yogacara]], reflects quality and form, though is not directly altered and is 'beyond all attributes and form' (Sanskrit: [[nirguna]]).

The "banquet" being the [[ganacakra]].&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Dharmapala]] [[Mahakala]], conveys the importance of 'mirror' iconography to [[Dharmakaya]]:

==Akshobhya==
The [[Dhyani Buddha]], [[Akshobhya]], is the embodiment of '[[Five Wisdoms#Ādarśa-jñāna|mirror knowledge]]' (Sanskrit: Ādarśa-jñāna; refer Panchajnana).

==Literature==
The mirror motif is employed pervasively throughout Buddhist literature but it is very important to traditions of Dzoghcen. A number of texts use the mirror motif in their title:
*'[[The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva]]' ({{bo|t=རྡོ་རྗེ་སེམས་དཔའ་སྙིང་གི་མེ་ལོང|w=rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long}}) which is one of the [[Seventeen Tantras]] of the [[Upadesha]].

{{Population transfer}}

The '''Polish population transfers in 1944–46''' from the eastern half of prewar [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (also known as the expulsions of Poles from the [[Kresy]] [[macroregion]]),&lt;ref name="Ther" /&gt; refer to the [[forced migration]]s of [[Poles]] toward the end – and in the aftermath – of [[World War II]]. These were the result of [[Soviet Union]] policy that was ratified by its Allies. Similarly the Soviet Union had enforced policy between 1939 and 1941, that targeted and expelled ethnic Poles residing in the Soviet zone of occupation following the Nazi-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]]. The second wave of expulsions resulted from the retaking of Poland by the [[Red Army]] during the Soviet counter-offensive. It took over [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|territory for its republic of Ukraine]], a shift that was ratified at the end of World War II by the Soviet Union's then Allies of the West.

The postwar population transfers, targeting Polish nationals, were part of an official Soviet policy that affected more than one million Polish citizens, who were removed in stages from the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]. After the war, following Soviet demands laid out during the [[Tehran Conference]] of 1943, the [[Kresy]] macroregion was formally incorporated into the Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian [[Republics of the Soviet Union]]. This was agreed at the [[Potsdam Conference]] of Allies in 1945, to which the acting Government of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Republic of Poland in exile]] was not invited.&lt;ref name="Gren"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century |author=John A.S.

The ethnic [[displaced person|displacement]] of Poles (and also of [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|ethnic Germans]], covered in a separate article) was agreed to by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]]: [[Winston Churchill]] of the United Kingdom, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the U.S., and [[Joseph Stalin]] of the USSR, during the conferences at both [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]]. The Polish transfers were among the largest of several [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|post-war expulsions]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], which displaced a total of about twenty million people.

According to official data, during the state-controlled expulsion between 1945 and 1946, roughly 1,167,000 Poles left the westernmost republics of the Soviet Union, less than 50% of those who registered for population transfer. Another major [[Repatriation of Poles (1955–1959)|ethnic Polish transfer]] took place after Stalin's death, in 1955{{ndash}}1959.&lt;ref name="Ciesielski"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Włodzimierz Borodziej |author2=Ingo Eser |author3=Stanisław Jankowiak |author4=Jerzy Kochanowski |author5=Claudia Kraft |author6=Witold Stankowski |author7=Katrin Steffen |title=Przesiedlenie ludności polskiej z Kresów Wschodnich do Polski 1944–1947 |trans-title=Resettlement of Poles from Kresy 1944–1947 |year=1999 |editor=Stanisław Ciesielski |pages=29, 50, 468 |publisher=Neriton |location=[[Warsaw]] |isbn=83-86842-56-3 |language=pl |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qsUqAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Ukrainy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the repatriated Poles were settled in [[historical eastern Germany|formerly German eastern provinces]]; after 1945, these were referred to as the "[[Recovered Territories]]" of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].

== Background ==
The history of ethnic Polish settlement in what is now Ukraine and Belarus dates to 1030–31. More Poles migrated to this area after the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, when most of the territory became part of the newly established [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From 1657 to 1793, some 80 Roman Catholic churches and monasteries were built in [[Volhynia]] alone. The expansion of Catholicism in [[Lemkivshchyna]], [[Chełm Land]], [[Podlaskie]], [[Brześć Litewski|Brześć land]], [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], Volhynia and [[Right bank Ukraine]] was accompanied by the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of the eastern lands. Social and ethnic conflicts arose regarding the differences in religious practices between the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox]] adherents during the [[Union of Brest]] in 1595-96, when the Metropolitan of Kiev-Halych broke relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church and accepted the authority of the Roman Catholic Pope and Vatican.&lt;ref name="Dvornik1962"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dvornik |first=Francis |year=1962 |title=The Slavs in European history and civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LACpYP-g1y8C&amp;pg=PA347 |edition=3 |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813507996 |page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[partitions of Poland]], toward the end of the 18th century, resulted in the expulsions of ethnic Poles from their homes in the east for the first time in the history of the nation. Some 80,000 Poles were escorted to [[Siberia]] by the Russian imperial army in 1864 in the single largest deportation action undertaken within the [[Russian Partition]].&lt;ref name="Davies1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Norman Davies]] |title=Europe: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA828 |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-820171-7 |pages=828–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Books were burned; churches destroyed; priests murdered;" wrote [[Norman Davies]].&lt;ref name="ND-64"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Rossiya |publisher=Oxford University Press |work=God's Playground/ A History of Poland: Volume II: 1795 to the Present |year=2005 |author=Norman Davies |page=64 |via=Google Books preview |ISBN=0199253404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ukrainians were officially considered "part of the [[Russian people]]".&lt;ref name=RPULRAM03&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YLJ_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=The Ukrainian Question: The Russian Empire and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century |author=Aleksei Miller |year=2003 |publisher=[[Central European University Press]] |page=26 |ISBN=9639241601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schools"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCZi--UtYdEC&amp;pg=PA216 |title=Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy |author=[[Jonathan Steele]] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1988 |ISBN=978-0-674-26837-1 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917-1922 brought an end to the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name="goldstein_1992-51"&gt;Goldstein, Erik (1992). ''Second World War 1939–1945''. Wars and Peace Treaties. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-07822-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ukrainian sources from the [[Cold War]] period, during the [[Bolshevik revolution]] of 1917 the Polish population of [[Kiev]] was 42,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} ''Entsyklopedia Ukrainoznavstva'' (Encyclopedia of Ukraine, 10 vols, 1955-84), Paris, New York: Shevchenko Society, 1970. Vol 6, p. 2224.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1917, when relations between the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) and [[Russia]] became strained, the Polish Democratic Council of Kiev supported the Ukrainian side in its conflict with [[St. Petersburg|Petrograd]]. Throughout the existence of UNR (1917–21), there was a separate ministry for Polish affairs, headed by [[M. Mickiewycz]]; it was set up by the Ukrainian side in November 1917. In that entire period, some 1,300 Polish-language schools were operating in Galicia, with 1,800 teachers and 84,000 students. In the region of [[Podolia]] in 1917, there were 290 Polish schools.

Beginning in 1920, the Bolshevik and nationalist terror campaigns of the new war triggered the flight of Poles and Jews from Soviet Russia to newly sovereign Poland. In 1922 Bolshevik Russian [[Red Army]], with their Bolshevik allies in Ukraine overwhelmed the government of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], including the annexed Ukrainian territories into the [[Soviet Union]]. In that year, 120,000 Poles stranded in the east were expelled to the west and the [[Second Polish Republic]].&lt;ref name="Karpus_zwyciezcy"&gt;{{cite book |authors=[[Zbigniew Karpus|Karpus, Zbigniew]], Alexandrowicz Stanisław, [[Waldemar Rezmer]] |title=Zwycięzcy za drutami.

In the autumn of 1935, Stalin ordered a new wave of mass deportations of Poles from the western republics of the Soviet Union. This was also the time of his purges of different classes of peoples, many of whom were killed. Poles were expelled from the border regions in order to resettle the area with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, but Stalin had them deported to the far reaches of Siberia and Central Asia. In 1935 alone 1,500 families were deported to Siberia from the Soviet Ukraine. In 1936, 5,000 Polish families were deported to [[Kazakhstan]]. The deportations were accompanied by the gradual elimination of Polish cultural institutions. Polish-language newspapers were closed, as were Polish-language classes throughout Ukraine.

Soon after the wave of deportations, the Soviet NKVD orchestrated the [[Genocide of Poles in the Soviet Union]]. The Polish population in the USSR had officially dropped by 165,000 in that period according to official Soviet census of 1937–38; Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30 percent.&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.balticnorthernminorities.org/pdf/project_abstracts.pdf | title=The 'Polish operation' of the NKVD | publisher=[[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw|University of Stefan Wyszyński]] in [[Warsaw]] | work=The Baltic and Arctic Areas under Stalin.

==Second Polish Republic==
Amidst several border conflicts, Poland re-emerged as a sovereign state following [[Partitions of Poland|a century of foreign partitions]]. The [[Polish-Ukrainian alliance]] was unsuccessful, and the [[Polish-Soviet war]] continued until the [[Treaty of Riga]] was signed in 1921. The Soviet Union did not officially exist before 31 December 1922.&lt;ref name="brit_ruspol"&gt;See for instance [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064493 Russo-Polish War] in [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;br /&gt;"The conflict began when the Polish head of state [[Józef Piłsudski]] formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader [[Symon Petlyura]] (21 April 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May."&lt;/ref&gt; The disputed territories were split in Riga between the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the Soviet Union representing [[Ukrainian SSR]] (part of the [[Soviet Union]] after 1923). In the following few years in [[Kresy]], the lands assigned to sovereign Poland, some 8,265 Polish farmers were resettled with help from the government.&lt;ref name="Gawryszewski"&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrzej Gawryszewski |title=Ludność Polski w XX wieku |year=2005 |pages=381–383 |chapter=XI: Przemieszczenia ludności |chapterurl=http://www.igipz.pan.pl/wydaw/Monografie_5/rozdz11_1.pdf |publisher=[[Polish Academy of Sciences]] |location=Warsaw |isbn=83-87954-66-7 |url=http://www.igipz.pan.pl/wydaw/Monografie_5/ |language=pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001031057/http://www.igipz.pan.pl/wydaw/Monografie_5/ |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall number of settlers in the east was negligible as compared to the region's long-term residents. For instance in the [[Wołyń Voivodeship (1921–1939)|Volhynian Voivodeship]] (1,437,569 inhabitants in 1921), the number of settlers did not exceed 15,000 people (3,128 refugees from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]], roughly 7,000 members of local administration, and 2,600 [[osadnik|military settlers]]).&lt;ref name="Gawryszewski"/&gt; Approximately 4 percent of the newly arrived settlers lived on land granted to them.

Tensions between the [[Ukrainian minority in Poland]] and the Polish government escalated. On 12 July 1930, activists of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN), helped by the [[Ukrainian Military Organization|UVO]], began the so-called ''sabotage action'', during which Polish estates were burned, and roads, rail lines and telephone connections were destroyed. The OUN used terrorism and sabotage in order to force the Polish government into actions that would cause a loss of support for the more moderate Ukrainian politicians ready to negotiate with the Polish state.&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ro-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Organization+Ukrainian+Nationalists+sabotage+action+1930&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U0KohAOYMH&amp;sig=5nkSGDBRtAgpQrFjTz45T7WXgEU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LFN4SuevK4HosQP6kY3lBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century''], By R.

==Invasion of Poland==
The 1939 [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] during World War II was subsequently accompanied by the Soviets forcibly deporting hundreds of thousands of Polish citizens to distant parts of the Soviet Union: Siberia and Central Asia. Five years later, for the first time, the Supreme Soviet formally acknowledged that the Polish nationals expelled after the Soviet invasion were not Soviet citizens, but foreign subjects. Two decrees were signed on 22 June and 16 August 1944 to facilitate the release of Polish nationals from captivity.&lt;ref name="YL227"&gt;{{cite book |author=Yosef Litvak |title=Polish-Jewish Refugees Repatriated from the Soviet Union at the End of the Second World War and Afterwards |work=Jews in Eastern Poland and the USSR, 1939-46 |editors=Norman Davies, Antony Polonsky |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |ISBN=1349217891 |pages=9, 227 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MUivCwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22Polish+prisoners%22 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportations===
After the signing of the secret [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] in 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Germany [[German invasion of Poland|invaded]] Western Poland. Two weeks later, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland]]. As a result, Poland was divided between the Germans and the Soviets (see [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]]). With the annexation of the [[Kresy]] in 1939, modern-day Western Ukraine was annexed to [[Soviet Ukraine]], and Western Belarus to [[Soviet Belorussia]], respectively.

By 1944, the population of ethnic Poles in Western Ukraine was 1,182,100. The [[Polish government in exile]] in London affirmed its position of retaining the 1939 borders. [[Nikita Khrushchev]], however, approached Stalin personally to keep the territories gained through the illegal and secret Molotov-Ribbentrop pact under continued Soviet occupation.

{{quote|The residents of the Western Ukraine and Byelorussia, as well as those of the Wilno district, which had been annexed to the Soviet Union under the Ribentrop-Molotov pact of 23 August and 28 September 1939, had all been under German occupation for between two and half to three years, and were finally annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944. The speedy exodus of Poles from these regions was meant to erase their Polish past and to confirm the fact that the regions were indeed part of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="YL227"/&gt;}}

The document regarding the resettlement of Poles from the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs to Poland was signed 9 September 1944 in [[Lublin]] by Khrushchev and the head of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] [[Edward Osóbka-Morawski]] (the corresponding document with the Lithuanian SSR was signed on 22 September). The document specified who was eligible for the resettlement (it primarily applied to all Poles and Jews who were citizens of the [[Second Polish Republic]] before 17 September 1939, and their families), what property they could take with them, and what aid they would receive from the corresponding governments. The resettlement was divided into two phases: first, the eligible citizens were registered as wishing to be resettled; second, their request was to be reviewed and approved by the corresponding governments. About 750,000 Poles and Jews from the western regions of Ukraine were deported, as well as about 200,000 each from western Belarus and from Lithuanian SSR each. The deportations continued until August 1, 1946.

=== Postwar transfers from Ukraine ===
Toward the end of [[World War II]], tensions between the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish AK]] and Ukrainians escalated into the [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia]], led by the nationalist Ukrainian groups including the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]. Although the Soviet government was trying to eradicate these organizations, it did little to support the Polish minority; and instead encouraged population transfer. The haste at which repatriation was done was such that the Polish leader [[Bolesław Bierut]] was forced to intercede and approach Stalin to slow down the deportation, as the post-war Polish government was overwhelmed by the sudden great number of refugees needing aid.

{{quote|The Soviet "population exchanges" of 1944-1946 ostensibly concerned [in the legal sense, nominal] citizens of prewar Poland, but in fact Poles and Jews were sent west, whereas Ukrainians had to stay in [[Soviet Ukraine]]. The real criterion was one of ethnicity, not citizenship. The [exclusively] ethnic criterion was applied to everyone in Volhynia, Ukrainians forced to stay despite their prewar Polish citizenship, Poles and Jews forced to leave despite their ancient traditions in the region. Jewish survivors of [[the Holocaust]] and Polish [[Massacres in Volhynia|survivors of the ethnic cleansing]] were generally willing to depart. The history of Volhynia, as an ancient multi-confessional society, had come to an end.|[[Timothy Snyder]] &lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shoah in Ukraine: History, Testimony, Memorialization |editors=Ray Brandon, [[Wendy Lower]]|author=[[Timothy D. Snyder]] |publisher=Indiana University Press |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hyYGOyX1IQUC&amp;q=multi-confessional+society |year=2008 |ISBN=0253001595 |page=102 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Poles in southern [[Kresy]] (now Western Ukraine) were given the option of resettlement in [[Siberia]] or Poland, and most chose Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Serhiychuk, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish government-in-exile in London directed their organizations (see [[Polish Secret State]]) in [[Lwów]] and other major centers in Eastern Poland to sit fast and not evacuate, promising that during peaceful discussions they would be able to keep Lwów within Poland. In response, Khrushchev introduced a different approach to dealing with this ''Polish problem''. Until this time, Polish children could be educated in Polish, according to the curriculum of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]]. Overnight this allowance was discontinued, and all Polish schools were required to teach the Soviet Ukrainian curriculum, with classes to be held only in Ukrainian and Russian. All males were told to prepare for mobilization into labor brigades within the [[Red Army]]. These actions were introduced specifically to encourage Polish emigration from Ukraine to Poland.

Stefania Kubrynowycz, director of the middle school in [[Rokotyniv]], stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Russians hate the Poles. [Soviet] Soldiers get changed in to the uniforms of bandits ([[Banderite]]s) and wander into Polish villages where they suggest that they move to Poland. Those that do not want to move are threatened with death. If it were not for England and America, the Soviets would eat the Poles".&lt;ref&gt;Serhiychuk, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1945, the [[NKVD]] arrested 772 Poles in Lviv (where, according to Soviet sources, on October 1, 1944, Poles represented 66.7% of population), among them 14 professors, 6 doctors, 2 engineers, 3 artists, and 5 Catholic priests. The Polish community was outraged about the arrests. The [[Polish underground press]] in Lviv characterized these acts as attempts to hasten the deportation of Poles from their city. Those arrested were released after they signed papers agreeing to emigrate to Poland. It is difficult to establish the exact number of Poles expelled from Lviv, but it was estimated as between 100,000 and 140,000.

=== Transfers from Belarus ===
In contrast to actions in the Ukrainian SSR, the communist officials in Belorussian SSR did not actively support deportation of Poles. Belorussian officials made it difficult for Polish activists to communicate with ''[[tutejszy|tuteishians]]'' – people who were undecided as to whether they considered themselves Polish or Belarusian.&lt;ref name=ptas141&gt;Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, ''Redrawing Nations: Ethnic Cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944–1948'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7425-1094-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oGmTs2SceAgC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=Lithuanization&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=wKzDSdSJNZTOkwTn5qWDDg Google Print, p.141]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rural population, who usually had no official documents of identity, were denied the "right" of repatriation on the basis that they did not have documents stating they were Polish citizens.&lt;ref name=ptas141/&gt; In what was described as the "fight for the people", Polish officials attempted to get as many people repatriated as possible, while the Belorussian officials tried to retain them, particularly the peasants, while deporting most of the Polish [[intelligentsia]]. It is estimated that about 150,000 to 250,000 people were deported from Belarus. Similar numbers were registered as Poles but forced by the Belorussian officials to remain in Belarus. A similar number were denied registration as Poles in the Belorussian SSR.

In response, Poland followed a similar process in regards to the Belarusian population of the territory of the [[Białystok Voivodeship (1919–39)|Białystok Voivodeship]], which was partially retained by Poland after World War II. It sought to retain some of the Belarusian people.&lt;ref name=ptas141/&gt;

Part of the difference in treatment between the two areas arose from religious identity. In Ukraine, most Ukrainian Catholics were members of the powerful Ukrainian Uniate church, which was often in conflict with the Polish Roman Catholics. But in Belarus, most Belarusian Catholics were members of the Latin rite and were not in religious conflict with Poles. Some educated Belarusian Catholics who could speak Polish identified as "Poles", and they were deported from Stalin's regime to Poland, where religious freedom was somewhat more open. But Belarusian authorities did not want a mass exodus of their population to Poland and tried to retain practicing Catholics. Latin Rite Catholicism has retained a significant presence in Belarus, where about 10% of the people identify as Catholic in the early 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== From Lithuania ===
The expulsion of ethnic Poles from Lithuania saw numerous delays. Local Polish clergy were active in agitating against leaving, and the underground press called those who had registered for repatriation ''traitors''. Many ethnic Poles hoped that postwar Peace Conference would assign [[Vilnius region]] to Poland. After these hopes vanished, the number of people wanting to leave gradually increased, and they signed papers for the [[People's Republic of Poland]] [[State Repatriation Office]] representatives.

Official attitudes in the Lithuanian SSR were similar to those of the Belarusian officials. The Lithuanian communist party was dominated by a nationalist faction {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which supported the removal of the Polish intelligentsia, particularly from the highly disputed [[Vilnius region]].&lt;ref name=snyder91-93&gt;[[Timothy Snyder]], ''The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999'', Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-300-10586-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;vq=Lithuanization&amp;dq=Lithuanization&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Google Print, p.91-93]&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Vilnius]] was considered a historical capital of Lithuania; however, in the early 20th century its population was around 60% Polish, and 30% Jewish, with only about 2–3% self-declared Lithuanians. The government considered the rural Polish population important to the agricultural economy, and believed those people would be relatively amenable to assimilation policies ([[Lithuanization]]).&lt;ref name=ptas141/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder91-93/&gt;

But the government encouraged expulsion of Poles from Vilnius, and facilitated it. The result was a rapid [[Polonization|depolonization]] and Lithuanization of the city&lt;ref name=snyder91-93/&gt; (80% of the Polish population was removed).&lt;ref&gt;Michael McQueen. "Collaboration as an Element in the Polish-Lithuanian struggle over Vilnius." Joachim Tauber. ''"Kollaboration" in Nordosteuropa''. [[Harrassowitz Verlag]]. 2006.  p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lithuanian ideology declared that many of the persons who identified as Polish were in fact "polonized Lithuanians". The rural population was denied the right to leave Lithuania, due to their lack of official pre-war documentation of Polish citizenship.&lt;ref name=ptas141/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder91-93/&gt; Contrary to the government's agreement with Poland, many individuals were threatened with having to settle outstanding debts or with arrest if they chose repatriation. Soviet authorities persecuted individuals connected to the Polish resistance ([[Armia Krajowa]] and [[Polish Underground State]]). In the end, about 50% of the 400,000 people registered for relocation were allowed to leave. Political scientist Dovilė Budrytė estimated that about 150,000 people left for Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Dovile Budryte, ''Taming Nationalism?: Political Community bBilding in the Post-Soviet Baltic States'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, {{ISBN|0-7546-4281-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJMzpeUHkQcC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=Lithuanization&amp;ei=QJzDSZmAGImGNL_g6OwN Google Print, p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the motto "From the people to the people," the [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] who created RNN have since added a [[Twitter]] feed and launched an independent website dedicated to short news stories favored by an [[Internet|online]] audience.&lt;ref name="Solayman_09-2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emajmagazine.com/2011/09/13/egypts-revolution-media-a-question-of-credibility/ |title=Egypt's Revolution Media: A Question of Credibility |last=Solayman |first=Hanan |date=13 September 2011 |publisher=EMAJ Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223211/http://emajmagazine.com/2011/09/13/egypts-revolution-media-a-question-of-credibility/ |archive-date=2013-12-02 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNN is an organized citizen news network with four working committees; one for editing the news, another to support the correspondents covering Egypt, a third for managing the multimedia feeds and a fourth for staff functions such as development, training and public relations. RNN's Arabic name, Rassd, is an acronym that stands for Rakeb (observe), Sawwer (record) and Dawwen (blog). RNN created a [[Ustream]] channel on January 27, 2011, and a YouTube account a month later.

The success of RNN and its new [[social media]] model is evidenced in its recent local network expansion into [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Syria]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Solayman_09-2011"/&gt; Even so, one media scholar in the US (commenting in 2011) called the accuracy of RNN's reporting "fairly mediocre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/09/online-journalism-booms-in-egypt-but-not-without-restriction262.html |title=Online Journalism Booms in Egypt, But Not Without Restriction |last=Sistek |first=Hanan |date=19 September 2011 |publisher=PBS |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210082742/https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/09/online-journalism-booms-in-egypt-but-not-without-restriction262.html |archive-date=2013-02-10 |access-date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNN has endured closures of their Facebook profile and YouTube account as part of the attacks from private media, attempting to thwart their work and influence their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dailynewsegypt.com/alternative-media-grows-restructures-industry.html |title=Alternative Media Grows, Restructures Industry |last=Solayman |first=Hanan |website=[[Daily News Egypt]] |accessdate=23 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of RNN's news by international media==
RNN has been a global source of Egyptian revolution-related news since its launch. During the early days of the citizen uprisings across the Middle East, major networks such as BBC, Reuters, Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya used some of Rassd's news and photos, and followed the network on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummin|first=H.J.|title=ICFJ Helps Citizen Journalist Create Top-Ranked News Network in ‘Arab Spring’|url=http://www.icfj.org/node/36586|publisher=International Center for Journalists|accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the [[web portal|online portal]] went live it was [[Streaming media|streaming video]] to [[MSNBC]] through its Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=Mary Kate|title=Egypt Cuts the Internet in the Face of Revolution|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/mary-kate-cary/2011/01/28/egypt-cuts-the-internet-in-the-face-of-revolution|publisher=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then on February 5, 2011, [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]'s [[NBC]]-affiliate cited RNN, [[Cairo]] when it reported that [[Hosni Mubarak|President Hosni Mubarak]] had stepped down as head of [[List of political parties in Egypt|Egypt's ruling party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Mubarak Resigns as Head of Egypt's Ruling Party|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/13975907/report-mubarak-reisgns-as-head-of-egypts-ruling-party|publisher=WAVE 3 News|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Español rioplatense.png|thumb|right|Approximate area of Rioplatense Spanish with Patagonian variants included.]]
'''Rioplatense Spanish''' &lt;!--see http://www.stanford.edu/~aananda/8HLSFinal.PDF--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|r|iː|oʊ|p|l|ə|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|s|eɪ}}; {{lang-es|español rioplatense}}, locally ''castellano rioplatense'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-es|kahteˈʃano rioplaˈtense|local}} or {{IPA-es|-ˈʒano -|}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a dialect&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Alba, ''Zonificación dialectal del español en América'' ("Classification of the Spanish Language within Dialectal Zones in America"), in: César Hernández Alonso (ed.), "''Historia presente del español de América''", Pabecal: Junta de Castilla y León, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.upol.cz/~obd/fulltext/Romanica-8/Romanica-8_05.pdf Jiří Černý, "''Algunas observaciones sobre el español hablado en América''" ("Some Observations about the Spanish Spoken in America").

The Hague 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as ''River Plate Spanish'' or ''Argentine Spanish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Political History of Spanish: The Making of a Language | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2013 | pages=212–228 | isbn=9781107005730 | editor-last=Del Valle | editor-first=José}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the most prominent dialect to employ ''[[voseo]]'' in both speech and writing, many features of Rioplatense are also shared with the varieties spoken in [[Media Luna|Eastern Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]. This dialect is often spoken with an intonation resembling that of the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] language of Southern Italy, but there are exceptions. The usual word employed to name the Spanish language in this region is ''castellano'' ({{lang-en|Castilian}}) and seldom ''español'' ({{lang-en|Spanish}}). See [[names given to the Spanish language]].

Due to the fact that Rioplatense is merely a peculiar dialect and not a language, there are no credible figures for a total number of speakers. Generally, native speakers of Spanish who were raised in Uruguay or the majority of Argentina are assumed to speak Rioplatense (at least informally) just as, for instance, Americans would be assumed to speak [[American English]], rather than any other variety of English. The total population of these areas would amount to some 25–30 million, depending on the definition and expanse.

==Location==
Rioplatense is mainly based in the cities of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[La Plata]], [[Mar del Plata]] and [[Bahía Blanca]] in Argentina, and [[Montevideo]] in Uruguay, the most populated cities in the dialectal area, along with their respective suburbs and the areas in between. This regional form of Spanish is also found in other areas, not geographically close but culturally influenced by those population centers (e.g., in parts of Paraguay and in all of Patagonia). Rioplatense is the standard in audiovisual media in Argentina and Uruguay. To the north, and northeast exists the hybrid [[Riverense Portuñol]].

==Influences on the language==
The Spaniards brought their language to the area during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] in the region. Originally part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], the Río de la Plata basin had its status lifted to [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] in 1776.

Until the massive [[immigration to Argentina|immigration to the region]] started in the 1870s, the language of the Río de la Plata had virtually no influence from other languages and varied mainly by localisms. Argentines and Uruguayans often state that their populations, like those of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], comprise people of relatively recent European descent, the largest immigrant groups coming from Spain and Italy.

===European immigration===
Several languages, and especially Italian, influenced the ''[[Criollo (people)|criollo]]'' Spanish of the time, because of the diversity of settlers and immigrants to Argentina and Uruguay:
* 1870–1890: mainly [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Gallo-Italic|Northern Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]  speakers and some from [[France]], [[Germany]], and other [[Europe]]an countries.
* 1910–1945: again from Spain, [[Southern Italy]], Portugal and in smaller numbers from across Europe; [[Jew]]ish immigration—mainly from [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] from the 1910s until after [[World War II]]—was also significant.
* [[English speakers]]—from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]—were not as numerous as the Italians (40% of Argentines have Italian ancestry), but were influential in industry, business, education and agriculture. English immigrants were influential within the upper middle class.

===Influence of indigenous populations in Argentina===
European settlement decimated Native American populations before 1810, and also during the expansion into Patagonia (after 1870). However, the interaction between Spanish and several of the native languages has left visible traces. Words from [[Guarani language|Guarani]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and others were incorporated into the local form of Spanish.

Some words of Amerindian origin commonly used in Rioplatense Spanish are:
&lt;!-- words not so used elsewhere, or used in relation with this area, such as ''Guacho'' --&gt;
* From [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]: ''guacho'' or ''guacha'' (orig. ''wakcha'' "poor person, vagabond, orphan"); the term for the native cowboys of the Pampas, ''gaucho'', may be related. 
''pochoclo'' (pop + choclo, from choqllo, corn) --  popcorn in Argentina 
* From [[Guarani language|Guaraní]]: ''pororó''—popcorn in Uruguay (but is also more commonly called pop or palomitas), Paraguay and some Argentine provinces.

==Linguistic features==

{{IPA notice}}

===Vocabulary===
Differences between dialects of Spanish are numerous; about 9,000 Rioplatense words {{Cortés, 2013}} are not used or, in many cases, even understood elsewhere. These include many terms from the basic vocabulary, such as words for fruits, garments, foodstuffs, car parts, etc., as well as local slang.

Rioplatense vocabularies continue to diverge from Peninsular Spanish: Rioplatense Spanish tends to borrow (or [[calque]]) technical words from American English, while Peninsular Spanish tends to borrow or calque them from British English or from French. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Phonology===
Rioplatense Spanish distinguishes itself from other dialects of Spanish by the pronunciation of certain consonants.

* Like many other dialects, Rioplatense features [[yeísmo]]: the sounds represented by ''ll'' (historically the palatal lateral {{IPA|/ʎ/}}) and ''y'' (historically the palatal approximant {{IPA|/ʝ/}}) have fused into one. Thus, in Rioplatense, ''se cayó'' "he fell down" is homophonous with ''se calló'' "he became silent". This merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either [[voiced postalveolar fricative|voiced]] {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as in English ''mea&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ure'' or the French ''j'') in the central and western parts of the dialect region (this phenomenon is called ''zheísmo'') or [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (as in English ''&lt;u&gt;sh&lt;/u&gt;ine'' or the French ''ch'') in and around Buenos Aires (called ''sheísmo'').&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Chang, [http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wss/4/paper1755.pdf "Variation in palatal production in Buenos Aires Spanish"]. Selected Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Spanish Sociolinguistics, ed. Maurice Westmoreland and Juan Antonio Thomas, 54-63. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition sheísmo is also present in areas such as the Río de Plata and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducción a la sociolinguistica hispana|last=Díaz-Campos|first=Manuel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As in most American dialects, also, Rioplatense Spanish has  [[seseo]] ({{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are not distinguished). That is, ''casa'' ("house") is homophonous with ''caza'' ("hunt"). ''Seseo'' is common to other dialects of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in Latin America]], [[Canarian Spanish]], [[Andalusian Spanish]].
* In popular speech, the fricative {{IPA|/s/}} has a tendency to become 'aspirated' before another consonant (the resulting sound depending on what the consonant is, although stating it is a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], {{IPA|[h]}}, would give a clear idea of the mechanism) or simply in all syllable-final positions in less educated speech {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This change may be realized only before consonants or also before vowels and, like lenition, is typically insensitive to word boundaries. That is, ''esto es lo mismo'' "this is the same" is pronounced something like {{IPA|[ˈehto ˈeɦ lo ˈmiɦmo]}}, but in ''las águilas azules'' "the blue eagles", {{IPA|/s/}} in ''las'' and ''águilas'' might remain {{IPA|[s]}} as no consonant follows: {{IPA|[las ˈaɣilas aˈsules]}}, or become {{IPA|[h]}}: {{IPA|[lah ˈaɣilah aˈsuleh]}}; the pronunciation is largely an individual choice.
*The phoneme {{IPA|/x/}} (written as {{angle bracket|g}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and as {{angle bracket|j}} elsewhere) is never glottalised to {{IPA|[h]}} in the Atlantic coast. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This phenomenon is common to other coastal dialects in Latin American Spanish, as well as Caribbean, Canarian, and Andalusian dialects, but not in Uruguayan dialect. Uruguayan speakers always realize it as {{IPA|[x]}}, like people in Northern and Central Spain. Uruguayans never realize it as {{IPA|[h]}} instead of {{IPA|[x]}}, but {{IPA|[h]}} is a possible phonetic realization of {{IPA|/s/}} when it is followed by two or more consonants or at the end of a phrase. Argentine speakers realize it both as {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[h]}}.
* In some areas, speakers tend to drop the final {{IPA|/r/}} sound in verb infinitives and the final {{IPA|/s/}} in most words. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This elision is considered a feature of uneducated speakers in some places, but it is widespread in others, at least in rapid speech.

Aspiration of {{IPA|/s/}}, together with loss of final {{IPA|/r/}} and some common instances of diphthong simplification,{{dubious|Diphthong simplification|date=December 2014}} tend to produce a noticeable simplification of the syllable structure, giving Rioplatense informal speech a distinct fluid consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel rhythm: {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

:''Si querés irte, andate. Yo no te voy a parar.''
:"If you want to go, then go. I'm not going to stop you."

===Intonation===
Preliminary research has shown that Rioplatense Spanish, and particularly the speech of the city of Buenos Aires, has [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns that resemble those of [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]]. This correlates well with immigration patterns. Argentina has received huge numbers of Italian settlers since the 19th century.

According to a study conducted by [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] of [[Argentina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish |author1=Colantoni, Laura |author2=Gurlekian, Jorge |journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition |issn=1366-7289 |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=August 2004 |pages=107–119 |publisher=Cambridge University press |doi=10.1017/S1366728904001488}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buenos Aires and Rosario residents speak with an intonation most closely resembling [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. The researchers note this as a relatively recent phenomenon, starting in the beginning of the 20th century with the main wave of Southern Italian immigration. Before that, the ''[[porteño]]'' accent was more similar to that of Spain, especially [[Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/762441 |title=Napolitanos y porteños, unidos por el acento - 06.12.2005 - lanacion.com |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns and verb conjugation===
[[File:Voseo-extension-real1.png|thumb|418x418px|In this map of ''[[voseo]] countries'', the spread of the [[dialect]] is clearly illustrated. '''[[Argentina]]''', '''[[Uruguay]]''' and '''[[Paraguay]]''' are represented by dark blue on the map, '''Rioplatense Spanish''' is spoken in these regions. [[Argentina]] is the [[largest country]] that uses the ''voseo'', and it is associated as exclusively belonging to that [[nation]].]]
One of the features of the Argentine and Uruguayan speaking style is the '''[[voseo]]''': the usage of the pronoun ''vos'' for the second person singular, instead of ''tú''. In other Spanish-speaking regions where ''voseo'' is used, such as in Chile and Colombia, the use of voseo has at times been considered a nonstandard lower speaking style; whereas in Argentina and Uruguay it is standard.

The second person plural pronoun, which is ''vosotros'' in Spain, is replaced with ''ustedes'' in Rioplatense, as in most other Latin American dialects. While ''usted'' is the formal second person singular pronoun, its plural ''ustedes'' has a neutral connotation and can be used to address friends and acquaintances as well as in more formal occasions (see [[T-V distinction]]). ''Ustedes'' takes a grammatically third- person plural verb.

As an example, see the conjugation table for the verb ''amar'' (to love) in the present tense, indicative mode:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Inflection of ''amar'''''
|-
! Person/Number || Peninsular || Rioplatense
|-
| 1st sing. || ''yo amo'' || ''yo amo''
|-
| 2nd sing. || ''tú amas'' || ''vos amás''
|-
| 3rd sing. || ''él ama'' || ''él ama''
|-
| 1st plural || ''nosotros amamos'' || ''nosotros amamos''
|-
| 2nd plural || ''vosotros amáis''|| ''ustedes aman¹'' 
|-
| 3rd plural || ''ellos aman'' || ''ellos aman''
|}

:(¹) ''Ustedes'' is used throughout most of Latin America for both the familiar and formal. In Spain, outside of Andalusia, it is used only in formal speech for the second person plural.

Although apparently there is just a stress shift (from '' '''a'''mas'' to '' am'''á'''s''), the origin of such a stress is the loss of the diphthong of the ancient ''vos'' inflection from ''vos amáis'' to ''vos amás''. This can be better seen with the verb "to be": from ''vos sois'' to ''vos sos''. In [[Spanish irregular verbs#Vowel-alternating verbs|vowel-alternating verbs]] like ''perder'' and ''morir'', the stress shift also triggers a change of the vowel in the [[root (linguistics)|root]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Inflection of ''perder'''''
|-
! Peninsular || Rioplatense
|-
| ''yo pierdo'' || ''yo pierdo''
|-
| ''tú pierdes'' || ''vos perdés''
|-
| ''él pierde'' || ''él pierde''
|-
| ''nosotros perdemos'' || ''nosotros perdemos''
|-
| ''vosotros perdéis'' || ''ustedes pierden''
|-
| ''ellos pierden'' || ''ellos pierden''
|}

For the ''-ir'' verbs, the Peninsular ''vosotros'' forms end in ''-ís'', so there is no diphthong to simplify, and Rioplatense ''vos'' employs the same form: instead of ''tú vives'', ''vos vivís''; instead of ''tú vienes'', ''vos venís'' (note the alternation).

{| class="wikitable"

|}

The imperative forms for ''vos'' are identical to the plural imperative forms in Peninsular minus the final ''-d'' (stress remains the same):

*''Hablá más fuerte, por favor.'' "Speak louder, please." (''hablad'' in Peninsular)
*''Comé un poco de torta.'' "Eat some cake." (''comed'' in Peninsular)
*''Vení para acá.'' "Come over here." (''venid'' in Peninsular)

The plural imperative uses the ''ustedes'' form (i. e. the third person plural subjunctive, as corresponding to ''ellos'').

As for the subjunctive forms of ''vos'' verbs, while they tend to take the ''tú'' conjugation, some speakers do use the classical ''vos'' conjugation, employing the ''vosotros'' form minus the ''i'' in the final diphthong. Many consider only the ''tú'' subjunctive forms to be correct.

*''Espero que veas'' or ''Espero que veás'' "I hope you can see" (Peninsular ''veáis'')
*''Lo que quieras'' or (less used) ''Lo que quierás/querás'' "Whatever you want" (Peninsular ''queráis'')

In the [[preterite]], an ''s'' is sometimes added, for instance ''(vos) perdistes''. This corresponds to the classical ''vos'' conjugation found in literature. Compare Iberian Spanish form ''vosotros perdisteis''. However, it is incorrect.

Other verb forms coincide with ''tú'' after the ''i'' is omitted (the ''vos'' forms are the same as ''tú'').

*''Si salieras'' "If you went out" (Peninsular ''salierais'')

====Usage====
In the old times, ''vos'' was used as a respectful term. In Rioplatense, as in most other dialects which employ ''voseo'', this pronoun has become informal, supplanting the use of ''tú'' (compare ''[[you]]'' in English, which used to be formal singular but has replaced and obliterated the former informal singular pronoun ''thou''). It is used especially for addressing friends and family members (regardless of age), but may also include most acquaintances, such as co-workers, friends of one's friends, etc.

===Usage of tenses===
Although literary works use the full spectrum of verb inflections, in Rioplatense (as well as many other Spanish dialects), the future tense tends to use a verbal phrase ([[periphrasis]]) in the spoken language.

This verb phrase is formed by the verb ''ir'' ("to go") followed by the preposition ''a'' ("to") and the main verb in the infinitive. This resembles the English phrase ''to be going to'' + infinitive verb. For example:

*''Creo que descansaré un poco'' → ''Creo que voy a descansar un poco'' (I think I will rest a little → I think I am going to rest a little)
*''Mañana me visitará mi madre'' → ''Mañana me va a visitar mi vieja'' (Tomorrow my mother will visit me → Tomorrow my mother is going to visit me)
*''La visitaré mañana'' → ''La voy a visitar mañana'' (I will visit her tomorrow → I am going to visit her tomorrow)

The [[present perfect]] (Spanish: Pretérito perfecto compuesto), just like ''pretérito anterior'', is rarely used: the simple past replaces it. However, the Present Perfect is still used in Northwestern Argentina, particularly in the province of [[Tucumán]].

*''Juan no ha llegado todavía'' → ''Juan no llegó todavía'' (Juan has not arrived yet → Juan did not arrive yet)
*''El torneo ha comenzado'' → ''El torneo empezó'' (The tournament has begun → The tournament began)
*''Ellas no han votado'' → ''Ellas no votaron'' (They have not voted → They did not vote)

But, in the subjunctive mood, the [[present perfect]] is still widely used:

*''No creo que lo hayan visto ya'' (I don't believe they have already seen him)
*''Espero que lo hayas hecho ayer'' (I hope you did it yesterday)

In [[Buenos Aires]] a reflexive form of verbs is often used - "''se viene''" instead of "''viene'''', etc.

==Influence on Chilean Spanish==
In [[Chilean Spanish]] there is plenty of lexical influence from the Argentine dialects suggesting a  "masked prestige" {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} otherwise not expressed, since the image of Argentine things is usually negative. Influences run across the different social strata of Chile. Argentine tourism in Chile during summer and Chilean tourism in Argentina would influence the speech of the upper class. The middle classes would have Argentine influences by watching football in [[cable television]] and by watching Argentine programs in the [[broadcast television]]. ''[[La Cuarta]]'', a "popular" [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], regularly employs [[lunfardo]] words and expressions. Usually Chileans do not recognize the Argentine borrowings as such, claiming they are Chilean terms and expressions{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. The relation between Argentine dialects and Chilean Spanish is one of "asymmetric permeability", with Chilean Spanish adopting sayings of the Argentine variants but usually not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salamanca |first=Gastón |last2=Ramírez |first2=Ariella |date=2014 |title=Argentinismos en el léxico del español de Chile: Nuevas evidencias  |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-04622014000100006 |journal=[[Atenea]] |publisher= |volume=509 |issue= |pages=97–121  |doi= |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America''''' is a 2009 non-fiction book by [[Rich Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113543979|date=6 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=A Black Author's Journey Into American 'Whitopia'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1929729,00.html|title=America's Booming White Enclaves|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=James, Randy|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Benjamin briefly summarized his experiences in a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

==Overview==
African American journalist [[Rich Benjamin]] documents his journeys to find out why more and more white Americans move to small towns and areas that are, for the most part, white, and to explain why Whitopias are growing and what it means for the United States.

Benjamin mounted a two-year tour of the United States, covering 26,907 miles (43,303 km), looking for "Whitopias", which he defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVSZAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Searching For Whitopia|website=[[Google Books]]|pages=2|author=Benjamin, Rich|publisher=[[Hachette Books]]|date=2009|authorlink=Rich Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*an area which has experienced at least 6% growth rate since 2000;
*the great majority of that growth consists of white persons;
*the area has a pleasant look, feel, ambiance, or charm.

He spent several months in three such areas: [[St. George, Utah]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], and [[Forsyth County, Georgia]]. In each case, he generated a master plan to thoroughly immerse himself in the community's core, with lists of the power brokers, the important groups, and the significant events. He tried to volunteer or involve himself with those people and groups.

==Author's experiences==
In St. George, Benjamin rented a house over the [[telephone]] in a gated community, La Entrada.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.tiny.ted.com/talks/rich_benjamin_my_road_trip_through_the_whitest_towns_in_america|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|title=Rich Benjamin: My road trip through the whitest towns in America|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up golfing, fishing, and [[Texas Hold 'Em]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was generally welcomed in every instance, and learned that the dominant topic in St. George was [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]; a local group had been organized to fight immigration, and they held regular rallies.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Idaho, Benjamin rented a resort cabin at [[Lake Coeur d'Alene]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He found a significant number of retired [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers living there,&lt;ref name=T/&gt; and also found a significant number of gun owners where he learned to shoot a pistol at the local gun range.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

He spent time at a retreat, the only non-white journalist in the group, at the Council of [[Aryan Nations]] compound.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was told that the group is not "white-supremacy"; they are "white-segregation" - they merely don't want to live in close proximity to non-white people.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He noted the preponderance of [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Georgia he found the predominant cultural activity revolved around a mega-church, so he involved himself in its activities.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He felt the most comfortable in this situation, since both blacks and whites in this area are used to seeing the other - as contrasted to the first two sites, where a black person is still a rarity.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15239">The '''socioeconomic impact of female education''' constitutes a significant area of research within [[international development]]. Increases in the amount of female education in regions tends to correlate with high levels of development. Some of the effects are related to [[economic development]]. Women's education increases the income of women and leads to growth in [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Other effects are related to [[social development]]. Educating girls leads to a number of social benefits, including many related to women's empowerment.

==Research==
Recent research in human development has established a strong link between women's education and international development. International development is an academic discipline concerned with the social and economic progress in impoverished regions. In particular, researchers seek to determine what factors explain differences in rates of development. Women's education is one of the major [[explanatory variable]]s behind the rates of social and economic development,&lt;ref name=Klasen2002&gt;Klasen, Stephan. "[http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/3/345.full.pdf+html Low Schooling for Girls, Slower Growth for All? Cross-Country Evidence on the Effect of Gender Inequality in Education on Economic Development]." The World Bank Economic Review 16, no. 3 (2002): 345-373.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown to have a positive correlation with both.&lt;ref name=HillKing1998&gt;King, Elizabeth M., and M. Anne Hill. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DL8uSGzj8YIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=King,+Elizabeth+M.,+and+M.+Anne+Hill.+Women%27s+education+in+developing+countries+barriers,+benefits,+and+policies&amp;ots=S24BzlCMM-&amp;sig=L7CSB9ykslgR69DbIMTIN6mKXq4 Women's education in developing countries barriers, benefits, and policies]. Baltimore: Published for the World Bank [by] the Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999&gt;Dollar, David, and Roberta Gatti. [http://darp.lse.ac.uk/frankweb/courses/EC501/DG.pdf Gender Inequality, Income, and Growth: Are Good Times Good for Women?]. Washington D.C.: The World Bank, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to notable economist [[Lawrence Summers]], “investment in the education of girls may well be the highest-return investment available in the developing world.”&lt;ref name="HillKing1998" /&gt; Closing gender disparity is also one of the [[UN Millennium Development Goals#Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women|U.N. Millennium Developmental Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;UN. "United Nations Millennium Development Goals." UN News Center. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/gender.shtml (accessed November 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
There are multiple ways researchers measure the effects of women's education on development. Typically, studies concern themselves with the gender gap between the education levels of boys and girls and not simply the level of women's education.&lt;ref name=HillKing1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PsacharopoulosPatrinos2004&gt;Psacharopoulos, George, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. "[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2002/09/27/000094946_02091705491654/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf Returns To Investment In Education: A Further Update]." Education Economics 12, no. 2 (2004): 111-134.&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to distinguish the specific effects of women's education from the benefits of education in general. Note that some studies, particularly older ones, do simply look at women's total education levels.&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999 /&gt; One way to measure education levels is to look at what percentage of each gender graduates from each stage of school. A similar, more exact way is to look at the average number of years of schooling a member of each gender receives. A third approach uses the [[Literacy|literacy rates]] for each gender, as literacy is one of the earliest and primary aims of education.&lt;ref name="HillKing1998" /&gt; This provides an idea of not just how much education was received but how effective it was.

The most common way to measure economic development is to look at changes in growth of [[GDP]]. In order to ensure that a connection holds, correlations are analyzed across different countries over different periods of time. Typically the result given is a relatively steady average effect, although variation over time can also be measured.&lt;ref name=Patrinos2008 /&gt; The benefits of education to an individual can also be analyzed. This is done by first finding the cost of education and the amount of income that would have been earned during years enrolled in school. The difference between the sum of these two quantities and the total increase in income due to education is the net return.&lt;ref name="Patrinos2008"&gt;Patrinos, Harry. "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EL2j2dW9lCgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA53 Returns to Education: The Gender Perspective]." In Girls' Education in the 21st Century: gender equality, empowerment, and economic growth. Washington DC: World Bank, 2008. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on economic development==
Both individuals and countries benefit from women's education. Individuals who invest in education receive a net monetary gain over the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref name=PsacharopoulosPatrinos2004 /&gt; According to Harry Patrinos, lead education economist at the World Bank,&lt;ref name="WBPatrinos"&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/harry-patrinos&lt;/ref&gt; “the profitability of education, according to estimates of private rate of return, is indisputable, universal, and global.”&lt;ref name=Patrinos2008 /&gt; The principle holds particularly for women, who can expect a 1.2% higher return than men on the resources they invest in education.&lt;ref name=PsacharopoulosPatrinos2004 /&gt; Providing one extra year of education to girls increases their wages by 10-20%.&lt;ref name=LevineEtAl2008&gt;Levine, Ruth, Cynthia Lloyd, Margaret Greene, and Caren Grown. [http://www.ungei.org/infobycountry/files/file_GirlsCount.pdf Girls count: a global investment &amp; action agenda]. Washington, DC: Center for Global Development, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is 5% more than the corresponding returns on providing a boy with an extra year of schooling.&lt;ref name=LevineEtAl2008 /&gt;

This individual monetary gain creates an increase in the overall economic productivity of a country. Girls are underrepresented in schooling, meaning that investments aimed specifically at educating women should produce bigger dividends.&lt;ref name=Schultz2002&gt;Schultz, T. Paul. [http://www.development.wne.uw.edu.pl/uploads/Courses/DW_Schultz_girls.pdf Why governments should invest more to educate girls]. New Haven, CT: Economic Growth Center, Yale University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although investment in women's education is not present everywhere, David Dollar and Roberta Gatti have presented findings that show that this decision, along with other failures to invest in women are not “an efficient economic choice for developing countries” and that "countries that under-invest grow more slowly.”&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999 /&gt; Looking holistically at the opportunity cost of not investing in girls, the total missed GDP growth is between 1.2% and 1.5%.&lt;ref name=ChaabanCunningham2011&gt;Chaaban, Jad, and Wendy Cunningham. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1907071 Measuring the economic gain of investing in girls: the girl effect dividend]. Washington, D.C.: The World Bank, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at different regions, it is estimated that 0.4-0.9% of the difference in GDP growth is accounted for solely by differences in the gender gap in education.&lt;ref name=Klasen2002 /&gt; The effect of the educational gender gap is more pronounced when a country is only moderately poor.&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999 /&gt; Thus the incentive to invest in women goes up as a country moves out of extreme poverty.&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999 /&gt;

In addition to total economic growth, women's education also increases the equitability of the distribution of wealth in a society. Increased women's education is important for achieving this as it targets the impoverished women, a particularly disadvantaged group.&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008&gt;Hanushek, Eric. "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EL2j2dW9lCgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA23 Schooling, Gender Equity, and Economic Outcomes]." In Girls' education in the 21st century: gender equality, empowerment, and economic growth. Washington DC: World Bank, 2008. 23-40&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that lower gender disparity in educational attainment for a developing country correlates with lower overall income disparity within society.&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008 /&gt;

==Effects on social development==
Women's education leads to significant social development. Some of the most notable social benefits include decreased fertility rates and lower infant mortality rates, and lower maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name=HillKing1998 /&gt; Closing the gender gap in education also increases gender equality, which is considered important both in itself and because it ensures equal rights and opportunities for people regardless of gender.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2011&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. Creating capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Women's education has cognitive benefits for women as well.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "[http://www.visionaryvalues.com/wiki/images/Gender_Equality_and_Empowerment_MDG_Kabeer.pdf Gender Equality And Women's Empowerment: A Critical Analysis Of The Third Millennium Development Goal]." Gender &amp; Development 13, no. 1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Improved cognitive abilities increase the quality of life for women&lt;ref name=Nussbaum2011 /&gt; and also lead to other benefits. One example of this is the fact that educated women are better able to make decisions related to health, both for themselves and their children.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; Cognitive abilities also translate to increased political participation among women.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; Educated women are more likely to engage in [[Civic engagement|civic participation]] and attend political meetings, and there are several instances in which educated women in the developing world were able to secure benefits for themselves through political movements.&lt;ref name=LevineEtAl2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; Evidence also points to an increased likelihood of democratic governance in countries with well-educated women.&lt;ref name=LevineEtAl2008 /&gt;

There are also benefits relating to the woman’s role in the household. Educated women have been found to experience less domestic violence, regardless of other social status indicators like employment status.&lt;ref name=Sen1999&gt;Sen, Purna. "Enhancing Women's Choices In Responding To Domestic Violence In Calcutta: A Comparison Of Employment And Education." The European Journal of Development Research 11, no. 2 (1999): 65-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Women with an education are also more involved in the decision-making process of the family and report making more decisions over a given time period.&lt;ref name=LevineEtAl2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; In particular, these benefits extend to economic decisions.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; Besides the intrinsic value of increasing a woman's agency,&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; having women play a more active role in the family also brings about social benefits for family members. In a household where the mother is educated, children and especially girls are more likely to attend school.&lt;ref name=HillKing1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BirdsallLevineIbrahim2005&gt;Birdsall, Nancy, Ruth Levine, and Amina Ibrahim. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3435.2005.00230.x/abstract Towards Universal Primary Education: Investments, Incentives, And Institutions]." European Journal of Education 40, no. 3 (2005): 337-349.&lt;/ref&gt; In households where a mother is not educated, adult [[literacy]] programs can indirectly help to teach mothers the value of education and encourage them to send their children to school.&lt;ref name=BirdsallLevineIbrahim2005 /&gt; There are also a number of other benefits for children associated with having an educated mother over an educated father, including higher survival rates and better nutrition.&lt;ref name=Schultz2002 /&gt;

==Limitations of impact==
There are some cases in which women's education has less of an effect on development. Economically, the benefits of investing in women are much smaller in areas facing high levels of poverty.&lt;ref name=DollarGatti1999 /&gt; Also, in some cases the education women receive is of much lower quality than what men receive, lowering its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; This phenomenon can be accompanied by the so-called [[hidden curriculum]] in schools, where certain values are reinforced.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; Emphasis on the superiority of boys can cause educated women to pass up economic opportunities in favor of lower-paying [[Pink-collar worker|traditionally female jobs]], with poor economic and social consequences.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; There are also situations in which women's education helps development on the macro-scale but is inefficient for a family. In societies where women are [[Marriage#Post-marital residence|married off]] and leave the family while men stay back and take care of their parents, investing in sons is more valuable to parents. Additionally, while investing in women's education has a higher overall return when looking at all levels of education, through primary school investing in men has a higher rate of return.&lt;ref name=PsacharopoulosPatrinos2004 /&gt; This gives families who are only planning to send their children to primary school incentives to invest in their sons' education over their daughters' education. Socially, societal gender roles may stifle the ability of women's education to improve gender equality for women.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt; This is particularly the case when education for women is only seen culturally as a tool for making women more attractive wives.&lt;ref name=Kabeer2005 /&gt;

Some researchers don't claim that women's education necessarily has little effect on development, but instead question the methodologies of the research showing that it has a sizeable effect. One issue that researchers acknowledge is the difficulty in comparing education levels.&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008 /&gt; The same number of years of schooling in two different countries may have very different educational content. Similarly, what is termed ‘primary school’ in different country may vary widely. Also, while extensive information for education in developed countries exists, data is only available for a small number of developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008 /&gt; This brings into question to what extent the results can be generalized for all developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hanushek2008 /&gt; Additionally, while the pure economic benefits are relatively uncontroversial, there is some discrepancy over how to measure the social benefits, with some variability between studies.&lt;ref name=PsacharopoulosPatrinos2004 /&gt;

The '''Soldiers’, Sailors’, Marines’, Coast Guard and Airmen’s Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] founded in 1919 and located at 283 [[Lexington Avenue]] between East [[36th Street (Manhattan)|36th]] and [[37th Street (Manhattan)|37th]] Streets in the [[Murray Hill (Manhattan)|Murray Hill]] neighborhood of [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is the only private organization in the New York area accommodating [[United States military|U.S. servicemen and servicewomen]] at subsidized rates. It also caters to military retirees and veterans and their families.

==Mission==
According to the club, its mission is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“To promote the general welfare of men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its Allies, and their families, by maintaining and offering club and lodging rooms”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
In 1919, Cornelia Barnes Rogers and Eleanor Butler Alexander-Roosevelt, wife of [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], along with General [[John J. Pershing]], founded '''The Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Club''' to accommodate servicemen returning from overseas duty in [[World War I]]. The Club originally served only active duty enlisted male soldiers and sailors, but it now serves all ranks (officers and enlisted) and services, active and retired, of the United States and its allies. With no [[U.S. government]] funding, supported solely by guest proceeds and the donations of private citizens, it has accommodated over 2,500,000 men and women of the [[US military]] and their families.

Currently, about 15,000 such personnel patronize the facility annually. In recent years the SSMAC Club has tended to incur an annual deficit of around $350,000.

One of the largest fundraisers for the club is the prestigious [[International Debutante Ball]] held biannually at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Times |first1=NY |title=47 presented at the International Debutante Ball |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/31/archives/47-presented-at-international-debutante-ball.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility==
Since the early 1920s, the SSMAC Club has occupied two adjacent 19th century [[townhouse]]s on Lexington Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets. These were built in the 1880s as homes for the upper middle class of that period. It is now a 79-bed facility that includes a library with two Internet stations, two large event rooms (North Lounge, South Lounge; both on the 1st floor), a television room, and a dining room. The walls of both common areas and private rooms are replete with U.S. military memorabilia, especially relating to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. (Private rooms are dedicated to individual veterans, families and other donors having provided pictures, certificates, etc. A small room at the back of the 1st floor memorializes [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] ([[Knyaz|Prince]]) [[Serge Obolensky]].)

The '''Ṣolubba''', also known as the '''Ṣleb''' and the '''Ṣulayb''' ({{lang-ar|صلوبة}}, {{lang|ar|صليب}}), were a [[Huteimi|Ḥutaymi]] tribal group in the northern part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] who were clearly distinguishable from the [[Arabs]].

They maintained a distinctive lifestyle as isolated nomads until the mid-20th Century, when the Solubba are believed to have merged into neighbouring ethnic groups. They were last seen by western travellers {{who|date=February 2016}} during the late 1940s. Leopold Weiss, an Austro-Hungarian Jewish (converted to Islam and known as Muhammad Asad) is a philosopher, historian, research scholar and former correspondent of famous German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung. In his reputed work "The road to Mecca" mentions an encounter with Sulluba  ear Saudi-Iraqi border in lates 1920s.

== Origin ==
The origin of the Solubba is obscure. They have been identified with the ''Selappayu'' in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] records, and a clue to their origin is their use of [[Desert Kites|desert kite]]s and game traps, first attested to in around 7,000 BC, which makes them the pre-Islamic inhabitants of Arabia.&lt;ref name=Blench4&gt;{{Harvnb|Blench|2010|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cambridge linguist and anthropologist [[Roger Blench]] sees the Solubba as the last survivors of [[Palaeolithic]] hunters and salt-traders who once dominated Arabia. Those were assimilated in the next wave of humans consisted of cattle herders in the 6th millennium BC who introduced cows, wild donkeys, sheep and dogs, wild camels and goats. Those peoples may have engaged in trade across the [[Red Sea]] with speakers of [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] or [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]. In the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC speakers of [[Semitic languages]] arrived from the Near East and marginalised and absorbed the rest.&lt;ref name=Blench10&gt;{{Harvnb|Blench|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western travelers reported that the [[Bedouin]] did not consider the Solluba to be descendants of [[Qahtanite|Qaḥṭān]]. One legend mentions that they originated from ancient Christian groups, possibly [[Crusaders]] who were taken into slavery by the Bedouin.&lt;ref name=McNutt43&gt;{{Harvnb|McNutt|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Werner Caskel]] criticizes the Crusader origin theory and instead proposes that the term "Solluba" describes a host of groups hailing from different backgrounds: those of [[al-Hasa|al-Ḥasā]] being of 12th- to 13th-century AD migrants from southern Persia, and the group to the west being composed of communities emerging after their defeat by the [[Wahhabi]]s.&lt;ref name=Bosworth814&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosworth|Heinrichs|Donzel|2003|p=814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another theory sees the Solubba as a former Bedouin group that lost their herds and fell in the eyes of other Bedouin.&lt;ref name=Meeker22&gt;{{Harvnb|Meeker|1979|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doughty282&gt;{{Harvnb|Doughty|Lawrence|2010|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society ==
The Solubba were reported by western travelers as having different physical features than other Arabs, often with fairer eyes and hair. They also spoke a distinct variety of Arabic that contained several words exclusive to their dialect.&lt;ref name="McNutt43"/&gt;
The Bedouin usually differentiated between the Solubba and other [[Huteimi]] groups, since unlike Huteimis the Solubba were independent and did not require protection from the Bedouin.
The Arab Bedouin despised the Solubba and counted them as men of no honor and thus inferior to them.&lt;ref name="Meeker22"/&gt; Their deep knowledge of the desert however earned them the title ''Abu al-Khala'' (Fathers of the empty spaces).&lt;ref name="McNutt43"/&gt;

The Solluba followed occupations such as carpentry, and metal- and leather-working. They were also known as fortune-tellers and magicians, as well as musicians and poets. The Bedouin valued their knowledge of the desert, often hiring them as scouts, and depended on them to heal their animals. Despite their dependence on the Solluba, the Bedouin did not appreciate them and often looked down upon them.&lt;ref name=Bosworth815&gt;{{Harvnb|Bosworth|Heinrichs|Donzel|2003|p=815}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike other nomadic Huteimi and Bedouin groups, the Solluba did not engage in plundering and were in turn viewed as neutrals and often spared when raids took place.&lt;ref name="Meeker22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bosworth815/&gt; Despite their low status, their hospitality was accepted, especially when a warrior was sick or wounded as they were famed as healers.&lt;ref name=McNutt44&gt;{{Harvnb|McNutt|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During spring the Solluba lived close to Bedouin settlements and lived off the milk of their cattle. In summer they trekked deep in the desert accompanied only by their wild asses and lived on hunting.&lt;ref name=Doughty281&gt;{{Harvnb|Doughty|Lawrence|2010|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Solluba owned certain slopes and valleys in the desert and young men gave portions of their territory as dowry to the family of brides to hunt on.&lt;ref name=Bosworth815/&gt;

Although formally Muslims, few Solluba were observant. They seem to have retained some of their traditional beliefs, worshipping the boulder ''al-Weli Abu Ruzuma'', located in the [[Syrian Desert]]. Their emblem, which was shown at ceremonial festivities, was a cross wrapped with a dress. Generally, they were seen as [[Kafir|unbelievers]] and suffered Wahhabi raids, with a notorious massacre in [[Arar, Saudi Arabia|ʿArʿar]] valley.&lt;ref name=Bosworth815/&gt;

== Population ==
Clear estimates of Solubba numbers is difficult as a result of their spread over a large geographical area. In 1898 their total number was put at 3,000. Some 1,700 were thought to be spread in the Syrian Desert. Ottoman records show around 500 Solubbas in the region of [[Mosul]].&lt;ref name=Levinson314&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|1995|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their numbers continued to dwindle in the 20th century,&lt;ref name=Levinson314/&gt; and many were massacred by Wahhabis during the [[Ikhwan rebellion]], they were however compensated by [[Ibn Saud]]. After the Second World War many Solluba were employed in the Iraqi, Jordanian and Kuwaiti armies as reputable trackers. Solluba and other nomads were settled in new urban centres along pipelines after the discovery of oil, many became identified with the Arab tribes where they settled while others continued to be known as Ṣulayb.&lt;ref name=Bosworth815/&gt;

A '''''tug''''' ({{Lang-mn|туг}}  {{IPA-mn|tʰʊɡ|}}, {{lang-tr|tuğ}}, {{lang-ota|طوغ}} {{transl|ota|ṭuġ}} or {{lang|ota|توغ}} {{transl|ota|tuġ}}) or '''sulde''' ({{lang-mn|сүлд}})  is a pole with circularly arranged horse or yak tail hairs of varying colors arranged at the top. It was historically flown during the period of the [[Mongol Empire]], and later adopted in derived  [[Turco-Mongol]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] khanates and the [[Ottoman Empire]]  .&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/Ib.htm {{lang|uk|Довідник з історії України.

In the 17th century, it was also adopted by Slavic cavalry  ([[cossacks]], [[haidamaka]]), under the name '''''bunchuk''''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Бунчук; [[Polish language|Polish]]: Buńczuk). It is still used by some units of the Polish military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/brokgauz_efron/17440/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%87%D1%83%D0%BA {{lang|ru|Бунчук // Энциклопедический словарь Ф.А. Брокгауза и И.А. Ефрона}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Mongols==
A white-haired banner is used as a peacetime symbol, while the black banner was for wartime. Usage of the horse tail is symbolic because horses are so central to the Mongols' livelihood. This is similar to the use of horse tail hairs for the [[morin khuur]].

The original white banner disappeared early in history, but the black one survived as the repository of Genghis Khan's soul. The Mongols continued to honor the banner, and [[Zanabazar]] (1635–1723) built a monastery with the special mission of flying and protecting the black banner in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford ''Genghis Khan'', p.XVI&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1937, the black banner disappeared amidst the [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia|great purges]] of the nationalists, monks and intellectuals, and the destruction of monasteries.

The Nine White banners came into renewed significance in Mongolia after democracy was adopted in the early 1990s as a symbol of the traditional Mongolian state, replacing the previous [[communist]] [[red flag (politics)|red flags]].

The state banner flown by the Mongols, the "Yesön Khölt tsagaan tug" ({{lang-mn|Есөн хөлт цагаан туг|links=no}}) or the "Nine Base White Banners", is composed of nine flag poles decorated with white horse tail hairs hanging from a round surface with a flame or [[trident]]-like shape on the top. The Nine White Banners was a peacetime emblem used exclusively by the [[List of Mongol Khans|Khans]] in front of their yurt. The central banner is larger in size than the rest and is placed in the center of the other eight. The modern Mongolian nine white banners are kept in the [[Government Palace (Mongolia)|Government Palace]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]].

It is made of black horse tail hairs and flown in the same fashion. According to the illustrated Japanese chronicle ''[[Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba]]'', the banner of [[Mongol invasions of Japan|the Mongolian Yuan fleet that invaded Japan]] was black. The modern Mongolian black banners are kept in the Ministry of Defense.

Within the [[Mongolian Armed Forces]], the white tug is used as the finial in military colours' flagpoles.

'''Unicorn Riot''' is a decentralized, non-profit media collective that originated online in 2015. The non-hierarchical media organization operates in the US cities of Boston, Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Philadelphia. They produce [[Streaming media|live streams]] of rallies and protests&lt;ref name="MPR"/&gt; and are funded by viewer donations.

==Structure==
Unicorn Riot currently has around 10 members, based in Boston, Denver, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Fusion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPR"/&gt; The media collective is non-hierarchical and makes decisions based on [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]].&lt;ref name="Westword"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Chris|title=Guerrilla Video Journalists Unicorn Riot Focus on Homelessness and the Police|url=http://www.westword.com/news/guerrilla-video-journalists-unicorn-riot-focus-on-homelessness-and-the-police-7589751|work=Westword|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicorn Riot has maintained a channel on [[Livestream|livestream.org]] since May 2015.&lt;ref name="Westword"/&gt; Besides creating live video of protests, the media collective also engages in investigative journalism, producing web series, video packages, blogs, and podcasts.&lt;ref name="MPR"/&gt; They have published documents obtained through open records requests, including a copy of the Denver Police Department Crowd Management Manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connell|first1=Kit|title=Leak Reveals Denver Police Use Undercover ‘Shadow Teams’ To Target Protest Leaders|url=http://www.mintpressnews.com/leak-reveals-denver-cops-use-undercover-shadow-teams-to-target-protest-leaders/213398/|work=MintPress News|date=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also produce the weekly news show ''Deprogram''.

==History==
===Foundation===
The founding members of Unicorn Riot met while filming [[direct action]]s in support of [[Tar Sands Blockade]] and [[Occupy Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="Intercept"/&gt; Some had previously worked for online news outlets and had grown frustrated with news organizations that failed to publish their work. The founders of Unicorn Riot started meeting in Minneapolis in the fall of 2014. Among the founders were Lorenzo Serna, Andrew Neef, Niko Georgiades, Pat Boyle, and Ray Weiland,&lt;ref name="MPR"/&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fusion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sterling|first1=Anna|title=Why Are The Police Targeting This Group Of Journalists?|url=http://fusion.net/story/308422/this-group-of-citizen-journalists-is-keeping-authorities-in-check-with-their-cellphones/|work=Fusion|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unicorn Riot seeks to amplify the voices of people from marginalized communities and to broadcast and bring context to stories that are not picked up by the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="MPR2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unicorn Riot a new force in covering protests|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/07/14/unicorn-riot-protest-coverage|work=MPR News|date=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, they documented the [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson protests]] following the [[shooting of Michael Brown]].  During the next year, Unicorn Riot registered as an educational [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization.&lt;ref name="MPR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Cody|title=The media, the protest movement and Unicorn Riot|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/05/05/unicorn-riot-media-protest-movement|work=MPR News|date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicorn Riot journalists are often embedded in protests, and film from the front lines.&lt;ref name="Intercept"/&gt; Members of the media collective have been repeatedly targeted for arrest by law enforcement officers&lt;ref name="Fusion"/&gt; and often have their cameras and equipment confiscated.&lt;ref name="Westword"/&gt; Their press credentials have also been challenged by the police.&lt;ref name="Intercept"/&gt;

===Black Lives Matter protests===
Unicorn Riot has documented a number of rallies and protests related to the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement. Following the November 2015 [[shooting of Jamar Clark]] in Minneapolis, Unicorn Riot maintained a live stream of the occupation of the [[Minneapolis Police Department]]'s 4th Precinct station.&lt;ref name="MPR"/&gt; The media collective also documented the protests that took place following the [[shooting of Philando Castile]], including blockages of interstate freeways.&lt;ref name="MPR2"/&gt;

===Denver homeless encampments===
In Denver, Colorado, Unicorn Riot live streamed the removal of homeless encampments, including an eviction that took place during a blizzard on the morning of December 15, 2015.&lt;ref name="Fusion"/&gt;

===Dakota Access Pipeline protests===
During the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|protests]] against the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]], Unicorn Riot was one of the first media groups to be present when [[Standing Rock Sioux]] tribe members set up the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests#Sacred Stone Camp|Sacred Stone Camp]] on April 1, 2016. The media collective has maintained a near continuous presence at the pipeline protests. Video from Unicorn Riot showing a crowd of protesters being sprayed with [[water cannon]]s during sub-zero temperatures was used to contradict police reports that the cannons were only being used to put out fires.&lt;ref name="Intercept"/&gt; Four Unicorn Riot reporters were arrested in September and October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Funes|first1=Yessenia|title=Charges Dropped Against Amy Goodman for Covering DAPL|url=http://www.colorlines.com/articles/charges-dropped-against-amy-goodman-covering-dapl|work=Colorlines|date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Schiano and Georgiades were arrested on September 13 as they were filming protesters who had locked themselves to equipment being used to construct the pipeline. Reporter Lorenzo Serna was arrested in both North Dakota and Iowa, and reporter Jenn Schreiter was arrested in October while reporting on a lockdown at a DAPL construction site in Iowa.&lt;ref name="Intercept"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Alleen|title=Arrests of Journalists at Standing Rock Test the Boundaries of the First Amendment|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/11/27/arrests-of-journalists-at-standing-rock-test-the-boundaries-of-the-first-amendment/|work=The Intercept|date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unite the Right rally===
Unicorn Riot had documented several of the chat rooms in the [[Discord (software)|Discord]] application prior to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in August 2017, which led to violence between alt right groups and local citizens, including the death of one person. The group subsequently released this material, which is being used to identify the anonymous uses on Discord that may have been part of the conspiracy to direct more violence at the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/leaked-alt-right-chat-logs-are-key-to-charlottesville-lawsuits/ | title=  Violent Alt-Right Chats Could Be Key to Charlottesville Lawsuits | first = Nitasha | last = Tiku | date = August 27, 2017 | accessdate = August 7, 2018 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/07/subpoena-for-app-called-discord-could-unmask-identities-of-charlottesville-white-supremacists/ | title = Subpoena for app called ‘Discord’ could unmask identities of Charlottesville white supremacists | first = Meagan | last=  Flynn | date = August 7, 2018 | accessdate = August 7, 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary Film===
Unicorn Riot produced a feature-length [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7650360/ documentary film] about the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline entitled "Black Snake Killaz: A #NoDAPL Story." The film was premiered on November 17, 2017 at the Parkway theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and [https://www.unicornriot.ninja/black-snake-killaz-2017/ released online] free of charge for educational purposes via Unicorn Riot's website on November 18, 2017.

"'''WUPHF.com'''" is the ninth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' and the show's 135th episode overall. Written by [[Aaron Shure]] and directed by [[Danny Leiner]], the episode aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on November 18, 2010. It resolves two long-running plot threads: [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan]]'s WUPHF.com project and [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] and [[Angela Martin|Angela]]'s contract to have a baby. This episode received positive reviews and was nominated for the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy]].

==Synopsis==
[[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) has gotten [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]), [[Stanley Hudson]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]), [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]), and [[Pam Beesly|Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) to put in funding for WUPHF.com (introduced in "[[Whistleblower (The Office)|The Whistleblower]]" as a cross-portal messaging system). While Ryan touts a planned "investors ski weekend", Michael learns that there is already an offer to buy out WUPHF.com and Ryan only has nine days of funding left before his venture collapses. Ryan's subsequent sales pitch falls apart when he reveals that the potential buyer is [[Washington University]] Public Health Fund, since the investors deduce that they only want to purchase the company for the domain name, because it is the acronym for the fund. Though the others demand that WUPHF.com be sold, Michael stands by Ryan, and since Michael owns over 50% of WUPHF.com, his decision stands. Pam tells Michael that Ryan has never viewed Michael as either his mentor or a best friend, and is now using Michael's unrequited affection for him to make him support WUPHF.com beyond reason, but everyone will lose their money if they do not sell, not just Michael. Michael takes this in, and is silently hurt when Ryan talks his way out of having dinner with him and blithely supports Michael's theoretical plan to get a second mortgage for more WUPHF.com funds. Despite this, he still does not agree to a sale, and instead lists his erstwhile protege's flaws right in front of a surprised and visibly wounded Ryan, then points out all his talents and that he believes in him. Taken aback by Michael's faith in him, Ryan at last makes a sincere effort to make WUPHF.com a success without additional investor funds. Ultimately forced to accept defeat, he sends Michael a message that he is going to sell WUPHF.com. Michael expresses relief.  

[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) creates a hay festival in the parking lot for the Thanksgiving holiday, in order to exorcise the memories from his childhood days when his family had competing hay festivals and he never was elected king for them. His efforts distract him from fulfilling a request for sex from [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) per their contract. A frustrated Angela meets a charming, friendly man ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]) who is attending the festival with his young son. Angela is pleased to meet someone who laughs at her jokes rather than at her, and approves when he asks if he can call her sometime. She is still more pleased when the man reveals he is a widower. Dwight appoints himself the "Hay Festival King" in the meantime, but arrives at his and Angela's warehouse rendezvous point to see their procreation contract has been stamped VOID, and looks stricken. [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]), meanwhile, gets lost in the hay maze and panics.

[[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) is in the midst of a record sales streak; he claims that his sales skills have been sharpened at home by convincing baby Cece to eat [[baby food]]. However, Kevin and Angela inform Jim that Sabre instituted a commissions cap for the year and Jim maxed out his returns. Jim talks to [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]) about it, but Gabe insists that he cannot change the policy. Unmotivated to work, Jim chats with his coworkers and makes fart noises, irritating both Gabe and Pam. He finally fills his time by editing the intro to [[Jo Bennett]]'s ([[Kathy Bates]]) audio autobiography so that it addresses Gabe. He then calls Gabe on his desk phone and sets up the receiver next to a playback of the edited autobiography, prompting Gabe to listen to the entire audiobook.

==Production==
[[File:Jack Coleman Get Smart premiere arrival (crop).jpg|alt=|Coleman smiling|thumb|[[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]] (seen here in 2008) guest starred in this episode.]]
"WUPHF.com" was written by co-executive producer [[Aaron Shure]], his fifth writing credit on the series, and directed by [[Danny Leiner]], his first ''Office'' directing credit. In a deleted scene, Michael seeks advice from Toby while the HR representative is having a webchat with his daughter; when Michael overhears Sasha talking about Toby's ex-wife's new boyfriend, Michael forgets he wanted help dealing with Ryan, and laughs at Toby's misery at the news.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11327">[[File:Jovem 001.JPG|thumb|alt=A Brazilian Youth in an urban city park| Brazilian Youth in urban city park.]]  '''Youth in Brazil''' includes Brazilians aged 15 to 24 or 29, depending on the definition of youth.&lt;ref&gt;.OECD.org.[http://www.oecd.org/youth.htm ''OECD work on Youth''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.OECD Family Database [https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/CO_3_5_Young_people_not_in_education_or_employment.pdf ''Young people not in education or employment''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Youth]] account for 16.5% of the population in Brazil which is, 202,656,788 people.  There are 16,993,708 male youth and 16,521,057 female youth in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="World Factbook"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency. "Brazil". The World Factbook. Retrieved 23 Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth population in 2010 was 34.5 percent higher than it was in 1980.  However, birthrates among Brazilians are dropping and youth as a percent of total population is decreasing. The fast fertility decline since the 1960s is the largest contributing factor to Brazil's slowing population growth rate, aging population, and fast-paced demographic transition.&lt;ref name="World Factbook" /&gt; By 2050 the number of youth is projected to fall again by 33.1 percent in comparison to the 2010 youth population.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth"&gt;Publishing, OECD. Investing In Youth [Electronic Resource]. n.p.: Paris : OECD Publishing, 2014. Drake University Catalog. Web. 2 Oct. 2014..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and Marriage==
Today Brazilian youth are living at home longer than before due to a longer time spent in school and trouble finding steady employment.  It is not uncommon for youth to live at home or be dependents of their parents until they get married. In general, men live at home with their parents longer than women do.  The family has great influence over Brazilian youth. The family provides youth with socialization and allows them to develop and shape their personalities.&lt;ref name="Latin America"&gt;Weltri, Carlos. The World's Youth: Adolescence in Eight Regions of the World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 276-304. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average age for youth to get married is twenty years old. Education is positively correlated with the age of marriage. According to [[fertility]] surveys, 30% of women with at least six years of education got married before age 20. The percentage increased to 60% among women who obtained less than six years of education. Youth living in rural areas generally get married sooner than urban youth.  In most cases youth engage in sexual activity before marriage.  Only one in ten youth use birth control.&lt;ref name="Latin America" /&gt;

==Education==
[[Education in Brazil]] is free and regulated by the national [[Ministry of Education]] (MEC), while the funding and administration is derived from the states.  The education system consists of three stages: pre-school, fundamental education, and upper secondary education. Pre-school covers ages four and five, fundamental education covers age six through fourteen and upper secondary education is for youth age 15-17.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

[[File:Ensino medio.tif|thumb|Ensino media alt=Brazilian students walking through their high school campus.| Brazilian students walking through their high school campus.]]  Participation in secondary education has historically been low in Brazil. However enrollments in [[early childhood education]] have increased by 52% between 2000 and 2012.  Approximately 98% of 6 to 14 year olds are now enrolled in education and the number of youth who attain upper secondary education has doubled within the past generation.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

Brazilian students have one of the highest rates of grade repetition amongst students in counties who participate in the [[PISA]] tests. Over eight million Brazilian youth did not finish their fundamental education.  Over a third of 20- to 24-year-olds leave school without reaching upper secondary education.  This is twice the average rate observed by the [[OECD]].&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;  The average literacy rate is approximately 97.5%.  The literacy rate among male youth is 96.7% and 98.3% among females.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy"&gt;Youth Policy: Brazil. N.p., 21 Apr. 2014. Web. 23 Oct. 2014. &lt;http://www.youthpolicy.org/factsheets/country/brazil/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 8% of the youth population have already left school before age 15.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt; By the age of 18 only 50% of Brazilian youth remain in education.  The labor market does not require as high levels of education as other countries.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

==Employment==
Brazilian youth work in sectors such as manufacturing, trade, construction, hotel, and restaurant industries. Since 2000 states have been in charge of setting their own [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt; Industrialization and service sectors provide work opportunities in the cities for young people.  These jobs often have high turnover rates.&lt;ref name="Youth and City"&gt;Dalsgaard, Anne Line, and Karen Tranberg Hansen. Youth And The City In The Global South. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008. eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 9 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil a majority of youth do not work out of necessity.  Among youth age 18-22 only 27.2% work because they say they have to. Approximately 24.9% work because they want to be independent, while 23.3% work because they consider work to be a personal achievement.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

Brazil has instituted policies specifically to help youth make more smooth and successful transitions from school to work.  In 2003 the first national program was created to assist young people in obtaining their first job. That program is First Job Stimulus Program (Programa de Estimulo ao Primeiro Emprego).  In 2011 the National Agenda on Decent Work for Youth (Agenda Nacional de Trabalho Decente para a Juventude) was created.&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

===Unemployment===
[[Unemployment]] rates among youth in Brazil are generally double the rates among adults.&lt;ref name="Latin America"/&gt; As of 2011, there was an approximate 15.4% youth unemployment rate.  Specifically, youth males have a 12.2% unemployment rate while females have a 19.8% unemployment rate.&lt;ref name="World Factbook"/&gt; 
Unemployment Insurance (UI) stated in Brazil in 1986 and has existed in its present form since 1994.  The insurance covers individuals in the private sector who lose their work through unjustified dismissal, including being laid-off. There are currently no requirements for an unemployed individual to search for work. An estimated 27% of Brazilian unemployment recipients are under the age of 21. This is partially because youth are less likely to be eligible for [[unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]].&lt;ref name="Investing in Youth" /&gt;

==Youth Crime==
[[UNESCO]] calculates that there are 54.5 homicides for every 100,000 young men living in cities such as [[Recife]], Brazil. Most homicides occur in poor [[barrio]]s like Santa Barbara and Vientnã.&lt;ref name="Youth and City"/&gt;  The highest death rates were among males age 15 to 24. Not all youth crimes in Brazil are violent homicides.&lt;ref name="Latin America"/&gt; [[Gang]] activity is common among young people, especially in favelas. In Brazil the favelas are controlled primarily by youth and young adults.&lt;ref name="Violence"&gt;Zdun, Steffen. "Violence In Street Culture: Cross-Cultural Comparison Of Youth Groups And Criminal Gangs." New Directions For Youth Development 2008.119 (2008): 39-54. Academic Search Complete. Web. 15 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Brazilian favelas it is common for children around the age of ten to join a gang.  At age twelve they can carry a weapon. This is especially dangerous because, at this stage in a child's life they have not developed the ability to control their actions, especially with weapons.  There are also pressures from gangs and drugs influences that increase youth crime and homicide.  Criminal gangs use as much violence than necessary to control their business, so they are not disturbed by police.&lt;ref name="Violence" /&gt;

==Youth Policy==
Historically, youth policies in Brazil focus primarily on two types of intervention policy. One focus sees youth as asocial threat.  The other policy views youth as the subject to rights. However, youth policies are starting to shift away from the 'youth problem approach' of combating violence and controlling youth's free time. There is now a push to ensure their rights.&lt;ref name="Democracy"&gt;Silva, Itamar, and Anna L. Salles Souto, eds. Democracy, Citizenship, and Youth: Towards Social and Political Participation in Brazil. London: I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Constitution of Brazil was amended to specifically include and protect youth.  A new chapter in the constitution entitled, "Family, Child, Adolescent, Youth, and Elderly" was created.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy" /&gt;

On August 5, 2013 Brazil's Parliament approved the creation of the Statute of Youth. The Statute provides guidelines and principles for public youth policy, youth rights, and the legal establishment of a National System of Youth and Youth Councils.  The Statute of Youth defines youth as people between age 15 and 29.&lt;ref name="Youth Statute Enacted"&gt;"Brazil: Youth Statute Enacted." Library of Congress. Library of Congress, 8 Aug. 2013. Web. 2 Nov. 2014. &lt;https://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205403658_text&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Statute requires that youth have the right to:

*Citizenship, social and political participation, and representation
*An education 
*Acquisition of the necessary skills to practice a profession, work, and income 
*Non-discrimination and equality 
*Health
*Culture 
*Communication, media, and [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]
*Sport and leisure 
*Mobility 
*Enjoyment of a sustainable and [[ecology|ecologically]] balanced environment
*[[Public security]] and access to justice &lt;ref name="Youth Statute Enacted" /&gt;

Public and Private agents engaging in youth, must follow these youth policy guidelines.&lt;ref name="Youth Statute Enacted" /&gt;

==Politics==
Brazil has a [[compulsory voting]] system. Youth gain the right to vote at age 16.  Voting is optional for youth age 16 to 18 and people over 70 years old.&lt;ref name="Youth Policy" /&gt;

In June 2013, a [[2013 protests in Brazil|student-led protest movement]] began in São Paulo, Brazil.  The protests began when bus and subway fares were raised 10-cents.  The protests was led by the Free Fare Movement ([[Movimento Passe Livre]]).  As the youth protests went on, the movement grew to address other issues, including excessive amounts of money being used for the World Cup, government corruption, and social inequalities. The youth also stood up to [[police brutality]] against their fellow protesters. The goals of the movement included  improvement of public transportation, national health care, and the public education system.&lt;ref name="Bus Protests"&gt;Wills, Santiago.
