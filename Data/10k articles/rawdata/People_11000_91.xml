'''Abra Kadabra''' ('''Citizen Abra''') is a magical supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]],&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Citation|last = Jimenez|first = Phil|author-link = Phil Jimenez|contribution = Abra Kadabra|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 8|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #128 (May 1962).

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Flash 133.jpg|125px|left|thumb|''The Flash'' #133 (December, 1962), cover art by [[Carmine Infantino]]]]
'''Citizen Abra''' is from the 64th century, at a time when science has made [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] obsolete. However, he desires a career as a performing magician, so he goes back in time to find an audience to entertain after stealing a time machine and inventing a device to paralyze the guards, and soon clashes with the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]). He has a hypnotic device that makes people clap regardless of their thoughts, which he uses to force applause from audiences even when they don't applaud his magic tricks. He finds his magic is being overlooked, so decides to involve himself in important events. When the Flash tries to stop a crime he is committing, he makes the Flash clap, enabling him to escape. He is able to send the Flash into space after challenging him to a fight at the theatre, but the Flash is able to change the course of the planetoid he is on so he is sent back to Earth, and finds Kadabra took his left-behind costume, meaning he can follow the impulses, and Kadabra is jailed. But he hypnotizes the Governor using a ray from a device made out of pots and pans, to let him out, and starts staging a puppet show where the Flash is defeated by a puppet called Captain Cream-Puff. When the Flash passes a poster advertising Kadabra, he is turned into a puppet and used in the performance. But the Scarlet Speedster is able to restore himself slightly using the organic matter in his brain, which was not transformed, and then reverse Kadabra's ray so he is restored completely. He again defeats Kadabra.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' vol. 1 #133 (December 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his many confrontations with the Flash, Abra Kadabra's technology is damaged and his body becomes insubstantial and wraith-like.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' Vol. 2 #23 (Feb. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' Vol. 2 #67 (Sept. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; After his body is returned to normal, he is captured by a bounty hunter named Peregrine, and returned to his native century to serve a death sentence, although he is saved by the Flash before he can be executed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' Vol. 2 #68 (Sept. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after returning to the 21st century, during the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, he forgoes his technological implements and tricks five [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] into selling their souls to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] so he can gain genuine magical powers.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; Abra Kadabra later kidnapped [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], the girlfriend of [[Wally West]] (Barry Allen's protégé and successor), during their wedding and erases her from history,&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' Vol. 2 #142 (Oct. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; though he is ultimately defeated with the help of [[Dark Flash|Walter West]], Wally's counterpart from an alternate dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' Vol. 2 #158 (March 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Abra Kadabra became a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #2 (Jan. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[One Year Later]]", he and several other Rogues are approached by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] with a plan to kill the Flash ([[Bart Allen]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #11 (June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Though Inertia is defeated, Kadabra and the other Rogues successfully beat Bart to death, though not before Kadabra recognizes that Bart is too young to be the Flash they are used to dealing with.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13 (Aug. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Salvation Run ===
Abra Kadabra is one of the exiled villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]'', along with his fellow Rogues: [[Captain Cold]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Weather Wizard]], and [[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]]. Upon coming across the planet's local pygmies, Abra Kadabra deciphers its language and uses it to locate a "safe zone" for himself and the other Rogues before leading the other villains dispatched there to it.&lt;ref&gt;''Salvation Run'' #1 (Jan. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] who joined [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains,&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' #21 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; however the rest of the Rogues left the Society.&lt;ref&gt;''Rogues Revenge'' #1 (Sept. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was last seen in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' off-panel, being attacked by [[Professor Zoom]]. In the final issue of the mini-series, Abra is seen to have survived Zoom's attack and says Zoom should have made sure he was dead.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DC Rebirth ===
Abra Kadabra makes his post-[[DC Rebirth]] debut in the ''[[Titans (comics)|Titans]]'' series. He first appears as a bumbling and terrible party magician known as Mister Hocus Pocus. When [[Lilith Clay|Lilith]] forms a psionic link with Wally West to try and uncover who or what removed 10 years of history from everyone's memories, she accidentally awakens Abra Kadabra from within Mister Hocus Pocus. Abra Kadabra reveals he is the one who made Wally disappear and he will now destroy him.&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' #1 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Abra Kadabra creates younger puppet duplicates of the Titans and has them fight the Titans. When the puppet Lilith finds [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] and tells Abra Kadabra of her importance to Wally, Abra Kadabra realizes that history is broken, knowing that Wally and Linda will not meet years from now. Abra Kadabra realizes that his plans must be speed up, and before he can contemplate even further, he is attacked by [[Garth (comics)|Garth]]. He tries to kill him but only succeeds in injuring Garth due to Wally's interference.&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' vol. 3, #2 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Abra Kadabra reveals to Wally that he removed the latter from time and recollection because he always managed to thwart Abra Kadabra's plans, and disappears with his puppet Titans afterwards. At the theater, Abra Kadabra tries to receive evaluations of the Titans from his puppets. Abra Kadabra reveals his origin (which is similar to his pre-Flashpoint origin) to his puppets, revealing that he is from the future and traveled back in time in order to become famous, but his plans were always thwarted by the Flash (Barry Allen) and Kid Flash (Wally West). Abra Kadabra then used almost all of his power to throw Wally into the time stream in order to remove him from time, but it removed his memories in the process. Intrigued as to why history has been knocked askew, due to the fact Wally knows Linda (even hinting that he knows the true perpetrator), Abra Kadabra begins to craft an even greater trick and he kidnaps Linda from in front of Wally.&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' vol. 3, #3 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

He then attempts to force Wally into a position where Wally will run himself into the Speed Force, believing that Wally will be unable to return without Linda as his 'lightning rod',&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' vol. 3, #5 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; but Wally is able to return by using the Titans as his own lightning rod after talking with a representation of his memories of Linda in the Speed Force, which assures him that he can still win Linda back. With Abra Kadabra defeated and sending him to the timestream, Lilith notes that she cannot understand Abra Kadabra's madness, but picked up a key word in his thoughts; "[[Doctor Manhattan|Manhattan]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Titans'' vol. 3, #6 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Abra Kadabra is a powerful sorcerer and can achieve virtually any feat with his spells. Originally his powers were all due to 64th century scientific technology that appeared magical to residents of the 20th century. Later, Kadabra's powers are augmented to include true [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] when he strikes a deal with Neron.&lt;ref&gt;''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Abra Kadabra is a television presenter and member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Seven]]. He sends a message about [[Shade, the Changing Man]] believing that Shade was a dangerous lunatic and then reveals the identities of the Secret Seven members.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Secret Seven'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* Abra Kadabra has a non-voiced cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode "Flash and Substance", he appears as a background character in the bar frequented by [[Wally West]]'s enemies.
* Abra Kadabra appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. In the teaser of the episode "Chill of the Night", [[Batman]] teams up with [[Zatanna]] to stop him from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. He casts a spell to gag Zatanna; when Zatanna tries to remove it Zatanna pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs tied to the tongue. Batman holds back the people he possessed, Zatanna gets Kadabra's wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear then snaps the wand. Zatanna then traps him in her hat. Zatanna later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. Abra Kadabra appeared in the anthology episode "Four Star Spectacular" in [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s segment. He only came to the present because he wanted to see if the Flash dies at the [[Mirror Master]]'s hands. But because of his interruption, Flash easily defeated the Mirror Master. This caused Abra Kadabra to kill with his wand (actually it is Flash's mirror duplicate made by the Mirror Master's device). It shocked him so much that he returned to the future to see if he has made any alternations.
* Abra Kadabra appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced again by Jeff Bennett. In the episode "Denial", he and [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] work together in order to claim the Helmet of Fate which started with Abra Kadabra abducting Kent Nelson when he was seeing [[Madame Xanadu]]. Kid Flash confirms that he uses futuristic technology to simulate magic. He managed to subdue [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and Artemis until Kid Flash (wearing the Helmet of Fate) was able to strip him of his technology making him vulnerable to Superboy's punch. In "Terrors", Abra Kadabra was seen as one of the inmates at [[Belle Reve]].
* Abra Kadabra appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[David Dastmalchian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/06/exclusive-abra-kadabra-is-coming-to-the-flash |title=EXCLUSIVE: Abra Kadabra is Coming to The Flash |last=Beedle |first=Tim |date=March 6, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |access-date=March 8, 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307125118/http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/03/06/exclusive-abra-kadabra-is-coming-to-the-flash |archive-date=2017-03-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a technologically-enhanced villain from the 64th century, with nano-tech in his body that allows him to have a range of abilities that are almost indistinguishable from magic and sorcery in the 21st century. He reveals that he and Barry Allen are enemies in the future and even knows [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]]'s true identity. Being pursued by [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] for crimes on Earth-19, he arrives on Earth-1 to steal components for a time machine so he can return to his own time. He is stopped by the Flash, Kid Flash, [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]] and Gypsy. Before returning to Earth-19 with Gypsy to be executed, he informs Barry that the two of them will be enemies in the Flash's future and his past. Knowing of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]], [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]] and the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]], he enjoys the opportunity to taunt Barry with knowing Savitar's identity but will not reveal it, allowing him to feel that he is essentially killing [[Iris West]] by proxy as Savitar supposedly killed Iris in the future.

===Video games===
* Abra Kadabra appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' DLC "The Lightning Strikes", voiced by Christopher Loveless.

'''Adolph Woermann''' (10 December 1847 in [[Hamburg]] – 4 May 1911 in the [[Grönwohld]]-Hof near [[Trittau]]) was a German merchant, shipowner and politician, who was also instrumental in the establishment of [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] in [[Africa]]. In his time he was the largest German trader to West Africa&lt;ref name="Bade-362"&gt;Klaus J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2301">According to [[Welsh mythology|Welsh tradition]], '''Afaon fab Taliesin''' (also spelled as '''Addaon''') was the son of the bard [[Taliesin]] and a member of [[King Arthur]]'s retinue. He appears both in the ''[[Welsh Triads]]'' and in the medieval Arthurian tale ''[[Breuddwyd Rhonabwy]]''.

==Role in Welsh tradition==
According to the ''Dream of Rhonabwy'', Afaon fought alongside Arthur at the [[Battle of Badon]] as one of his chief counsellors. He recklessly rode past Arthur prior to the battle, splashing the king in his haste, and was rebuked by [[Elffin ap Gwyddno]]. Despite his recklessness, he was referred to by [[Iddog ap Mynio]] as "the wisest and most accomplished in the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is alluded to several times in the [[Welsh Triads]]. Triad 7 calls him one of the "Three Bull-Chieftains of the Island of Britain", together with two other sons of bards.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Triad 25 names him one of the "Three Battle-Rulers of the Island of Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, p. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Triad 33 describes his death at the hands of Llawgat Trwm Bargod Eidyn (Heavy Battle-Hand of the Border of Eidyn) as one of the "Three Unfortunate Slaughters of the Island of Britain". An alternate version of this triad, 33 W., titled "Three Savage Men of the Island of Britain, who performed the Three Unfortunate (Ill-omened) Slaughters", renders the killer's name slightly differently as Llongad Grwm Fargod Eidyn (Llongad the Bent of the Border of Eidyn).&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich 75-78, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afaon is further  mentioned in the late twelfth century ''Enlyngion y Clyweit'', a collection of proverbial [[englyn]]s attributed to various historical and mythological heroes. The text claims that he once sang the proverb "The cheek will not conceal the anguish of the heart".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/clyweid.html ''Englynion y Clyweit''].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Alfred Cuschieri''' is a Maltese-British academic and surgeon. He is most notable for his pioneering contribution to the development and clinical implementation of [[laparoscopic surgery|minimal access surgery]], also known as key-hole surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(05)75151-5.pdf |title=Alfred Cuschieri |access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been Professor of Surgery at the [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies|Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna]] since 2003 as well as Chief Scientific Advisor to the Institute of Medical Science and Technology at the [[University of Dundee]] since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imsat.org/AlfredCuschieri.htm |title=IMSaT - Professor Cuschieri |access-date=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Cuschieri obtained his medical degree from the Royal University of Malta (as it was then known) in 1961. Soon after graduation he left Malta for the United Kingdom to undertake further research into his areas of surgical and technological interest at the [[University of Liverpool]]. At Liverpool, he rose to become a lecturer in the medical school and then, in 1974, to a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Personal Chair]] in Surgery.&lt;ref name="Alfred Cuschieri C.V."&gt;{{cite web |url=https://independent.academia.edu/AlfredCuschieri/CurriculumVitae |title=Cuschieri - Academia |access-date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cuschieri moved north to join Dundee's [[University of Dundee School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] as Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Surgery and Molecular Oncology Department. It was while working at [[Ninewells Hospital]] in the city that he and his team first began researching the medical and technological basis for minimal access surgery.&lt;ref name="Doctor who shrunk the surgeon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080322/interview/doctor-who-shrunk-the-surgeon.201061 |title=Doctor who shrunk the surgeon |access-date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuschieri's team took advantage of, among other internal and external ergonomic developments, smaller cameras allowing insertion into the incision made in the skin; as a result of this progress the first minimally invasive surgery in the UK was carried out at Ninewells in 1987.&lt;ref name="Doctor who shrunk the surgeon" /&gt;

A lack of appropriate training in this form of surgery, and instances of procedures going wrong even resulting in deaths, led to some concern and mistrust in the new techniques. As a result, training units were set up at hospitals and medical schools around the UK with one of the first designated in 1993 under Cuschieri's directorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surgicaltrainingnetwork.org/cuschieri-skills-centre---dundee.html |title=Cuschieri Skills Centre |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://app.dundee.ac.uk/pressreleases/2007/prjuly07/finalgraduation.html |title=University of Dundee Graduation notes |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuschieri holds some fifty-eight patents for various surgical instruments and has been originally published around five hundred times in peer-reviewed journals; he has been European Editor-in-Chief of [[Surgical Endoscopy]] since 1992.&lt;ref name="Alfred Cuschieri C.V." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmimicro.com/meet-our-advisors/ |title=Advisers to Medical Micro Instruments |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADLBOAT.jpg|thumb|André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat]]
'''André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat''' (30 November 1746 – 14 October 1829) was a French financier, banker and philanthropist.

==Early life==
André Laffon de Ladebat was born in [[Bordeaux]], France, the son of commercial ship-owner [[Jacques-Alexandre Laffon de Ladebat]]. He studied in the [[Netherlands]] at the Protestant University of [[Franeker]].

In 1763, returning to France after a stay in [[England]], de Ladebat entered his father's naval armaments business, and invested heavily in the development of an "Experimental Farm" in [[Pessac]], and began to deforest the [[Moorland|moors]] of Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noes.site.voila.fr/ La ferme expérimentale de Pessac en Gironde France]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, he actively participated in the work of the Bordeaux Academy of Sciences, as well as the Academy of Painting and Sculpture, of which he was president.

De Ladebat distinguished himself through his writings on finance, [[political economy]], and the improvement of living conditions.  He is especially noted for his 1788 work "Discourse on the Necessity and the Means of Abolishing Slavery in the Colonies" which would be published in Bordeaux and read several years later in a session of the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and would be drawn upon by the ''[[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|Societé des amis des noirs]]'' (Society of Friends of Blacks) with which be became associated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10697/10697-8.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in revolutionary politics ==
Despite his status as a [[Nobility|noble]], de Ladebat was appointed to the [[Estates-General of 1789]]. However, as he refused to resign from his post in order to represent the nobility in his ''[[Départements of France|département]]'', he was removed from office. While a member of the executive committee of the [[Gironde]] in 1790, he was elected to serve as deputy from the Gironde at the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], where he rejoined the moderate [[Feuillant (political group)|Feuillant]] royalist party: he presided over the Finance Committee and assumed the presidency of the Legislative Assembly in June, 1792. On 20 June 1792, during the riots at the [[Tuileries Palace]], he defended King [[Louis XVI of France]] and the royal family, an action which led to his arrest the following December.

Though released at the beginning of the [[National Convention|Convention]], de Ladebat was again imprisoned under the [[Reign of Terror]] as suspect because of his connections with the [[Girondins]]. He escaped the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]] thanks to the government's reliance on his credit in order to finance its operations.

Finally, under the [[French Directory|Executive Directory]], he was elected a deputy on the [[Council of Ancients]]. De Ladebat represented a danger to individuals in compromising or corrupt positions of power in need of enormous financial support. His personal honesty, thoroughness, and devout [[Protestantism]] made him a serious challenge to the Directory. Along with [[Boissy d'Anglais]], he unceasingly denounced licentiousness and bureaucratic waste.

== 18 Fructidor and exile ==
De Ladebat was President of the [[Council of Ancients]] at the time of the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor|18 Fructidor coup]] against the new moderate majority on the Councils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://18_fructidor_anV.voila.net (Le coup d'état du 18 fructidor an V)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was later deported to [[French Guiana]] with sixteen other deputies. He would remain in exile at [[Sinnamary]] for over two years with several other deportees, including [[Pichegru|General Pichegru]]. Of the sixteen deported to Sinnamary, eight died there or while escaping, six escaped successfully, and two were finally recalled to France.

==Return to France and retirement from politics==
De Ladebat returned to France in February 1800 after intervention from the [[First Consul]], [[Napoléon Bonaparte]]. After his return, several ''départements'' asked him to represent them in the [[French Consulate|Senate]]. However, he remained suspicious of [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]], who had always blamed him for denouncing previous acts of violence in Italy, and had demanded his dismissal shortly before the events of 18 Fructidor. Suspicious of his independence, Bonaparte removed de Ladebat's name from the Senate roles. De Ladebat was the only surviving member of the 18 Fructidor plot to leave politics and return to commerce. Explaining his abstention from politics, he wrote,
:"In an arbitrary monarchy, the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin anarchy]], the confusion of the Directory and the military [[despotism]], I saw nothing but contempt for the people"

==Later life and death==
De Ladebat gained widespread recognition for financial competence and ability after taking over direction of the ''Banque Territoriale'' and organizing the final liquidation of the ''Caisse d'Escompte'', a predecessor of the [[Banque de France]].

He sought to repair the damage done to his finances following his deportation after 18 Fructidor; he reclaimed the remainder of his dispersed or confiscated assets and, notably, obtained compensation for the Sartine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sartine.site.voila.fr/]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his family-owned boats earlier requisitioned for use in the [[Indies]].

During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he fell out of favor with the [[House of Bourbon]]. He also contributed to the establishment of the [[Savings and Loan Association|Caisses d'Epargne]] and philanthropic institutions. In 1818, he became the president of the Protestant Society of Forethought and Mutual Assistance, and a member of the Society of Christian Morality. In 1821, he was among the founders of the Committee for the Abolition of Slavery, along with [[Auguste de Staël]] and [[Charles de Rémusat]].

The same year, after a stay in England where he studied the new community and industrial organization systems implemented by [[Robert Owen]] at [[New Lanark]], de Ladebat translated the works of Henry Grey Macnab, which relate and analyse his pioneering experiences working for the "Relief and most useful employment of the working class and the poor, and for the education of their children."

Shortly before his death in 1829, he assembled his notes from his deportation to Sinnamary, which would eventually be published by his grandson in 1912 under the title "Journal from my Deportation to French Guiana - Fructidor Year 5 - Ventôse Year 8". He was buried at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in [[Paris]]. His eulogy was delivered by [[François Guizot]], then the President of the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://Laffon_de_Ladebat.voila.net André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arlie Russell Hochschild''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|əʊ|k|ʃ|ɪ|l|d}}; born January 15, 1940) is an American sociologist and academic. She is professor [[emeritus|emerita]] of sociology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sociology.berkeley.edu/emeritus-faculty Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hochschild has long focused on the human emotions which underlie moral beliefs, practices,  and social life generally. She is the author of nine books including,  most recently ''[[Strangers in Their Own Land]]: Anger and Mourning on the American Right'', a finalist for the [[National Book Award]], and ''[[The Second Shift]]'', ''[[The Managed Heart]]'', and ''[[The Time Bind]]''.   In the tradition of [[C. Wright Mills]], Hochschild continually tries to draw links between private troubles and social issues.

==Early life==
Hochschild was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Ruth Alene (Libbey) and Francis Henry Russell, who was the U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, Ghana, and Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1989/04/02/ex-ambassador-fh-russell-dies-at-age-84/bc8688dd-ead9-4f89-84c0-4bbb63b67685/&lt;/ref&gt; Hochschild early became fascinated with the boundaries people draw between inner experience and outer appearance. As she writes in the preface to her book [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|''The Managed Heart: The Commercialization of Human Feeling'']],

:"I found myself passing a dish of peanuts among many guests and looking up at their smiles; diplomatic smiles can look different when seen from below than when seen straight on. Afterwards I would listen to my mother and father interpret various gestures. The tight smile of the Bulgarian emissary, the averted glance of the Chinese consul . . . I learned, conveyed messages not simply from person to person but from Sofia to Washington, from Peking to Paris, and from Paris to Washington. Had I passed the peanuts to a person, I wondered, or to an actor? Where did the person end and the act begin? Just how is a person related to an act?"&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983ix"&gt;Hochschild, 1983; p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Hochschild graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1962  and then earned her M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley, whose faculty she soon joined. She wrote her first book, ''The Unexpected Community'', in 1973. As a graduate student, Hochschild was greatly inspired by the writings of [[Erving Goffman]] and [[C. Wright Mills]]. In [[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|''White Collar'']], Mills argued that we "sell our personality." This resonated with Hochschild, but she felt that more needed to be added. As she writes,

:"Mills seemed to assume that in order to sell personality, one need only have it. Yet simply having personality does not make one a diplomat, any more than having muscles makes one an athlete. What was missing was a sense of the active emotional labor involved in the selling. This labor, it seemed to me, might be one part of a distinctly patterned yet invisible emotional system– a system composed of individual acts of 'emotion work,' social 'feeling rules,' and a great variety of exchanges between people in private and public life."&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983x"&gt;Hochschild, 1983; p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hochschild went on to create concepts which illuminate the power of emotion in social life. With her husband, writer [[Adam Hochschild]], she raised two sons.

==Concepts==

===Emotion as social===

Hochschild starts with the thesis that human emotions-—joy, sadness, anger, elation, jealousy, envy, despair—-are, in large part, social. Each culture, she argues, provides us with prototypes of feeling which, like the different keys on a piano, attune us to different inner notes. Tahitians, she points out, have one word, "sick," for what in other cultures might correspond to envy, depression, grief or sadness.&lt;ref name="Hochschild2003a"&gt;Hochschild, 2003a.&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture guides the act of recognizing a feeling by proposing what's possible for us to feel. In [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|''The Managed Heart'']] Hochschild cites the Czech novelist [[Milan Kundera]], who writes that the Czech word "litost" refers to an indefinable longing, mixed with remorse and grief—a constellation of feelings with no equivalent in any other language. It is not that non-Czechs never feel litost, she notes; it is that they are not, in the same way, invited to lift out and affirm the feeling—instead of to disregard or suppress it.&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983"&gt;Hochschild, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from what we think a feeling ''is'', Hochschild asserts in [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|''The Managed Heart'']], we have ideas about what it ''should be''. We say, "You should be thrilled at winning the prize" or "you must be furious at what he did." We evaluate the fit between feeling and context in light of what she calls "[[feeling rules]]," which are themselves deeply rooted in culture.&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983" /&gt; In light of such feeling rules, we try to manage our feelings—i.e., we try to be happy at a party, or grief-stricken at a funeral. In all of these ways—our experience of an interaction, our definition of feeling, our appraisal and management of feeling—feeling is social.

Emotional expression and management are learned in the private sphere, then later through participation in public life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wharton, A. S. (2011). The Sociology of Arlie Hochschild. ''Work &amp; Occupations'', ''38''(4), 459-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional labor===

"[[Emotional labor]]" refers to the management of one’s feelings and expressions based on the emotional requirements of a job.&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983" /&gt; For example, in [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|''The Managed Heart'']] Hochschild writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers' feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety. Bill collectors, too, are often trained to imagine debtors as lazy or dishonest, and so to feel suspicious and be intimidating.&lt;ref name="Hochschild1983" /&gt; As the number of service jobs grows, so too does the amount and number of kinds of [[emotional labor]].

Increasingly, Hochschild argues, [[emotional labor]] has gone global. In her essay, "Love and Gold," in ''Global Woman'' she describes immigrant care workers who leave their children and elderly back in the Philippines, Mexico or elsewhere in the global South, to take paid jobs caring for the young and elderly in families in the affluent North. Such jobs call on workers to manage grief and anguish vis-a-vis their own long-unseen children, spouses, and elderly parents, even as they try to feel—and genuinely do feel—warm attachment to the children and elders they daily care for in the North. In an interview with ''Journal of Consumer Culture'', Hochschild focuses on the emotional labor of female immigrants, "So you have women from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, India, Mexico leaving their children and elderly behind to take jobs caring for American, Canadian, Saudi, and European children and elderly. It was also not uncommon to hear nannies say, ‘I love the kids I take care of now more than my own. I hate to say it, but I do'".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wilson, N. H., &amp; Lande, B. J. (n.d). Feeling Capitalism: A Conversation with Arlie Hochschild. Sage Publications, Ltd. &lt;/ref&gt; Extending from the eldest daughter in a rural village who takes care of siblings while a mother cares for an employer's children in the city of a poor country to that employer's employer -- and children --in a rich country, outsourcing care work creates a global care chain with a different emotional task at each link of it. &lt;ref name="Hochschild2004"&gt;Hochschild, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Work and family===

In  other books, Hochschild applies her perspective on emotion to the American family. In ''The Second Shift'', she argues that the family has been stuck in a "stalled revolution." Most mothers  work for pay outside the home; that is the revolution. But the jobs they go out to and men they come home to haven't changed as rapidly or deeply as has she; that is the stall. So working mothers end up doing the lion's share of the work—both emotional and physical—of tending the home, which leads her to feel resentment. Hochschild traces links between a couple's division of labor and their underlying "economy of gratitude."&lt;ref name="Hochschild1989"&gt;Hochschild, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Who, she asks, is grateful to whom, and for what?&lt;ref name="Hochschild1989" /&gt;

In ''The Time Bind'', Hochschild studied working parents at a [[Fortune 500]] company dealing with an important contradiction.  On one hand, nearly everyone she talked to told her that "my family comes first."&lt;ref name="Hochschild2001"&gt;Hochschild, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, working parents felt a magnetic draw to work. For about a fifth of these working parents, she found, home felt like work and work felt like home. Where, she asked informants, do you get help when you need it? Often the answer was work. Where are you most rewarded for what you do, work or home? Often the answer was work. One man told her, "When I'm doing the right thing with my teenage son, chances are he's giving me hell for it. When I'm doing the right thing at work, my boss is clapping me on my back." &lt;ref name="Hochschild2001" /&gt;   Parents, she found, handled this strain in several ways. One was to reduce their idea of what they needed. ("Oh, I don't really need time to unwind.")  Another was to outsource personal tasks.  A third was to develop an imaginary self, the self you would be if only you had time.&lt;ref name="Hochschild2001" /&gt; The "time bind" refers to the lack of time parents had to themselves, the feeling that they were always running late and the thought that they were confined to the limited hours of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. R. (2006). Chapter 33: The Time Bind. In , Inequality Reader: Contemporary &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender (pp. 284-289). Perseus Books, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''Journal of Consumer Culture'', Hochschild describes how capitalism plays a role in one’s “imaginary self”. She explains, “Many workers put in long hours, and return home exhausted. They turn to television as a form of passive ‘recovery’ from work. In the four hours of television, they’re exposed to thousands of amusing, fun advertisements. Those ads function as a conveyor belt to the mall. At the mall, they spend the money they’ve earned on objects that function as totems to a ‘potential self’ or hypothetical self – a self we would be if only we had time”. It is also a self in danger of being perpetually in emotional debt to loved ones. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Politics and emotion===

Her latest book, ''Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right'', is based on five years of immersion research among Louisiana supporters of the Tea Party. It explores the role of emotion in politics by first posing a paradox.  Why, she asks, do residents of the nation's second poorest state vote for candidates who resist federal help? Why in a highly polluted state, do they vote for politicians reluctant to regulate polluting industries?  Her search for answers leads her to the concept of the "deep story."  A deep story is a story that feels true about a highly salient feature of life. One takes facts  out of a deep story. One takes moral precepts out of the deep story. What remains is simply what feels true about a highly salient issue, and can be described through metaphor, as the experience of "waiting in line" for a valued reward, and witnessing unwelcome "line-cutters." Everyone, she argues, has a deep story -- and for many on the right, it reflects a keen sense of decline, the sting of scorn, and sense of being a stranger in one's own land.

Taken as a whole, Hochschild's work describes the many ways in which each individual self becomes a shock absorber of larger forces, and focuses on the   impact of these forces on emotion. For further reference, see her Curriculum Vitae, U.C. Berkeley, Sociology Department website. 

==Honors==
Hochschild has been short-listed for the 2016 National Book Award for  ''Strangers In Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right'' and was a New York Times Bestseller. In 2015, she was awarded the [http://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/world-leadingsociologistawardedwithucdulyssesmedal/ Ulysses Medal] from University College Dublin, Ireland. Hochschild has also won [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] and [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon]] fellowships, and three awards granted by the [[American Sociological Association]]—the [[Charles Cooley]] Award (for [[The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling|''The Managed Heart'']]) the [[Jessie Bernard]] Award (for ''The Second Shift'', [[Time bind|''The Time Bind'']] and ''Global Woman''), and the Award for Public Understanding of Sociology (for lifetime achievement). In awarding Hochschild the Jessie Bernard Award, the citation observed her "creative genius for framing questions and lines of insight, often condensed into memorable, paradigm-shifting words and phrases."

''The Managed Heart'', ''The Second Shift,''   ''The Time Bind'',  and ''Strangers In Their Own Land'' have been  named "Notable Books of the Year" by ''The New York Times''.

[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-8889-2 ''The Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times''] was chosen by ''Publisher's Weekly'' as one of the "Best Books of 2012." The last chapter was [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/opinion/sunday/the-outsourced-life.html?pagewanted=all excerpted] in ''The New York Times'' (May 5, 2012).

Hochschild has received honorary doctoral degrees from [[Swarthmore College]]([[US]],) [[Aalborg University]] ([[Denmark]]), the [[University of Oslo]], ([[Norway]]), the [[University of Lapland]], ([[Finland]]),  [[Mount St. Vincent University]], ([[Canada]]), Westminster University ([[US]]) and University of Lausanne ([[Switzerland]]). 

==Legacy==

Within sociology she is known as the founder of the [[sociology of emotions|sociology of emotion]] and, outside of it, as a public sociologist, contributing to such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]'' op-ed page and ''[[New York Times Book Review|Book Review]]'', ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ The Washington Post],'' ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'', ''[[The American Prospect]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',  ''[[The Progressive]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. 

Concepts developed by Hochschild, such as "emotional labor," "feeling rules", the "economy of gratitude," and  "global care chains" have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines. Capturing some of the recent research and debate, a collection published in 2011, ''At the Heart of Work and Family: Engaging the Ideas of Arlie Hochschild'', critically explores some of her key concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=At the Heart of Work and Family: Engaging the Ideas of Arlie Hochschild|year=2011|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-4956-9|editor=Anita Ilta Garey and Karen V. Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another collection of papers devoted to her work is ''Pathways to Empathy: New Studies on Commodification, Emotional Labor and Time Binds'' (2013) edited by Gertraud Koch and Stephanie Everke Buchanan (Campus Verlag-Arbeit und Alltag, University of Chicago Press). The book is based on papers given at an "International Workshop in Honour of Hochschild" at [[Zeppelin University]],
Friedrichshafen, Germany (November 12–13, 2011). Her work appears in 16 languages.

'''Axel von dem Bussche''' (Baron Axel von dem Bussche-Streithorst; 24 April 1919 – 26 January 1993) was a German officer during [[World War II]] who was a member of the [[German Resistance]]. He planned to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] in coordination with [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] in November 1943 at the [[Wolfsschanze]].

==Army career==
Born in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], to his German father and to his Danish mother Jenny Lassen, he joined the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in 1937 at the age of 18 as a professional officer and was posted as a junior officer of the elite [[Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam]] (IR 9) to the eastern front in Poland. In 1942 Bussche witnessed by chance an [[SS]]-organised [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]] of more than 3,000 Jewish civilians carried out by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] at the old [[Dubno]] airport. This experience traumatized him all his life and was enough to turn him decidedly against Hitler. He joined an ''[[ad hoc]]'' resistance group within [[Army Group Centre]] later (September 1943) to be led by Count Stauffenberg. After this experience he declared that there were only three ways left to preserve his honor as an officer: to die in battle, to desert, or to rebel against the government that had ordered this and all other massacres. He chose the last option, justifying his intention to kill Hitler by his legal right to defend  others against unlawful, ongoing, criminal attacks.

==Resistance==
In November 1943, Bussche, personally encouraged by Count Claus Stauffenberg, undertook to carry out a [[suicide bombing]] to kill [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Hitler was due to inspect new Army winter uniforms at his ''Führerhauptquartier [[Wolfsschanze]]'', near [[Rastenburg]] in [[Eastern Prussia]] (today in Poland). Bussche, over two metres tall, blond and blue eyed, exemplified the looks of Hitler's "Nordic" racial ideal, and was an ideal model for the uniforms. Bussche equipped a [[landmine]] with a fast reacting hand grenade detonator, which he intended to hide in the deeper pockets of his uniform trousers. He planned to detonate this bomb while embracing Hitler, thus killing both Hitler and himself.

The viewing was scheduled for 16 November 1943, but the night before, the railway truck containing the new uniforms was destroyed in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raid on [[Berlin]]. On 18 November 1943, Bussche returned to his unit on the Eastern Front. He had spent three terrible nights at the Führerhauptquartier. Bussche volunteered to try again in February 1944, when new uniforms would be at hand. In January 1944, however, he was seriously wounded and lost one of his legs.

Another officer, Captain [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin|Ewald von Kleist]], volunteered to carry out the mission at a viewing on 11 February 1944. However Hitler repeatedly postponed and finally cancelled the event. Bussche spent many months in the [[Waffen-SS]] hospital in [[Lychen]] and so was not involved at all in the [[20 July plot]] to kill Hitler. Bussche's role in the earlier assassination plots was not suspected, and he was not betrayed by any of the officers who knew of his involvement. Consequently, he was one of the extremely few Army plotters to survive the war.

==After the war==
After the war, Bussche studied law at [[Göttingen]] University and later became a diplomat, serving from 1954 to 1958 in the [[Embassy of Germany, Washington, D.C.|German Embassy in Washington]]. Then he was headmaster of the [[Kurt Hahn]] boarding school "[[Schule Schloss Salem]]" located near [[Lake Constance]] in Southern-Germany. He was also a member of the presidency of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], an adviser to the [[World Bank]], and a delegate to the [[Stockholm]] [[UN]] environment conference of 1972.

In 1950, he married Lady Mildred Camilla Nichola Acheson, eldest daughter of [[Archibald Acheson, 5th Earl of Gosford|the 5th Earl of Gosford]] and Mildred Carter (of Virginia), who before had been married to Baron Hans Christoph Schenk von Stauffenberg. Bussche had two daughters with Lady Camilla, (Mrs.) Nicola Dietzsch-Doertenbach and Baroness Jane von dem Bussche.

'''Charles Frederick Houghton''' (27 April 1839 &amp;ndash; 13 August 1898) was a [[Canadian]] rancher, justice of the peace, politician and soldier.

==Military career==
Born in [[County Kilkenny]], [[Ireland]], he was commissioned into the [[57th Foot]] without purchase in 1855. In 1856 he was promoted [[lieutenant]] without purchase, and in 1858 he transferred into the [[5th Foot]]; a month later he transferred into the [[20th Foot]]. In 1861 he purchased a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captaincy]]. In 1863 he retired from the Army and emigrated to [[British Columbia]], Canada, settling in the [[Okanagan]] valley. Through a military land grant, he established [[Coldstream Ranch]] that year, later transferring title to fellow officers [[Forbes George Vernon]] and Charles Albert Vernon.

==Political career==
In 1865 and 1866, he led expeditions to explore the Gold Range through to the Columbia River mines. In 1866, he was appointed justice of the peace. After British Columbia entered [[Canadian confederation|confederation]] he was elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] for the riding of [[Yale (electoral district)|Yale District]] in 1871.

After being promoted to lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed deputy adjutant-general of the militia for Military District No.11 (British Columbia) in 1873.

In 1877, he commanded a force of 60 men, reinforced by infantry and artillery from [[New Westminster]] and the gunboat {{HMS|Grappler|1856|6}}, in a failed attempt to remove striking colliers from [[Robert Dunsmuir]]'s Wellington mine. Two years later, Houghton married Dunsmuir's daughter, Marion.

After his marriage and a half-year in Europe, Houghton was transferred to [[Manitoba]] where he organised the 90th (Winnipeg) Battalion of Rifles. He was passed over in favour of Major-General [[Frederick Dobson Middleton]] for command of the troops charged with suppressing the [[North-West Rebellion]].

'''Earl Manigault''' (September 7, 1944 – May 15, 1998) was an American [[Streetball|street basketball]] player who was nicknamed "The Goat."

==Early life==
Earl Manigault was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and raised in [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He grew up playing basketball and practiced constantly. With per game averages of 24 points and 11 rebounds, Manigault starred at Benjamin Franklin High School, a basketball powerhouse in the Public School Athletic League.&lt;ref name="slamonline.com"&gt;http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2010/06/king-of-kings/&lt;/ref&gt; Manigault set the NYC junior high school record by scoring 57 points in a game in the late 1950s. While attending high school, Manigault's life took a fateful turn when he began associating with groups that would eventually lead to his expulsion. He started using drugs and skipping classes. He was the star of his high school team and seemed destined for greatness in the [[National Basketball Association]].  Manigault was expelled from school for smoking [[marijuana]]. He finished high school at a private academy, [[Laurinburg Institute]], in North Carolina. In one year there, he averaged 31 points and 13 rebounds per game.&lt;ref name="slamonline.com"/&gt;

He enrolled in [[Johnson C. Smith University]], but left after one semester due to his constant problems with school and continuous quibbles with the coach.

The nickname "Goat" has several proposed origins. In an article for the ''New York Times'', Earl stated that he got the nickname because a junior high school teacher kept pronouncing his name ''Mani-Goat.'' Other theories state that by the time Manigault was in high school, he was known as "The Goat" because of his quiet demeanor. Another states that the nickname started by confusion over Manigault's last name; people thought Manigault referred to himself as Earl Nanny Goat, so he became "The Goat". However, the most popular belief is that he was called The Goat as the [[acronym]] for Greatest Of All Time. Although it is unclear how the name was dubbed, Greatest of All Time is the idea that lasted. The "[http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/happywarriorplayground/ Happy Warrior Playground]" on Amsterdam at West 99th Street in Manhattan is more commonly referred to as "Goat Park" where Manigault reigned.

He was mentored by [[Holcombe Rucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopshype.com/articles/rucker_mallozzi.htm|title=Asphalt gods|last=Mallozzi|first=Vincent M.|date=2003-06-29|publisher=hoopshype.com|accessdate=2008-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128140034/http://hoopshype.com/articles/rucker_mallozzi.htm|archivedate=2009-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and legends==
Manigault was particularly famous for his leaping abilities on the basketball court. However much of his legend is unsupported playground myth, including his signature move - the double dunk. He allegedly would dunk the ball, catch it with his left hand, switch the ball to his right hand, bring it back around to the top of the basket and jam it through again, all done while still in the air on a single jump, and without hanging on the rim.&lt;ref name="Beckham 1980"&gt;Beckham, Barry 1980. "Double Dunk, The Story of Earl 'the Goat' Manigault", Pages 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; However this is a story repeatedly told but unconfirmed. It was refuted by Manigault himself in a CNN interview available on YouTube when he called the reports of this feat rubbish, stating not even The Goat could do that. Like other street basketballers of the day such as [[Jumpin Jackie Jackson|Jackie Jackson]], Earl was reportedly able to touch the top of the backboard to retrieve quarters and dollar bills, part of "elaborate innovations and tricks" elite street players of the era performed before games to help build their reputations.&lt;ref name="Axethelm 1999"&gt;[[Pete Axthelm|Axthelm, Pete]] 1999. "The City Game: Basketball from the Garden to the Playgrounds"&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this has never been confirmed. Like the dunking myth, it is always referred to as "reportedly" without a credible source to support it. It is refuted in Todd Gallagher's book " Andy Roddick Beat Me With a Frying Pan."  The book dedicates an entire chapter to this myth concluding it was never done by Manigault or anyone else, including NBA stars. Gallagher writes " Earl "The Goat" Manigault is widely regarded as one of the greatest playground basketball players of all time. Although he never played in the NBA and only briefly played in college, the legend of Manigault has spread far and wide and led to his play being glorified in magazines, books, and even a movie starring [[Don Cheadle]] called ''[[Rebound: The Legend of Earl "The Goat" Manigault]]''. There are a number of tales regarding Manigault's prowess, but the central story that propelled his legend was that he had such extraordinary leaping ability he could pull dollar bills off the top of the backboard and leave change. What made this even more amazing was that Manigault was, depending on who one talks to, somewhere between 5-11 and 6-1. Considering that the top of the backboard is at thirteen feet and the average six-foot-tall man can only touch about eight feet high standing flat-footed, Manigault would have had to jump at least sixty inches to even come close. He was only 6' 1", but attributed his tremendous jumping ability to having in childhood often worn ankle weights during practice.  (Such efficacy of ankle weights is doubtful, however.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livestrong.com/article/317647-ankle-weights-make-jump-higher/&lt;/ref&gt; He once dunked two-handed during a game from near the foul line over two players much taller than himself (Sahil Muliyil 6'8", David Urenda 6'9").&lt;ref name="Axethelm 1999"/&gt; He once reverse dunked 36 times in a row to win a $60 bet.&lt;ref&gt;McShane, Larry 1998. Cager Legend, 'The Goat,' Dead. Sentinel, May 28, http://www.proquest.com/ (accessed December 22, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

But to prove dunking was not his only skill, he would practice hundreds of shots each day, making him a deadly long-range shooter as well. Manigault played with some of the best players of his day, such as [[Earl Monroe]], [[Connie Hawkins]], and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. When Abdul-Jabbar finished his career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and had his number retired at the Los Angeles Forum, he was asked who was the greatest player he had played with or against and he responded by saying Manigault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2010/06/king-of-kings/|title=King Of Kings|last=Mallozzi |first=Vincent M. |date=September 1995|publisher=SLAM Magazine|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earl is featured in the 2012 documentary film "Doin' it in the Park" about New York City street basketball.

==Later years==
Manigault returned to Harlem and developed a [[heroin]] addiction.  He served sixteen months in prison in 1969 and 1970 for drug possession. While incarcerated, Manigault was a subject in Pete Axthelm's book "The City Game," which came to the attention of [[Utah Stars]] owner Bill Daniels.

After he was released in 1970 at age 25, he hung in Lower Harlem, in and near the projects known as the [[Frederick Douglass Houses]], often with close friends who enjoyed his humor and friendship—friends like Sleepy Thomas, L. Byrd and so many others. Later he tried out for the [[Utah Stars]] of the [[American Basketball Association]], but he did not make the team and never played professionally. After shunning an offer from the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], Manigault started the Goat Tournament, a summer tourney that would feature NBA stars such as [[Bernard King]] and [[Mario Elie]]. Still, his drug habit reappeared and he served another term of two years from 1977 to 1979 for a failed robbery attempt so he could buy heroin. After this prison term in the [[Bronx House of Detention]] and [[Sing Sing]], Manigault quit heroin and moved to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] with his two youngest sons, far away from New York City and the temptation of drugs. In 1980, Manigault returned to New York and brought back the Goat Tournament. Never married, he started the "Walk Away From Drugs" tournament for kids in Harlem to prevent them from making the same mistakes he had made. Much of his later years were dedicated to working with kids on the court.

Manigault made a living by painting houses, mowing lawns, and working for the local recreation department. By the late 1980s, however, he was almost destitute, became frail, and suffered from serious heart problems. In February 1987, he had to have two heart operations. He became a counselor and coach at East Harlem's La Guardia Memorial House, working for New York's Supportive Children's Advocacy Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/earl-manigault&lt;/ref&gt;

Manigault is quoted in the New York Times article 'A Fallen King Revisits His Realm' as saying "For every Michael Jordan, there's an Earl Manigault. We all can't make it. Somebody has to fall. I was the one." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/sports/a-fallen-king-revisits-his-realm.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Fallen King Revisits His Realm |date=1989-06-16|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fawzi al-Qawuqji''' ({{lang-ar|فوزي القاوقجي}}; 19 January 1890 – 5 June 1977) was a leading Arab nationalist military figure in the interwar period,&lt;ref name="Achcar"&gt;The Arabs and the Holocaust: The Arab-Israeli War of Narratives, by Gilbert Achcar, (NY: Henry Holt and Co.; 2009), pp. 92: "Arab nationalism's leading military figure in the interwar period ... served as a commander in all the Arab national battles of the period."&lt;/ref&gt; based in Germany, and allied to Nazi Germany during [[World War II]], who served as the [[Arab Liberation Army]] (ALA) field commander during the [[1948 Palestine War]].

==Early life==
Fawzi al-Qawuqji was born in 1890 into a [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] family in the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], which was then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name = "Höpp, 1995"&gt;“Ruhmloses Zwischenspiel: Fawzi al-Qawuqji in Deutschland, 1941–1947,” by Gerhard Höpp in Peter Heine, ed., Al-Rafidayn: Jahrbuch zu Geschichte und Kultur des modernen Iraq (Würzburg: Ergon Verlag, 1995), (http://www.zmo.de/biblio/nachlass/hoepp/01_30_064.pdf) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|According to Basheer Nafi, Qawuji was born in [[Tripoli]], [[Ottoman Tripolitania]], in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Nafi, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; According to Time Magazine, Qawuji was born in [[Beirut]], [[Beirut Vilayet]], in 1895.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;Time, ''I Have Returned''&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

In 1912, he graduated from the military academy in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Höpp, 1995, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Achcar calls him "Arab nationalism's leading military figure in the interwar period... served as a commander in all the Arab national battles of the period."

==World War I==
He served as a captain (Yuzbashi) in the 12th Ottoman corps garrison in Mosul, and in several battles during the First World War, including at [[Battle of Qurna|Qurna]] in Iraq and at [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]] in Ottoman Palestine. He was decorated with the Ottoman Majidi Medal for his role in these battles.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He was also awarded the German Iron Cross, second class, for his service fighting alongside General Otto von Kreiss' Prussians, who had opposed the British in Palestine during World War I.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre"&gt;[[Larry Collins (writer)|Collins, Larry]] and [[Dominique Lapierre|Lapierre, Dominique]] (1972): [[O Jerusalem!]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], {{ISBN|0-671-66241-4}}., pp. 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar period==
The Ottoman Empire collapsed after World War I. Al-Qawuqji supported the independence of the short-lived  [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]]. In 1920, he fought at the [[Battle of Maysalun]], serving in the army of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] as a captain (''ra'is khayyal'') in a squadron commanded by [[Taha al-Hashimi]].

After the unsuccessful outcome of the campaign to establish the Arab Kingdom of Syria, [[Syria]] became a [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]]. Al-Qawuqji then joined the 'Syrian Legion' (also known as the [[Army of the Levant|French-Syrian Army]]) which had been created by the French mandatory authorities. Al-Qawuqji received formal training at the [[Third French Republic|French]] ''[[École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]''.&lt;ref name="Provence, 2005, pp. 95-–103"&gt;Provence, 2005, pp. 95-–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became commander of a cavalry squadron in [[Hama]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the [[Great Syrian Revolt|rebellion of 1925&amp;ndash;1927]], he deserted the [[French Army]] to join the rebellion, leading the [[1925 Hama uprising|uprising in Hama]] in early October 1925.&lt;ref name="Provence, 2005, pp. 95-–103"/&gt; al-Qawuqji remained an outlaw thereafter.&lt;ref name=Lyman&gt;Lyman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakib Arslan]] brought al-Qawuqji to the [[Hejaz]] to help train the army of Saudi monarch [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul-Aziz]]. Al-Qawuqji relates that he was unimpressed with Abdul-Aziz, depicting him as self-infatuated and suspicious, who disappointingly attempted to justify his collaboration with the British.&lt;ref&gt;"Achcar," p. 121n.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ALA-Qawuqji3rdright.jpg|thumb|Fawzi al-Qawuqji (3rd from the right) in 1936.]]

In 1936, al-Qawuqji began fighting the [[United Kingdom|British]] and the [[Yishuv|Jewish population]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] in actions that would become known as the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]]. He represented the Iraqi [[Society for the Defense of Palestine]], which was separate from forces under the control of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem [[Haj Amin Husseini]].&lt;ref&gt;Höpp, 1995, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qawuqji resigned his commission in the Iraqi army and his position at the Royal Military College to lead approximately fifty armed guerrillas into Mandatory Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;"Iraq Between the Two World Wars: The Militarist Origins of Tyranny," by Reeva Spector Simon, (New York: Columbia University Press; 2013), p. 65; p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In June he contacted [[Fritz Grobba]], who was acting as German ambassador to Iraq. This was probably al-Qawuqji's first encounter with a representative of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Höpp, 1995, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In August, he commanded about 200 volunteers from Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, and the Samaria region of Palestine. His title was 'Supreme Commander of the Arab Revolution in South-Syrian Palestine.'  He operated four units, (Iraqi, Syrian, [[Druze]] and Palestinian) in the [[Nablus]] - [[Tulkaram]] - [[Jenin]] triangle until the end of October. The military performance of al-Qawuqji's troops became hampered by internal dissensions and animosity between him and Grand Mufti Husseini, the [[Arab Higher Committee]], and the Mufti's kinsman [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]], who commanded forces that were active in the area around Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On 26 October 1936, al-Qawuqji crossed the Jordan River with his troops into Transjordan. A few weeks later he returned to Iraq.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Höpp, 1995, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although al-Qawuqji and Grand Mufti al-Husseini had periods of considerable friction and discord, particularly during the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; the two men subsequently reached a rapprochement. Al-Qawuqji followed the Mufti from Lebanon to Iraq in October 1939, along with other members of the Mufti's entourage, including [[Jamal al-Husayni]], [[Rafiq al-Tamimi]], and Sheikh [[Hasan Salama]]. Al-Qawuqji became the Mufti's military advisor in the 'Arab Committee' that Haj Amin Husseini formed in Baghdad. Husseini's group, including, al-Qawuqji, played critical roles in the pro-Axis coup.&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' by Jeffrey Herf (Yale University Press, 2009) {{ISBN|978-0-300-14579-3}}. p, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  His frequently demonstrated prowess won him fame among the Arab population and the esteem of Haj Amin Husseini. His popular following, however, was not altogether to the Mufti's liking.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, p 160"&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;  He was prominent in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] during the [[Rashid Ali]] [[Iraq coup (1941)|coup of 1941]] and, during the subsequent [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], he again fought against the British. Al-Qawuqji led approximately 500 "irregulars" in the area between Rutbah and Ramadi.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He established a reputation as bold fighter. He was also known to either execute or mutilate his prisoners.&lt;ref name="Lyman"/&gt;  After the Rashid Ali regime collapsed, al-Qawuqji and his irregular forces were targeted for destruction by the ''[[Mercol]]'' [[flying column]] and were chased out of Iraq. While still in Iraq, a British plane strafed and almost killed him.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

==World War II==

===Berlin===
After suffering serious wounds fighting the British in Iraq, al-Qawuqji was transported to [[Vichy France|Vichy French]]-held Syria, and then made his way to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=Lyman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained in Germany for the remainder of World War II, recuperated from his wounds, and married a German woman.&lt;ref&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, pp. 159, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qawuqji's sojourn in Germany has been the subject of considerable controversy.&lt;ref&gt;"Palestinian Arab National Movement, 1929 - 1939: From Riots to Rebellion," by Yehoshua Porath, (London: Cass; 1977), pp. 236, 237&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilbert Achcar]] recounts stories of conflicts during his Berlin period:

&lt;blockquote&gt; In his memoirs, he tells how, during his stay in hospital, he came under heavy pressure from German civilian and military officials to declare his allegiance to the führer. He even had an altercation with an SS officer who proffered threats when al-Qawuqji insisted that Germany first formally acknowledge the Arab's right to independence. The next day, his son died of poisoning. al-Qawuqji, convinced that the Nazis had murdered the young man, refused to take part in the funeral they organized.&lt;ref name="Achcar, p. 92"&gt;"Achcar," p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Achcar reports that al-Qawuqji was as bewildered by rivalries between competing Arab leaders (Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and exiled Iraqi former Prime Minister Rashid Ali) as by the Axis foot-dragging over support for Arab nationalist goals. He opposed incorporating Arab units into the Axis armed forces, since he preferred their formation into an independent Arab nationalist army.&lt;ref name="Achcar, p. 92"/&gt;

In May 1942, after the [[Axis powers]] signed secret documents to support the Arab nationalists, al-Qawuqji expressed dissatisfaction with the results, commenting that they were "just symbolic and not an agreement."&lt;ref&gt;"Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine." by Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cuppers, trans. by Krista Smith, (Enigma Books, published in association with the United States Holocaust Museum, NY; 2010), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Military Service===
He was awarded the rank of a colonel of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army), and given a captain to act as his aide, along with a chauffeured car, and an apartment near the clinic at Hansa. His expenses were paid by Wehrmacht High Command and by Rashid Ali's Foreign Minister. The Germans used al-Qawuqji's name and reputation extensively in their propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Höpp, 1995, p.16, "Der Syrer, dem der Rang eines Obersten der Wehrmacht verliehen worden war' ', erfreute sich eines Adjutanten im Hauptmannsrang und eines Dienstwagens mit Chauffeur sowie einer Wohnung in der Cuxhavenerstraße, nahe der Klinik am Hansaplatz; bezahlt wurde sein Aufenthalt aus einem Sonderfonds des Reichsaußenministers für al-Kaylani sowie durch das Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.' Der Name al-Qawuqji's war desweiteren fester Bestandteil der deutschen Propaganda', und er figurierte als Kandidat für einen "arabischen Führerrat", dessen Gründung das Auswärtige Amt Hitler vorschlug."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany al-Qawuqji continued to oppose the Allies in cooperation with other Arabs who were allied with the Axis powers, including the two competing leaders of the pro-Nazi Arab factions, Grand Mufti Husseini and former Iraqi Prime Minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. In June 1941, [[Wehrmacht]] High [[Führer Directive No. 30]] and the "Instructions for [[Special Staff F]]" (Sonderstab F) designated the Wehrmacht's central agency for all issues that affected the Arab world.  General der Flieger [[Hellmuth Felmy]], who was appointed central authority for all Arab affairs concerning the Wehrmacht under the terms of this "Directive No. 30", wrote about al-Qawuqji's 'active interest' and support of the military training of Arabs by the Nazis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus a number of the volunteers had already secretly contacted Fauzi Kaikyi, the Syrian army leader. After his escape by plane from the British, Fauzi had established himself in Berlin and begun to take an active interest in the Arabs at Sunium.&lt;ref name = "Felmy &amp; Warlimont"&gt;"German Exploitation of Arab Nationalist Movements in World War II" by Gen. Hellmuth Felmy and Gen. Walter Warlimont, Foreword by Generaloberst Franz Haider, Historical Division, Headquarters, United States Army, Europe, ''Foreign Military Studies Branch'', 1952, p.13, by Gen. Haider;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 1941 al-Qawuqji wrote a memorandum addressed to General Felmy.&lt;ref&gt;Mallmann &amp; Cuppers, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; This memorandum's subject was the need for German-Arab alliance in Iraq, and included discussions of geography, desert warfare, and combined propaganda efforts directed against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Mallmann &amp; Cuppers, p. 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Qawuqji was officially transferred to Sonderstab F after he was fully recovered from the wounds he received fighting against the British in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mallmann &amp; Cuppers, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Gen. Felmy's memoirs (written after the war when he was a prisoner of the allies and published by the US Army) mention the political conflicts between the 'chieftains' (Grand Mufti Husseini and former Iraqi Prime Minister Rashid Ali) among Arab receiving military training in Greece, and their consequent contact with al-Qawuqji.&lt;ref name = "Felmy &amp; Warlimont"/&gt; He consistently campaigned for the formation of an independent Arab nationalist army that would fight as German allies, rather than incorporate Arabs under the German command structure. On 4 September 1941 al-Qawuqji told a comrade in Syria "I will come with Arab and German troops to help you."&lt;ref&gt;Mallmann &amp; Cuppers, p. 85, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, he was captured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, and reportedly held prisoner until February 1947.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

==1948 Palestine War and Arab Liberation Army==
{{Main article|1948 Palestine War|Arab Liberation Army}}

===Arab League Field Commander===
In 1947 al-Qawuqji traveled to Egypt via France, and proclaimed that he was "at the disposition of the Arab people should they call on [him] to take up arms again."&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, pp. 160, 161"&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, pp. 160, 161&lt;/ref&gt;  In August he threatened that, should the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] vote go the wrong way, “we will have to initiate total war. We will murder, wreck and ruin everything standing in our way, be it English, American or Jewish"&lt;ref name="morris2008p61"/&gt;

After the UN Partition vote, the [[Arab League]] appointed him to be field commander of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) in the 1948 Palestine War. This appointment was opposed by Haj Amin Husseini, who had appointed his own kinsman [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] as the commander of the [[Army of the Holy War]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, pp. 156--163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gelber"&gt;"Palestine, 1948 : war, escape and the emergence of the Palestinian refugee problem," by Yoav Gelber, (Portland, OR : Sussex Academic Press; 2006), p. 46–48,51–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The execution of the 1948 Palestine War was marked by the personal, family, and political rivalry between al-Qawuqji (who fought mainly in northern Palestine) and al-Husayni, who fought mostly in the Jerusalem area.&lt;ref&gt;"One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate," by Tom Segev, (New York: Henry Holt and Co., LLC; 1999), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Palestine===
In early March 1948, al-Qawuqji moved some of his forces from the [[Damascus]] area and crossed (unmolested by British troops) into Palestine over the [[Allenby Bridge]], leading hundreds of Arab and Bosnian volunteers&lt;ref name="Gelber" /&gt; in a column of twenty-five trucks.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 206"&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; The British troops' inaction infuriated General Sir Gordon MacMillan, who stated that al-Qawudji should not be allowed "to go openly rampaging over territory in which Britain considered herself a sovereign power." General MacMillan did not want to confront al-Qawudji's force, however, since he saw "no point in getting a lot of British soldiers killed in that kind of operation."&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 206"/&gt;

Inside [[Mandatory Palestine]] al-Qawuqji commanded a few thousand armed men who had infiltrated the area. They were grouped into several regiments concentrated in Galilee and around Nablus.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 207"&gt;Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qawuqji told his troops that the purpose was "ridding Palestine of the Zionist plague".&lt;ref name="morris2008p61"/&gt; According to Collins and LaPierre, he anticipated a short campaign, and announced: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have come to Palestine to stay and fight until Palestine is a free and united Arab country or until I am killed and buried here," ... His aim, he declared, borrowing the slogan that was becoming the leitmotiv of the Arab leadership, was "to drive all the Jews into the sea."&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Lapierre, p. 207"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mishmar HaEmek===
[[File:Kaukji-armored-car-1948.jpg|thumb|An [[Otter Light Reconnaissance Car|Otter]] armored car captured by the [[Haganah]] from the ALA (Arab Liberation Army- Kaukji's army) on 1948. The car still carries the ALA emblem, a dagger stabbing a Star of David.]]
In April 1948, the ALA mounted a major attack on the kibbutz [[Battle of Mishmar HaEmek|Mishmar HaEmek]] which sat near the strategic road that connected [[Haifa]] to [[Jenin]], and was surrounded by Arab villages.&lt;ref&gt;Morris,2008, pp. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 April al-Qawuqji initiated the first use of artillery during the war by directing his seven 75 and 105&amp;nbsp;mm field guns to fire on the kibbutz for a 36-hour barrage. During this battle al-Qawuqji issued a number of announcements that were subsequently proven false. In the first 24-hours he announced victory, on 8 April he announced he had taken Mishmar HaEmek, and after the battle was lost he claimed the Jews had been assisted by non-Jewish Soviet troops and bombers. Copies of these mendacious telegrams are preserved in the Jordanian archives.&lt;ref&gt;"The War for Palestine," by Eugene L. Rogan and Avi Shlaim, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2007), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The Haganah and [[Palmach]] counter-attacked and the ALA were routed. The battle was over by 16 April, and most of the Arabs in the area fled, disheartened by the defeat of the ALA or demoralized by the Jewish victory. The remaining minority were expelled from the surrounding Arab villages by Jewish forces.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2008, pp. 133--137.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Qawuqji.jpg|thumb|Fawzi al-Quawuqji 24th May 1948]]
In July, al-Qawuqji launched a rolling offensive of counterattacks, focusing on [[Ilaniya]] (Sejera), a Jewish settlement deep in ALA territory. Although he deployed armored cars and a battery of 75&amp;nbsp;mm artillery to support the ALA infantry, his troops suffered from lack of artillery ammunition and host of other deficiencies. The opposing [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] Twelfth Battalion withstood the attack, inflicting heavy losses on the ALA. The battle ended on 18 July, with the ALA losing the Arab village of Lubiya, which had been their main base in Central Eastern Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2008, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Hiram===
The ALA established control of upper central Galilee, from the [[Sakhnin]]–Arabe–[[Deir Hanna]] line through [[Majd al-Krum]] up to the Lebanese border until October 1948. On 22 October, the date of the third [[UN]] Security Council cease-fire order, the ALA attacked Sheikh Abd,a hilltop overlooking [[Kibbutz]] [[Manara, Israel|Manara]] and put the kibbutz under siege. Al-Qawudji told the UN observers that he demanded depopulation of nearby Kibbutz [[Yiftah]] forces, and a diminution of the Jewish forces in Manara. The Jewish forces responded by demanding that ALA withdraw from its positions. Al-Qawuqji rejected these counter-demands. The Jewish forces then informed the United Nations that in view of al-Qawuqji's actions it did not feel encumbered by the UN's cease-fire order, and on 24 October launched [[Operation Hiram]]. Historian Benny Morris concludes that although the Israelis had planned for Operation Hiram, they may not have launched this campaign without the justification provided by al-Qawuqji's military provocations.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2008, p.339, "al-Qawuqji supplied the justification for Operation Hiram, in which the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] overran the north-central Galilee “pocket” and a strip of southern Lebanon...Operation Hiram had been long in the planning...on 6 October, at the IDF General Staff meeting, Carmel had pressed for [Hiram] authorization, But the Cabinet held back. The Arabs were shortly to give him his chance. Before dawn on 22 October, in defiance of the UN Security Council cease-fire order, ALA units stormed the IDF hilltop position of Sheikh Abd, just north of, and overlooking, Kibbutz [[Manara, Israel|Manara]], …. (which) was imperiled....Ben-Gurion initially rejected Carmel’s demand to launch a major counteroffensive. He was chary of antagonizing the United Nations so close on the heels of its cease-fire order. … The kibbutz was now besieged, and the main south-north road through the Panhandle to Metulla was also under threat. During the 24–25 October ALA troops regularly sniped at Manara and at traffic along the main road. In contacts with UN observers, al-Qawuqji demanded that Israel evacuate ... The IDF demanded the ALA’s withdrawal from the captured positions and, after a 'no' from al-Qawuqji, informed the United Nations that it felt free to do as it pleased. Sensing what was about to happen, the Lebanese army 'ordered' al-Qawuqji to withdraw from Israeli territory—but to no avail. Al-Qawuqji’s provocation at Sheikh Abd made little military sense,...On 16 October, a week before the attack on Sheikh Abd, Carmel … had pressed Ben-Gurion to be allowed 'to begin in the Galilee.' Ben- Gurion had refused But on 24–25 October he gave the green light"&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that the ALA were driven from their positions by force, and the Arab forces lost all of upper Galilee, even though this had been assigned to the Arabs by the UN Partition Plan. On 30 October the Jewish [[Carmeli Brigade]] retook Sheikh Abd from the ALA, who had abandoned the position. Shortly thereafter the last of the ALA forces were driven out of the [[Galilee]] and al-Qawuqji escaped to Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2008, pp. 330--339; see especially p. 339: "IDF Northern Front OC Moshe Carmel was later to write that al-Qawuqji’s provocation had been like “a match that ignited . . . [the] fire . . . in a dry, yellow field . . . but the fire quickly rose . . . [and] turned on him and he was unable to douse it.” In truth ...Operation Hiram had been long in the planning."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, al-Qawuqji moved to Syria and lived in Damascus, [[Beirut]] and Tripoli.

'''Francis Schlatter''' (1856–c. 1896) was an Alsatian [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] who, because of miraculous cures attributed to him, became known as the Healer.

==Biography==
Schlatter was born in the village of [[Ebersheim, Bas-Rhin]], near [[Sélestat]], in [[Alsace]] on April 29, 1856.  In 1884 he [[emigration|emigrated]] to the United States, where he worked at his trade in various cities, arriving in [[Denver, Colorado]], in 1892.  There, a few months later, he experienced a vision at his cobbler's bench in which he heard the voice of the Father commanding him to sell his business, give the money to the poor, and devote his life to healing the sick.  He then undertook a two-year, 3,000-mile walking pilgrimage around the American West which took him across eastern Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and then to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], where he was arrested and jailed for vagrancy.  In early 1894 he escaped and headed west, walking across Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona and into southern California, where he began his first efforts at healing with the Indians of the [[San Jacinto Valley]].  After two months, he again took up his pilgrimage and traveled east across the [[Mojave Desert|Mohave Desert]], living on nothing but flour and water.  In July 1895 he emerged as a Christlike healer in the Rio Grande villages south of Albuquerque. There, while treating hundreds of sick, suffering, and disabled people who flocked to Albuquerque's Old Town, he became famous.  Crowds gathered about him daily, hoping to be cured of their diseases simply by clasping his hands.  The following month he returned to Denver, but did not resume his healings until mid-September.  During the next few weeks, his ministry drew tens of thousands of pilgrims to a small home in North Denver.  Schlatter is said to have refused all rewards for his services.  His manner of living was of the simplest, and he taught no new [[doctrine]].  He said only that he obeyed a power which he called Father, and from this power he received his healing [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;All of the information in this paragraph can be found in ''The Life of the Harp in the Hand of the Harper'' (Denver: Privately printed, 1897), copyrighted by the book's compiler, Ada Morley Jarrett. Only a few copies of the original exist; however, in 1989 [[Norman Cleaveland]] published ''The Healer: The Story of Francis Schlatter'' (Santa Fe, NM: Sunstone Press), which incorporates the original material.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of November 13, 1895, he suddenly disappeared, leaving behind him a note in which he said that his mission was ended.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocky Mountain News'' (Denver), 15 November 1895, and ''New York Times,'' 15 November 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, in 1897 news came out of Mexico that the healer's bones and possessions had been found on a mountainside in the Sierra Madre.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocky Mountain News,'' 7 June 1897, and ''New York Times,'' 7 June 1897.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, a New Mexico woman named Ada Morley published a book called ''The Life of the Harp in the Hand of the Harper'' which told of the healer's three-month retreat on her ranch in [[Datil, New Mexico]], after his disappearance from Denver.  The book, which carried the title the healer gave it, also contained a first-person description of his two-year pilgrimage, which he believed held the same significance for mankind as Christ's forty days in the wilderness.  On departing the Morley ranch, Schlatter told Morley that God intended to establish [[New Jerusalem]] in the Datil Mountains, and the healer promised to return at that time.  In the wake of the healer's death, several men claiming to be Francis Schlatter made headlines around the country in 1909, 1916, and 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Newspapers across the U.S. covered these events, but they can all be found in the ''New York Times,'' 22 October 1909, 28 May 1916, and 18 October 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francis Schlatter. "Treating in the rain".tif|thumb|Schlatter standing in center, healing man as other people wait in line or observe from sidelines. 1895]]
In [[August Strindberg]]´s autobiographical novel ''[[Inferno (Strindberg)|Inferno]]'' Francis Schlatter is mentioned as a [[doppelgänger]] of another man Strindberg met in [[Paris]] in 1896, the year after Schlatter disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tB73O83CZRkC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=francis+schlatter+strindberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zra-cphivJ&amp;sig=B7VJwMbvXKpmx3owEWcGRa6Jc5w&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=Uz_lSp-PB9LJ-QailfzICQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false August Strindberg: ''The Inferno'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was afraid of Schlatter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/strindbergandhi00strigoog#page/n14/mode/1up Internet archive: ''Strindberg and his plays'']&lt;/ref&gt; The "double"  turned out to be Paul Herrmann, a German-American painter.&lt;ref&gt;Evert Sprinchorn, ed., August Strindberg, ''Inferno, Alone, and Other Writings'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday/Anchor Books, 1968), 156–57, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Healer's Copper Rod==

In 1906 [[Edgar Lee Hewett]], who became a noted archaeologist and museum director, was conducting research near [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]], Mexico, when his Mexican guide pointed out an unmarked grave. Ten years before, the guide said, he had come across the body of a dead man following a blizzard. From the guide's description, Hewett surmised that the dead man the guide had come across was Francis Schlatter, whom Hewett had met and whose healing sessions he observed in 1895. Hewett asked if any of the man's possessions had survived. The guide led him to the home of the ''jefe'' of Casas Grandes, and there Hewett saw Schlatter's Bible, saddle, and copper rod—which had become a mysterious hallmark of the healer from the time of his disappearance. Years later, in 1922, Hewett returned to Mexico and examined the copper rod again. By now the director of the School of American Research (now the [[School for Advanced Research]]) and the [[Museum of New Mexico]], he showed interest in the rod and made a donation to the village of Casas Grandes to hire a teacher. Back in Santa Fe, a few weeks later, he received a heavy, burlap-wrapped package, and inside was Francis Schlatter's copper rod. He placed the rod in the collections of the two institutions he directed, which shared space in the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe, N.M. Today the rod lies in the collections of the New Mexico History Museum in the Palace of the Governors.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar L. Hewett, ''Campfire and Trail'' (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1943), 69–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death and Imposters ==

Almost immediately after reports came out of Mexico announcing the healer's death, skepticism arose. Ada Morley, who had visited at length with Schlatter during his three-month stay at her ranch in New Mexico in early 1896, had her doubts. "The men who found the skeleton declared to have been [Schlatter's]," she said, "say it was resting as though it had never been disturbed. I know the coyotes would never have left it so if it had ever lain there bearing flesh."&lt;ref&gt;''Rocky Mountain News'' (Denver), June 12, 1897&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' expressed doubts as well. "It does not appear that the human remains were actually identified as Schlatter's," the newspaper stated on June 19, 1897, "or that any identification was possible." However, the presence of the healer's possessions at the scene, especially his copper rod, convinced most people otherwise.

Over the next twenty-five years, several men arose claiming to be Francis Schlatter. One, a Presbyterian minister named Charles McLean, died in Hastings, Nebraska, in 1909, creating a controversy between skeptics and believers.&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Post'', October 21, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; Two others, August Schrader and Jacob Kunze, who formed a healing team that operated between 1908 and 1917, were arrested and jailed in 1916 for mail fraud.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' October 29, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; A final so-called imposter died in St. Louis, Missouri, in October 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''Denver Post,'' October 29, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the twentieth century, a renewed interest in Schlatter brought with it speculation about the claim of the healer who had died in St. Louis. Most recently, ''The Vanishing Messiah: The Life and Resurrections of Francis Schlatter'' (2016), argues that the healer conspired to stage his death in the mountains of Mexico and returned to the United States to continue healing in the eastern and southern parts of the country until his death in St. Louis in 1922. [http://www.vanishingmessiah.com The Vanishing Messiah] This author's claim rests in part on the discovery of a largely forgotten autobiography in the Library of Congress entitled ''Modern Miracles of Healing: A True Account of the Life, Works and Wanderings of Francis Schlatter, the Healer'', attributed to "Francis Schlatter, The Alsacian," and published in 1903.

'''Frane Selak''' (born June 14, 1929)&lt;ref name=TS/&gt; is a [[Croatia]]n man who has allegedly [[Cheating death|escaped death]] seven times, and afterward won the lottery in 2003, prompting journalists to dub him "the world's luckiest man",&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt; and "world's luckiest unluckiest man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sploid.gizmodo.com/meet-the-worlds-luckiest-unluckiest-man-who-cheated-dea-1570676489/all Meet the world's luckiest unluckiest man who cheated death 7 times - Sploid.Gizmodo 01.05.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brushes with death==
Selak's brushes with death started in January 1962 when he was riding a train through a cold, rainy canyon and the train flipped off the tracks and crashed in a river. Someone pulled Selak to safety, while 17 other unfortunate passengers drowned.&lt;ref name=der&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-27390339.html|title=Stirb langsam |first=Hauke|last=Goos|language=German|trans-title=Die Hard|date=16 June 2003|accessdate=24 April 2014|work=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selak suffered a broken arm and [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt; The next year, during his first and only plane ride, he was blown out of a malfunctioning plane door and landed in a [[haystack]]; the plane crashed, killing 19 people.&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt; However, there is no report of any plane crash in Croatia in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1963/1963.htm PlaneCrashInfo.com listing for all crashes worldwide in 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search-result/?type=crash&amp;display=entry&amp;year_post=1963&amp;continent=0&amp;country=209508&amp;zone=0&amp;pavillon=0&amp;aircraft=0&amp;operator=0&amp;cause=0&amp;et_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives search for crashes in Croatia in 1963] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214835/http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search-result/?type=crash&amp;display=entry&amp;year_post=1963&amp;continent=0&amp;country=209508&amp;zone=0&amp;pavillon=0&amp;aircraft=0&amp;operator=0&amp;cause=0&amp;et_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess |date=May 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9A Aviation Safety Network search for all plane crashes in Croatia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015104725/http://aviation-safety.net/database/country/country.php?id=9A |date=October 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years after that, in 1966, a bus that he was riding skidded off the road and into a river, drowning four passengers. Selak swam to shore with a few cuts and bruises.&lt;ref name=Hough&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough|first=Andrew|title=Frano Selak: 'world's luckiest man' gives away his lottery fortune|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7721985/Frano-Selak-worlds-luckiest-man-gives-away-his-lottery-fortune.html|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 his car caught fire as he was driving and he managed to escape before the fuel tank blew up. Three years later, in another driving incident, the engine of his car was doused with hot oil from a malfunctioning [[fuel pump]], causing flames to shoot through the air vents. Selak's hair was completely singed in this incident, but he was otherwise unharmed. In 1995, he was struck by a bus in [[Zagreb]], but sustained only minor injuries. In 1996 he eluded a head-on collision with a [[United Nations]] truck on a mountain curve by swerving into a [[traffic barrier|guardrail]], which gave way under the force of his car; he was ejected from the car when the door flew open, (he wasn't wearing a seatbelt) managed to hold onto a tree, and watched his car plummet down {{convert|90|m|-1}} into a gorge.&lt;ref name=Hough /&gt;&lt;ref name=der/&gt;

==Lottery winner==
In 2003, two days after his 73rd birthday,&lt;ref name=der/&gt; Selak won [[euro sign|€]]800,000 (US$1,110,000) (£702,920) in the lottery.&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt;&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{cite news|title=Fortune smiles on unluckiest man|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/fortune-smiles-on-unluckiest-man-1-652456|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=18 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his win, he also married for the fifth time.&lt;ref name=Hough/&gt; While he purchased two houses and a boat with his winnings,&lt;ref name=der/&gt; in 2010 he decided to give most of the remaining money away to relatives and friends after deciding to live a frugal lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Hough /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Kearton was born to Christopher John Kearton, a bricklayer, and Lilian (née Hancock) in Congleton, [[Cheshire]]; although the family moved to Tunstall in the [[Staffordshire Potteries|Potteries]] not long after his birth. He completed his secondary education at Hanley High School before going up to [[St John's College, Oxford]] in 1929 as an [[exhibitioner|open exhibitioner]] to read [[Chemistry]]. He graduated with a First in 1933 although he did not apply for the promotion of his BA to an [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|MA]] until 1959.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

==Marriage==

Three years after leaving Oxford, on 16 April 1936, he married Kathleen Agnes (née Kay) whom he had met when at school through playing tennis. She had completed a French degree at [[Bedford College, London]] and was a teacher at Morecambe Grammar School. The couple later had two sons and two daughters.

Lord Kearton died from cancer on 2 July 1992 at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] and was buried at [[Whitchurch, Buckinghamshire|Whitchurch]]. He left an estate, according to probate of 14 August 1992, of £337,670.

==Other appointments==

Kearton was made an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] (DSc) by the [[University of Bath]] in 1966 when [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Lord Hinton]] was appointed the university's first Chancellor. Kearton himself was appointed Chancellor of the university in 1980 and, according to [[Norman Wooding|Sir Norman Wooding]], was a "notably active member of the University." He was still in office as Chancellor upon his death in 1991.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

'''Friederike Hauffe''' (born '''Friederike Wanner''', 23 September 1801 – 25 August 1829), also known as '''Frederica Hauffe''', or the '''Seeress of Prevorst''', was a German [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] medium, [[Mysticism|mystic]] and [[Sleepwalking|somnambulist]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, Vanessa D. (1996). ''Victorian Ghosts in the Noontide: Women Writers and the Supernatural''. University of Missouri Press. pp. 31-32. {{ISBN|0-8262-1081-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, Joscelyn]]. (2015). ''Upstate Cauldron: Eccentric Spiritual Movements in Early New York State''. State University of New York. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-5595-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Hauffe was born in [[Prevorst]], a small village "In [[Duchy of Württemberg|Wirtemberg]], near the town of [[Löwenstein]], on those mountains whose highest point, the Stocksberg, is raised 1879 feet above the level of the sea, surrounded on all sides by hill and valley, and in a romantic seclusion...`with] something more than 400 inhabitants, the greatest number of whom maintain themselves by woodcutting, coalburning, and collecting the productions of the forest". Her father was a gamekeeper or district forester. She grew up physically healthy, as opposed to her sisters who were afflicted in their childhood with "[[gout]]", according to the physician [[Justinus Kerner]] in his book about her. 

At a very early age, it was alleged she had "premonitory dreams" and could point out "metals and water with the hazel wand". She was later, unclear at what age, given into the care of her grandmother and grandfather Johann Schmidgall in [[Löwenstein]]. He recognized what was described as "sensibility to spiritual influences". Later, her parents took her back to the secluded village of Prevorst, until the family moved to [[Oberstenfeld]]. She lived there from age 17 until 19. At age 19 her parents arranged that she became engaged to a Gottlieb Hauffe, who belonged to her uncle's family. In 1821 on the same day as her wedding, the funeral of the minister of Oberstenfeld took place, a more than 60-year-old man who had had great spiritual influence on her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinus Kerner|Kerner, Justinus]]. (1845 edition). [https://archive.org/details/seeressofprevors00kern ''The Seeress of Prevorst: Being Revelations Concerning the Inner-Life of Man, and the Inter-Diffusion of a World of Spirits in the One We Inhabit'']. London, J. C. Moore.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her marriage, she lived at [[Kürnbach]]. She died in Löwenstein.

==Investigations==
Hauffe had suffered from [[convulsion]]s, and fell into spontaneous [[trance]]s. She claimed to have communicated with [[spirit]]s and experienced visions. Hauffe was made famous by the physician [[Justinus Kerner]] who examined her at [[Weinsberg]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A.]] (1990). ''They Call it Hypnosis''. Prometheus Books. pp. 218-220. {{ISBN|978-0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described her trances in his book ''Die Seherin von Prevorst'' (1829). She spent much of her time in a state of somnambulism. Kerner recorded alleged instances of clairvoyance and [[prophetic dream]]s. However, psychical researcher [[Frank Podmore]] noted that the "evidence is in all cases inconclusive, and sometimes indicative of collusion with members of the Seeress's family."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1909). ''Mesmerism and Christian Science: A Short History of Mental Healing''. Philadelphia: G. W. Jacobs. pp. 214-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 17, 1933 and December 15, 1933, Dr. C.G. Jung gave 5 lectures at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) on Mrs. Hauffe's case, taken from a psychiatric and psychological perspective.  He noted: "Her case illustrates the utmost introversion, in that everything moves inward.  Everything in her has been cut off from our reality; indeed she defended herself against the outer world." Dr. Jung also mentioned Dr. Kerner's observation of malnutrition, including scurvy, which was common in the early 19th Century in rural Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9110">'''Gary Stadler''' is an American [[New-age music|new-age]] pianist, composer, songwriter and producer, specializing in contemporary [[Celtic music|Celtic-influenced]] themes and atmospheres. Stadler's six albums generally focus on imaginative concepts loosely based in [[Celtic mythology]], especially stories of the realm of [[Fairy|Faerie]].  His music combines melodic elements of rare world instruments, mastery of synthesizer orchestrations and studio techniques. Three of his albums feature collaborations with vocalists [[Singh Kaur]], [[Stephannie]] and [[Wendy Rule]].

Stadler's third album, ''Fairy Heartmagic'' was listed on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard's]] New Age Top 25 chart for four weeks in year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Magazine, April 28, 2001 through May 17, 2001, chart position # 24 on Top 25 New Age Albums&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of his songs have been featured on compilations on multiple record labels in the USA and Europe.

Stadler is the brother of professional golfer [[Craig Stadler]].

==Background and artistic development==

Stadler knew at an early age that music would play a major role in his life. In school, in his hometown of San Diego, he learned to play the piano and most of the other instruments in the orchestra. When asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he always replied, "I want to be an orchestra conductor!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sequoiarecords.com/bio-gary-stadler.html Gary Stadler bio on Sequoia Records website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 he wrote two songs, "Dream Spell" and "Awakening", for a play produced and performed in San Diego entitled ''The Goblin's Bride'', based on Celtic myths of the realm of Faerie.  Those songs were the genesis of his first album, ''Fairy of the Woods'',  released by Sequoia Records in 1996, and well received by the alternative market of independent [[New Age]] bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;''New Age Voice Magazine'' wrote in August 1996: 'Strong and compelling melodies and lovely synth orchestral settings make Gary Stadler's ''Fairy of the Woods'' a magical charmer. Stadler's melodies and arrangements are classically structured, but his orchestrations offer a colorful imagination the opportunity to inhabit the auld Celtic realms of fairies and wizards, glens and caves, fireflies and stardust.'&lt;/ref&gt;

Stadler found a loyal audience who stayed with him as he added vocals and moved into a more acoustic direction on his second album released in 1998, ''Fairy NightSongs'', featuring the lyrics and exquisite voice of recording artist [[Singh Kaur]], already known to New Age listeners for her ''Crimson Series'' of  recordings featuring harpist [[Kim Robertson (musician)|Kim Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Ryals wrote in ''New Age Retailer'', August 1998: 'Kaur and Stadler bring the healing mystery of the fairy folk to life. Kaur's voice soars like fairies dancing on gentle night breezes, with lyrics and pure vocalizations. Stadler composed most of the music and contributed string bass and cello to his keyboards and piano. The 16-page cover booklet is filled with entrancing art and complete lyrics. Fairy Night Songs is absolutely exquisite from beginning to end.'&lt;/ref&gt;

For his third record, Stadler collaborated with [[Stephannie]], a young vocalist and songwriter with a unique talent — by recalling her dreams she composed lyrics in a form of [[glossolalia]] she referred to as a new language of Celtic fantasy. Joined by the well-known Celtic harpist [[Lisa Lynne]], Stadler's third album, ''Fairy HeartMagic'',  was released on Sequoia Records in October 2000, recognized on Billboard's New Age Top 25.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Magazine, April 28, 2001 through May 17, 2001, chart position # 24 on Top 25 New Age Albums&lt;/ref&gt; The song ''Fairy NightSongs'' from this album was awarded [[JPF (music)|JPF]] Best New Age/World song of 2004 following its appearance on a compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpfolks.com/MusicAwards/index.html JPF Awards 2004 by genre at the Galaxy Concert Theatre November 7, 2004 in Santa Ana, CA]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of Stadler's CD to be enhanced with a CD-ROM session that offers two bonus songs in MP3 format and additional artwork for computer display.  All of Stadler's later albums featured similar enhancements.

Stadler's fourth album, ''Reflections of Faerie'', in 2003 returned to instrumental pieces reminiscent of his first release but with a deeper and more intimate feel, mostly solo piano, with some featured harp artistry of [[Lisa Lynne]].   In 2004, for his fifth release ''Deep Within a Faerie Forest'', Stadler collaborated with singer/composer [[Wendy Rule]] of Australia. This recording once again delves deep into the depths of the mystical Faerie realms with intriguing lyrics and unusual instrumentation.  His sixth album, ''Faerie Lullabies'' was a retrospective produced in 2006 in which he chose the most peaceful and comforting pieces from his earlier releases and re-recorded them in the form of instrumental lullabies, intended for both children and their parents.

Stadler's song "Fairy of the Woods" was featured on the sound track of ''A Magickal Life: Jeff McBride'', produced and broadcast by Canada's [[VisionTV]], a one-hour episode of their series ''Enigma True-Life Stories'' in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visiontv.ca/Enigma/enigma_release.html VisionTV Enigma documentary series]&lt;/ref&gt;  His former wife Tamara contributed lyrics to his albums as well as the albums of fellow Vegas Vortex musical group [[Zingaia]], also featured in the same documentary program.

==Album artwork==

The artwork on the first two of  Stadler's six albums was created by San Diego artist [[Scott Thom]], known for his original airbrush paintings coveted by collectors and his line of New Age greeting cards. Las Vegas artist Katlyn Breene of [[Zingaia]] (who also wrote some of the lyrics on ''[[Fairy NightSongs]]'' and ''[[Fairy HeartMagic]]'') created the artwork for Stadler's remaining albums.

==Broad interests==

In addition to his musical talents, Stadler's interests and skills are widely varied.  He has spent the majority of his business life as an electronics design engineer with emphasis on laser system design.  His love for automobile mechanics won him 1st place in the San Diego Plymouth Troubleshooting contest, continuing on to win 4th place in the national Plymouth Troubleshooting contest.  His interests include technical and historical [[glassblowing]] — he currently specializes in the manufacture of distillation equipment for [[essential oil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alchemyconference.com/bios.htm International Alchemy Conference presenter bios]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is known for his expertise in [[stage lighting]] and [[laser lighting display|laser art]] (one of his first careers), producing "wet" light shows and laser light shows in the 1970s and 1980s, owning and operating an electronic design/manufacturing company from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, and winning a Technical Achievement Oscar for innovations in the film lighting industry in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1994 IMDb: Academy Awards, USA: 1994&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has used these skills in the creation of innovative temporary [[art installation]]s at the [[Burning Man]] festivals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartmagic.com/inner_mind.html Photos of Stadler's Burning Man installation, August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; events produced by the [[Vegas Vortex]], and stage magic productions of [[Jeff McBride]].

==Early life==
He was born on 24 June 1938 in [[Najafabad]], [[Isfahan]]. After spending time in studying elementary and secondary schools in Najafabad, He moved to [[Tehran]] for higher education and was graduated from [[University of Tehran]]. He was a classmate with [[Abulhassan Banisadr]]. He was journalist from 1958 to 1965 and was worked in [[Ettela'at]].

==Career==
Ayat was a member of [[Zahmatkeshan Party]] before [[Iranian Revolution]] but resigned from the party. Ayat joined the [[Islamic Republican Party]] and became a member of its central committee.&lt;ref name=jplaw&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Asayesh,Hossein. Adlina Ab. Halim, Jayum A.

After that, Ayat was elected as a member of [[Parliament of Iran|Parliament]] from [[Tehran]]. He was one of the main leaders in impeachment of [[President of Iran|President]] [[Abulhassan Banisadr]]. He was opposed to the election of [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] as [[Prime Minister of Iran|prime minister]] because he believed that [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] was a freemasonry agent who had penetrated in the political structure of [[the Islamic Republic of Iran]] to attempt the subversion of the Islamic government when the time is ripe.{{fact|date=August 2018}} It is often stated that he was to submit to the officials the hard evidence he had gathered against Mousavi and his wife Zahra Rahnavard.{{fact|date=August 2018}} He was killed when he was on his way to submit the hard evidence by some in front of his house and the hard evidence is said to have been stolen in order to keep Mousavi from being removed forever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arashmag.com/content/view/280/46/ Why I didn't voted?, Hashem Sabbaghian]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Polish Righteous among the Nations}}
'''Jerzy and Irena Krępeć''', a [[Poles|Polish]] husband and wife, living in [[Ursus (district in Warsaw)|Gołąbki]] near [[Warsaw]] during [[Nazi German]] [[occupation of Poland]] in [[World War II]], were the Righteous who rescued Polish [[Jew]]s with families including refugees from the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto in Warsaw]] during the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;Peggy Curran, [http://polish-jewish-heritage.org/eng/august_03_pole.htm  "Pole to be honoured for sheltering Jews from Gestapo,"] Reprinted by the Canadian Foundation of Polish-Jewish Heritage, Montreal Chapter. Station Cote St.Luc, C. 284, Montreal QC, Canada H4V 2Y4. First published: [[Montreal Gazette]], August 5, 2003, and: Montreal Gazette, December 10, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ceremonies ==

Jerzy and Irena Krępeć were bestowed the titles of [[Righteous among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] on April 18, 1994.&lt;ref name="YV"&gt;[http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/family.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4034979 Jerzy and Irena Krępeć] - their activity to save Jews' lives during the [[Holocaust]], at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Their medals of honor were presented to a widowed Irena Krępeć by the Israeli [[Consul general|Consul General]] in [[Canada]] Daniel Gal, during the ceremony at the Israeli consulate in [[Montreal]], on December 12, 1995 in the presence of the Polish Consul General Małgorzata Dzieduszycki, and the French and English press.

Daniel Gal explained in his speech that the Holocaust survivors pleaded on behalf of the entire Krępeć family with all its members and that Yad Vashem honored Jerzy and Irena first. Subsequently, their son, Tadeusz living in Montreal, and Jerzy’s two sisters, Eugenia Krępeć–Muszyński and Alina (Halina) Krępeć–Tyszka, were recognized as Righteous in May and November 2002, with more testimonies by their Jewish countrymen. The ceremony was written about in 12 newspaper articles in three languages. "My father never sought recognition or compensation for what he did," said André Krepec — the eldest son of Tadeusz Krepec — who attended the forum together with his widowed mother Halina, three brothers, sister, and their families. "For him, it was just a question of human values…"&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;

== The rescuers and the rescued ==

Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, Jerzy Krępeć (1896–1981) and Irena ''née '' Adamus (1906–17.11.1999),&lt;ref name="NW"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.nekrologi-baza.pl/nazw/str_k17.html Nekrologi warszawskie: Gazeta Wyborcza, Gazeta Stołeczna, Życie Warszawy, Trybuna, etc.]&lt;/ref&gt; were forced out by the Nazis from their estate near [[Płock]]. They moved to Gołąbki near Warsaw with their three children: Tadeusz (14), Krystyna (13) and Maria (9), and rented a farm called Osada not far from where Irena’s parents lived. Soon they began to take in Jews who escaped from Nazi persecution. Among them: Krystyna Izbicki, Anna Zofia and her son Jozef Ettinger, Krystyna Radziejewski and her foster-daughter Larissa Sztorchan,  Czeslawa Konko (children's instructor), Zofia Sidor, her sisters, Eliza Temler and Dr. Tworkowski.  More than 20 Jewish refugees joined in after the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt; They all worked at the farm and in the fields to maintain food supplies and also, for their own cover. Children, both Christian and Jewish, attended classes at an underground school set up by the family.

Jerzy Krępeć rented a second farm nearby where he placed his two sisters: Alina Tyszka (with daughters, Marta and Stefa) and Eugenia Muszynski with her teenage daughter Olenka (14). Alina Tyszka was expelled from her estate near [[Bydgoszcz]] (which was incorporated into the [[3rd Reich]]). Her husband Feliks, a Polish officer, was executed by the Nazis with his two uncles. Alina escaped when threatened with arrest, because of her earlier assistance given to Jews at a forced labor camp in [[Bielin, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Bielin]] where she worked in 1941. Eugenia's husband was held as a Polish POW in Germany. The two sisters immediately began sheltering more Jews. They all worked together at the farm. Their older children, especially Tadeusz and Olenka helped. The Jews moved from one farm to the other in case of danger. Some received false identification cards thanks to Jerzy's underground contacts, which was good also for their morale.

The entire Krepec family helped everybody in need with shelter, food, clothing and moral support. People in the village knew about the numerous Jewish families living at both farms, but nobody betrayed them and all refugees survived. Indeed, Jerzy Krepec had many silent partners, including neighbors well aware of the succession of farmhands speaking Polish with an accent. Undeterred by the associated risk, Tadeusz Krepec used to sneak out at night and steal guns and grenades from the German Panzer division stationed nearby, then bury them at the farm for the Polish Underground.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;

After the war, the Krepec family kept in touch with the Jewish friends who had stayed with them during the occupation. They were receiving shipments of oranges from Israel; however, they would not accept the offer to help emigrate from their homeland. Their son, Tadeusz Krepec, who studied at the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] eventually moved to Montreal in 1973 as an engineer.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;

The filmography of [[Canadian American]] actor and comedian [[Jim Carrey]] comprises both [[film]] and [[television]] roles. He has appeared in over forty-five feature films, and twelve [[television film]]s and [[Television series|series]]. He is one of the top-50 highest-grossing actors of all time at the North American box office, with over [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 billion total gross and an average of $94.3&amp;nbsp;million per film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;p=.htm "People Index."] [[Box Office Mojo]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with thirteen films that grossed over $200&amp;nbsp;million at the worldwide box office; the highest grossing one was ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=jimcarrey.htm |title=Jim Carrey's profile at Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 1984, Carrey gained his first lead role on the short-lived TV series ''[[The Duck Factory]]'', playing a young [[cartoonist]] and his first starring role proper in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'', a [[comedy horror]] movie with [[Lauren Hutton]] as a [[vampire]] countess and Jim playing as her victim. He landed [[Supporting character|supporting roles]] in films, such as ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' and ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]''.

In 1994, Carrey's real breakthrough came when he was given the leading role in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', in which he played a goof-ball [[detective]] specialized in crimes involving animals. The film would go on to earn over [[United States dollar|$]]72 million at the [[box office]].&lt;ref name="ace"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' (1994) &gt; Summary &gt; Domestic Total Gross| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aceventura.htm| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with another two commercial successes: ''[[The Mask]]'', in which he played a mild-mannered [[bank clerk]] who transformed into a wise-cracking [[superhero]] when he puts on a magical mask, and ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' where he and [[Jeff Daniels]] played a pair of childish men who come into possession of a suitcase full of money. The films ended up grossing $120 million and $127 million, respectively, and established Carrey as a star.&lt;ref name="mask"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''The Mask'' (1994) &gt; Summary &gt; Domestic Total Gross | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mask.htm| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dumb"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''Dumb and Dumber'' (1994) &gt; Summary &gt; Domestic Total Gross| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dumbanddumber.htm| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next projects included ''[[Batman Forever]]'', ''[[Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls]]'' in which he reprised his famed role, ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' and ''[[Liar Liar]]''.

In 1998, he gained critical acclaim in the [[Satire|satirical]] comedy-drama film ''[[The Truman Show]]'', in which he played Truman Burbank, a man whose life was, unbeknownst to him, a top-rating reality television show. The film was highly praised and led many to believe he would be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]], but instead he picked up his first Golden Globe Award for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama]].&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;{{cite news | author = Svetkey, Benjamin  | title = The Truman Pro | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = June 5, 1998 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283442,00.html | accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he returned to comedy reteaming with the [[Farrelly brothers]] for ''[[Me, Myself &amp; Irene]]'', it received mixed reviews but enjoyed box office success.&lt;ref name="irene"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=Me, Myself &amp; Irene Movie Reviews, Pictures | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/me_myself_and_irene/ | archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irene2"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''Me, Myself &amp; Irene'' (2000) &gt; Summary &gt; Domestic Total Gross | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=memyselfandirene.htm| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Carrey also appeared in ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]''.&lt;ref name="grinch"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'' (2000) &gt; Summary &gt; Domestic Total Gross| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=grinch.htm| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He again turned a serious side for [[Frank Darabont]]'s ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]''.

In July 2002, Carrey announced he would co-star with [[Garry Shandling]] in ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2002/07/16/jim-carrey-will-costar-garry-shandling-over-hedge|title=Jim Carrey will costar with Garry Shandling in ''Over the Hedge'' | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 16, 2002|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, however, he dropped out, and was replaced with [[Bruce Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/willis-replaces-carrey-over-hedge|title=Willis Replaces Carrey in Over the Hedge|publisher=www.awn.com|date=October 25, 2004|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his next feature film, Carrey starred opposite [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] in [[Tom Shadyac]]'s international hit comedy ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'', portraying a television newsman who unexpectedly receives God's [[Omnipotence|omnipotent abilities]] when the deity decides to take a vacation. It remains his most financially successful film to date.&lt;ref name="bruce"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Box Office Mojo | title=''Bruce Almighty'' (2003) | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=brucealmighty.htm | accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he took a role in the critically lauded art-house film ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'', written by acclaimed screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufmann]] and directed by the innovative [[Michael Gondry]].&lt;ref name="eternal"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | title=Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Movie Reviews, Pictures | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind/| archivedate=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey starred opposite [[Kate Winslet]] as a man pursued through his memories as they are erased.

Carrey received his fourth [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, and was also nominated for his first [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]]. Among his films in the 2000s were ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane (2005 film)|Fun with Dick and Jane]]'', ''[[The Number 23]]'', ''[[Horton Hears a Who!]]'', ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'', ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.

'''John Breese''' (1789 - 1842) was a Welsh Independent minister. He attended the local chapel from a young age, and probably acquired most of his early education during Sunday School classes. He was admitted a full member of the church at the age of 20, before being invited to begin preaching at 24. Encouraged and helped by his friends he attended a school in [[Shrewsbury]], before joining the Academy at [[Llanfyllin]]. His style of preaching was popular and attracted attention. He accepted an appointment at Edmund Street Church in [[Liverpool]] in 1817, before a move to the Tabernacle, Great Crosshall Street.

John married Margaret Williams (1801-1879) in 1823.&lt;ref&gt; Radnorshire, Wales, Marriages, 1813-1838; Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced six children. Margaret was the younger sister of Liberal MP for Merioneth,  [[David Williams (Merioneth)|David Williams]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/montgomeryshirew00will Montgomeryshire worthies] by Richard Williams, 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation as a preacher was far reaching, causing him to become quite famous throughout Wales. William Williams (1781 - 1840) and himself were the preachers most in demand at preaching assemblies.

Shortly after taking up an appointment at the Independent Chapel in Lammas Street, [[Carmarthen]] in 1835 his health began to fail. He died in Lammas Street on August 8, 1842 and was buried in the Chapel churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Notable_Welshmen_1700_1900.pdf] Notable Welshman by the Rev.

'''Agent June Stahl''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[FX (TV network)|FX]] television series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and a major antagonist of the series, played by [[Ally Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/ Sons of Anarchy at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=40843 Hunnam, Glenn and Sagal in FX's Anarchy]&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[Stockton, California]]-based Agent of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] investigating the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club]] in [[Charming, California]]. She is portrayed as being bisexual.  Stahl's methods are often ruthless, and include murdering her own girlfriend to get what she wants. Her actions have led to the deaths of two people associated with SAMCRO as well as the kidnapping of Abel Teller. She also killed an admitted gunrunner and then framed [[Gemma Teller Morrow]], making the shooting seem unlawful.

==Biography==
===Season 1===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}
June Stahl arrives in [[Charming (Sons of Anarchy)|Charming]] in episode 6, "[[List of Sons of Anarchy episodes#Season 1: 2008|AK-51]]", and is assigned to a case involving the [[Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club]] and their involvement in inter-state [[arms trafficking]]. She had been called in by [[David Hale (Sons of Anarchy)|David Hale]], the local police department's Deputy Chief, as he had been struggling to rid the town of the gang due to his superior, [[Wayne Unser]]'s, corruptness. She soon becomes involved in an affair with David Hale. [[Jax Teller]], SAMCRO's Vice President, witnessed them in a sexual encounter at the police station while breaking [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Cherry|Cherry]] out of lockup. Agent Stahl became even more obsessed with crushing SAMCRO after being severely beaten by [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Otto Delaney|Big Otto Delaney]], who hit her head into a table as a way to show the club that he did not succumb to her pressure. He also detested her for arresting his wife [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Luann Delaney|Luann]] as a way to force him to become an [[informant]]. Her subsequent attempts to recruit [[Opie Winston]] caused her to trick [[Clay Morrow]], SAMCRO's President, into believing that Opie had betrayed the Club and the others with whom he murdered Hefferen, a port commissioner. Clay responded by ordering [[Tig Trager]] to kill Opie and pin it on the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]] [[street gang]]. Opie's wife, who was driving his truck, was mistakenly killed instead. This incident caused a rift between Stahl and Deputy Chief Hale, who icily told her at the crime scene, "This blood's on you." She continued in her attempts to bring down SAMCRO until the very end, keeping another member, [[Bobby Munson]], in jail three weeks after the case was dropped and he was a free man. When Bobby asked her why she did that, even though it caused so much sorrow and did not accomplish anything, she says it gave her peace of mind.

In a deleted scene on the Season 1 DVD, she is shown waking up with a naked woman in her bed and telling her she has to go, thus revealing she is bisexual. This is the end of the episode.

===Season 2===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}
Agent Stahl returned again later in Season Two to investigate the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#L.O.A.N.|L.O.A.N.]] and the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#True IRA|True IRA]]. She visits Clay in jail in attempt to get him to turn on the IRA. Although she fails at that, their conversation ultimately provokes a physical confrontation between Jax and Clay. She also visits Jax Teller as well in an attempt to exploit the schism between SAMCRO and the IRA and ends up revealing the IRA's betrayal of SAMCRO to L.O.A.N. Jax declines the offer and instills dread upon Stahl with the revelation of her colleague [[Josh Kohn]]'s murder.

Stahl was able to prey on [[Chibs Telford]]'s desire to reunite with his family and the two worked out a deal where if Chibs delivered the True IRA to the ATF, she would rescue his estranged wife and daughter and would grant complete immunity for any crimes to SAMCRO. However, Stahl decided to change the deal (no immunity for SAMCRO) but couldn't convince Chibs to go along with it. She threatened him by saying that she herself would tell the IRA about Chibs' betrayal, but she was still unable to break him.

When Opie found out that his wife, Donna's, death was a result of Stahl making Opie appear to be a snitch, he found her and threatened her at gunpoint. However, he showed mercy and let her live. He took out the empty magazine to his gun and gave it to Stahl. After Opie left, Stahl broke down and started crying.

In the season two finale, Stahl discovers that Ethan Zobelle is an F.B.I. informant and passes the information to Chief Unser, who in turn passes it onto SAMCRO. She continued her sting operation with Edmond Hayes and was able to arrange a meeting between him and his father, Cameron. Cameron secretly told Edmond to kill Stahl, so Edmond convinced Stahl that another meeting would take place and she arranged for only herself to be present.  At his home, Edmond retrieved a gun but couldn't bring himself to kill Stahl.  Stahl revealed that the ATF knew all along about Cameron's plan and that Edmond's gun was loaded with blanks.  Feeling like a fool, Edmond punched Stahl and attempted to escape, but Stahl was able to fire several shots from her sidearm and accidentally killed Edmond.  Soon after, Polly Zobelle showed up to say goodbye to Edmond, but instead found his dead body. Before finding Stahl, Gemma Teller  appeared in the house, looking to exact revenge on Polly.  Gemma killed Polly in self-defense and then discovered Edmond's body and Stahl.  After telling Gemma to flee, Stahl tricked Gemma into handling her gun, making it appear that Gemma killed both Polly and Edmond.

After Gemma escaped, Stahl announced over her radio that Gemma had murdered Polly Zobelle and then took Stahl's sidearm to kill Edmond Hayes. However, Edmond's father had been eavesdropping on Stahl's broadcast and ends up killing SAMCRO member Half-Sack and kidnapping Jax's infant son in retaliation.

=== Season 3===
{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}
Stahl showed no remorse for the fact that her actions led to the death of Half-Sack and the kidnapping of baby Abel. She was demoted off of the IRA case by the ATF after the events at the end of season 2 but was looking for ways to return to the case.  She interrogated Tara regarding the kidnapping and was agitated even though Tara was being truthful in an effort to get law enforcement to assist in the search for Abel. Clay told Stahl that if anything happened to Abel because of her, he will personally kill her, which terrified Stahl inside.

Gemma Teller made a personal deal with Stahl to surrender to the federal authorities, but her heart condition flares, causing her to pass out in the drive way of the SAMCRO clubhouse before she can turn herself in.  At the hospital, Stahl informed Gemma that the US Attorney will take away the deal because she didn't turn herself in even though she was incapacitated.  Jax took a risky move and secretly made an off-the-record deal with Stahl to give her the True IRA in exchange for Stahl pushing back their upcoming bail hearing, reduced time on their gun charges, and Stahl recanting her statement against Gemma.

Stahl proved to be trustworthy in her deal with Jax when she is able to push back SAMCRO's bail hearing by 10 days so that the bikers can go to Belfast to get Abel back.  She supplied a rigged testimony for Gemma to relay to the U.S. Attorney's office, incriminating Agent Tyler in the process. She has been trustworthy because she knows that Jax's knowledge of the California gun-running operation can save her dying career and unlike the rest of her deals she had a lot to lose by breaking.

It is reinforced in season three that Agent Stahl is bisexual as she is shown to be having an intimate relationship with Agent Tyler, the one she incriminated in the statement she gave to Gemma. During an assignment, Stahl shoots Agent Tyler in the throat and sets it up as a drive-by from a Mexican gang. In her statement, she admits their intimate relationship and claims that Agent Tyler had confessed to framing Gemma for the murder of Edmond, thereby exonerating Gemma and holding up her end of the deal. When Gemma finds out about the deal, she threatens to revoke her statement and tell the authorities who really wrote it. Stahl replies that she is already too late, as she has already been exonerated.

She exposes Jax's deal to the club thinking they would kill him. Her motivation for doing so seems to have been malicious. However, Jax was aware that she could not be trusted and had already informed the other members of the club. This led ultimately to Opie, with the help of Unser, targeting Agent Stahl in retribution for her role in the death of his wife, Donna. During this confrontation Stahl breaks down crying and begs Opie for her life, to which Opie responds, "This is what she felt." He then shoots Stahl in the back of the head with a [[MAC-10]], instantly killing her. After this, Chibs Telford rigs the scene to look as if the real IRA murdered Stahl and Jimmy O'Phelan.

'''Kazimierz Brodziński''' (8 March 1791 in [[Królówka]] – 10 October 1835 in [[Dresden]]) was an important [[Poles|Polish]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet.

== Life ==
He was born in [[Królówka]] near [[Bochnia]]. He came from the low nobility. He was a student at schools in [[Tarnów]], where he also graduated from the grammar school. He served in the army of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. He took part in the campaign of 1812, during which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. During the ''Battle of the Nations'' at [[Leipzig]], he was wounded and taken prisoner by the [[Prussia]]ns. Having returned from captivity in 1814, he settled in [[Warsaw]], where he worked as a clerk. He joined the freemasons, advanced to the fifth degree of initiation; in 1819 he became the secretary of the Great East. From 1818, he was a teacher of Polish literature and of style in schools of various degrees. He also co-operated with ''Pamiętnik Warszawski'', initially as a member of the editorial staff and later as co-editor. In 1823 he became a member of the [[Society of the Friends of the Sciences]]. Having received his doctor's degree in philosophy, he was appointed Professor at [[Warsaw University]]. He travelled to [[Prague]], Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France. These journeys, made in order to improve his health, became an opportunity to make the acquaintance of Czech researchers into Slavic studies and Czech and Slovak folklore: [[Josef Jungmann]], [[Vaclav Hanka]] and [[Jan Kollar]]. During the [[November Uprising]], he was an editor of insurgent newspapers: ''Kurier Polski'' and ''Nowa Polska''. Appointed a general inspector of schools by the insurgent authorities, he worked upon the reorganisation of education. After the collapse of the uprising he was dismissed from his posts. He stayed in Kraków for some time. In 1834 he returned to Warsaw, where he edited ''Jutrzenka'' and ''Magazyn Powszechny''. In May 1835 he left for treatment to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]]. On his way back he died in Dresden on 10 October 1835.

== Work ==
His knowledge of the German language, obtained at school, led to his very early interest in German literature. He read S. Gessner's pastorals, the works of [[Schiller]] and [[Goethe]]. Brodziński was, above all, a writer of elegies and pastorals. In his pastorals he aimed at giving a modern form to this ancient genre. He searched for inspiration in Old Polish pastorals, in [[Reklewski]]'s poetry, in the theoretical essays of [[Herder]], [[Jean Paul]] and Schiller. He included his thoughts on pastoral in his aesthetic essays: ''O klasyczności i romantyczności tudzież o duchu poezji polskiej'' (1818) and ''O idylli pod względem moralnym'' (1823)

The pastoral ''Wiesław'' gained him universal approval. Its first version appeared in the volumes 16 and 18 of ''Pamiętnik Warszawski'' from 1820. It was a pastoral picture spun around the love story of Wiesław and Halina. Yet it was not about the vicissitudes of the lovers. In his pastoral, Brodziński describes the world of harmony between virtuous people and nature. The source of virtue was work on the land, a close relationship with the earth. The poet emphasised the originality of the world in Wiesław by reaching for folklore. [[Adam Mickiewicz]], in the Epilogue of [[Pan Tadeusz]], mentions the popularity of Brodziński's work among contemporary readers. ''Wiesław'' was translated into Bulgarian, Czech, German and Russian.

Brodziński wrote the [[libretto]] for [[Karol Kurpiński]]'s 1820 opera ''[[Kalmora]]''.

[[Image:Leda - after Michelangelo Buonarroti.jpg|thumb|right|''Leda and the Swan'', 16th-century copy after [[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|the lost painting]] by [[Michelangelo]]]]
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Leda''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|d|ə|,_|ˈ|l|eɪ|-}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Λήδα}} {{IPA-el|lɛ͜ɛ́da͜a|}}) was an Aetolian princess who became a Spartan queen. Her myth gave rise to the popular motif in Renaissance and later art of [[Leda and the Swan]].

== Family ==
Leda was the daughter of the [[Aetolia]]n king [[Thestius]] hence she was also called Thestias&lt;ref&gt;Apollod. 3.10.5; Paus. 3.13.8; Eur. IA 49&lt;/ref&gt;. Her mother was either [[Leucippe]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; or Deidameia, daughter of [[Perieres (king of Messenia)|Perieres]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 201&lt;/ref&gt; or else [[Eurythemis]], daughter of [[Cleoboea]]&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 1. 7. 10&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[Laophonte (mythology)|Laophonte]], daughter of [[Pleuron (Greek mythology)|Pleuron]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Alcman]]. ''Fragment 15'' as cited in ''[[Scholia|Scholiast]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. ''[[Argonautica]], 1.146''&lt;/ref&gt;. According to [[Alcman]], Leda's parents were [[Glaucus]] and Laophonte&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while [[Eumelus of Corinth|Eumelus]] attested that they are [[Sisyphus]] and Panteiduia or Paneidyia&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia|Scholiast]] on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. ''[[Argonautica]], 1.146''  as cited in Lyric Poets. ''[[Eumelus of Corinth|Eumelus]], Life''&lt;/ref&gt; 

She married king [[Tyndareus]] (Τυνδάρεως) of [[Sparta]] and by him, mother of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] (Ἑλένη) of Troy, [[Clytemnestra]] (Κλυταιμνήστρα), and [[Castor and Pollux]] (Κάστωρ καὶ Πολυδεύκης, also spelled "Castor and Polydeuces"). Leda also had other daughters by [[Tyndareus]]: [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]] (Τιμάνδρα), [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]] (Φοίβη), and [[Philonoe]] (Φιλονόη).

== Mythology ==
[[Image:Leda and Zeus (Swan).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Leda with the Swan, a restored Roman copy, perhaps after an original by [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheus]] ([[Museo del Prado]])]]Leda was admired by [[Zeus]], who seduced her in the guise of a [[swan]]. As a swan, Zeus fell into her arms for protection from a pursuing eagle. Their consummation, on the same night as Leda lay with her husband Tyndareus, resulted in two eggs from which hatched Helen (later known as the beautiful "[[Helen of Troy]]"), Clytemnestra, and Castor and Pollux (also known as the [[Dioscuri]]). Which children are the progeny of Tyndareus the mortal king, and which are of Zeus and thus half-immortal, is not consistent among accounts, nor is which child hatched from which egg. The split is almost always half mortal, half divine, although the pairings do not always reflect the children's heritage pairings. Castor and Pollux are sometimes both mortal, sometimes both divine. One consistent point is that if only one of them is immortal, it is Pollux.  It is also always stated that Helen is the daughter of Zeus.

In Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', Helen looks down from the walls of Troy and wonders why she does not see her brothers among the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. The narrator remarks that they are both already dead and buried back in their homeland of [[Lacedaemon]], thus suggesting that at least in the Homeric tradition, both were mortal.

Another account of the myth states that [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] (Νέμεσις) was the mother of Helen, and was also impregnated by Zeus in the guise of a swan. A shepherd found the egg and gave it to Leda, who carefully kept it in a chest until the egg hatched. When the egg hatched, Leda adopted Helen as her daughter. Zeus also commemorated the birth of Helen by creating the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] (Κύκνος), the Swan, in the sky.

== In art ==
{{see|Leda and the Swan}}Leda and the swan and Leda and the egg were popular subjects in ancient art. In the post-[[classical art]]s, it became a potent source of inspiration. It is the subject of [[William Butler Yeats]]' poem [[Leda_and_the_Swan#In_poetry|Leda and the Swan]]. She is also the main subject in Honoré Desmond Sharrer's "Leda &amp; the Folks", a large painting focusing as well on the parents of entertainer [[Elvis Presley]] and currently located at the Smith College Museum of Art.

'''Peter Robinson''' (born 3 November 1962, [[Kingston, Jamaica]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marilyn-mn0000825079|title=Biography|work=allmusic.com|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''Marilyn''', is a British/Jamaican&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mistermarilyn.com/biography/|title=Bandar Bola Tangkas Online|website=mistermarilyn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; pop singer and songwriter. He is most well known for his 1983 hit "[[Calling Your Name]]" and his highly [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Kingston, Jamaica. At age 5, he moved with his mother to [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/27/marilyn-peter-robinson-sat-in-room-20-years-taking-crack-watching-alien-films|title=Marilyn: ‘I sat in a room for 20 years, taking crack and watching the Alien films’|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|date=27 September 2016|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He left school at 15, and has stated that he was bullied at school for being feminine, and that he self-harmed.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaycQqdbat0|title=Toby Mott in conversation with Marilyn|first=|last=ICA|date=6 June 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Marilyn persona==

As a boy, Robinson loved Marilyn Monroe's image, and Marilyn became his school nickname.  While the name originated from homophobic bullies at school, Robinson decided to appropriate it to his advantage.&lt;ref name="Smash"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Sheaf|first1=Claire|title= Marilyn (interview)|magazine= Smash Hits|volume= 5|issue= 22|page=30|publisher= EMAP Metro|date=27 October 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, he was a regular nightclub-goer and wanted to look different, so he adopted a [[Marilyn Monroe]] image wearing vintage dresses with bleached blond hair.  He became part of the British [[New Romantic]] movement which emerged in the late 1970s club scene and was popularised in the early 1980s.

Robinson was a regular at 'The Blitz' nightclub (regulars being labelled as [[Blitz Kids]]), a highly stylised club in London run by [[Steve Strange]] of the pop group [[Visage (band)|Visage]], and a place which spawned many early 1980s pop stars such as [[Spandau Ballet]]. During this time, Robinson met [[Boy George]] (prior to his forming [[Culture Club]]), and the pair would later share a squat together.

In 1979, Robinson appeared in the documentary ''Steppin' Out'' directed by [[Lyndall Hobbs]], which explored the fashionable nightclubs and the trendy pop culture scenes that were famous in London in the late 70s. It was shown as the support film to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' in British cinemas.&lt;ref name="Smash"/&gt; Also in 1979, he appeared in the first segment of director [[Derek Jarman]]'s 12-minute short film ''Broken English''. While Boy George went on to form [[Culture Club]] in 1981 and secured a recording deal with Virgin Records, Marilyn was still scouting for a recording contract and had relocated to Los Angeles for some time. There, he worked as a personal assistant to daytime soap star [[Terry Lester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Tebbutt|first1= Simon|title= News Beat: Some Like It Hot (an interview with Marilyn)|magazine=Number One Magazine|page=19|publisher= IPC Magazines|date=6 August 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teamed up with songwriter and pop entrepreneur [[Paul Caplin]] who became his manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlinmusic.com/songs/page/songId/244|title=Carlin Music UK - 100 years of Music|website=www.carlinmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career: 1980s==
After Marilyn's friend Boy George had made a commercial impact with Culture Club, record companies were looking for other artists with a similar cross-dressing image. In 1983, following a high-profile appearance in the promo video for [[Eurythmics]]' hit single, "[[Who's That Girl? (Eurythmics song)|Who's That Girl?]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayinthe80s.com/2013/10/1983-music-eurhythmics-whos-that-girl/|title=1983. Music: Eurhythmics. Who's That Girl? - Gay in the 80s|date=10 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson signed his own recording contract as Marilyn with [[Phonogram Records]].

Marilyn's first chart success came in late 1983 with his debut single "[[Calling Your Name]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishchartsingles.com/index.php/2013/11/27/calling-your-name-marilyn/ British Chart Singles]&lt;/ref&gt; which reached the Top 5 in the UK and Australia, and number 1 in Japan.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} He had two further minor UK Top 40 hits in 1984 with "Cry and Be Free" and "You Don't Love Me" (the latter of which he performed at the Children's Royal Variety Performance held at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], London, in the presence of [[HRH The Princess Anne]]).

In March 1984, Marilyn flew to Australia for a 10-day promotional tour and was besieged by fans who were waiting to greet him at Melbourne Airport. Film footage of his arrival was broadcast on that evening's television news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TYvT5eSLRw&amp;list=UUO7Qcft9wFunFllP63iiClA|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grMU3PaMwHY|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Australia, he was attacked and kicked in the face by a member of the public at the Exchange Hotel, a gay bar venue in Sydney, sustaining a bruised eye from the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblitzkids.com/site_archive/blitz_kids/marilyn.html Blitz Kids (clippings)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082458/http://www.theblitzkids.com/site_archive/blitz_kids/marilyn.html |date=21 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1984, Marilyn took part in the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas]]" along with various other pop stars of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/feed-the-world-band-aid-25-years-on-1825385.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=27|title=Feed the world? Band Aid 25 years on|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1985, now facing financial difficulties and being forced to give up his London home, Phonogram Records dispatched him to Detroit, Michigan, to work with producer [[Don Was]]. While in America he cut his trademark long blonde hair short and ceased wearing make-up, abandoning the image that had brought him his initial success. After spending a week recording new material with Was, Marilyn was scheduled to perform live for the first time at New York's famed [[Area (nightclub)|Area nightclub]]. The performance was intended to be filmed for use in the promo video for his new single, "Baby U Left Me", but the film crew were delayed, and although Marilyn proceeded to go onstage anyway, the performance was ruined by technical problems with the club's [[public address|PA system]]. Midway through his first song, Marilyn abandoned the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1= Tennant|first1= Neil|last2= |first2= |title= Marilyn - Does Anyone Still Want Him?|magazine= Smash Hits|volume= 7|issue= 6|pages=26, 27|publisher= EMAP Metro|date=14 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1985, Marilyn released his debut album, ''[[Despite Straight Lines]]''. Despite including his three earlier UK Top 40 hit singles, the album only charted in Australia.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; Further singles from the album, "Baby U Left Me" and "Pray for That Sunshine" were unsuccessful, although the former reached the top 40 in Australia.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

By this time, Robinson's drug addiction and his highly publicised disputes with Boy George damaged his public image. Public tastes were also changing, and his music career suffered.

Despite the problems in New York the year before, Marilyn performed live once in December 1986 at the Mud Club in London, where he performed a cover version of "[[Spirit in the Sky]]" which was planned to be his new single but was never released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblitzkids.com/site_archive/yurayaya/mazmud86/index.html Marilyn at the Mud Club (MazMag, 1986)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051104/http://www.theblitzkids.com/site_archive/yurayaya/mazmud86/index.html |date=21 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, Robinson had signed with the Interbeat label, though again no new recordings surfaced. He then dropped out of the public eye for the next decade, abandoning his music career.

==Activities from late 1990s-2006==
Robinson first re-appeared in 1999 when he was interviewed on the [[Channel 4]] programme ''Top Ten New Romantics'', though he himself was not listed in the chart. In 2000, he attempted to relaunch his career and recorded a new single as Marilyn, a cover version of the [[Dennis Brown]] song "How Could I Live?" for Desilu Records based in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbhvvb_marilyn-how-could-i-live-2001_music Daily Motion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419191332/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xbhvvb_marilyn-how-could-i-live-2001_music |date=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson recorded the track in Jamaica and a few months later producer Nick Cabrera flew out there to supervise the final work on the track and its subsequent remixes. German producer Kinky Roland also made a remix of the track.&lt;ref name="Cabrera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickcabrera.com|title=Nick Cabrera Photography|website=www.nickcabrera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following disagreements with the label, Robinson refused to let the single be released, though some 12" promotional copies do exist.&lt;ref name="Cabrera"/&gt;

In 2001, Robinson appeared in the BBC documentary programme ''A Fine Romance: The Story of the New Romantics''. On 2 September 2001, Marilyn performed a live appearance at the ''Sound on Sunday'' club night in Leicester Square, London. It was his first live performance in over 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circa-club.com/gallery/gay_history_icons_marilyn_peter_robinson.php|title=Gay History, Gay Celebrities, Gay Icons - Marilyn ( Peter Robinson ) - Circa - Club for Gay Professional Men|first=Global Websuites|last=Limited|website=www.circa-club.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote the gig, Robinson gave a series of magazine interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn quotes, from 'The Marilyn Files' by Stewart Who? QX magazine, 29 August 2001, No. 345, pages 24–26: "When we discuss the long exile, he feels there's nothing to explain. 'I don't go round looking for publicity ... because I've done that already.' He's just beginning to comprehend the cult status and level of support on offer. If he could only help himself: 'It's shocking to me. I haven't tuned into anything for years. Or thought about work, because I've been a junkie. No one was in my bubble but me. My outlook has been, will the last person leaving, switch the light out'."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from an interview with Marilyn – ‘She's back’ in The Pink Paper, 31 August 2001, issue 701, page 15: "Few can remember just how huge Marilyn was in the early 80s, when, with other characters like Steve Strange, Leigh Bowery and one George O'Dowd, he crossed from club-scene mannequin to mainstream diva."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extract from ‘Karma Chameleon’ in Boyz magazine, 1 September 2001, issue 526, page 33. "Way back in the day, when Liam Gallager was still at school, Patsy Kensit was in Eighth Wonder (just about) and Duran Duran had the biggest hair on the planet (apart from George Michael and Bonnie Tyler of course), homosexuality was sadly still just about as uncouth as not replacing the toilet roll... only about ten times so. Therefore, it's not hard to imagine the dramatic effect the likes of gender benders Boy George and Marilyn had on society at large. Gay and straight boys alike went wild with mascara, whilst mothers and grannies, well, er... we joined them!"&lt;/ref&gt;

A 4-track self-pressed CD-R of older material was released privately in 2003.&lt;ref name="discogs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Marilyn-Hold-On-Tight/release/1954162|title=Marilyn - Hold On Tight|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Robinson appeared on the [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[The Salon]]'', a reality show based at a hairdressing salon where members of the public and several celebrities went for haircuts and beauty treatments. He also appeared in the TV documentary ''25 Years of Smash Hits'' that traced the influence of UK pop music.

In 2006, Robinson was interviewed in the [[Channel 4]] TV documentary ''Whatever Happened to the Gender Benders?'', which reflected on the advent of the New Romantic movement of the early 1980s and the prominent roles that he, Boy George and Steve Strange played within it.

==Career since 2013==

On 16 May 2013, Robinson appeared on Birmingham's Switch Radio where he gave a 30-minute interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.switchradio.co.uk/viewnews.asp?id=47|title=Switch Radio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, he appeared on Kev Gurney's ''Club Tropicana'' radio show on Bolton 96.5 radio where he gave a 20-minute interview in which he speaks candidly about his life. During the interview he revealed that he has been back in the recording studio and is currently working on four new tracks with a new production team, and suggested the possibility of live dates in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/kevingurney/marilyn Soundcloud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014806/https://soundcloud.com/kevingurney/marilyn |date=19 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared on an episode of Celebrity Gogglebox that aired on Channel 4 on 9 October 2015 as part of the channel's Stand Up To Cancer Charity Evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Boy George, Miranda Hart and Jamie Dornan to appear in Gogglebox celebrity special|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11918598/Boy-George-and-Geri-Halliwell-to-appear-in-Gogglebox-celebrity-special.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson began reporting on his Facebook page in Spring 2015 that he has been writing and recording some new material with [[Boy George]] as producer, and some re-recordings of his back catalogue. He spoke about the new recordings at length during a June 2016 interview.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; On 23 September 2016, Marilyn released his first new single in over 30 years, entitled "Love or Money".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boygeorgeuk.com/?p=6232|title=MISTER MARILYN&lt;BR&gt; LOVE OR MONEY|first=|last=admin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The same day, both he and Boy George appeared on the television show ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'', which showed the promo video for the single. The pair were also interviewed on ''[[Loose Women]]'' on 26 September 2016.

==Personal life==

Robinson was born in Jamaica, but after his parents split up, he and his mother moved back to England when he was four years old, settling in Hertfordshire. After being constantly bullied, he left school at 15, and by 1979 he had left home and was living in a squat in London.

Robinson has been candid about the effect drug abuse has had on his life, and the physical and mental health problems he has suffered. In 1986, both he and Boy George were arrested in London on charges of drug possession. On 20 August 1986, at Marylebone Magistrates Court in London, a magistrate dismissed a heroin charge against Robinson because the prosecution offered no evidence.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-20/news/mn-18506_1_heroin-charge|title=British Drug Charge Against Pop Singer Marilyn Dismissed|first=Associated|last=Press|date=20 August 1986|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a November 2014 interview with the Daily Mirror, he said that he was a heroin addict from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/band-aid-star-marilyn-spent-4611526|title=Band Aid star spent decades battling heroin and poverty after recording track|first=Melissa|last=Thompson|date=11 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson says he has been clear of all drugs since 2010, after a period in rehab prompted by some specific severe health problems.

In his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', [[Boy George]] wrote that in the 1980s Robinson had a relationship with singer [[Gavin Rossdale]].  In a 1996 interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Rossdale responded: "That's George's take – he doesn't know me. There's a queue of people going to their lawyers about stuff in his book. I hope he manages to sell some books by putting my name in there."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938704/nirvanawannabes ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere both Rossdale and Robinson initially denied the story&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2364482"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/2364482/Gavin-Rossdale-is-gay-Boy-George |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223133906/http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/2364482/Gavin-Rossdale-is-gay-Boy-George |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2013 |title=Gavin Rossdale 'gay' – Boy George |date=27 April 2009 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intouchweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intouchweekly.com/2009/04/in_touch_exclusivemarilyn_gavi.php |title=Celebrity news and entertainment from |publisher=In Touch Weekly |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004030502/http://www.intouchweekly.com/2009/04/in_touch_exclusivemarilyn_gavi.php |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2003 Robinson dedicated the Marilyn CD "Hold on Tight" to Rossdale, citing "the years of our passionate relationship" and featuring a photo of them together on the cover.&lt;ref name="discogs.com"/&gt;  Later, both men spoke more candidly about their relationship, with Robinson confirming in 2009 that they had been "together five years" in the 1980s&lt;ref name="intouchweekly.com"/&gt; while in  2010 Rossdale said the relationship with Robinson had been an experimentation and "part of growing up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perezhilton.com/2010-10-13-gavin-rossdale-confirms-same-sex-hookup-with-cross-dressing-pop-star-marilyn |title=Gavin Rossdale Confirms Same Sex Hook-Up With Cross Dressing Pop Star! |publisher=PerezHilton.com |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiner |first=Jonah |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201011/bush-frontman-lead-singer-gavin-rossdale-interview-gwen-stefani#ixzz12FS7Y4U0 |title=Gavin Rossdale, Uncensored: Music + Books |publisher=Details |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320627/Gwen-Stefanis-husband-Gavin-Rossdales-gay-confession-years-late-says-Marilyn.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140824205042/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320627/Gwen-Stefanis-husband-Gavin-Rossdales-gay-confession-years-late-says-Marilyn.html|deadurl=yes|title=Gwen Stefani's husband Gavin Rossdale's gay confession is 'years late…|date=24 August 2014|archivedate=24 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson said, "Gavin and Gwen [Stefani, Rossdale's then-wife] are perfect for each other, but he was the love of my life."&lt;ref name="intouchweekly.com"/&gt;

Books that have included references to Marilyn include:

''We Can Be Heroes: Punks, Poseurs, Peacocks and People of a Particular Persuasion'' by Graham Smith, published by Unbound – 20 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-blitz-kids-how-the-new-romantics-made-london-swing-again-8294639.html|title=The Blitz kids: How the New Romantics made London swing again|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-blitz-kids-how-the-new-romantics-made-london-swing-again-8294639.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=8|title=The Blitz kids: How the New Romantics made London swing again|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shapersofthe80s.com/2011/10/07/➤-a-taste-of-the-80s-blitz-kids-—-this-photo-book-captures-their-unseen-glory/ Shapers of the 80s]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Take It Like a Man: The Autobiography of Boy George.'' (1995) Marilyn features prominently in Boy George's autobiography, which reflects on their long friendship and years together from living in a London squat and working at the Blitz Club. In the book, George claims that while they were living in a squat together, they were chased out by a neighbour (male) who was attracted to Marilyn, but who then broke the door down with an axe when he discovered Marilyn was a man. He also claims Marilyn once tried to seduce [[David Bowie]] at a London nightclub but was rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= O'Dowd|first=George "Boy George" |date=1995 |title= [[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]: The Autobiography of Boy George|location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0062117786 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marilyn has been portrayed in several productions, including Boy George's stage musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' which reflected on the [[New Romantic]] scene of the early '80s.&lt;ref&gt;MARILYN interview by James Anderson in ''Attitude'' magazine in which Marilyn discusses the forthcoming musical 'Taboo' in which he is portrayed, September 2001, number 89, pages 22–23. "How do you feel about the forthcoming musical, Taboo, based on the early '80s London club legends? 'Originally it was going to be a film – and I'm not sure what I think about it really. The four main characters are Marilyn, Boy George, Steve Strange and Philip Salon. I've got to look at the tapes of the actors' workshops from it round at George's. It's coming from mainly George's angle again [the Boy is writing the music for the show] and that's slightly perturbing to me.' You talk about George like he has some real hold over you? 'I love George, we're friends and we've got a history together. The thing is, he's more famous than me. I don't have the access to the media to be able to say my A-B-C to his D-E-F. People will believe anything someone says it they're a celebrity, and that's sad'."&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also portrayed by the actor [[Freddie Fox (actor)|Freddie Fox]] in the 2010 BBC television film ''[[Worried About the Boy]]'', about the rise of Boy George in the early '80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hungertv.com/film/feature/fantastic-mr-fox/|title=One From the Archives: FANTASTIC MR FOX: FREDDIE FOX - HUNGER TV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herber und Baier.jpg|thumb|Herber and Baier]]
'''Maxi Herber''' (8 October 1920 – 20 October 2006) was a [[Germany|German]] [[figure skating|figure skater]] who competed in [[pair skating]] and [[single skating]]. She is the [[List of Olympic medalists in figure skating by age#Youngest champions|youngest]] figure skating Olympic champion (at the age of 15 years and 128 days) when she [[Figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics – Pairs|won gold in pair skating]] together with [[Ernst Baier]] at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]]. The duo revolutionized [[pair skating]], becoming the first team to perform [[figure skating jump|jumps]] side by side.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Born in [[Munich]], Herber was also an accomplished single skater, winning the German nationals three times, from 1933 to 1935. She skated for the Münchner EV (Munich EV) club.

Herber and Baier married after their skating career ended in 1940. They had 3 children. After [[World War II]] they skated in ice shows. Later the couple owned a business. In 1964 they were divorced. As a result of the divorce, she had to depend on social services to survive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Supported by the "Deutsche Sporthilfe" (German Sport help organisation) she moved to [[Oberau]] near [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in [[Bavaria]]. Some years later Herber and Baier remarried, but were divorced again.

Herber suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]]. In 2000, she moved to the Lenzheim retirement home in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Soon afterwards she had an exhibition of her [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] paintings there. She died at age 86 in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]; Herber had been Germany's oldest living female Olympic champion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

'''Mick West''' is a science writer, [[scientific skepticism|skeptical]] investigator, and retired video game programmer. He is the creator of the websites ''Contrail Science'' and ''Metabunk'', for which he investigates and debunks [[pseudoscientific]] claims such as [[chemtrails]], [[UFO]]s, and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and has appeared in various media as an [[expert]] analyst and science communicator.

==Career==
===Neversoft===
West co-founded [[Neversoft Entertainment]] in July 1994 with Joel Jewett and Chris Ward. The [[video game developer|video game development]] company, known for ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' and the ''[[Tony Hawk's (series)|Tony Hawk's]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' video game franchises, was acquired by [[Activision]] in October 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/neversoft-entertainment/3010-1442/ |title=Neversoft Entertainment (Company) |publisher=[[Giant Bomb]] |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; its studio merged with [[Infinity Ward]] on May 3, 2014 and was made defunct on July 10, 2014.

===Websites===
West became interested in the [[chemtrail conspiracy theory]] while studying aviation weather for his pilot’s license. He created the website “Contrail Science” with the aim of explaining [[contrails]] and debunking chemtrail theories. He believed initially that he could explain and debunk these theories quite quickly, but they were more resilient than he’d anticipated: he has now spent more than 10 years covering the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Kaleigh |title=Send This Article to All Your Friends Who Believe in Chemtrails |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zm8d4e/send-this-article-to-all-your-friends-who-believe-in-chemtrails |website=motherboard.vice.com |publisher=Vice |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion on the “Contrail Science” website eventually expanded to include other conspiracy theories, including that of [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]]. So West decided to create another website, “Metabunk”, to expand the discussion to other alternative beliefs. Metabunk covers such topics as [[pseudoscience]], [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and the [[paranormal]]. The website also includes a forum, “Skydentify”, where West invites people to send photos and videos of UFOs and supposed ghosts. He analyses these using his background in video game programming and [[Photoshop]], and then he and other forum members attempt to explain what the photos and videos are actually depicting. They also discuss the best way to communicate the results of their debunking investigations.&lt;ref name = rs&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-506-1july2018 |title=The Skeptic Zone |website=skepticzone.tv |publisher=The Skeptic Zone Podcast |last1=Saunders |first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Saunders (skeptic) |date=1 July 2018 |time=2.30 |access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis from West and other experts on Metabunk has been cited in other publications, such as [[the Daily Express]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Austin |first1=Jon |title=Is this REAL TRUTH about Pentagon UFO video that convinced world aliens may exist? |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/904005/Pentagon-UFO-real-truth-US-navy-aliens-may-exist |website=express.co.uk |publisher=Express Newspapers |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kooser |first1=Amanda |title=UFO caught on video?

West describes the objective of his work as attempting to get people out of the “rabbit hole” of conspiratorial thinking. “Chemtrails is a surprisingly popular theory; it’s right up there with things like the 9/11 conspiracy theories,” he says. “It all stems from a fundamental distrust of science and authority. You are always going to get a percentage of people who are true believers. My goal is to minimize that as much as possible, stop people falling for it, and help them get out as easily as possible.”&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

He also created the online forum morgellonswatch.com to dispel the myths and misinformation surrounding the unconfirmed [[skin condition]], [[Morgellons]].&lt;ref name = sts/&gt;

===Academic work===
[[File:Mick West CSICon 2016.jpg|thumb|Mick West speaking at CSICon in 2016]] 
In August 2016, West co-authored a paper with climate scientists Ken Caldeira, Christine Shearer, and Steven J. Davis published in the journal [[Environmental Research Letters]] titled ''Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program (SLAP)''. The objective of the paper was to produce a peer-reviewed expert response to the chemtrail theory. The authors surveyed experts on atmospheric chemistry and deposition to scientifically evaluate the claims of chemtrail conspiracy theorists. Upon publication, it was recognized as the first study by a major science organization on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sutherland |first1=Scott |title=Scientists conclude 'chemtrail conspiracy' has no substance |url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/scientists-conclude-chemtrail-conspiracy-has-no-substance/71200 |website=theweathernetwork.com |publisher=The Weather Network |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its conclusion reported that “76 out of 77 (98.7%) scientists that took part in this study said there was no evidence of a SLAP, and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, such as typical contrail formation and poor data sampling instructions presented on SLAP websites”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shearer |first1=Christine |last2=West |first2=Mick |last3=Caldeira |first3=Ken |last4=Davis |first4=Stephen |title=Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084011/meta |website=iopscience.iop.org |publisher=IOP Publishing |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data science company [[Altmetric]], rated the paper in the top 5% of all research, in terms of interest generated and it has been cited many times by scientific publications and news outlets. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program |url=https://www.altmetric.com/details/10396896/news |website=altmetric.com |publisher=Altmetric |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the [[New York Times]], where West said the new study should help sway people who might otherwise be convinced by a chemtrails website. “You’re trying to hold back the tide to a certain degree, and hopefully have less people fall into that way of thinking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fountain |first1=Henry |title=Scientists Just Say No to ‘Chemtrails’ Conspiracy Theory |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/science/scientists-just-say-no-to-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West has written articles for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]'s journal [[Skeptical Inquirer]], such as “Curated Crowdsourcing in UFO Investigations” where he discusses the Skydentify forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Mick |title=Curated Croudsourcing in UFO Investigations. |url=https://www.csicop.org/sb/show/curated_crowdsourcing_in_ufo_investigations |website=csicop.org |publisher=CSI |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “In Defense of Debunkers” in which he talks of the role of skepticism and of debunking and the importance of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Mick |title=In Defense of Debunkers |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/in_defense_of_debunkers |website=csicop.org |publisher=CSI |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, West delivered a presentation at [[CSICon]] titled “Expert Elicitation vs. Chemtrails” in which he discussed his 2016 scientific paper on climate engineering.&lt;ref name = sg&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gerbic |first1=Susan |authorlink= Susan Gerbic |title=From Chemtrails to CSICon: An Interview with Mick West |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/from_chemtrails_to_csicon_an_interview_with_mick_west |website=csicorp.org |publisher=CSI |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
In 2018, West authored ''Escaping the Rabbit Hole. How to Debunk Conspiracy Theories Using Facts, Logic, and Respect'' with the goal of helping people understand and explain conspiracy theories, and then pass those explanations onto others. In a review of the book, British actor [[Stephen Fry]] wrote “Mick West demonstrates with exquisite style, wit, and insight how those three rare and valuable species, Fact, Logic and Respect (each now on the very brink of extinction) have in harness the power to shine light into darkness and dispel the miasma of bias, superstition and balefully proud ignorance that is threatening to poison our age.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Escaping the Rabbit Hole |url=https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781510735804/escaping-the-rabbit-hole/ |website=skyhorsepublishing.com |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extended excerpt from this book was published in [[Salon (website)|Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Mick |title=How to pull a friend out of the conspiracy theory rabbit hole |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/09/16/how-to-pull-a-friend-out-of-the-conspiracy-theory-rabbit-hole/ |website=Salon |publisher=Salon Media Group, Inc |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Media ===
West is often cited as an expert analyst on chemtrails and UFOs by the media. In 2010, he appeared on [[CBS]] evening news and [[KPCC]] radio news to comment on a viral video of what appeared to be a "mystery" missile launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=David |title="Missile Mystery" Laid to Rest |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/missile-mystery-laid-to-rest/ |website=cbsnews.com |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mystery solved: 'Mystery missile' just a jet |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/11/11/20923/mystery-solved-mystery-missile-just-jet/ |website=scpr.org |publisher=Southern California Public Radio |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September of 2016, [[Radio New Zealand]] profiled West as a science writer and someone who “is dedicated to the art of debunking wild theories that circulate online and helping other people do the same, with his website, Metabunk.” In the interview he described how his passion for debunking comes from a concern that real problems are being ignored because science is ignored. In particular he talked about the harm conspiracy theorists can cause when they accuse the families of victims of gun massacres as being crisis actors. He also explained that when “dealing with conspiracy theorists the best thing is to be polite. You’ve got to be a kind of gentleman scientist. If people are polite then you will get listened to. Never misrepresent yourself, never lie, never fake evidence, never indulge in hoaxes. You’ve got to be 100% beyond reproach at all times.”&lt;ref name = rnz&gt;{{cite web |title=The man who debunks conspiracy theories |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/201817013/the-man-who-debunks-conspiracy-theories |website=radionz.co.nz |publisher=Radio New Zealand |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has also made a number of appearances on podcasts discussing his life and debunking career.

Muhammad gained few early [[Sahabah|followers]], and experienced [[Persecution of Muslims by Meccans|hostility from Meccan]] polytheists. To escape ongoing persecution, he [[Migration to Abyssinia|sent some followers]] to [[Kingdom of Aksum|Abyssinia]] in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to [[Medina]] (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. This event, the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'', marks the beginning of the [[Islamic calendar]], also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the [[Constitution of Medina]]. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent wars with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on the city of Mecca]]. The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]], he fell ill and died. By his death, most of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] had [[conversion to Islam|converted to Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Muhammad", Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world

&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations (each known as ''[[Ayah]]'', lit.&amp;nbsp;"Sign [of God]"), which Muhammad reported receiving until his death, form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim "Word of God" and around which the religion is based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (''[[sunnah]]''), found in the [[Hadith]] and ''[[Prophetic biography|sira]]'' (biography) literature, are also upheld and used as [[sources of sharia|sources]] of Islamic law (see [[Sharia]]).

===Early biographies===
{{main|Prophetic biography}}
Important sources regarding Muhammad's life may be found in the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries [[Hijri year|of the Muslim era]] (AH&amp;nbsp;– 8th and 9th century CE).&lt;ref name="Watt-Mecca-xi"&gt;Watt (1953), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; These include traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which provide additional information about Muhammad's life.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;Reeves (2003), pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving written ''sira'' (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s ''[[Prophetic biography|Life of God's Messenger]]'' written c. 767 CE (150 AH). Although the work was lost, this sira was used at great length by [[Ibn Hisham]] and to a lesser extent by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]].&lt;ref name="Nigosian6"&gt;S.A. Nigosian (2004), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donner (1998), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ibn Hisham admits in the preface to his biography of Muhammad that he omitted matters from Ibn Ishaq's biography that "would distress certain people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Holland, Tom |title=In the Shadow of the Sword |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5u3Ukw7AftwC&amp;pg=PT28&amp;lpg=PT28&amp;dq=%22in+the+shadow+of+the+sword%22+%22would+distress+certain+people%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20the%20shadow%20of%20the%20sword%22%20%22would%20distress%20certain%20people%22&amp;f=false |year=2012 |publisher=Doubleday |pages=42|isbn=9780748119516 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early history source is the history of Muhammad's campaigns by [[al-Waqidi]] (death 207 of Muslim era), and [[The Book of the Major Classes|the work]] of his secretary [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]] (death 230 of Muslim era).&lt;ref name="Watt-Mecca-xi"/&gt;

Many scholars accept these early biographies as authentic, though their accuracy is unascertainable.&lt;ref name="Nigosian6"/&gt; Recent studies have led scholars to distinguish between traditions touching legal matters and purely historical events. In the legal group, traditions could have been subject to invention while historic events, aside from exceptional cases, may have been only subject to "tendential shaping".&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1953), p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadith===
{{main|Hadith}}
Other important sources include the [[hadith]] collections, accounts of the verbal and physical teachings and traditions of Muhammad. Hadiths were compiled several generations after his death by followers including [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]], [[Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi]], [[Al-Nasa'i|Abd ar-Rahman al-Nasai]], [[Abu Dawood]], [[Ibn Majah]], [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[al-Daraqutni]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 1993, pp. 33–34"&gt;Lewis (1993), pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.C. Brown |last1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan A.C. Brown |date=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nyMKDEAb4GsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Canonization of al-Bukhārī and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunnī Ḥadīth Canon |page=9 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=978-9004158399 |quote=We can discern three strata of the Sunni ḥadīth canon. The perennial core has been the ''Ṣaḥīḥayn''. Beyond these two foundational classics, some fourth-/tenth-century scholars refer to a four-book selection that adds the two ''Sunans'' of Abū Dāwūd (d. 275/889) and al-Nāsaʾī (d. 303/915). The Five Book canon, which is first noted in the sixth/twelfth century, incorporates the ''Jāmiʿ'' of al-Tirmidhī (d. 279/892). Finally, the Six Book canon, which hails from the same period, adds either the ''Sunan'' of Ibn Mājah (d. 273/887), the ''Sunan'' of al-Dāraquṭnī (d. 385/995) or the ''Muwaṭṭaʾ'' of Mālik b. Anas (d. 179/796). Later ḥadīth compendia often included other collections as well. None of these books, however, has enjoyed the esteem of al-Bukhārīʼs and Muslimʼs works. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018150501/https://books.google.com/books?id=nyMKDEAb4GsC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=18 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Western academics cautiously view the hadith collections as accurate historical sources.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1993, pp. 33–34"/&gt; Scholars such as [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]] do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods, but judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1997), pp. xi, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim scholars on the other hand typically place a greater emphasis on the hadith literature instead of the biographical literature, since hadiths maintain a verifiable chain of transmission ([[isnad]]); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it less verifiable in their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAXNxxkJKYsC&amp;pg=PA99 |author=Nurullah Ardic |page=99 |title=Islam and the Politics of Secularism |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136489846 |date=21 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122105439/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAXNxxkJKYsC&amp;pg=PA99 |archivedate=22 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Islamic Arabia==
{{main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Jahiliyyah|Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia}}

[[File:Tribes english.png|thumb|Main tribes and settlements of Arabia in Muhammad's lifetime]]

The [[Arabian Peninsula]] was largely arid and volcanic, making agriculture difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; two of the most prominent being [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes.&lt;ref name="Muhammad-Mecca-12"&gt;Watt (1953), pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Communal life was essential for survival in the [[desert]] conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1953), pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous Arabs were either [[nomad]]ic or [[Sedentism|sedentary]]. Nomadic groups constantly traveled seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the sedentary settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.&lt;ref name="Rue"&gt;Loyal Rue, ''Religion Is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological'',2005, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito4"&gt;John Esposito, ''Islam'', Expanded edition, Oxford University Press, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-Islamic Arabia, gods or goddesses were viewed as protectors of individual tribes, their spirits being associated with sacred trees, [[Baetylus|stones]], springs and wells. As well as being the site of an annual pilgrimage, the [[Kaaba]] shrine in Mecca housed 360 idols of tribal patron deities. Three goddesses were associated with Allah as his daughters: [[Allāt]], [[Manāt]] and [[al-'Uzzá]]. Monotheistic communities existed in Arabia, including Christians and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

During the early years of Muhammad's life, the [[Quraysh]] tribe he belonged to became a dominant force in western Arabia.&lt;ref name="Robin286"&gt;{{cite book |author=Christian Julien Robin |title=Arabia and Ethiopia.

He then came under the care of his uncle [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]], the new leader of the Banu Hashim.&lt;ref name="Watt7"/&gt; According to Islamic historian [[William Montgomery Watt]] there was a general disregard by guardians in taking care of weaker members of the tribes in Mecca during the 6th century, "Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, but it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time."&lt;ref name="Watt8"&gt;Watt (1974), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teens, Muhammad accompanied his uncle on Syrian trading journeys to gain experience in commercial trade.&lt;ref name="Watt8"/&gt; Islamic tradition states that when Muhammad was either nine or twelve while accompanying the Meccans' caravan to Syria, he met a Christian monk or hermit named [[Bahira]] who is said to have foreseen Muhammad's career as a prophet of God.&lt;ref&gt;Armand Abel, ''Bahira'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Muhammad during his later youth, available information is fragmented, making it difficult to separate history from legend.&lt;ref name="Watt8"/&gt; It is known that he became a merchant and "was involved in trade between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]."&lt;ref name="BerkWorldHistory"&gt;''Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History'' (2005), v. 3, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his upright character he acquired the nickname "[[Amin (name)|al-Amin]]" (Arabic: الامين), meaning "faithful, trustworthy" and "al-Sadiq" meaning "truthful"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Khan |first1=Majid Ali |title=Muhammad the final messenger |edition=1998 |page=332 |year=1998 |publisher=Islamic Book Service |location=India |isbn=978-81-85738-25-3 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator.&lt;ref name="EncWorldHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadijah]], a 40-year-old widow. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one.&lt;ref name="BerkWorldHistory"/&gt;

Several years later, according to a narration collected by historian [[Ibn Ishaq]], Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the [[Black Stone]] in place in the wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.&lt;ref name="Dairesi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sacred Trusts: Pavilion of the Sacred Relics, Topkapı Palace Museum, Istanbul |editor=Uğurluel, Talha |editor2=Doğru, Ahmet |author1=Dairesi, Hırka-i Saadet |author2=Aydin, Hilmi |publisher=Tughra Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-932099-72-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Mustafa Al-A'zami]] (2003), ''The History of The Qur'anic Text: From Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments'', p. 24.

[[Sahih Bukhari]] narrates Muhammad describing his revelations as "sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell". [[Aisha]] reported, "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php |title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement |publisher=Cmje.org |accessdate=26 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110054749/http://www.cmje.org/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/001-sbt.php |archivedate=10 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alford T. Welch|Welch]] these descriptions may be considered genuine, since they are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Quran, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their [[eschatological]] punishment (Quran {{cite quran|38|70 |s=ns |b=n}}, Quran {{cite quran|6|19 |s=ns |b=n}}). Occasionally the Quran did not explicitly refer to Judgment day but provided examples from the history of extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Quran {{cite quran|41|13 |e=16 |s=ns |b=n}}).&lt;ref name="EoQ-Muhammad"/&gt; Muhammad did not only warn those who rejected God's revelation, but also dispensed good news for those who abandoned evil, listening to the divine words and serving God.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Peterson, ''Good News'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's mission also involves preaching monotheism: The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Muhammad"/&gt; {{Quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#ffeeaa|align=right|width=30%|salign=right|quote=''Recite in the name of your Lord who created—Created man from a clinging substance.

The key themes of the early Quranic verses included the responsibility of man towards his creator; the resurrection of the dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God in all aspects of life. Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not committing [[Women in pre-Islamic Arabia#Female infanticide|female]] [[infanticide]].&lt;ref name = "EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

===Opposition===

[[File:Surat An-Najm.jpg|thumb|right|The last [[ayah]] from the [[sura]] [[An-Najm]]: ''"So prostrate to Allah and worship."'' Muhammad's message of [[monotheism]] challenged the traditional order.]]
According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad's wife [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]] was the first to believe he was a prophet.&lt;ref name="Watt53-86"&gt;Watt (1953), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; She was followed by Muhammad's ten-year-old cousin [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], close friend [[Abu Bakr]], and adopted son [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zaid]].&lt;ref name="Watt53-86"/&gt; Around 613, Muhammad began to preach to the public (Quran {{cite quran|26|214 |s=ns |b=n}}).&lt;ref name="Al-A'zami2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2007), pp. 37–39&lt;/ref&gt; Most Meccans ignored and mocked him, though a few became his followers. There were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants; people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it; and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners.&lt;ref name = "Cambridge 1977 36"&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ibn Saad, opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that condemned idol worship and the polytheism practiced by the Meccan forefathers.&lt;ref&gt;F.E. Peters (1994), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Quranic exegesis maintains that it began as Muhammad started public preaching.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Uri Rubin'', Quraysh'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt; As his followers increased, Muhammad became a threat to the local tribes and rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Ka'aba, the focal point of Meccan religious life that Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba.&lt;ref name = "Cambridge 1977 36" /&gt; Powerful merchants attempted to convince Muhammad to abandon his preaching; he was offered admission to the inner circle of merchants, as well as an advantageous marriage. He refused both of these offers.&lt;ref name = "Cambridge 1977 36" /&gt;

And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to mercy.''|source=— Quran (90:8–17)}}
Tradition records at great length the persecution and ill-treatment towards Muhammad and his followers.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat]], a slave of a prominent Meccan leader [[Amr ibn Hishām|Abu Jahl]], is famous as the first martyr of Islam; killed with a spear by her master when she refused to give up her faith. [[Bilal ibn Rabah|Bilal]], another Muslim slave, was tortured by [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]] who placed a heavy rock on his chest to force his conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan E. Brockopp, ''Slaves and Slavery'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Arafat, ''Bilal b. Rabah'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 615, some of Muhammad's followers [[Migration to Abyssinia|emigrated]] to the Ethiopian [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and founded a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor [[Aṣḥama ibn Abjar]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi|Ibn Sa'ad]] mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to [[Hegira|Hijra]], while a second group rejoined them in Medina. [[Ibn Hisham]] and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]], however, only talk about one migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution played a major role in Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of [[Urwah ibn Zubayr|ʿUrwa]] preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as [[Umar]] and [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Hamzah]] converted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horovitz |first1=Josef |author-link1=Josef Horovitz |last2= |first2= |date=1927 |title=The Earliest Biographies of the Prophet and Their Authors |journal=Islamic Culture |volume=1 |issue= 2|pages=279–284 |doi=10.1163/157005807780220576 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a completely different story on the reason why the Muslims returned from Ethiopia to Mecca. According to this account—initially mentioned by [[Al-Waqidi]] then rehashed by [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi|Ibn Sa'ad]] and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]], but not by [[Ibn Hisham]] and not by [[Ibn Ishaq]]&lt;ref&gt;"Muḥammad", [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Second Edition.

(Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans). cf Ibn Ishaq, A.

(The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad, Jonathan E. Brockopp, p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt; This episode, known as "The Story of the Cranes," is also known as "[[Satanic Verses]]". According to the story, this led to a general reconciliation between Muḥammad and the Meccans, and the Abyssinia Muslims began to return home. When they arrived Gabriel had informed Muḥammad the two verses were not part of the revelation, but had been inserted by Satan. Notable scholars at the time argued against the historic authenticity of these verses and the story itself on various grounds.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuran" in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 2nd Edition, Vol. 5 (1986), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"Muḥammad", [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Second Edition.

In 617, the leaders of [[Makhzum]] and [[Banu Abd-Shams]], two important Quraysh clans, declared a public [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites|boycott against Banu Hashim]], their commercial rival, to pressure it into withdrawing its protection of Muhammad.

Islamic tradition states that in 620, Muhammad experienced the ''[[Isra and Mi'raj]]'', a miraculous night-long journey said to have occurred with the angel [[Gabriel]]. At the journey's beginning, the ''Isra'', he is said to have traveled from [[Mecca]] on a [[Buraq|winged steed]] to "the farthest mosque." Later, during the ''Mi'raj'', Muhammad is said to have toured [[Jannah|heaven]] and [[Jahannam|hell]], and spoke with earlier prophets, such as [[Islamic view of Abraham|Abraham]], [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]], and [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].&lt;ref name="EoIMW"/&gt; [[Ibn Ishaq]], author of the first [[Sirah Rasul Allah|biography of Muhammad]], presents the event as a spiritual experience; later historians, such as [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]], present it as a physical journey.&lt;ref name="EoIMW"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2003), p. 482&lt;/ref&gt;

Some western scholars{{who|date=May 2014}} hold that the Isra and Mi'raj journey traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial ''al-Baytu l-Maʿmur'' (heavenly prototype of the Kaaba); later traditions indicate Muhammad's journey as having been from Mecca to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Sells, Michael.

Muhammad's wife Khadijah and uncle Abu Talib both died in 619, the year thus being known as the "[[Year of Sorrow]]". With the death of Abu Talib, leadership of the Banu Hashim clan passed to [[Abu Lahab]], a tenacious enemy of Muhammad. Soon afterward, Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection over Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in danger; the withdrawal of clan protection implied that blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then [[Muhammad's visit to Ta'if|visited Ta'if]], another important city in Arabia, and tried to find a protector, but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger.&lt;ref name = "EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen"/&gt; Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca.

Many people visited Mecca on business or as pilgrims to the [[Kaaba]]. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called Medina).&lt;ref name= "EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; The Arab population of Yathrib were familiar with monotheism and were prepared for the appearance of a prophet because a Jewish community existed there.&lt;ref name= "EoI-Muhammad" /&gt; They also hoped, by the means of Muhammad and the new faith, to gain supremacy over Mecca; the Yathrib were jealous of its importance as the place of pilgrimage. Converts to Islam came from nearly all Arab tribes in Medina; by June of the subsequent year, seventy-five Muslims came to Mecca for pilgrimage and to meet Muhammad. Meeting him secretly by night, the group made what is known as the "''[[Second pledge at al-Aqabah|Second Pledge of al-'Aqaba]]''", or, in Orientalists' view, the "''Pledge of War''".&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to [[Hijra (Islam)|emigrate]] to [[Yathrib]]. As with the [[migration to Abyssinia]], the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave.&lt;ref name = P87&gt;Peterson (2006), pp. 86–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hijra is the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE.

====Migration to Medina====
{{main|Muhammad in Medina}}
A delegation, consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider.&lt;ref name="Cambridge39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esp"&gt;Esposito (1998), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620.&lt;ref name="Cambridge39"/&gt; The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the [[Battle of Bu'ath]] in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and [[Eye for an eye|an eye for an eye]] were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.&lt;ref name="Cambridge39"&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

Muhammad instructed his followers to emigrate to Medina, until nearly all his followers left Mecca. Being alarmed at the departure, according to tradition, the Meccans plotted to assassinate Muhammad. With the help of [[Ali]], Muhammad fooled the Meccans watching him, and secretly slipped away from the town with Abu Bakr.&lt;ref&gt;Moojan Momen (1985), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By 622, Muhammad emigrated to Medina, a large agricultural [[oasis]]. Those who migrated from Mecca along with Muhammad became known as ''[[muhajirun]]'' (emigrants).&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

====Establishment of a new polity====
{{main|Constitution of Medina}}
Among the first things Muhammad did to ease the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was to draft a document known as the [[Constitution of Medina]], "establishing a kind of alliance or federation" among the eight Medinan tribes and Muslim emigrants from Mecca; this specified rights and duties of all citizens, and the relationship of the different communities in Medina (including the Muslim community to other communities, specifically the [[Jew]]s and other "[[People of the Book|Peoples of the Book]]").&lt;ref name="Cambridge39"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esp"/&gt; The community defined in the Constitution of Medina, ''[[Ummah]]'', had a religious outlook, also shaped by practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

The first group of converts to Islam in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the general acceptance of Islam by the [[pagan]] population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], this was influenced by the conversion of [[Sa'd ibn Mu'adh]] (a prominent Medinan leader) to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Medinans who converted to Islam and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ''[[Ansar (Islam)|ansar]]'' (supporters).&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad" /&gt; Then Muhammad instituted [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters]] and he chose [[Ali]] as his own brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ali ibn Abitalib |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |accessdate=25 October 2007 |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a043.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812205939/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f8/v1f8a043.html |archivedate=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad delivered [[Quran]]ic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans (see sura [[Al-Hajj]], Quran {{cite quran|22|39 |e=40 |s=ns |b=n}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kelsay]] (1993), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God that he should be facing Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer. Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer.&lt;ref name="Watt1974"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Montgomery Watt |title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLN2hNidLw4C&amp;pg=PA113 |accessdate=29 December 2011 |date=7 February 1974 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-881078-0 |pages=112–14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615195815/http://books.google.com/books?id=zLN2hNidLw4C&amp;pg=PA113 |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 624, Muhammad led some three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr.&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson (2002), p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. A Meccan force was sent to protect the caravan and went on to confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. The [[Battle of Badr]] commenced.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including [[Amr ibn Hishām|Abu Jahl]].&lt;ref&gt;Glubb (2002), pp. 179–86&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed.&lt;ref name="Lewisw"&gt;Lewis (2002), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W123"&gt;Watt (1961), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rodinson 168-9"&gt;Rodinson (2002), pp. 168–69&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(2002), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory strengthened Muhammad's position in Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Russ Rodgers, ''The Generalship of Muhammad: Battles and Campaigns of the Prophet of Allah'' (University Press of Florida; 2012) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the opposition to him became less vocal. Pagans who had not yet converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, [[Asma bint Marwan]] of the Aws Manat tribe and [[Abu 'Afak]] of the 'Amr b. 'Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims.&lt;ref name=watt-medina-178&gt;Watt (1956), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; They were killed by people belonging to their own or related clans, and Muhammad did not disapprove of the killings.&lt;ref name=watt-medina-178/&gt; This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Muhammad Ali, ''Muhammad The Prophet'', pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad expelled from Medina the [[Banu Qaynuqa]], one of three main Jewish tribes,&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=9780745654881 |last=Zeitlin |first=Irving M. |title=The Historical Muhammad |date=2007 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[al-Waqidi]], after [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubaiy]] spoke for them, Muhammad refrained from executing them and commanded that they be exiled from Medina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781136921131 |last=Faizer |first=Rizwi |title=The Life of Muhammad: Al-Waqidi's Kitab al-Maghazi |date=2010 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of [[Hejaz]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

====Conflict with Mecca====
{{main|Battle of Uhud}}
[[File:The Prophet Muhammad and the Muslim Army at the Battle of Uhud, from the Siyer-i Nebi, 1595.jpg|thumb|"The Prophet Muhammad and the Muslim Army at the [[Battle of Uhud]]", from a 1595 edition of the [[Mamluk]]-Turkic ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'']]
The Meccans were eager to avenge their defeat. To maintain economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been reduced at Badr.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1961), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties to Medina while Muhammad led expeditions against tribes allied with Mecca and sent raiders onto a Meccan caravan.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1961), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Sufyan]] gathered an army of 3000 men and set out for an attack on Medina.&lt;ref name = "Lewis 1960 45"&gt;Lewis (1960), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers a day later. The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, a dispute arose over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many senior figures suggested it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of the heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying crops, and huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the younger Muslims and readied the Muslim force for battle. Muhammad led his force outside to the mountain of Uhud (the location of the Meccan camp) and fought the [[Battle of Uhud]] on 23 March 625.&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Robinson, ''Uhud'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1964), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Muslim army had the advantage in early encounters, lack of discipline on the part of strategically placed archers led to a Muslim defeat; 75 Muslims were killed including [[Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]], Muhammad's uncle who became one of the best known [[Martyrdom in Islam|martyrs in the Muslim tradition]]. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims, instead, they marched back to Mecca declaring victory. The announcement is probably because Muhammad was wounded and thought dead. When they discovered that Muhammad lived, the Meccans did not return due to false information about new forces coming to his aid. The attack had failed to achieve their aim of completely destroying the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cook (2007), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslims buried the dead and returned to Medina that evening. Questions accumulated about the reasons for the loss; Muhammad delivered Quranic verses {{cite quran|3|152 |s=ns |b=n}} indicating that the defeat was twofold: partly a punishment for disobedience, partly a test for steadfastness.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Watt (1981), p. 432
* Watt (1964), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Sufyan directed his effort towards another attack on Medina. He gained support from the nomadic tribes to the north and east of Medina; using propaganda about Muhammad's weakness, promises of booty, memories of Quraysh prestige and through bribery.&lt;ref name = "Watt Medina 30"&gt;Watt (1956), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's new policy was to prevent alliances against him. Whenever alliances against Medina were formed, he sent out expeditions to break them up.&lt;ref name = "Watt Medina 30" /&gt; Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, and reacted in a severe manner.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the assassination of [[Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf]], a chieftain of the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Nadir]]. Al-Ashraf went to Mecca and wrote poems that roused the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the Battle of Badr.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Uri |year=1990 |title=The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf |journal=Oriens |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=65–71 |jstor=1580625 |doi=10.2307/1580625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Banu Nadir from Medina&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt; forcing their emigration to Syria; he allowed them to take some possessions, as he was unable to subdue the Banu Nadir in their strongholds. The rest of their property was claimed by Muhammad in the name of God as it was not gained with bloodshed. Muhammad surprised various Arab tribes, individually, with overwhelming force, causing his enemies to unite to annihilate him. Muhammad's attempts to prevent a confederation against him were unsuccessful, though he was able to increase his own forces and stopped many potential tribes from joining his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Siege of Medina====
{{main|Battle of the Trench}}
[[File:Masjid al-Qiblatain.jpg|thumb|The [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]], where Muhammad established the new [[Qibla]], or direction of prayer]]
With the help of the exiled [[Banu Nadir]], the Quraysh military leader [[Abu Sufyan]] mustered a force of 10,000 men. Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, [[Salman the Persian]]. The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), pp. 36, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Sufyan's troops were unprepared for the fortifications, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to return home.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Rodinson (2002), pp. 209–11
* Watt (1964), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran discusses this battle in sura Al-Ahzab, in verses {{cite quran|33|9 |e=27 |s=ns |b=n}}.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
During the battle, the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]], located to the south of Medina, entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad. Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him. No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad's scouts.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1964) pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; After the coalition's retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to [[Ibn Ishaq]], all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson (2007), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan (2007), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Walid N. Arafat and [[Barakat Ahmad]] have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq's narrative.&lt;ref name="Meri1"&gt;Meri, ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq's Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary [[Malik ibn Anas]], and a transmitter of "odd tales" by the later [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]].&lt;ref name="Arafat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arafat |first1= |year= |title=New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina |url= |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=1976 |issue= |pages=100–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved.&lt;ref name="Ahmad85"&gt;Ahmad, pp. 85–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nemoy, "Barakat Ahmad's "Muhammad and the Jews", p. 325. Nemoy is sourcing Ahmad's ''Muhammad and the Jews''.&lt;/ref&gt; Watt finds Arafat's arguments "not entirely convincing", while [[Meir J. Kister]] has contradicted{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad.&lt;ref&gt;Kister, "The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the siege of Medina, the Meccans exerted the available strength to destroy the Muslim community. The failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an [[Aisha#Accusation of adultery|accusation of adultery]] was made against [[Aisha]], Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, [[An-Nur]]).&lt;ref name="Watt-encyc-online"/&gt;

====Truce of Hudaybiyyah====
{{main|Treaty of Hudaybiyyah}}
{{Quote box|align=right|quote=
"In your name, O God!&lt;br /&gt;This is the treaty of peace between Muhammad Ibn Abdullah and Suhayl Ibn Amr. They have agreed to allow their arms to rest for ten years. During this time each party shall be secure, and neither shall injure the other; no secret damage shall be inflicted, but honesty and honour shall prevail between them. Whoever in Arabia wishes to enter into a treaty or covenant with Muhammad can do so, and whoever wishes to enter into a treaty or covenant with the Quraysh can do so. And if a Qurayshite comes without the permission of his guardian to Muhammad, he shall be delivered up to the Quraysh; but if, on the other hand, one of Muhammad's people comes to the Quraysh, he shall not be delivered up to Muhammad. This year, Muhammad, with his companions, must withdraw from Mecca, but next year, he may come to Mecca and remain for three days, yet without their weapons except those of a traveller; the swords remaining in their sheaths."
|source=—The statement of the treaty of Hudaybiyyah&lt;ref name=Text&gt;{{cite book |title=Learning Islam 8 |year=2009 |publisher=Islamic Services Foundation |isbn=978-1-933301-12-9 |page=D14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Although Muhammad had delivered Quranic verses commanding the [[Hajj]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|196 |e=210 |s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In the month of [[Shawwal]] 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to prepare for a pilgrimage (''[[umrah]]'') to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1987), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca.&lt;ref name = "Hudaybiya"/&gt; According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.&lt;ref name = "Hudaybiya"&gt;Watt, ''al- Hudaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya'' [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kabaa.jpg|thumb|The [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] long held a major economic and religious role for the area. Seventeen months after Muhammad's arrival in Medina, it became the Muslim [[Qibla]], or direction for prayer ([[salat]]). The Kaaba has been rebuilt several times; the present structure, built in 1629, is a reconstruction of an earlier building dating to 683.&lt;ref name="Peters2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=F.E.

Negotiations commenced with emissaries traveling to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, [[Uthman|Uthman bin al-Affan]], had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad called upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee (or to stick with Muhammad, whatever decision he made) if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the "Pledge of Acceptance" or the "[[Pledge of the Tree|Pledge under the Tree]]". News of Uthman's safety allowed for negotiations to continue, and a treaty scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and Quraysh.&lt;ref name = "Hudaybiya" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (2002), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The main points of the treaty included: cessation of hostilities, the deferral of Muhammad's pilgrimage to the following year, and agreement to send back any Meccan who emigrated to Medina without permission from their protector.&lt;ref name = "Hudaybiya"/&gt;

Many Muslims were not satisfied with the treaty. However, the Quranic sura "[[Al-Fath]]" (The Victory) (Quran {{cite quran|48|1 |e=29 |s=ns |b=n}}) assured them that the expedition must be considered a victorious one.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1987), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; It was later that Muhammad's followers realized the benefit behind the treaty. These benefits included the requirement of the Meccans to identify Muhammad as an equal, cessation of military activity allowing Medina to gain strength, and the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the pilgrimage rituals.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

After signing the truce, Muhammad assembled an expedition against the Jewish oasis of [[Khaybar]], known as the [[Battle of Khaybar]]. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya.&lt;ref name = "Lewis 1960 45" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaglieri, ''Khaybar'', Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim tradition, [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State|Muhammad also sent letters]] to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources).&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref name=King_Lings&gt;Lings (1987), p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kings_Khan&gt;Khan (1998), pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; He sent messengers (with letters) to [[Heraclius]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (the eastern Roman Empire), [[Khosrau II|Khosrau]] of [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], the chief of [[Yemen]] and to some others.&lt;ref name=King_Lings/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kings_Khan/&gt; In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on [[Transjordania]]n Byzantine soil in the [[Battle of Mu'tah]].&lt;ref&gt;F.

The [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah|truce of Hudaybiyyah]] was enforced for two years.&lt;ref name=khan_274&gt;Khan (1998), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lings_291"&gt;Lings (1987), p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe of [[Banu Khuza'a]] had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the [[Banu Bakr ibn Abd Manat|Banu Bakr]], had allied with the Meccans.&lt;ref name=khan_274/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lings_291" /&gt; A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them.&lt;ref name=khan_274/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lings_291/&gt; The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting.&lt;ref name=khan_274/&gt; After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.&lt;ref name=khan_274_275&gt;Khan (1998), pp. 274–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meccans replied that they accepted the last condition.&lt;ref name=khan_274_275/&gt; Soon they realized their mistake and sent [[Abu Sufyan]] to renew the Hudaybiyyah treaty, a request that was declined by Muhammad.

Muhammad began to prepare for a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Lings (1987), p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; In 630, Muhammad marched on Mecca with 10,000 Muslim converts. With minimal casualties, Muhammad seized control of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He declared an amnesty for past offences, except for ten men and women who were "guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace".&lt;ref name=Subhani&gt;''The Message'' by Ayatullah Ja'far Subhani, [http://www.al-islam.org/message/49.htm#n582 chapter 48] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502163638/http://www.al-islam.org/message/49.htm |date=2 May 2012 }} referencing Sirah by [[Ibn Hisham]], vol.

====Conquest of Arabia====
{{main|Battle of Hunayn|Expedition to Tabouk}}

[[File:Muslim Conquest.PNG|thumb|Conquests of Muhammad (green lines) and the Rashidun caliphs (black lines). Shown: Byzantine empire (North and West) &amp; Sassanid-Persian empire (Northeast).]]
Following the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a military threat from the confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The [[Hawazin|Banu Hawazin]] were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the [[Banu Thaqif]] (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to the decline of the prestige of Meccans.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the [[Battle of Hunayn]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

In the same year, Muhammad organized an attack against northern Arabia because of their previous defeat at the [[Battle of Mu'tah]] and reports of hostility adopted against Muslims. With great difficulty he assembled 30,000 men; half of whom on the second day returned with [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], untroubled by the damning verses which Muhammad hurled at them. Although Muhammad did not engage with hostile forces at Tabuk, he received the submission of some local chiefs of the region.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.A. al-Bakhit, ''Tabuk'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also ordered the destruction of any remaining pagan idols in Eastern Arabia. The last city to hold out against the Muslims in Western Arabia was [[Taif]]. Muhammad refused to accept the city's surrender until they agreed to convert to Islam and allowed men to destroy the statue of their goddess [[Al-Lat]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq (translated by Guillaume, A. 1955) The Life of Muhammad.

A year after the Battle of Tabuk, the Banu Thaqif sent emissaries to surrender to Muhammad and adopt Islam. Many bedouins submitted to Muhammad to safeguard against his attacks and to benefit from the spoils of war.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; However, the bedouins were alien to the system of Islam and wanted to maintain independence: namely their code of virtue and ancestral traditions. Muhammad required a military and political agreement according to which they "acknowledge the suzerainty of Medina, to refrain from attack on the Muslims and their allies, and to pay the [[Zakat]], the Muslim religious levy."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1993), pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In 632, at the end of the tenth year after migration to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as ''[[Hajj]]''.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; On the 9th of [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] Muhammad delivered his [[Farewell Sermon]], at [[Mount Arafat]] east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sultan |first=Sohaib |title=The Koran For Dummies |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |date=March 2011 |isbn=978-0-7645-5581-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He abolished old [[blood feud]]s and disputes based on the former [[tribal]] system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (''awan'') in your households. You took them in God's trust, and [[Islamic marriage contract|legitimated your sexual relations]] with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness.

====Death and tomb====
A few months after the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and suffered for several days with fever, head pain, and weakness. He died on Monday, 8 June 632, in Medina, at the age of 62 or 63, in the house of his wife Aisha.&lt;ref name="USN&amp;WR"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/religion/2008/04/07/the-last-prophet.html?PageNr=3 ''The Last Prophet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123041056/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/religion/2008/04/07/the-last-prophet.html?PageNr=3 |date=23 January 2009 }}, p. 3.

===After Muhammad===

The succession to Muhammad is the central issue that divided the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] into several [[Islamic schools and branches|divisions]] in the first century of [[Muslim history]]. A few months prior to his death, Muhammad [[The event of Ghadir Khumm|delivered a sermon at Ghadir Khumm]] where he announced that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] would be his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Majd|first1=Vahid|title=The Sermon of Prophet Muhammad (saww) at Ghadir Khum}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sermon, Muhammad ordered the Muslims to [[The event of Ghadir Khumm#Oath of allegiance|pledge allegiance to Ali]]. Both [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] sources agree that [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] were among the many who pledged allegiance to Ali at this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team |website=Al-Islam.org |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Volume 4 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=al-Razi |first1=Fakhr |title=Tafsir al-Kabir, Volume 12 |pages=49-50}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just after Muhammad died, a group of Muslims met at [[Saqifa]], where Umar pledged allegiance to [[Abu Bakr]]. Abu Bakr then assumed political power, and his supporters became known as the Sunnis. Despite that, a group of Muslims kept their allegiance to Ali. These people, who became known as Shias, held that while Ali's right to be the political leader may have been taken, he was still the religious and spiritual leader after Muhammad.

Eventually, after the deaths of Abu Bakr and two other Sunni leaders, Umar and Uthman, the Sunni Muslims went to Ali for political leadership. After Ali died, his son [[Hasan ibn Ali]] succeeded him, both politically and, according to Shias, religiously. However, after six months, he made [[Hasan-Muawiya treaty|a peace treaty]] with [[Muawiya I|Muawiya ibn Abu Sufyan]], which stipulated that, among other conditions, Muawiya would have political power as long as he did not choose who would succeed him. Muawiya broke the treaty and made his son [[Yazid ibn Muawiya|Yazid]] his successor, thus forming the [[Umayyad dynasty]]. While this was going on, Hasan and, after his death, his brother [[Husain ibn Ali]], remained the religious leaders, at least according to the Shia. Thus, according to the Sunnis, whoever held political power was considered the successor to Muhammad, while the Shias held the twelve Imams (Ali, Hasan, Husain, and Husain's descendants) were the successors to Muhammad, even if they did not hold political power.

In addition to these two main branches, many other opinions also formed regarding succession to Muhammad.

==Islamic social reforms==
{{main|Early social changes under Islam}}

According to [[William Montgomery Watt]], religion for Muhammad was not a private and individual matter but "the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself. He was responding &amp;#91;not only&amp;#93;... to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject."&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Islam (1970), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Lewis]] says there are two important political traditions in Islam—Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca. In his view, Islam is a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies.&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;Lewis [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4557 (1998)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408105440/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4557 |date=8 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally agree that Islamic social changes in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, slavery and the rights of women and children improved on the ''status quo'' of Arab society.&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* Robinson (2004), p. 21
* Esposito (1998), p. 98
* R. Walzer, ''Ak̲h̲lāḳ'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Lewis, Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents".{{which|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; Muhammad's message transformed society and [[Islamic ethics|moral orders]] of life in the Arabian Peninsula; society focused on the changes to perceived identity, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic ethics'', [[Encyclopedia of Ethics]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2014}}
Economic reforms addressed the plight of the poor, which was becoming an issue in [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran requires payment of an alms tax ([[zakat]]) for the benefit of the poor; as Muhammad's power grew he demanded that tribes who wished to ally with him implement the zakat in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (1998), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad's life is traditionally defined into two periods: [[Muhammad in Mecca|pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca]] (from 570 to 622), and [[Muhammad in Medina|post-hijra in Medina]] (from 622 until 632). Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives in total (although two have ambiguous accounts, [[Rayhana bint Zayd]] and [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], as wife or concubine.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Marco Schöller, '' Banu Qurayza'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]] mentioning the differing accounts of the status of [[Rayhana]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbara Freyer"&gt;Barbara Freyer Stowasser, ''Wives of the Prophet'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]&lt;/ref&gt;) Eleven of the thirteen marriages occurred after the [[Hijra (Islam)|migration to Medina]].

At the age of 25, Muhammad married the wealthy [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]] who was 40 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Subhani |first=Jafar |title=The Message |url=http://www.al-islam.org/message |publisher=Ansariyan Publications, Qom |chapter=Chapter 9 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007221418/http://www.al-islam.org/message/ |archivedate=7 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage lasted for 25&amp;nbsp;years and was a happy one.&lt;ref name="Esp2"&gt;Esposito (1998), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage.&lt;ref name = "Bullough 1998 119"&gt;Bullough (1998), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reeves46"&gt;Reeves (2003), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; After Khadijah's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry [[Sawda bint Zama]], a Muslim widow, or [[Aisha]], daughter of [[Um Ruman]] and [[Abu Bakr]] of [[Mecca]]. Muhammad is said to have asked for arrangements to marry both.&lt;ref name="Watt-encyc-online"&gt;Watt, ''Aisha'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khadijah were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After migration to Medina, Muhammad, who was then in his fifties, married several more women.

Muhammad performed household chores such as preparing food, sewing clothes, and repairing shoes. He is also said to have had accustomed his wives to dialogue; he listened to their advice, and the wives debated and even argued with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ramadan]] (2007), pp. 168–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asma Barlas (2002), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (1992), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Khadijah is said to have had four daughters with Muhammad ([[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad]], [[Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad]], [[Zainab bint Muhammad]], [[Fatimah|Fatimah Zahra]]) and two sons ([[Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad]] and [[Qasim ibn Muhammad]], who both died in childhood). All but one of his daughters, Fatimah, died before him.&lt;ref name="Nich"/&gt; Some Shi'a scholars contend that Fatimah was Muhammad's only daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Ordoni (1990), pp. 32, 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]] bore him a son named [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad]], but the child died when he was two years old.&lt;ref name="Nich"&gt;Nicholas Awde (2000), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine of Muhammad's wives survived him.&lt;ref name="Barbara Freyer"/&gt; Aisha, who became known as Muhammad's favourite wife in Sunni tradition, survived him by decades and was instrumental in helping assemble the scattered sayings of Muhammad that form the Hadith literature for the Sunni branch of Islam.&lt;ref name="Watt-encyc-online"/&gt;

Muhammad's descendants through Fatimah are known as ''[[sharif]]s'', ''syeds'' or ''[[sayyid]]s''. These are honorific titles in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''sharif'' meaning 'noble' and ''sayed'' or ''sayyid'' meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shi'a, though the Shi'a place much more emphasis and value on their distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ali |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zayd ibn Haritha]] was a slave that Muhammad bought, freed, and then adopted as his son. He also had a [[wet nurse|wetnurse]].&lt;ref name=Zad116&gt;Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya recorded the list of some names of Muhammad's female-slaves in [[Zad al-Ma'ad]], Part I, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; According to a BBC summary, "the Prophet Muhammad did not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. But he insisted that slave owners treat their slaves well and stressed the virtue of freeing slaves. Muhammad treated slaves as human beings and clearly held some in the highest esteem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml |title=Slavery in Islam |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624234057/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml |archivedate=24 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim tradition===
{{main|Muhammad in Islam}}

Following the attestation to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]], the belief in Muhammad's prophethood is the main aspect of the [[Aqidah|Islamic faith]]. Every Muslim proclaims in ''[[Shahadah]]'': "I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God." The Shahadah is the basic creed or tenet of [[Islam]]. Islamic belief is that ideally the Shahadah is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death. Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer (''[[adhan]]'') and the [[salat|prayer]] itself. Non-Muslims wishing to [[Conversion to Islam|convert to Islam]] are required to recite the creed.&lt;ref&gt;Farah (1994), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic belief, Muhammad is regarded as the last prophet sent by God.&lt;ref name="espos12"&gt;Esposito (1998), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Malcolm |title=Islam for Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPXu561ZpvgC&amp;pg=PT100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |year=2003 |publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc. |location=[[Indiana]] |isbn= 9781118053966|page=100 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924043530/https://books.google.com/books?id=zPXu561ZpvgC&amp;pg=PT100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S.

And this Book confirms (it)...", while {{Cite quran|2|136 |s=ns |b=n}} commands the believers of Islam to "Say: we believe in God and that which is revealed unto us, and that which was revealed unto [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] and [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] and the tribes, and that which [[Moses]] and Jesus received, and which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered."

[[File:Sahadah-Topkapi-Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Muslim]] [[Profession (religious)|profession]] of faith, the [[Shahadah]], illustrates the Muslim conception of the role of Muhammad: "There is no god except [[Allah|the God]] and Muhammad is the [[Prophets in Islam|Messenger of God]]."

Muslim tradition credits [[Miracles of Muhammad|Muhammad with several miracles or supernatural events]].&lt;ref name="EoI-Miracle"&gt;A.J. Wensinck, ''Muʿd̲j̲iza'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many Muslim commentators and some Western scholars have interpreted the Surah {{cite quran|54|1 |e=2 |s=ns |b=n}} as referring to Muhammad [[Splitting of the moon|splitting the Moon]] in view of the Quraysh when they began persecuting his followers.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Miracle"&gt;Denis Gril, ''Miracles'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Martin Varisco, ''Moon'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt; Western historian of Islam Denis Gril believes the Quran does not overtly describe Muhammad performing [[Islamic view of miracles|miracles]], and the supreme miracle of Muhammad is [[Quran and miracles|identified with the Quran itself]].&lt;ref name="EoQ-Miracle"/&gt;

According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was attacked by the people of Ta'if and was badly injured. The tradition also describes an angel appearing to him and offering retribution against the assailants. It is said that Muhammad rejected the offer and prayed for the guidance of the people of Ta'if.&lt;ref&gt;[[A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims]] chapter "[http://www.al-islam.org/restatement/16.htm Muhammad's Visit to Ta’if] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926090245/http://www.al-islam.org/restatement/16.htm |date=26 September 2013 }}" on al-islam.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunnah]] represents actions and sayings of Muhammad (preserved in reports known as [[Hadith]]), and covers a broad array of activities and beliefs ranging from religious rituals, personal hygiene, burial of the dead to the mystical questions involving the love between humans and God. The Sunnah is considered a model of emulation for pious Muslims and has to a great degree influenced the Muslim culture. The greeting that Muhammad taught Muslims to offer each other, "may peace be upon you" (Arabic: ''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|as-salamu 'alaykum]]'') is used by Muslims throughout the world. Many details of major Islamic rituals such as daily prayers, the fasting and the annual pilgrimage are only found in the Sunnah and not the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Encyclopædia Britannica, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohamed peace be upon him.svg|thumb|right|Calligraphic rendering of "may God honor him and grant him peace", customarily added after Muhammad's name in writing. The phrase is encoded as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] at [[Unicode]] code point [[Arabic Unicode|U+FDFA]].&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-3.1/U31-FB50.pdf |title=Arabic Presentation Forms-A |date=1 October 2009 |website=The Unicode Standard, Version 5.2 |publisher=Unicode, Inc. |location=Mountain View, Ca. |format=PDF |accessdate=9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{script|Arab|ﷺ}}.]]

The Sunnah contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''Fiḳh'', Encyclopedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim mystics, known as [[sufi]]s, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a perfect human-being. All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Muhammad'', Encyclopædia Britannica, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims have traditionally expressed love and veneration for Muhammad. Stories of Muhammad's life, his intercession and of his miracles (particularly "[[Splitting of the moon]]") have permeated popular Muslim thought and [[Na`at|poetry]]. Among Arabic odes to Muhammad, [[Qaṣīda al-Burda|Qasidat al-Burda]] ("Poem of the Mantle") by the Egyptian [[Sufi]] [[al-Busiri]] (1211–1294) is particularly well known, and widely held to possess a healing, spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Stetkevych2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych |title=The mantle odes: Arabic praise poems to the Prophet Muḥammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-nY3_DXo-gC&amp;pg=PR12 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-22206-0 |page=xii |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615211359/http://books.google.com/books?id=F-nY3_DXo-gC&amp;pg=PR12 |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran refers to Muhammad as "a mercy (''rahmat'') to the worlds" (Quran {{cite quran|21|107 |s=ns |b=n}}).&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; The association of rain with mercy in Oriental countries has led to imagining Muhammad as a rain cloud dispensing blessings and stretching over lands, reviving the dead hearts, just as rain revives the seemingly dead earth (see, for example, the Sindhi poem of Shah ʿAbd al-Latif).&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; [[Mawlid|Muhammad's birthday]] is celebrated as a major feast throughout the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], excluding [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]]-dominated Saudi Arabia where these public celebrations are discouraged.&lt;ref name="Nasr-Muhammad"&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Muhammad'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with the Arabic phrase ''ṣallā llahu ʿalayhi wa-sallam'' (''may God honor him and grant him peace'') or the English phrase ''[[Peace be upon him (Islam)|peace be upon him]]''.&lt;ref name="Ann Goldman 2006 p. 212"&gt;Ann Goldman, Richard Hain, Stephen Liben (2006), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; In casual writing, the abbreviations SAW (for the Arabic phrase) or PBUH (for the English phrase) are sometimes used; in printed matter, a small calligraphic rendition is commonly used ({{lang|ar|ﷺ}}).

===Medieval Christians===
{{see also|Medieval Christian views on Muhammad}}
The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine]] sources. They indicate that both [[Jews]] and Christians saw Muhammad as a [[false prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", ''Church History'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (June 1969), pp. 139–42, quoting from ''Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati'' 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Another Greek source for Muhammad is [[Theophanes the Confessor]], a 9th-century writer. The earliest Syriac source is the 7th-century writer [[John bar Penkaye]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti, ''History of the Arabs'', 10th edition (1970), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hossein Nasr]], the earliest European literature often refers to Muhammad unfavorably. A few learned circles of [[Middle Ages]] Europe{{spaced ndash}}primarily Latin-literate scholars{{spaced ndash}}had access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad as a person who seduced the [[Saracens]] into his submission under religious guise.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

In later ages, Muhammad came to be seen as a schismatic: [[Brunetto Latini]]'s 13th century ''Li livres dou tresor'' represents him as a former monk and cardinal,&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], Canto 28), written in the early 1300s, puts Muhammad and his son-in-law, Ali, in Hell "among the sowers of discord and the schismatics, being lacerated by devils again and again."&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;

After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Muhammad was often portrayed in a similar way.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lewis 2002 45"&gt;Lewis (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillaume Postel]] was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=9781615920204 |last=Warraq |first=Ibn |title=Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism |date=2007 |page=147 |quote=Indeed, [Postel's] greater tolerance for other religions was much in evidence in Παvθεvωδια: ''compostio omnium dissidiorum'', where, astonishingly for the sixteenth century, he argued that Muhammad ought to be esteemed even in Christendom as a genuine prophet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottfried Leibniz]] praised Muhammad because "he did not deviate from the natural religion".&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], in his ''Vie de Mahomed'' which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad"/&gt; He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain.&lt;ref name=tolan&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Muḥammad |last=Brockopp |first=Jonathan E |publisher=Cambridge UP |year=2010 |isbn=978-0521713726 |location=New York |pages=240–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire had a somewhat mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play ''[[Mahomet (play)|Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète]]'' he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in a published essay in 1748 he calls him "a sublime and hearty charlatan", but in his historical survey ''Essai sur les mœurs'', he presents him as legislator and a conqueror and calls him an "enthusiast."&lt;ref name=tolan/&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in his ''[[The Social Contract|Social Contract]]'' (1762), "brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers."&lt;ref name=tolan/&gt; [[Claude-Emmanuel de Pastoret|Emmanuel Pastoret]] published in 1787 his ''Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad'', in which he presents the lives of these three "great men", "the greatest legislators of the universe", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers. He rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers "the most sublime truths of cult and morals"; it defines the unity of God with an "admirable concision." Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the "legislator of Arabia" was "a great man."&lt;ref name=tolan/&gt; [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] admired Muhammad and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/talkofnapoleonat007678mbp#page/n321/mode/2up ''Talk Of Napoleon At St. Helena''] (1903), pp. 279–80&lt;/ref&gt; and described him as a model lawmaker and a great man.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Jonathan E. |editor1-last=Brockopp |title=The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/middle-east-history/cambridge-companion-muhammad |series=Cambridge Companions to Religion |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71372-6 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019194114/http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/middle-east-history/cambridge-companion-muhammad |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Younos, Farid |title=Islamic Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUEaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Cambridge Companions to Religion |year=2010 |publisher=AuthorHouse |page=15 |isbn=978-1-4918-2344-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his book ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History|Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History]]'' (1840) describes Muhammad as "[a] silent great soul; [...] one of those who cannot ''but'' be in earnest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Carlyle |year=1841 |title=On heroes, hero worship and the heroic in history |page=87 |publisher=James Fraser |place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle's interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad's status as a great man in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kecia Ali |title=The Lives of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oWYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 |year=2014 |publisher=Harvard UP |page=48 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904001211/https://books.google.com/books?id=-oWYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all |isbn=9780674744486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Almond]] says that [[German Romantic]] writers generally held positive views of Muhammad: "[[Goethe]]’s “extraordinary” poet-prophet, [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]’s nation builder (...) [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]]’s admiration for Islam as an aesthetic product, enviably authentic, radiantly holistic, played such a central role in his view of Mohammed as an exemplary world-fashioner that he even used it as a scale of judgement for the classical (the dithyramb, we are told, has to radiate pure beauty if it is to resemble “a Koran of poetry”.)"&lt;ref&gt;Ian Almond, ''History of Islam in German Thought: From Leibniz to Nietzsche'', Routledge (2009), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; After quoting [[Heinrich Heine]], who said in a letter to some friend that "I must admit that you, great prophet of Mecca, are the greatest poet and that your Quran... will not easily escape my memory", [[John V. Tolan|John Tolan]] goes on to show how [[Jews]] in Europe in particular held more nuanced views about Muhammad and Islam, being an [[ethnoreligious]] minority feeling discriminated, they specifically lauded [[Al-Andalus]], and thus, "writing about Islam was for Jews a way of indulging in a fantasy world, far from the persecution and [[pogroms]] of nineteenth-century Europe, where Jews could live in harmony with their non-Jewish neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;Tolan, John. "The Prophet Muhammad: A Model of Monotheistic Reform for Nineteenth-Century Ashkenaz." ''Common Knowledge'', vol. 24 no. 2, 2018, pp. 256-279&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern historians===
Recent writers such as [[William Montgomery Watt]] and Richard Bell dismiss the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad "was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith"&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Bell (1995) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and Muhammad's readiness to endure hardship for his cause, with what seemed to be no rational basis for hope, shows his sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Watt, however, says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken his subconscious for divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Watt and [[Bernard Lewis]] argue that viewing Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor makes it impossible to understand Islam's development.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1993), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alford T. Welch]] holds that Muhammad was able to be so influential and successful because of his firm belief in his vocation.&lt;ref name="EoI-Muhammad" /&gt;

===Criticism===
{{main|Criticism of Muhammad}}
Criticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|non-Muslim Arab]] contemporaries for preaching [[monotheism]], and by the [[Jewish tribes of Arabia]] for his unwarranted appropriation of [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical narratives]] and [[Biblical Figures|figures]],&lt;ref name="JE2"&gt;{{Cquote|The Jews [...] could not let pass unchallenged the way in which [[Biblical and Quranic narratives|the Koran appropriated Biblical accounts and personages]]; for instance, its making Abraham an Arab and the founder of the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] at [[Mecca]]. The prophet, who looked upon every evident correction of his gospel as an attack upon his own reputation, brooked no contradiction, and unhesitatingly threw down the gauntlet to the Jews. Numerous passages in the Koran show how he gradually went from slight thrusts to malicious vituperations and brutal attacks on the customs and beliefs of the Jews. When they justified themselves by referring to the Bible, Mohammed, who had taken nothing therefrom at first hand, accused them of intentionally concealing its true meaning or of entirely misunderstanding it, and taunted them with being "asses who carry books" (sura lxii. 5). The increasing bitterness of this vituperation, which was similarly directed against the less numerous [[Arab Christians|Christians]] of [[Medina]], indicated that in time Mohammed would not hesitate to proceed to actual hostilities. The outbreak of the latter was deferred by the fact that the hatred of the prophet was turned more forcibly in another direction, namely, against the [[Quraysh|people of Mecca]], whose earlier refusal of Islam and whose attitude toward the community appeared to him at Medina as a personal insult which constituted a sufficient cause for [[Islam and war|war]].|author=Richard Gottheil, Mary W.

At about the same time Mohammed contracted an engagement with [[Aisha|'A'ishah]], the six-year-old daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], and married her shortly after his arrival at Medina. 'A'ishah was the only one of his wives who had not been previously married; and she remained his favorite to the end. [...] In his married life, as well as in his religious life, a change seems to have come over Mohammed after his removal to Medina. In the space of ten years he took twelve or thirteen wives and had several concubines: even the faithful were scandalized, and the prophet had to resort to alleged special revelations from God to justify his conduct. Such was the case when he wished to marry [[Zaynab bint Jahsh|Zainab]], the wife of his adopted son [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zaid]].|author=Richard Gottheil, Mary W.

They were brought out to him in groups. Among them were the enemy of God, Huyayy b. Akhtab, and Ka’b b. Asad, the head of the tribe. They numbered 600 or 700—the largest estimate says they were between 800 and 900. As they were being taken in groups to the Messenger of God, they said to Ka’b b. Asad, "Ka’b, what do you understand.

'''Partholón''' (Modern spelling: 'Parthalán') is a character in medieval Irish Christian pseudo-history. By tradition, he is credited with leading a large group to settle in Ireland. The tale is probably an invention of the Christian writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=oVaUkHKOyLAC|page=11}}|title=Eyewitness to Irish History|last=Ellis|first=Peter Berresford|date=2 Mar 2007|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-05312-6|edition=2 Rev|page=11|authorlink=Peter Berresford Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Partholón" comes from the Biblical name "Bartholomaeus" or "Bartholomew". The name may be borrowed from a character who appears in the Christian pseudo-histories of Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Carey (Celticist)|Carey, John]]. [http://www.ucc.ie/academic/smg/CDI/PDFs_articles/JCarey_QuigginPamphletsI.pdf ''The Irish National Origin-Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory'']. [[University of Cambridge]], 1994. p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Legend ==
Partholón was the leader of the second group of people to settle in [[Ireland]], the 'Muintir Partholóin' (People of Partholón). They arrived on the uninhabited island about 300 years after [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's Flood]] and were believed responsible for introducing activities such as farming, cooking, brewing and building. After some years, they all succumbed to [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in one week. 

=== ''Historia Brittonum'' ===
The earliest surviving reference to Partholón is in the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', a 9th-century British [[Latin language|Latin]] compilation attributed to [[Nennius]]. It says that Ireland was settled three times by three different groups, with 'Partholomus' and his followers arriving first from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] with a thousand followers who multiplied until they numbered four thousand before succumbing to the plague in a single week.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, J. A.  (trans), [https://archive.org/stream/sixoldenglishchr00gileuoft#page/388/mode/2up "Nennius' History of the Britons" §13], ''Six Old English Chronicles'', Bohn's Antiquarian Library, 1848&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Lebor Gabála Érenn'' ===
The ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', an 11th-century Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, states that Ireland was settled six times, with Partholón and his followers forming the second group. The number may have been chosen to match the "[[Six Ages of the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt|Sjoestedt, Marie-Louise]] (1949). ''Celtic Gods and Heroes''. Dover Publications, 2000. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Lebor Gabála'', Ireland was uninhabited following the deaths of [[Cessair]] and her companions in [[Genesis flood narrative|the Flood]]. It says that Partholón came from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]{{sfn|Macallister|1940| p= 5}} and was the son of Sera, son of Sru, who was himself a descendant of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], [[Japhetites|son of]] [[Japheth]], who was the [[sons of Noah|son of]] [[Noah]]. Partholón and his people sailed to Ireland via [[Sicily]] and Iberia, arriving 300 or 312 years after the flood and landing at [[Inber Scéne]] ([[Kenmare]] in [[County Kerry]]). With Partholón were his wife ([[Dealgnaid|Delgnat]]), their three sons (Slanga, Rudraige and Laiglinne), the sons' wives (Nerba, Cichba and Cerbnad), and a thousand followers.

Partholón and all of his people—five thousand men and four thousand women—died of the plague in a single week, on Senmag (the "old plain"), near modern [[Tallaght]]. 

=== ''Foras Feasa ar Érinn'' ===
[[Geoffrey Keating|Seathrún Céitinn]]'s 17th-century compilation ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn|Foras Feasa ar Érinn]]'' says they arrived in 2061 BC. It claims that Partholón was the son of Sera, the king of Greece, and fled his homeland after murdering his father and mother. He lost his left eye in the attack on his parents. He and his followers set off from [[Greece]], sailed via Sicily and arrived in Ireland from the west, having traveled for two and a half months.

According to Céitinn, at the time of Partholón's arrival, Ireland consisted of one open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. Partholóin cleared four more plains, and seven more lakes [[lake-burst|burst from the ground]]. Named figures are credited with having introduced cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, dwellings, trade and dividing the island into four parts.

In Céitinn's version of the story, at the [[Magh Ithe|Battle of Mag Itha]], the first battle fought in Ireland, the Partholóin battled and defeated the [[Fomorians]], who were led by [[Cichol Gricenchos]]. The Fomorians have been interpreted as a group of [[pagan]] gods associated with the harmful forces of nature.

A poem in the ''Lebor Gabála'', expanded by Céitinn, tells how Partholón and his wife, Delgnat, lived on a small island near the head of the estuary of the [[River Erne]]. Once, while Partholón was out touring his domain, Delgnat seduced a servant named Topa. Afterward, they drank from Partholón's [[ale]], which could only be accessed through a golden tube. Partholón discovered the affair when he drank his ale and recognized the taste of Delgnat's and Topa's mouths on the tube. In anger, he killed Delgnat's dog and Topa. But Delgnat was unrepentant and insisted that Partholón was to blame, as leaving them alone together was like leaving honey before a woman, milk before a cat, edged tools before a craftsman, or meat before a child, and expecting them not to take advantage. This is recorded as the first case of adultery and the first jealousy in Ireland. The island in question was named Inis Saimera after Saimer, Delgnat's dog.

=== ''Annals of the Four Masters'' ===
The ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' says they arrived in 2520 [[Anno Mundi]] (after the "[[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]]"). This work states that the plague came 300 years after their arrival, in May and tat one man survived: [[Tuan mac Cairill|Tuan]], son of Partholón's brother Starn. Through a series of animal transformations, he survived through the centuries to be reborn as the son of a chieftain named Cairell in the time of [[Columba|Colm Cille]] (6th century). He remembered all he had seen, and thus preserved Partholón's story.

=== Others ===
Other accounts differ in the timing of Partholón's arrival in Ireland. Later sources say Partholón died there after thirty years in Ireland, and the rest of his people also died there of plague. Other medieval texts say they arrived in the 60th year of [[Abraham]].

Partholon's brother Tait was the great-grandfather of [[Nemed]].

'''Refugee health''', also known as '''migrant health''' or '''immigrant health''', is the field of study on the health effects experienced by people who have moved into another country or even to another part of the world, either by choice or as a result of unsafe circumstances such as war or persecution.  [[forced displacement|Displaced]] populations' health is mainly affected by [[infectious disease]], [[mental health]], and [[chronic diseases]] that are uncommon in the country in which they eventually settle. Refugee health status is largely due to factors such as the migrant's geographic origin, conditions of [[refugee camp]]s or [[urban refugee|urban settings]] where they lived, and personal, physical, and psychological conditions of the migrant, either pre-existing or acquired while traveling from their homeland to a camp or eventually to their new home.&lt;ref name="Palinkas_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palinkas LA, Pickwell SM, Brandstein K, Clark TJ, Hill LL, Moser RJ, Osman A | title = The journey to wellness: stages of refugee health promotion and disease prevention | journal = Journal of Immigrant Health | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–28 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 14512755 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021048112073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major health concerns==
Refugees may be at a higher risk for contracting certain diseases or having other health problems due to factors such as poor nutrition, poor sanitation and lack of adequate medical care. The most common health concerns are listed below.

=== Non-communicable diseases ===
[[Non-communicable disease]] (NCD) is a medical condition that is not transmissible and non-infectious. This means it is not caused by an infectious agent but instead is perpetuated by individual and environmental behaviors. According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], NCDs lead to an estimated 40 million deaths per year—worldwide. Accordingly, 70% of deaths worldwide are credited to NCDs. It is found that NCD development and control is directly linked with nutrition and healthy behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/ | title = Non communicable diseases|website=World Health Organization |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-communicable diseases have accounted for 19-46% of mortality from the top five refugee-producing countries in 2015. Accordingly, the overall proportion of deaths credited to NCDs has risen over 50%. Reports indicate that more than half of Syrian refugee households (resettled in Jordan) have a member suffering from an non-communicable disease.&lt;ref name="Sethi_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sethi S, Jonsson R, Skaff R, Tyler F | title = Community-Based Noncommunicable Disease Care for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon | journal = Global Health, Science and Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–506 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28928227 | pmc = 5620345 | doi = 10.9745/GHSP-D-17-00043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diabetes====
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a group of chronic metabolic diseases that affect the body's use of blood sugar. There are two main forms of diabetes: [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]]. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency and requires daily administered doses of [[insulin]]. Causes of Type 1 diabetes are unknown and are currently, not preventable. It is typically onset at an early age. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to properly utilize insulin. Type 2 diabetes is typically onset in adults and is linked with unhealthy behaviors. Another common form of diabetes is [[gestational diabetes]]. This occurs in pregnant women and does not necessarily lead to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/|title=Diabetes|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refugees are at an increased risk of developing diabetes because of the tendency towards inadequate nutritional behaviors.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkowitz SA, Fabreau GE, Raghavan S, Kentoffio K, Chang Y, He W, Atlas SJ, Percac-Lima S | title = Risk of Developing Diabetes Among Refugees and Immigrants: A Longitudinal Analysis | journal = Journal of Community Health | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 1274–1281 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27363825 | doi = 10.1007/s10900-016-0216-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], amongst [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]], there is a 6.1% prevalence of adult-onset diabetes. [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi refugees]] saw a 3% prevalence and Congolese refugees faced less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/congolese/health-information/non-communicable-disease.html|title=Non-Communicable Disease Error processing SSI file|date=2017-04-21|website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A literary analysis on diabetes risk amongst refugee populations suggests that increased diabetes risk among adult refugees may be associated with longer migration histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner J, Berthold SM, Buckley T, Kong S, Kuoch T, Scully M | title = Diabetes among refugee populations: what newly arriving refugees can learn from resettled Cambodians | journal = Current Diabetes Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 56 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26143533 | doi = 10.1007/s11892-015-0618-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis also links increased diabetes prevalence with the transition from traditional, agricultural lifestyles with potentially protective foods, to urbanized, westernized lifestyles that come with migration.

====Anemia====
[[Anemia]] is a condition in which an individual does not have enough healthy red blood cells. This will consequently lead to reduced oxygen flow to the body's organs. Most commonly, this is caused by not consuming enough iron. Anemia is used as a marker for overall [[micronutrient deficiency]]. Symptoms usually involve overall fatigue and tiredness, as a result of reduced oxygen flow. There are various treatments for anemia, including [[iron supplement]]s and vitamin B supplements. [[Blood transfusion]]s may also be used if blood production is low.

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], “an evaluation of anemia prevalence in the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] and surrounding areas showed that 48.4% of children younger than 5 years of age, and 44.8% of women 15-49 years of age suffered from anemia”. Amongst Congolese refugees, [[Sickle-cell disease|Sickle Cell Anemia]] (SCD) is of a much larger concern. In Central America, refugees coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras show the highest incidence of anemia cases. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] reports that the prevalence for children under 5 years old is 30% in El Salvador, 47% in Guatemala, and 40% in Honduras. In Guatemala, 22% of pregnant women are also anemic. These cases are mostly credited to poor nutrition or a chronic parasitic infection.&lt;ref name="CDC_refugee_health"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/index.html | title = Refugee Health Profiles {{!}} Immigrant and Refugee Health | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control | date = 2017-04-19 | access-date = 2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cardiovascular disease and hypertension ====
[[Cardiovascular disease]] is a general term for various heart conditions such as [[coronary artery disease]], [[cardiac arrest]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], and many more. [[Hypertension]] is high blood pressure—this is usually defined as blood pressure over 130/80. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension are associated with poor nutrition/diet, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic risk factors.

Amongst [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]], 4.1% of adults suffered from cardiovascular disease and 10.7% suffered from hypertension. There is also substantial risk amongst Congolese refugees. According to the CDC, amongst [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi refugees]] in [[Jordan]], 33% of those over 15 years of age had hypertension. Another 42% were pre-hypertensive. [[Bhutanese refugees|Bhutanese refugee]] adults had a 3% prevalence of hypertension, and nearly 1% prevalence of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]].&lt;ref name="CDC_refugee_health" /&gt;

=== Communicable diseases ===

==== Tuberculosis ====
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. As an airborne disease, TB is spread via inhalation of the bacteria, which subsequently travel to the lungs and other body parts to manifest infection. Once a person is infected, TB can either become latent or active. If latent, the disease is asymptomatic and non-contagious; however, latent TB can become active at any point. Active TB is symptomatic and contagious. Either way, TB should be treated immediately, as untreated infections can be fatal.

An estimated third of the world's population is infected with [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Refugee Health Provider Guide | url = http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/refugee/guide/index.html | publisher = Minnesota Department of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high incidence necessitates that those conducting the overseas exam (Panel Physicians) screen all refugees for TB and further test anyone suspected of having active TB. Screening for tuberculosis generally involves a [[tuberculin skin test]], followed by a chest X-ray when necessary, and laboratory testing depending on those results. Anyone between the ages of 2 and 14, living in a country with a tuberculosis incidence rate of 20 or more cases per 100,000 people (as identified by the WHO), is required to have a tuberculin skin test. Those aged 15 and older must have a chest x-ray.

In the US, refugee individuals identified as having active tuberculosis must complete treatment before being permitted to enter. Upon arriving in the US, the CDC recommends that all refugees be screened for tuberculosis using a tuberculin skin test. A follow-up chest x-ray is required if the tuberculin skin test is positive, or if the refugee was identified as having TB (either Class A or Class B) in their overseas exam, or if they are infected with HIV.

Over 2 billion people are infected with TB worldwide. Specifically amongst refugee populations, the risk of contracting TB are higher than in the general population, as overcrowding and international travel is higher and more frequent. According to the WHO, as of 2016, the TB incidence rate in Syria is 17 per 100,000 people. Compare this to 3.1 per 100,000 people in the United States.

==== Infectious hepatitis ====
There are multiple types of hepatitis, which most broadly can be described as viral infections of the liver. The most common types are viral Hepatitis A, B, and C. Hepatitis B and C can result in chronic infections, while Hepatitis A is solely infectious. As such, Hepatitis A is also referred to as Infectious Hepatitis, and is caused by the Hepatitis A Virus (HAV). HAV can be spread directly or indirectly via fecal contact, causal contact, sexual contact, and foodborne or waterborne pathways. Because of this, refugee populations are more susceptible to this infection. According to a 2016 study conducted in Greece, the rate of Infectious Hepatitis amongst Syrian refugees in certain Greek facilities is 152 per 1,000 people; rates in refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq were much lower, at 8 per 1,000 and 9 per 1,000 people, respectively. The disproportionately higher rate in Syrian refugees can be attributed to the higher proportion of Syrian refugees in the camps, as compared to refugees from other countries of origin. There is no treatment for HAV infections, so hygienic intervention measures and vaccinations are of the highest priority in preventative measures. However, health care is often not prioritized in refugee populations and resources are limited, thus making it difficult to properly control the rate and spread of infection.

==== Hepatitis B ====
[[Hepatitis B]] infection is endemic in [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Northern Asia]], and most of the [[Pacific Islands]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} According to the CDC, the rate of chronic infection among persons emigrating to the US from these areas is between 5% and 15%. Many states require or recommend that all refugees be screened for hepatitis B, and proceed with immunizations for all who are susceptible to this infection.

==== Sexually transmitted infections ====
Refugees can be at a higher risk for contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] because of a lack of access to protection and/or treatment, as well as the circumstances of war and flight, making them subject to higher incidences of [[rape]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Holt_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holt BY, Effler P, Brady W, Friday J, Belay E, Parker K, Toole M | title = Planning STI/HIV prevention among refugees and mobile populations: situation assessment of Sudanese refugees | journal = Disasters | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12703149 | doi = 10.1111/1467-7717.00216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees are regularly screened for [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], and [[HIV|HIV infection]] when they relocate.

=== Parasitic infections ===
[[Intestinal parasites]] are a major health problem for many groups, including refugees, and the presence of pathogenic parasites requires medical attention. "Over one&amp;nbsp;billion persons worldwide are estimated to be carriers of [[Ascaris]]. Approximately 480&amp;nbsp;million people are infected with [[Entamoeba histolytica]]. At least 500&amp;nbsp;million carry [[Trichuris]]. At present, 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;million people are infected with one or more of the [[Schistosoma]] species and it is estimated that more than 20&amp;nbsp;million persons throughout the world are infected with [[Hymenolepsis nana]]".&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; Consequences of parasitic infection can include [[anemia]] due to blood loss and [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], [[malnutrition]], [[growth retardation]], invasive disease, and death. Refugees are particularly at risk given the likelihood of poor or [[contaminated water]] and poor hygienic conditions in camps. Since 1999, the CDC has recommended that US-bound refugee populations from Africa and Southeast Asia undergo presumptive treatment for parasitic infections prior to departure. The US Protocol includes a single dose of albendazole.&lt;ref name="Swanson_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swanson SJ, Phares CR, Mamo B, Smith KE, Cetron MS, Stauffer WM | title = Albendazole therapy and enteric parasites in United States-bound refugees | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 16 | pages = 1498–507 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22512482 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1103360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many states, the domestic health screening exam recommends that all refugees be screened for parasitic infections whether or not they appear symptomatic. Screening often includes two stool specimens obtained more than 24 hours apart and/or a CBC with differential for evaluation of [[eosinophilia]].

==== Malaria ====
[[Malaria]] is considered [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the Americas from as far north as [[Mexico]] to as far south as [[Argentina]], in [[Africa]] from [[Egypt]] to [[South Africa]], in [[Asia]] from [[Turkey]] to [[Indonesia]], and in the islands of [[Oceania]]. It is estimated that 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;million people are infected each year with malaria, and over one&amp;nbsp;million people die every year from the disease, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, the CDC recommends that US-bound refugee populations from this region undergo presumptive treatment prior to departure to the US. For those refugee arrivals from sub-Saharan Africa with no pre-departure treatment documentation, the CDC recommends either they receive presumptive treatment on arrival (preferred) or have laboratory screening to detect [[Plasmodium]] infection. For refugees from other areas of the world where asymptomatic malaria is not prevalent, the CDC recommends that any refugee with signs or symptoms of malaria should receive diagnostic testing for Plasmodium, and subsequent treatment for confirmed infections, but not presumptive treatment.

==== Giardiasis ====

Giardiasis is an intestinal parasitic infection, where the protozoa is in its flagellate mode of movement. It is most commonly spread through contaminated water and food in developing countries. Symptoms are rather mild, and include abdominal pain, flatulence, and loose stool. Studies have found that Giardiasis is common amongst refugee populations, specifically those coming from Afghanistan. However, the parasite is not particularly adept at sustaining infection within children.

==== Leishmaniasis ====
Leishmaniasis is another parasitic infection with a high burden of disease amongst refugee populations. It is a vector-borne parasite, commonly spread by the bite of an infected sand flies. There are two common types of manifestation: cutaneous (skin lesions) and visceral leishmaniasis (infection of internal organs). In 2012, there was an outbreak of Leishmaniasis amongst Syrians. Leishmaniasis is of major concern in the eastern Mediterranean, which is home to the majority of the globe's prevalence (≈57%). Leishmaniasis is most common in this region, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic. Thus, refugees coming from these regions, which is the majority of all refugees, are highly susceptible to becoming infected by this parasite. Additionally, refugees from other countries are put at a high risk of contraction, as they often share temporary settlements with refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As a preventative measure, refugees are administered, when available, albendazole and ivermectin prior to their asylum seeking journey to other countries like the United States. Upon arrival, refugees are typically screened for these infections in order to prevent spread and fatality.

===Mental health===
As mental illnesses are not necessarily tangible or easily quantifiable, it is easy to disregard the real ramifications that poor mental health can have on a person. These repercussions can materialize in any aspect of a person's life, whether that be physical, social, financial, etc. Further, the manifestations of poor mental health are deeply rooted when trauma is experienced at a young age. Thus, populations vulnerable to traumatic experiences are at a concerningly high risk of mental illnesses and poor mental health.

Prior to [[World War II]], immigrants were mainly driven from their countries by forces such as unemployment, famine and poverty, often combined with various forms of prejudice and oppression whilst war and ethnopolitical conflict were less common causes for emigration. They have known social oppression, including inadequate education, lack of job opportunities, inability to practice their faith or marry whom they wished, and inability to live where they want. Beginning with World War II, however, civilians were increasingly targeted as a strategy of warfare, and since then most newcomers (especially refugees) have been victims of war and/or political repression. Many of them have also experienced or witnessed government-sponsored torture and/or terror. That said, refugees are often survivors who possess amazing resiliency, strength and resourcefulness.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; An assessment of mental health may be included in a refugee's domestic health screening.

Refugee [[mental health]] and integration into a new society are exquisitely interwoven. Traumatic experiences that occurred in the home country or during the resulting flight from that country are common. These experiences, in addition to the stresses of resettling in the host country, increase the chances of a less successful adjustment to the society of the host country. Mental health problems are one of the key barriers to the labor market integration of refugees in host societies.&lt;ref name="ruiz2018"&gt;{{cite journal|authors= Ruiz, I., and C. Vargas-Silva.|year=2018 |title=Differences in labour market outcomes between natives, refugees and other migrants in the UK | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume=18 | pages=855–885|url=https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/18/4/855/5023833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these traumatic and stressful events may be temporary and manageable with straightforward solutions or may be disabling and enduring.

High rates of mental health concerns have been documented in various refugee populations. Most studies reveal high rates of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[somatization]] among newly arrived refugees. Variations reported in the prevalence of PTSD and depression may be ascribed to a number of factors, including prior life in their homeland, the experience of flight from that homeland, life in refugee camps, and stressors during and after resettlement in a third country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = James M. | last1 = Jaranson | first2 = Solvig | last2 = Ekblad | first3 = Georgi V. | last3 = Kroupin | first4 = David P. | last4 = Eisenman | editor-first1 = Patricia Frye | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first2 = Elizabeth Day | editor-last2 = Barnett | editor-first3 = William | editor-last3 = Stauffer | editor-first4 = James M | editor-last4 = Jaranson | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Chapter 47: Mental Health and Illness in Immigrants: Epidemiology and Risk Factors | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ggajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA627 | title = Immigrant Medicine | date = 25 October 2007 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-323-07057-7 | pages = 627–628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, socioeconomic status, educational background, and gender all affect levels of mental illness.&lt;ref name="pmid16077055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter M, Haslam N | title = Predisplacement and postdisplacement factors associated with mental health of refugees and internally displaced persons: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 5 | pages = 602–12 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16077055 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.5.602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a study focused on the impacts of traumatic events on displaced persons from Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. It revealed that 54% of the population studied suffered from a severe emotional disorder. Of the children who participated in the study, 44% revealed depressive symptoms, and 45% showed signs of PTSD. Compared to other children around the globe, these statistics show a 10-fold increase in mental health disorders. Similarly to topics surrounding menstrual health, mental health is considered to be another taboo topic amongst certain cultures. This prevents people from seeking psychiatric help. Currently, there is only one functioning mental health hospital in Syria that tends to psychiatric needs. In 2016, a Syrian-American doctor named M.K. Hamza coined a new term to more accurately describe the effects felt by nearly all refugees affected by the ongoing crisis—human devastation syndrome. There is a severe lack of, and a dire need for, mental health attention and care. These traumatic events typically worsen and amplify progressively in the years following.

It is critical that mental health issues be addressed in the screening process. Leaving behind all that is familiar and starting a new life in a new country with a different language and culture in addition to previous trauma and dislocation produces an immediate challenge that can have long-term effects. This is true whether an individual is coming from Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, or elsewhere in the world. Many refugees will not share a Western perspective or vocabulary, so questions will need to be explained through specific examples or re-framed in culturally congruent terms with the assistance of an interpreter or bicultural worker.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; One option is to administer an efficient and valid screener for emotional distress, such as the Refugee Health Screener - 15, in the context of the overall health screening.&lt;ref name="Hollifield_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollifield M, Verbillis-Kolp S, Farmer B, Toolson EC, Woldehaimanot T, Yamazaki J, Holland A, St Clair J, SooHoo J | title = The Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15): development and validation of an instrument for anxiety, depression, and PTSD in refugees | journal = General Hospital Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 202–9 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23347455 | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of treatment for refugees with mental health issues must also be culturally congruent. Western psychiatric methods may not applicable to individuals who do not conceive of the body and mind in the same way as people in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mercer_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mercer SW, Ager A, Ruwanpura E | title = Psychosocial distress of Tibetans in exile: integrating western interventions with traditional beliefs and practice | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 179–89 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15482877 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.04.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies of Tibetan refugees have shown how important the Tibetan religion of Buddhism is in helping the refugees cope with their situation. The religion provides them with an explanation for their situation and hope for a better future.&lt;ref name="survivorsoftorture.org"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs E, Rosenfeld B, Lhewa D, Rasmussen A, Keller A | title = Entering exile: trauma, mental health, and coping among Tibetan refugees arriving in Dharamsala, India | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–208 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18404641 | doi = 10.1002/jts.20324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, indigenous methods of coping and psychological therapy can be integrated with Western methods of therapy to provide a wide spectrum of mental help to refugees.&lt;ref name="Mercer_2005" /&gt;

Additionally, refugee children face unique barriers to adequate psychological health support due to significant trauma during their vulnerable developmental years.

=== Women's health ===
Every woman from every country experiences her own menstrual process. However, some countries are more adept than others at providing proper resources and accessibility for women to easily maintain good hygiene. Menstrual health requires constant and proper upkeep in order to avoid subsequent infections. Menstruation requires attentive care and proper hygienic supplies. Thus, it is no wonder that while in the high income countries, menstrual health is not a major public health concern, but in developing countries or in times of crises, menstruation can pose a distinct problem for women in vulnerable populations.

Proper menstrual care includes washing oneself with soap on a daily basis, and changing menstrual supplies (such as pads or tampons) multiple times per day. Improper care can cause progressive infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) or reproductive tract infection (RTI). With limited access to clean, running water and hygienic supplies (soap, pads, tampons) within refugee camps, monthly periods create health problems for women and girls.

As such, studies have been conducted in various refugee camps to assess the degree of burden that menstruation has on women. Refugees staying in temporary settlements in Myanmar reported poor latrine conditions, describing them as unsafe and dirty, with locks on the doors being a rare occurrence. Additionally, many young girls reported dark, unlit paths at nighttime causing unwarranted assaults by intruders in the camps. Thus, girls reportedly would not use the bathroom once it was dark outside, even if in need of a shower or a fresh pad.

Another obstacle that refugee women face in maintaining their menstrual health is limited to no access to an adequate amount of sanitary supplies. Many refugees do not have the luxury of changing their pads every few hours per day, so a buildup of bacteria is common. Other studies have revealed that when desperate, women will resort to using leaves or old pads to absorb the discharged blood, according to a report by Sommer's team in the journal Conflict and Health.

In addition to limited supplies and sanitary facilities, cultural attitudes towards menstruation create a difficult, taboo environment surrounding the topic. Thus, women and girls may feel too uncomfortable to seek help or advice on tending to their personal needs.

=== Occupational health ===
Demand for labor is an important reason for migration. Despite the difficulty in researching immigrant populations, there is evidence that [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health]] is an area in which immigrants face disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Flynn | first1 = Michael | last2 = Eggerth | first2 = Donald | editor-first1 = Marc B. | editor-last1 = Schenker | editor-first2 = Xóchitl | editor-last2 = Castañeda | editor-first3 = Alfonso | editor-last3 = Rodriguez-Lainz | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Chapter 20: Occupational Health Research with Immigrant Workers | title = Migration and Health: A Research Methods Handbook | date = 2014 | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-27795-3 | pages = 377–395 | chapter-url =  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277224659_Occupational_Health_Research_with_Immigrant_Workers?_sg=4bOtq8P7CuEeeVZzW7h-KQXLH4ohUiSrnbOCDPz3AeQNQezlcLJzV8OGFSSaGAzjiBefjTKWgIX6JE5PkcB8H6-Py_g8EkNttl5BEz6i.oLabspekWVxjHLUYPYlSf2xP5pS4RClFkyclD7v5a7AF8mCUvHSskKpmasTWicA7vPNazvFjp9DRp0GM0IX6TQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging occupational health issue for immigrants relates to the health risks faced by people who are trafficked into situations of forced labor and [[debt bondage]].

== Interventions ==

=== Health Literacy ===
[[Health literacy]] is a crucial component to preventative healthcare and improved public health. A cross-sectional study conducted amongst refugees in Sweden, found that 60% of those assessed had inadequate functioning health literacy and 27% of them had inadequate comprehensive health literacy. The study concluded that health literacy should be taken into consideration when assessing refugee health and that more research is needed to assess the current dynamics and develop strategies to overcome the gaps in health literacy amongst refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wångdahl J, Lytsy P, Mårtensson L, Westerling R | title = Health literacy among refugees in Sweden - a cross-sectional study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 14 | pages = 1030 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25278109 | pmc = 4195944 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the provision of targeted, adequate health literacy tool kits, populations are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and prevention efforts—particularly in the realm of [[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osborne RH, Beauchamp A, Batterham R | title = Health literacy: a concept with potential to greatly impact the infectious diseases field | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 43 | pages = 101–102 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26724772 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2015.12.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These health literacy tools must be relevant to the communities, administered in familiar language and vocabulary, and must truly take into account the competencies and limitations of the target audience.Within health literacy initiatives, collaborative learning and [[social support]] could contribute to people's understanding and ability to judge, sift and use health information. Consequently,  adding these practices to the definition of critical health literacy could prove to be hugely beneficial to patient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Wit L, Fenenga C, Giammarchi C, di Furia L, Hutter I, de Winter A, Meijering L | title = Community-based initiatives improving critical health literacy: a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative evidence | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 40 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28728547 | pmc = 5520348 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-017-4570-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Communicable Diseases ===
When addressing the needs of [[Non-communicable disease|NCD]] patients within [[Humanitarian crisis|humanitarian crises]], there needs to be a more epidemiological approach to assessing prevalence of NCDs to ensure a better understanding of the local needs and risks. After such assessment is made, those new understandings must be targeted to create novel, innovative approaches to mitigate risks and promote healthy behaviors—in an infectious manner. Finally, in order to adequately provide such resources, there must be strong guidance and [[Health education|education]] continuously available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jobanputra K, Boulle P, Roberts B, Perel P | title = Three Steps to Improve Management of Noncommunicable Diseases in Humanitarian Crises | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = e1002180 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27824879 | pmc = 5100924 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunizations===
Refugees arrive in their new countries with a variety of [[immunization]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bigot A, Blok L, Boelaert M, Chartier Y, Corijn P, Davis A, Deguerry M, Dusauchoit T, Fermon F, Griekspoor A | title = Refugee health: an approach to emergency situations | date = 1997 | publisher = Macmillan Education | location = London | isbn = 978-0-333-72210-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While refugees may have had vaccinations in their country of origin, often they lack documentation because they were forced to depart their home country in haste. Some may have received immunizations as part of their overseas exam, and some may have received no immunizations. Recommendations by the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunizations (EPI) are generally followed by countries worldwide with minor variations in vaccine schedules, spacing of vaccine doses, and documentation. The majority of vaccines used worldwide are from reliable local or international manufacturers, and no potency problems have been detected, with the occasional exception of [[tetanus]] toxoid and the oral [[polio vaccine]] (OPV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/DTP_vaccine_rates_information_sheet.pdf|title=Information Sheet - Observed Rate of Vaccine Reactions - Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus Vaccines |date=May 2014|website=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Refugee health in the United States|United States]], entering refugees are not required to have vaccinations. However, it is mandated that at the time of applying for adjustment of status from legal temporary resident to legal permanent resident, a refugee must be fully vaccinated in accordance with recommendations of the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP). A list of required vaccines in the US can be found on the [[vaccine schedule]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html | title = Immunization Schedules for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control | access-date = 2017-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===

Social support can be very helpful in preventing mental health issues and for coping with living in a new land,&lt;ref name="survivorsoftorture.org" /&gt; so refugees from the same areas should be able to live close to each other. However, even in this case, it may be necessary for social support to be offered by statutory or voluntary agencies from outside the refugees' and asylum seekers' communities in line with local informal and formal structures and networks. One model for such support was proposed by British authors in 2014, the WAMBA process, in which five essential components of support for refugees and asylum seekers were identified:

* '''W'''elcome: a person-centred and benign enquiry as to the asylum seeker's history in a friendly setting and with the use of interpreters if necessary.
* '''A'''ccompaniment: the availability of social support in an asylum-seeking client's life (amongst other presences such as an exilic community and intimate attachments) may foster assurance that moments of crisis can be negotiated by asylum seeker and support worker together.
* '''M'''ediation: offering a type of humanitarian solidarity and care which will offset some of the negative consequences of the asylum-seeking process and the [[hegemonic]] order which it represents and mediating between the individual asylum seeker and the systemic constraints of the asylum process.
* '''B'''efriending: Befriending is another side to the relationship of accompaniment and which seeks to mitigate the political reality within which asylum seekers find themselves and which is distinctly unfriendly: tightly controlled, suspicious, rebarbative and highly hostile.
* '''A'''dvocacy: The professional helping relationship between worker and client can potentially diminish the isolation brought about by the circumstances within which some asylum seekers may live by giving time to hear the voice of the individual and providing support that attends to the individual's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fell|first1=Benedict|last2=Fell|first2=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 2014|title=Welfare across borders: a social work process with adult asylum seekers |journal=[[The British Journal of Social Work]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] |volume=44|issue=5|pages=1322&amp;ndash;1339|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bct003|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7658">'''Frederick Steven "Rick" Piltz ''' (July 29, 1943 – October 18, 2014) was a former senior associate in the U.S. [[Climate Change Science Program]]. In March 2005, he resigned over political interference in the program's climate change reports. In June 2005, the [[New York Times]] exposed the role of [[Philip Cooney]] in editing government documents on [[climate change]] to create scientific uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/politics/08climate.html?ex=1275883200&amp;en=22149dc70c0731d8&amp;ei=5090 Bush Aide Softened Greenhouse Gas Links to Global Warming - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A former [[lobbyist]] with the [[American Petroleum Institute]], Cooney resigned and days later took a job at Exxon Mobil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/politics/11cooney.long.html?ei=5088&amp;en=ed76c8cb7d540f10&amp;ex=1276142400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print Editor of Climate Reports Resigns - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Piltz went on to found Climate Science Watch, a project to hold public officials accountable for using [[climate science]] with integrity in [[Climate change policy of the United States|policy making]]. Climate Science Watch is a program of the [[Government Accountability Project]], a [[whistleblower]] protection agency in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistleblower.org/template/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politicization of science==
Piltz spent 14 years in various positions in Washington closely following how [[Scientific opinion on climate change|global warming science]] is misused by the government and [[special interest groups]]. From 1995, he served in senior positions in the Climate Change Science Program, before resigning in March 2005. In his resignation letter, he wrote, "I believe the overarching problem is that the [Bush] Administration...does not want and has acted to impede forthright communication of the state of climate science and its implication for society."&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/esthag-w/2005/jun/policy/figures/Piltz_Memo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Within months, the ''New York Times'' exposed White House operative [[Philip Cooney]] for editing government climate documents to increase [[uncertainty]] about the science. Cooney resigned and joined [[Exxon Mobil]].

Piltz also states that forces within the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] have sought to hide the results from the [[National Assessment on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/interviews/piltz.html ''Hot Politics'' Rick Piltz Interviews] on [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government watchdog==

Piltz founded [[Climate Science Watch]] in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/history/ |publisher=Climate Science Watch |title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group tracks and investigates climate science policy developments in the news and occasionally publishes [[news leak|leaked documents]] from government [[insider]]s.

Piltz testified twice before [[United States Congress|Congress]] since creating Climate Science Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131202854/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070130113813-92288.pdf |archivedate=January 31, 2007 |title=Testimony of Rick Piltz |publisher=Committee On Oversight And Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/index.php/csw/details/piltz-senate-testimony/ |title=Rick Piltz testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=Climate Science Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Piltz was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. In October 2014, Piltz died at a hospice in [[Washington, D.C.]] of [[bladder cancer]] at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/rick-s-piltz-whistleblower-on-federal-climate-policy-dies-at-71/2014/10/21/11827d00-5897-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pilz was a B.A. (1965), M.A. (1967) graduate of the [[University of Michigan]].

==Media appearances==
Since going public with the White House's attempts to undermine the science on climate change. Piltz has been interviewed by a number of media venues including ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'', the ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'', and the science journal ''[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]''. He is also a central character in the award winning documentary ''[[Everything's Cool (film)|Everything's Cool]]''.

==Awards==
Piltz was awarded the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling]] in 2006 for his work to prevent the politicization of climate science reporting in the federal government.  The prize is awarded to a citizen, corporate, or government whistleblower, [[investigative journalist]], or organization for bringing a specific issue of social importance to the public's attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridenhour.org/prizes_truth-telling_2006.html "Ridenhour Prize for Truth Telling"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ayodhya dispute==
Shereen Ratnagar along with archaeologist [[D. Mandal]] spent a day, in 2003, examining the excavations conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at the site of the [[Babri Masjid]] on behalf of the Sunni Waqf Board.  Subsequently, the two researchers wrote a highly critical appraisal of the excavations by the ASI titled ''Ayodhya: Archaeology after Excavation''. In 2010, they appeared as expert witnesses for the Sunni Waqf Board in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in the [[Allahabad High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDEwLzEwLzEwI0FyMDA2MDE |title=Trench warfare: Writing on the Wall |newspaper= Times of India |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=2014-12-25}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In its judgement on the Ayodhya dispute, the High Court flayed the role played by several witnesses including Ratnagar, who was forced to admit under oath that she had no field experience in [[archeological]] [[excavations]] in India.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-09/india/28254384_1_asi-excavations-experts-waqf-board How Allahabad HC exposed experts espousing Masjid-cause], Times of India, 9 October 2010, 03.07am IST&lt;/ref&gt; Ratnagar and her supporters defend her record by stating that she has participated in some archaeological digs at sites outside India, such as [[Tell al-Rimah]], [[Iraq]], in 1971,&lt;ref name="rimah"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/view/4199937  ''Iraq'' Vol. 34, No. 2 (Autumn, 1972), pp. 77-86. Published by: British Institute for the Study of Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Turkey and the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/SearchResults.asp?prodstock=12890 Publisher's statement on Shereen Ratnagar, Trading Encounters (Oxford University Press, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124090959/http://indiaclub.com/shop/SearchResults.asp?ProdStock=12890 |date=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the case, Shereen Ratnagar was served a [[Contempt of Court|contempt]] notice for violating a court order restraining witnesses in the ongoing case from airing their views in public.&lt;ref name="contempt_notice"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/babri-witnesses-get-hc-contempt-notice/621315/ Babri witnesses get HC contempt notice], Indian Express, Thu 20 May 2010, 04:18 hrs&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court of Allahabad had directed the Archeological Survey of India to open up the ground under the Mosque, by then broken down by the vandals of 1992, to search for temple remains. The Archaeological Survey excavated the site of six months in 2003, and submitted its Report the same year. The Report gave the suggestion that there are traces of a pillared temple in strata under the Mosque. While the book by Mandal and Ratnagar places on record the reasons why the two scholars conclude that claims about the temple are not credible, in the broader sense it also indicates why attempts to restore holy places to their original owners can be self-defeating projects. In this book two archaeologists have discussed the excavated data and the presentation and interpretation of these data by the Archaeological Survey. They have critique the methodology that was followed, show that certain excavated objects are not compatible with temples, question the existence of the foundations of temple pillars in strata beneath the Mosque, and observe that there are very few architectural features that can point to the remains of a temple at the site. What is the evidence that can point to the destruction of a public building at a particular site? In explaining this and the problems of the relative dating of floors and walls, it has been the endeavor of the authors to make stratigraphic archaeology intelligible to the lay reader. The authors have written this book not because they claim to have the last word, but because they are convinced that thinking people should peruse the evidence for themselves and make up their own minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mandal |first1=Dhaneshwar |last2=Ratnagar |first2=Shereen |title=Archaeology after Excavation |publisher=Tulika Books |location=New Delhi |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But, archaeologically one cannot prove that it was Ram Janmabhoomi. Mandal and Ratnagar assert that the pillar bases are clumps of bricks that are too feeble to support the weight of pillars and their view is widely supported by archaeologists and historians who reject the temple theory. In a review of the book, M S Mate, a former professor of archaeology at Deccan College, points out that the layout of the pillar bases are not at all conducive to temple rituals.
One of the duos most important discoveries was that the floor of the purported temple was actually of the same age as the mosque, as it ran up to the face of the mosque wall. There is also no evidence that the mosque was built on the foundations of a structure that had been destroyed. This leads the authors to vociferously conclude that the site bears evidence not of a destruction that took place in the 16th century, but of vandalism in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultureindevelopment.nl/News/Heritage%20Asia/616/Archeology_on_Babri_masjid_site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Batmanishvili was received by [[Pope Pius XI]], along with a group of Eastern Catholic priests, and was appointed apostolic administrator (some sources indicate that he was exarch) for the [[Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics|Georgian Catholics of the Byzantine rite]].&lt;ref&gt;[Dzwonkowski, Roman (1998).

On 16 October 1927 Batmanishvili was arrested in Tbilisi&lt;ref&gt;[Dzwonkowski, Roman (1998). Losy duchowieństwa katolickiego w ZSSR 1917-1939: martyrologium (in Polish).

In July 1932 he was accused of anti-Soviet agitation, holding liturgies and religious rituals, and transmitting information abroad on the situation of Catholics in the USSR. As a result he was isolated from the rest of the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[Чаплицкий, Бронислав; Осипова, Ирина Ивановна (2000).

'''Tania''' (13 October 1893 — 17 February 1999) was the stage name of Spanish tango singer '''Ana Luciano Divis'''. She was one of the most significant tango interpreters of her era. She was honored as an Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires and a Personality of Argentine Culture, as well as receiving the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] from [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]].

In 1923, they traveled to Argentina&lt;ref name="Clarín obit" /&gt; as part of the Iberian Troupe led by Teresita España.&lt;ref name="El Portal del Tango" /&gt; The initial tour included performances in Brazil, where a guitarist, Mario Pardo,&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; suggested she perform a tango, "Fumando espero",&lt;ref name="La Nacion, tribute" /&gt; which was well received and she added it to her repertoire.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; Later she added the tango "Esta noche me emborracho", which would lead to her introduction to the composer who would become her life companion.&lt;ref name="La Nacion, tribute" /&gt; By 1926, the troupe fell apart, her marriage had floundered and her husband returned to Spain, but Tania returned to Buenos Aires, as a solo act called "The Galician of Toledo".&lt;ref name="El Portal del Tango" /&gt; In 1927, [[José Razzano]] introduced her to [[Enrique Santos Discépolo]]&lt;ref name="Clarín obit" /&gt; at a cabaret performance of the Buenos Aires version of the [[Folies Bergère]].&lt;ref name="Independent, obit" /&gt; Razzano wanted Discépolo to hear Tania's rendition of his song. Almost from their meeting, they were never separated, though they did not marry.&lt;ref name="La Nacion, tribute" /&gt; She was called Discépolo's muse,&lt;ref name="Nacion obit" /&gt; but both of their careers took off once they joined their artistic and personal lives. He became a noted composer of tangos and she was one of the most popular interpreters of the genre.&lt;ref name="Independent, obit" /&gt;

[[File:Tania4.jpg|thumb|Tania and Enrique Santos Discépolo]]In the 1930s, Tania performed in live theater with shows under Discépolo's direction, including "La Perichona"  and "Mis canciones" in 1932, "Wunder Bar" in 1933 and "Winter Garden" in 1935.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; She sang on the radio beginning with a performance on Radio Prieto and then in 1937 sang on Radio Municipal.&lt;ref name="El Portal del Tango" /&gt; She worked on three films, ''[[El pobre Pérez]]'' (1937) with [[Luis César Amadori]], ''[[Four Hearts (1939 film)|Cuatro corazones]]'' (1939) and ''[[Caprichosa y millonaria]]'' (1940) both under the direction of Discépolo.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; They also had successes in the 1940s, with Tania performing as a soloist on Del Pueblo, Paris and Belgrano radio stations. She performed in "El Mundo" (the World) in 1945 with Mariano Mores.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; In 1946, they did a tour through Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Peru and then in 1947, Tania did a series on Radio Belgrano called "Cómo nacieron mis canciones" (How my songs were born) with Discépolo and made recordings with [[Columbia Records]], [[Odeon Records]] and [[RCA Victor]].&lt;ref name="El Portal del Tango" /&gt; She returned to live theater with "Blum"&lt;ref name="Nacion obit" /&gt; in 1949 and then did the same show in a final theatrical season from 1950-1951, the year Discépolo died, at the Teatro Gran Splendid.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt;

After Discépolo's death, Tania left Argentina, making an extended tour of Latin America and Europe. In part, it was due to her support of [[Juan Perón]] and the backlash against his supporters after his [[Revolución Libertadora|ouster in 1955]]. Tania did not return to Argentina until 1959, when she returned to help inaugurate a memorial home for the tango, which became known as "Cambalache", located  on Liberty Street near its intersection with Córdoba.&lt;ref name="Nacion obit" /&gt; She wrote her memoirs in 1973 with Jorge Miguel Couselo,&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt; but tango had gone out of style in the 1960s and would not make a comeback until the 1980s. When worldwide recognition of the genre re-emerged, Tania's recordings from the 1930s and 1940s were at the forefront again.&lt;ref name="Independent, obit" /&gt; From 1983 to 1988 she performed at the Teatro de la Ribera, simultaneously performing in "Botica de Tango" on Channel 11.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt;

In 1989, she was declared an Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires by the city council.&lt;ref name="La Nacion, tribute" /&gt; In 1993, she received from King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]]&lt;ref name="Clarín obit"/&gt; the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] and then in 1998, Tania was declared an Honored Personality of the Culture of Argentina by the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name="La Nacion, tribute" /&gt; 
She died on 17 February 1999 in the apartment she had shared with Discépolo and was buried in [[La Chacarita cemetery|La Chacarita Cemetery]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="Pagina 12 obit" /&gt;

==Advocacy==
A [[Dallas, Texas]] resident, Curry is on the board of the Dallas Red Foundation, "a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on providing financial support to organizations in the [[North Texas]] area that serve individuals affected by HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name=redpartydallas1&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://redpartydallas.org/|website=Red Party Dallas|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 board of directors includes president Jeff McKnight, treasurer Jeff Alley, secretary Travis Munson, and board members Dusin Cobb, Curry, Joey Sanders, Ernesto José Herrera-Brito, James Kendall,Devin White, Cody Lynch, Jared A.

Curry is a senior editor and head writer at HIV Equal Online, an online magazine described as "an international multimedia campaign that aims to end HIV stigma and promote HIV testing by creating a social art movement that changes the way people think about HIV and which  reopens the national dialogue about HIV."&lt;ref name=hivequal1&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Equal|url=http://www.hivequal.org/|website=HIV Equal|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry's role includes publishing editorial content for the website and working with [[freelance writers]].&lt;ref name=HIVequal2&gt;{{cite web|title=TYLER CURRY   SENIOR EDITOR|url=http://hivequal.org/tyler-curry.html|website=HIV Equal|accessdate=10 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083329/http://hivequal.org/tyler-curry.html|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an editorial and education campaign, TNPP works for the fight against [[discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS]]. On the receiving end of discrimination due to HIV, Curry was not allowed back into [[South Korea]] after [[Teaching English as a foreign language|teaching English]] for a year.&lt;ref name=Taffet1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taffet|first1=David|title=Get Pricked|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/pricked-10140950.html|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Dallas Voice|date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea had a policy of not issuing [[Visa policy of South Korea#Foreign Language teaching .28E-2.29 visa|work permits]] for people that have HIV, but that policy has since been amended.&lt;ref name=Solis1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solis|first1=Michael|title=Korea Maintains Mandatory HIV Testing Despite Lifting Travel Ban|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-solis/korea-maintains-mandatory_b_443724.html|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=Huffington Post|date=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willie Howard Mays, Jr.''' (born May 6, 1931), nicknamed "'''The Say Hey Kid'''", is an [[Americans|American]] former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[center fielder]] who spent almost all of his 22-season career playing for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York/San Francisco Giants]], before finishing with the [[New York Mets]]. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1979|1979]].

Mays won two National League (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) awards, ended his career with 660 [[home run]]s—third at the time of his retirement and currently fifth all-time—and won a record-tying 12 [[Gold Glove]] awards beginning in 1957, when the award was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/awards/mlb_awards_content.jsp?content=gold_gloves_history MLB Awards | MLB.com: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mays shares the record of most [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] played with 24, with [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Stan Musial]].&lt;ref name="sportsdatallc.com"&gt;Sportsdata.

Mays' career statistics and his longevity in the pre-[[performance-enhancing drugs]] era have drawn speculation that he may be the finest [[five-tool player]] ever, and many surveys and expert analyses, which have examined Mays' relative performance, have led to a growing opinion that Mays was possibly the greatest all-around baseball player of all time.&lt;ref name=Greatest /&gt; In 1999, Mays placed second on ''[[The Sporting News]]''{{'}}s "List of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players", making him the highest-ranking living player. Later that year, he was also elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. Mays is one of five National League players to have had eight consecutive 100-RBI seasons, along with [[Mel Ott]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Chipper Jones]], and [[Albert Pujols]]. Mays hit over 50 home runs in 1955 and 1965, representing the longest time span between 50-plus home run seasons for any player in [[Major League Baseball]] history. His final [[Major League Baseball]] appearance came on October 16 during Game 3 of the [[1973 World Series]].

==Early life==

Mays was born in 1931 in [[Westfield, Alabama]], a former primarily black settlement near [[Fairfield, Alabama|Fairfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Jesse Chambers |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2013/08/new_documentary_film_remembers.html |title=New film remembers long-gone West Jefferson community of Westfield, home of Mays, Clemon |newspaper=The Birmingham News |date=August 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Cat Mays, was a talented baseball player with the Negro team for the local iron plant.&lt;ref name="mainbooksource"&gt;{{cite book |title=Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend|author=James S.

==Professional baseball==

===Negro leagues===
Mays' [[professional baseball]] career began in 1947, while he was still in high school; he played briefly with the [[Chattanooga Choo-Choos]] in [[Tennessee]] during the summer. A short time later, Mays left the Choo-Choos and returned to his home state to join the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] of the [[Negro American League]]. Mays helped them win the pennant and advance to the 1948 [[Negro League World Series]], where they lost the series 4-1 to the [[Homestead Grays]]. Mays hit a respectable .262 for the season, but it was also his excellent fielding and baserunning that made him a standout. By playing professionally with the Black Barons, Mays jeopardized his opportunities to play high school sports in Alabama. This created some problems for him with high school administrators at Fairfield, who wanted him to help the teams and ticket sales.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, p. 38-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, a number of major league baseball franchises sent scouts to watch him play. The first was the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. The scout who discovered him, Bud Maughn, had been following him for over a year and referred him to the Braves, who then packaged a deal that called for $7,500 down and $7,500 in 30 days. They also planned to give Mays $6,000. The obstacle in the deal was that Tom Hayes, owner of the [[Birmingham Black Barons]], wanted to keep Mays for the balance of the season. Had the team been able to act more quickly, the Braves franchise might have had both Mays and [[Hank Aaron]] in their outfield from 1954 to 1973. The [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] also scouted him and wanted Ray Blades to negotiate a deal, but were too late. The New York Giants had already signed Mays for $4,000 and assigned him to their Class-B affiliate in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;June 22, 1950 letter from Eddie Montague to Jack Schwarz&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor leagues===
After Mays batted .353 in Trenton, he began the 1951 season with the class AAA [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. During his short time span in Minneapolis, Mays played with two other future Hall of Famers: [[Hoyt Wilhelm]] and [[Ray Dandridge]]. Batting .477 in 35 games and playing excellent defense, Mays was called up to the Giants on May 24, 1951. Mays was at a [[movie theater]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] when he found out he was being called up. A message flashed up on the screen that said:  "WILLIE MAYS CALL YOUR HOTEL."&lt;ref&gt;''The Giants of the Polo Grounds'' by Noel Hynd (1988). New York: Doubleday. page 358. {{ISBN|0-385 23790-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in his first major league game the next day in [[Philadelphia]]. Mays moved to [[Harlem, New York]], where his mentor was a [[New York State Boxing Commission]] official and former Harlem Rens basketball legend  "Strangler" [[Frank Forbes]].

===Major leagues===

====New York Giants (1951–57)====
Mays began his major league career on a sour note, with no hits in his first 12 [[at bat]]s. On his 13th at-bat, however, he hit a towering home run over the left field roof of the [[Polo Grounds]] off of future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Warren Spahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016223.html ESPN.com: Mays brought joy to baseball&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Spahn later joked, "I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out."  Mays's batting average improved steadily throughout the rest of the season. Although his .274 average, 68 RBI and 20 homers (in 121 games) were among the lowest of his career, he still won the 1951 [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]]. During the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants']] comeback in August and September 1951 to tie the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] in the pennant race, Mays' fielding and strong throwing arm were instrumental to several important Giants victories.&lt;ref&gt;''Willie Mays'', by Matt von Albade, Tempo Books, Grosset &amp; Dunlop, Inc.

The Giants went on to meet the [[1951 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[1951 World Series]]. In Game 1, Mays, [[Hank Thompson (baseball)|Hank Thompson]] and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Monte Irvin]] comprised the first all-[[African-American]] outfield in major league history four years after the color line was broken.&lt;ref&gt;''Willie Mays'', by Arnold Hano, Tempo Books, Grosset &amp; Dunlop, Inc.

The six-game set was the only time that Mays and retiring Yankee slugger [[Joe DiMaggio]] would compete against each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Series|The Series]]'', an illustrated history of Baseball's postseason showcase, 1903–1993, [[The Sporting News]], copyright 1993, The Sporting News Publishing Co. pp. 144–145 {{ISBN|0-89204-476-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mays was a popular figure in [[Harlem, New York|Harlem]]. Magazine photographers were fond of chronicling his participation in local stickball games with kids. It was said that in the urban game of hitting a rubber ball with an adapted broomstick handle, Mays could hit a shot that measured "six sewers" (the distance of six consecutive New York City manhole covers, nearly 300 feet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.500hrc.com/600-hrc-articles/willie-mays-learned-to-hit-curveball-playing-stickball-with-kids-during-rookie-year-in-the-bigs.html Jim Rednour, ''Willie Mays Learned To Hit Curveball Playing Stickball with Kids During Rookie Year In The Bigs''] Retrieved April 9, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harlembespoke.blogspot.com/2011/01/see-willie-mays-in-harlem.html Willie Mays &amp; Stickball in Harlem] Retrieved April 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. Army (1952–53)====
The United States Army [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] Mays in 1952 during the [[Korean War]] (1950–53) and he subsequently missed most of that season and all of the 1953 season. Mays spent much of his time in the Army playing baseball at [[Fort Eustis]], Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&amp;v=l&amp;bid=388&amp;pid=9039 BIOPROJ.SABR.ORG :: The Baseball Biography Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Fort Eustis that Mays learned the [[Glossary_of_baseball_(B)#basket_catch|basket catch]] from a fellow Fort Eustis outfielder, Jerry Salvador. Mays missed about 266 games due to military service.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.army.mil/article/200712/baseball_great_and_the_fort_eustis_connection&lt;/ref&gt;

====1954 season====

In [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954]], Mays returned to the Giants and hit for a league-leading .345 batting average while slugging 41 home runs en route to his only World Series championship. Mays won the National League [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player Award]] and the [[Hickok Belt]] as top professional athlete of the year. He also was selected as an All-Star for the first of 19 consecutive seasons (20 total)&lt;ref name="baseballhall.org"&gt;Baseball Hall of Fame, Willie Mays, ''"20-time All-Star"'' [http://baseballhall.org/hof/Mays-willie] Retrieved April 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, Patrick.

Retrieved April 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced [[Jackie Robinson]] in left field during the 4th inning of the All-Star Game. The Giants won the [[National League pennant winners 1901-68|National League pennant]] and the [[1954 World Series]], sweeping the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in four games. The 1954 series is perhaps best remembered for "[[The Catch (baseball)|The Catch]]", an over-the-shoulder running grab by Mays in deep center field of the Polo Grounds of a long drive off the bat of [[Vic Wertz]] during the eighth inning of Game 1. Considered the iconic image of Mays' playing career and one of baseball's most memorable fielding plays,&lt;ref name="espn.go.com"&gt;[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00215053.html ESPN.com: The Say Hey Kid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the catch prevented two Indian runners from scoring, preserving a tie game. The Giants won the game in the 10th inning on a three-run home run by [[Dusty Rhodes (outfielder)|Dusty Rhodes]], with Mays scoring the winning run. The 1954 World Series was the team's last championship while based in New York. The next time the franchise won was 56 years later when the [[San Francisco Giants]] won the World Series in 2010.

[[File:Willie Mays 1954.png|thumb|195px| Mays in 1954.]]
Mays went on to perform at a high level each of the last three years the Giants were in New York. In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs. In 1956, he hit 36 homers and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player, to join the "[[30–30 club]]". In 1957, the first season the [[Gold Glove]] award was presented, he won the first of 12 consecutive [[Gold Glove Award]]s. At the same time, Mays continued to finish in the National League's top-five in a variety of offensive categories. Mays, [[Roberto Clemente]] (also with 12), [[Al Kaline]], [[Andruw Jones]], [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and [[Ichiro Suzuki]] are the only outfielders to have ten or more career Gold Gloves. In 1957, Mays become the fourth player in major league history to join the [[20–20–20 club]] (2B, 3B, HR), something no player had accomplished since 1941. Mays also stole 38 bases that year, making him the second player in baseball history (after [[Frank Schulte]] in 1911) to reach 20 in each of those four categories (doubles, triples, homers, steals) in the same season.

====San Francisco Giants (1958–72)====
After the 1957 season, the Giants franchise relocated to San Francisco, California. Mays bought two homes in San Francisco, then lived in nearby [[Atherton, California|Atherton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outsidelands.org/sw5.php Streetwise: Willie Mays – Western Neighborhoods Project – San Francisco History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kay Linge, ''Willie Mays: A Biography'' (Greenwood Press, 2005), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; As he did in 1954, Mays vied for the National League batting title in 1958 until the final game of the season. Mays collected three hits in the game to finish with a career-high .347, but [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' [[Richie Ashburn]] won the title with a .350 batting average. He did manage to share the inaugural [[MLB Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month award]] with Stan Musial in May (no such award was given out in April until 1969), batting .405 with 12&amp;nbsp;HR and 29 RBI; he won a second such award in September (.434, 4 HR, 18 RBIs).

In 1959, the Giants led by two games with only eight games to play, but only won two of their remaining games and finished fourth, as their pitching staff collapsed due to overwork of their top hurlers. The Dodgers won the pennant following a playoff with the [[Milwaukee Braves]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sports Encyclopedia: Baseball (6th edition), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; As he did in New York, Mays would "play around" with kids playing sandlot ball in San Francisco. On three occasions in 1959 or 1960, he visited Julius Kahn Playground, five blocks from where he lived, including one time Giant players [[Jim Davenport]] and [[Tom Haller]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}{{clarify|date=September 2016}}

[[Alvin Dark]] was hired to manage the Giants before the start of the 1961 season and named Mays team captain. The improving Giants finished 1961 in third place and won 85 games, more than any of the previous six campaigns. Mays had one of his best games on April 30, 1961, [[List of Major League Baseball single-game home run leaders|hitting four home runs]] and driving in eight runs in a 14–4 win against the Milwaukee Braves at [[County Stadium]]. Mays went 4-for-5 at the plate and was on deck for a chance to hit a record fifth home run when the Giants' half of the ninth inning ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1961/B04300MLN1961.htm April 30, 1961 box score and play-by-play].

The Giants won the National League pennant in 1962, with Mays leading the team in eight offensive categories. The team finished the regular season in a tie for first place with the [[1962 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], and went on to win a three-game playoff series against the Dodgers, advancing to play in the [[1962 World Series|World Series]]. The Giants lost to the [[1962 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in seven games, and Mays batted .250 with two extra-base hits. It was his last World Series appearance as a member of the Giants.

In the 1963 and 1964 seasons Mays batted in over 100 runs and hit 85 total home runs. On July 2, 1963, Mays played in a game when future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] members [[Warren Spahn]] and [[Juan Marichal]] each threw 15 scoreless innings. In the bottom of the 16th inning, Mays hit a home run off Spahn for a 1–0 Giants victory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196307020.shtml July 2, 1963 Milwaukee Braves at San Francisco Giants Box Score and Play by Play] ''Baseball-Reference''&lt;/ref&gt; He won his third NL Player of the Month Award in August (.387, 8 HR, 27 RBI).

Mays won his second MVP award in 1965 behind a career-high 52 home runs. On September 13, 1965, he hit his 500th career home run off [[Don Nottebart]]. Warren Spahn, off whom Mays hit his first career home run, was his teammate at the time. After the home run, Spahn greeted Mays in the dugout, asking "Was it anything like the same feeling?" Mays replied "It was exactly the same feeling. Same pitch, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/15/SPGKS61N7V12.DTL | title=The majesty of Mays | first=Charles | last=Einstein | date=April 15, 2004 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, 1965, Mays and [[Sandy Koufax]] acted as peacemakers during a 14-minute brawl between the Giants and Dodgers after San Francisco pitcher Juan Marichal had bloodied Dodgers catcher [[John Roseboro]] with a bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_10_59/ai_65131125/pg_6 |title=Letting Off Steam – confrontations between players, fans and umpires |first=George |last=Vass |year=2000 |work=Baseball Digest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014021253/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_10_59/ai_65131125/pg_6 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won his fourth and final NL Player of the Month award in August (.363, 17&amp;nbsp;HR, 29 RBI), while setting the NL record for most home runs in the month of August (since tied by Sammy Sosa in 2001).

Mays played in over 150 games for 13 consecutive years (a major-league record) from 1954 to 1966. In 1966, his last with 100 RBIs, Mays finished third in the National League MVP voting. It was the ninth and final time he finished in the top five in the voting for the award.&lt;ref&gt;He also finished sixth in the balloting three times.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the ''[[Sporting News]]'' named Mays as the 1960s "Player of the Decade."

Mays hit his 600th home run off San Diego's [[Mike Corkins]] in September 1969. Plagued by injuries that season, he managed only 13 home runs. Mays enjoyed a resurgence in 1970, hitting 28 homers, and got off to a fast start in 1971, the year he turned 40. He had 15 home runs at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break but faded down the stretch and finished with 18. Mays helped the Giants win the division title that year, but they lost the [[NLCS]] to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].

During his time on the Giants, Mays and fellow player [[Bobby Bonds]] were friends. When Bobby's son, [[Barry Bonds]], was born, Bobby asked Mays to be Barry's godfather. Mays and the younger Bonds have maintained a close relationship ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://blogcritics.org/sports/article/q-are-barry-bonds-and-willie/ |title=Q: Are Barry Bonds and Willie Mays Related? {{!}} Blogcritics |access-date=February 19, 2013 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130414102119/http://blogcritics.org/sports/article/q-are-barry-bonds-and-willie/ |archive-date=April 14, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York Mets (1972–73)====
In May 1972, 41-year-old Mays was traded to the [[New York Mets|Mets]] for pitcher [[Charlie Williams (pitcher)|Charlie Williams]] and $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1972|r=-4}}}} today).&lt;ref name="trade"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mays Trade (at bottom) |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mayswi01.shtml |accessdate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Giants franchise was losing money. Owner [[Horace Stoneham]] could not guarantee Mays a pension after retirement and the Mets offered Mays a coaching position upon his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun McCormack, ''Willie Mays'' (Rosen Publishing Group, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mays had remained popular in New York long after the Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade was seen as a public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner [[Joan Whitney Payson|Joan Payson]], who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots and was instrumental in making the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Paul; and Lucas, Ed.

Accessed July 15, 2008. "Mets owner Joan Payson had always wanted to bring the 'Say Hey Kid' back to his baseball roots, and she finally pulled it off in a deal that shocked the baseball world."&lt;/ref&gt; In his Mets debut on a rainy Sunday afternoon at [[Shea Stadium]] on May 14, 1972, Mays put New York ahead to stay with a fifth-inning home run against [[Don Carrithers]] and his former team, the Giants. On August 16, 1973 of the following season, in a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]] with [[Don Gullett]] on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home run of his major league career.

Mays played a season and a half with the Mets before retiring; he appeared in 133 games. The Mets honored him on September 25, 1973, (Willie Mays Night) where he thanked the New York fans and said goodbye to baseball. He finished his career in the [[1973 World Series]], which the [[1973 New York Mets season|Mets]] lost to the [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in seven games. Mays got the first hit of the Series, but had only seven at-bats (with two hits). The final hit of his career came in Game 2, a key single to help the Mets win. He also fell down in the outfield during a play where he was hindered by the glare of the sun and by the hard outfield. Mays later said, "growing old is just a helpless hurt." His final at bat came on October 16, in Game 3 where he came in as a pinch hitter but grounded into a [[force play]]. Mays made his 20th and last All-Star appearance (20 seasons)&lt;ref name="baseballhall.org"/&gt; and 24th All-Star Game appearance&lt;ref name="sportsdatallc.com"/&gt; on July 24, 1973 when he was used as a pinch hitter.

In 1972 and 1973, Mays was the oldest regular position player in baseball. At age 42, he became the oldest position player to appear in a World Series game.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Willie's Time'', by [[Charles Einstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mays retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 outfield [[putouts]] remains the major league record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/PO_of_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Putouts as OF |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mays is the only major league player to have hit a home run in every inning from the 1st through the 16th innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sabr.org/research/offbeat-record-held-willie-mays An Offbeat Record Held By Willie Mays | SABR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his career with a record 22 extra-inning home runs.

After Mays retired as a player, he remained an active personality. Just as he had during his playing days, Mays continued to appear on various TV shows, in films and in other forms of non-sports-related media. He remained in the New York Mets organization as their hitting instructor until the end of the 1979 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mays on the IMDBb |url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0563092/ |accessdate=October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there where he taught future Mets star [[Lee Mazzilli]] his famous basket catch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080908&amp;content_id=3438789&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym |title=For Mazzilli, nothing like meeting Mays |website= mlb.com |first=Marty|last=Noble|date=September 8, 2008 |access-date=August 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001646/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080908&amp;content_id=3438789&amp;vkey=news_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym |archive-date=December 16, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 1979, Mays was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility. He garnered 409 of the 432 ballots cast (roughly 95 percent);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/history/hof_voting/year/1979.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the other 23 voters, acerbic ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]] wrote, "If Jesus Christ were to show up with his old baseball glove, some guys wouldn't vote for him. He dropped the cross three times, didn't he?"&lt;ref name="espn.go.com" /&gt;

Mays took up [[golf]] a few years after his promotion to the major leagues and quickly became an accomplished player, playing to a handicap of about four. After he retired, he played golf frequently in the San Francisco area.&lt;ref&gt;''Willie Mays: The Life, The Legend'', by James Hirsch, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his Hall of Fame election, Mays took a job at the Park Place Casino (now [[Bally's Atlantic City]]) in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]]. While there, he served as a Special Assistant to the Casino's President and as a greeter. After being told by [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Bowie Kuhn]] that he could not be both a coach and baseball goodwill ambassador while at the same time working for Bally's, Mays chose to terminate his baseball relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&amp;dat=19791030&amp;id=lktNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FjMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5264,5004502 Mays leaves baseball]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 [[Peter Ueberroth]], Kuhn's successor, decided to allow Mays and [[Mickey Mantle]] to return to baseball.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&amp;dat=19850319&amp;id=iQBgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rQwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1143,6453714 Ueberroth reinstates Mays, Mantle to baseball]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mays, Mantle had gone to work for an Atlantic City casino and had to give up any baseball positions he held.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19830209&amp;id=2lUvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=39oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1579,1421041 Bowie bounces Mantle]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] in 1985, former Mets teammate [[John Milner]] testified that Mays kept a bottle of liquid amphetamine in his locker at [[Shea Stadium]]. Milner admitted, however, that he had never seen Mays use amphetamines and Mays himself denied ever having taken any drugs during his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 13, 1985|title=Mays' Locker Was Source of Amphetamines--Milner|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-13/sports/sp-22701_1_willie-mays|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, Mays has served as Special Assistant to the President of the San Francisco Giants. Mays' number 24 is retired by the San Francisco Giants. [[AT&amp;T Park]], the Giants stadium, is located at 24 ''Willie Mays Plaza''. In front of the main entrance to the stadium is a larger-than-life statue of Mays. He also serves on the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro league players through financial and medical difficulties.

On February 10, 2010, Mays appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', discussing his career and a new biography, ''Willie Mays: The Life, the Legend'', by [[James S. Hirsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://thedailyshow.cc.com/episodes/f1nm9c/february-10--2010---willie-mays |title=FEBRUARY 10, 2010 – WILLIE MAYS|work=[[The Daily Show]] |date = February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequent traveler, Mays is one of 66 holders of [[American Airlines]]' lifetime passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/05/business/la-fi-0506-golden-ticket-20120506 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Bensinger | title=The frequent fliers who flew too much | date=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mays' [[godson]] [[Barry Bonds]] tied him for third on the all-time home run list, Mays greeted and presented him with a diamond-studded [[Olympic torch]] (given to Mays when he carried the torch during its tour through the United States). In 1992, when Bonds signed a free agent contract with the Giants, Mays personally offered Bonds his retired #24 (the number Bonds wore in [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh]]) but Bonds declined, electing to wear #25 instead, honoring his father, [[Bobby Bonds]], who wore that number with the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=December 11, 1992 |title=Bonds to Wear No. 25 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/11/sports/sports-people-baseball-bonds-to-wear-no-25.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willie Mays Day was proclaimed by former mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] and reaffirmed by mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] to be every May 24 in San Francisco, paying tribute not only to his birth in the month (May 6), but also to his name (Mays) and jersey number (24).

On May 6, 2010, on the occasion of his 79th birthday, Mays appeared on the floor of the [[California State Senate]] where they proclaimed it Willie Mays Day in the state.

On May 15, 2010, Mays was awarded the Major League Baseball Beacon of Life Award at the Civil Rights game at Great American Ball Park.

Mays has been mentioned or referenced in many popular songs. [[The Treniers]] recorded the song "Say Hey (The Willie Mays Song)" in 1955. The band [[Widespread Panic]] makes reference to Mays in the song "One Arm Steve" from their album ''[['Til the Medicine Takes]]''. [[Terry Cashman]]'s song "[[Talkin' Baseball]]" has the refrain "Willie, Mickey and the Duke", which subsequently became the title of an award given by the New York Baseball Writers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/willie_mickey_and_the_duke_award.shtml Willie, Mickey and the Duke Award]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Fogerty]] mentioned Mays, [[Ty Cobb]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] in his song "[[Centerfield (song)|Centerfield]]". His name was also used on the album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' in the song "I Shall Be Free", and in [[Gil Scott-Heron]]'s song "[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]." [[Chuck Prophet]] and Kurt Lipschutz (pen name, klipschutz) co-wrote the song "Willie Mays is Up at Bat" for Prophet's 2012 ''[[Temple Beautiful]]'' album, a tribute to San Francisco. Mays is also mentioned in "Our Song" by singer-songwriter [[Joe Henry]] from the 2007 album ''[[Civilian s (Joe Henry album)|Civilians]]''.  He is also the subject of the 1994 [[Americana music]] song "Homerun Willie" by [[John Dunnigan]].

Mays was mentioned numerous times in [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s comic strip ''[[Peanuts]]''. One of the most famous of these strips was originally published on February 9, 1966. In it, [[Charlie Brown]] is competing in a class spelling bee and he is asked to spell the word, "Maze". He erroneously spells it M-A-Y-S and screams out his dismay when he is eliminated. When Charlie Brown is later sent to the principal's office for raising his voice at the teacher regarding the incident, he wonders if one day he will meet Willie Mays and will have a good laugh together about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schulzmuseum.org/willie-mays-and-a-charlie-brown-christmas/ Charles M. Schulz MuseumWillie Mays and A Charlie Brown Christmas | Charles M. Schulz Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Willie Mays Parkway and Willie Mays Park in [[Orlando, Florida]] were named after Mays.

Mays also appears on [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]]'s "Adentro" music video, where he gives to lead singer, [[René Pérez]] a bag containing a pair of sunglasses, a [[Roberto Clemente]]'s baseball uniform, and a baseball bat signed by him, who then will be used by René to destroy his own luxury car, a [[Maserati]], in an attempt to widespread a message to youth about how irresponsible promoting of ostentatious luxury excesses in urban music as a status symbol, have them all killing between themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calle 13 grabó video junto al legendario beisbolista Willie Mays|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/entretencion/musica/calle-13/calle-13-grabo-video-junto-al-legendario-beisbolista-willie-mays/2014-03-05/164733.html|publisher=Cooperativa.cl|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Cooperativa.cl|language=Spanish|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantor-Navas|first=Judy|title=Willie Mays Appears in Calle 13's New Video: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/5930141/willie-mays-appears-in-calle-13-video-watch-adentro|work=Billboard|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=9 March 2014|date=March 6, 2014 &lt;!-- 6:21 PM EST --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movies ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'' and ''[[Major League II]]'', the center fielder for the [[Cleveland Indians]] is named Willie Mays Hayes. He was originally portrayed by a then-unknown [[Wesley Snipes]], but [[Omar Epps]] replaced Snipes in the sequel.

===1956 Willie Mays Major League Negro-American All-Stars Tour===
In 1956, Mays persuaded many of Major League Baseball's biggest black stars to go on a tour around the country after the season had ended to play exhibition games. While much of the tour was undocumented, one venue was Andrews Field,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/park.cgi?id=AR010 Andrews Field Minor League History] ''Baseball-Reference''&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], on October 16. Among the players who played in that game were Mays, [[Frank Robinson]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Elston Howard]], [[Monte Irvin]], [[Gene Baker]], [[Charles Johnson (baseball, born 1909)|Charlie Johnson]], [[Sam Jones (baseball)|Sam Jones]], [[Hank Thompson (baseball)|Hank Thompson]] and [[Joe Black]].

===Presidential Medal of Freedom===

In November 2015, Mays was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[President Barack Obama]] during a ceremony at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/11/16/yogi-berra-willie-mays-are-recipients-of-presidential-medal-of-freedom-president-obama/75889844/ | title=Yogi Berra, Willie Mays are recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom | work=[[USA Today]] | date=November 16, 2015 | accessdate=November 16, 2015 | author=Boeck, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC112515&gt;Phil Helsel – [http://www.aol.com/article/2015/11/24/obama-honoring-spielberg-streisand-and-more-with-medal-of-freed/21272337/?icid=maing-grid7%7Chtmlws-sb-bb%7Cdl3%7Csec1_lnk3%26pLid%3D-40526639 "Obama honoring Spielberg, Streisand and more with medal of freedom,"] ''NBC News'', November 24, 2015. Retrieved 2015-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony Obama credited Mays' baseball career with his own success, saying, "Willie also served our country: In his quiet example while excelling on one of America's biggest stages [he] helped carry forward the banner of civil rights", adding, "It's because of giants like Willie that someone like me could even think about running for president."&lt;ref name=NBC112515/&gt;

==Television appearances==
In addition to appearances in baseball documentaries and on talk shows, Mays has appeared in several sitcoms over the years, always as himself. He appeared as the mystery guest during different incarnations of the long-running game show ''[[What's My Line?]]''. He was in three episodes of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'': "Play Ball" and "My Son the Catcher" (both 1964) and "Calling Willie Mays" (1966). Also in 1966, he appeared in the "Twitch or Treat" episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which Darrin Stephens asks if Mays is a warlock, and Samantha Stephens replies, "The way he hits?  What else?"  In 1989, he appeared in ''[[My Two Dads]]'', in the episode "You Love Me, Right?", and in the episode "The Field" of ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''. Additionally, he had performed "Say Hey: The Willie Mays Song" on episode 4.46 of the ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0563092|Willie Mays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mays also voiced himself in the 1972 animated film ''[[Willie Mays and the Say-Hey Kid]]''.

==Personal life==
Mays married Marghuerite Wendell Chapman (1926–2010) in 1956, and they adopted their son Michael, who was born in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Willie Mays: The Life, The Legend'', by [[James Hirsch]], 2010, Scribner, New York, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 1962 or 1963, varying by source. Mays married Mae Louise Allen in November 1971; she died on April 19, 2013, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/giants/2013/04/19/willie-mays-wife-mae-dies-at-74/ |title=Willie Mays' wife, Mae, dies at 74 |first=John |last=Shea |date=April 19, 2013 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2000}}, Mays lived in [[Atherton, California]], in a house he bought in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glen |last=Dickey |url=https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Fans-Must-Learn-To-Let-Go-of-Stars-2755911.php |title=Fans Must Learn To Let Go of Stars |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=June 9, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Say Hey Kid" and other nicknames==
[[File:Willie Mays tribute display, AT&amp;T Park.JPG|thumb|Willie Mays tribute display at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, California]]

It is not clear how Mays became known as the "Say Hey Kid." One story is that in 1951, Barney Kremenko, a writer for the ''[[New York Journal]]'', began to refer to Mays as the 'Say Hey Kid' after he overheard Mays say, "'Say who,' 'Say what,' 'Say where,' 'Say hey'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mays earns his nickname |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/000725williemaysadd.html |accessdate=October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another story is that Jimmy Cannon created the nickname because Mays did not know everybody's names when he arrived in the minors. "You see a guy, you say, 'Hey, man. Say hey, man,'" Mays said. "Ted [Williams] was the 'Splinter'. Joe [DiMaggio] was 'Joltin' Joe'. Stan [Musial] was 'The Man'. I guess I hit a few home runs, and they said 'There goes the 'Say Hey Kid.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Article on Mays |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/03/SPGV1IJEEB1.DTL |accessdate=October 21, 2006 | first=John | last=Shea | date=May 3, 2006 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years before he became the "Say Hey Kid", when he began his professional career with the Black Barons, Mays was called "Buck" by teammates and fans.&lt;ref name="buck"&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |url=http://www.coe.ksu.edu/nlbemuseum/history/players/mays.html |title=eMuseum: Willie Mays |work= |publisher=Negro Leagues Baseball Museum |accessdate=March 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Giants players referred to him, their team captain, as "Cap."

'''Zeniff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|ɪ|f}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «zē´nĭf»&lt;/ref&gt; is a minor but pivotal person in the [[Book of Mormon]].  He is a [[Nephite]].  He left [[Zarahemla]] with a group of Nephites to go to the [[Lehi-Nephi|land of Nephi]].  This is remarkable since the Nephites had previously abandoned the land of Nephi.  At the time of Zeniff's journey to the [[Lehi-Nephi|land of Nephi]], it was inhabited by the Nephite's arch-enemies, the [[Lamanites]].  Zeniff became the king of the group of Nephites with whom he went to the [[Lehi-Nephi|land of Nephi]].

He is the first of three kings whose story is recounted in [[The Record of Zeniff]]. The record concerns a group of [[Nephite]]s who returned for a time to the [[Lehi-Nephi|land of Nephi]] but who were ultimately driven out by the [[Lamanites]].

==Background==
[[The Record of Zeniff#Background|The Record of Zeniff]] contains a synopsis of the history of the Nephites up to the time of Zeniff. At the time of Zeniff, the Nephites were living in the land of [[Zarahemla]] and the land of Nephi was occupied by the Lamanites.

==The Return to the Land of Nephi==
After [[King Mosiah I|Mosiah]]'s death, during the reign of his son, [[King Benjamin]], an army of Nephites determined to return to the land of Nephi and "possess the land of their inheritance" (Omni 1:27). Zeniff was among this group. When they drew near to the land of Nephi, Zeniff was sent to spy on the Lamanites, so that their army could destroy them. After seeing the Lamanites, Zeniff felt that they should not be destroyed but that the Nephites should enter into a treaty with them. The (unnamed) leader of the Nephite army, "an austere and blood-thirsty man", viewed this report as treasonous and tried to have Zeniff put to death. Fighting broke out among the Nephites, "the greater part of their army was destroyed", and "those that were spared" returned to the land of Zarahemla (Mosiah 9:1-2).

After a short time, Zeniff, who describes himself as "over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers" (Mosiah 9:3), gathered another group of Nephites and returned to the land of the Lamanites. This time Zeniff went to the king of the Lamanites and, pledging peace, persuaded him to let them stay in the land. The Lamanite king, Laman, gave them the land of '''''Lehi-Nephi''''' and the land of ''Shilom'', after commanding the Lamanites in those lands to depart.

==Contention with the Lamanites==
The people of Zeniff lived peacefully for twelve years, but Zeniff began to realize that King Laman had deceived him and did not intend for them to live in peace, but intended to exploit them and take, by force, the goods they produced. At first the Lamanite aggressions were limited to small pillaging raids, but soon a major battle was fought, with the Nephites victorious. Another ten years of watchful peace followed, until the death of King Laman, when Laman's son and successor again tried to drive the Nephites out of their land, but the Lamanites were once again defeated.

==An Uneasy Peace==
After these two great battles, Zeniff realized that their continued existence among the Lamanites would always be precarious. He ascribes their success in battle to their faith in God, and exhorts his people to always be faithful, since God alone can continue to deliver them from the Lamanites. His people enjoyed an uneasy peace throughout the rest of his reign and for some time afterward.

Grant Hardy says:

:''Zeniff has a remarkable ability to see the good in others, for earlier record keepers [in the Book of Mormon] such as [[Enos (Book of Mormon)|Enos]] and [[Jarom]] found nothing of value in [[Lamanite]] culture... Yet Zeniff, as a man of peace, argues that the Nephites should make a treaty with the Lamanites and regain the land of their inheritance through negotiation rather than conquest''&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After a reign of about forty years, Zeniff grew old and conferred the kingdom on his son, [[King Noah|Noah]]. (Zeniff's death is not specifically recorded.) King Noah "did not walk in the ways of his father" (Mosiah 11:2), but was sinful and idle. He taxed the people heavily to support himself and his corrupt supporters. Though warned by the prophet [[Abinadi]] that if he did not repent he would be destroyed, he continued his wicked practices and, as prophesied, he was killed and his people were conquered by the Lamanites. Noah's son [[Limhi]] became king, but he was subject to the Lamanite king and his people were forced to pay a tribute of one-half of all their possessions to the Lamanites.

The people of King Limhi were ultimately rescued by [[Ammon (Book of Mormon explorer)|Ammon]], who journeyed from the land of Zarahemla, helped them to escape and led them back to Zarahemla.
