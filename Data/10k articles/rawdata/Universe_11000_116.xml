[[Image:Flight8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tornado damage in [[Camilla, Georgia]] from the Southwest Georgia tornado outbreak]]The '''2000 Southwest Georgia tornado outbreak''' occurred between February 13 and February 14, 2000. Three deadly [[tornado]]es raked several counties of southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ([[United States|USA]]), killing 18 and causing extensive damage to neighborhoods on the south edge of [[Camilla, Georgia|Camilla]], where eleven died, as well as the area north of [[Meigs, Georgia|Meigs]], where six died.  It was the single deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States between June 1999 and October 2002. Other tornadoes struck [[Arkansas]], [[Alabama]], [[Tennessee]], [[Florida]] and the [[Carolinas]] during the 12-hour outbreak.

'''Abo Elementary School''' in [[Artesia, New Mexico|Artesia]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States]], was the first [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] in the United States constructed entirely underground and equipped to function as an advanced [[fallout shelter]].&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Kenneth|title=One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture|date=2001|publisher=New York University Press|location=London|isbn=0-8147-7522-5|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|137-139, 148}}Designed at the height of the [[Cold War]] and completed in 1962, the school had a [[concrete slab]] roof which doubled as the school's playground. It contained a large storage facility with room for emergency [[rations]] and supplies for up to 2,160 people in the event of [[nuclear warfare]] or other [[Disaster|catastrophe]]. The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

==Background==
Abo Elementary School was built partly to further the development of American [[fallout shelter]] design and to further knowledge about the long-term effects of life underground in a shelter environment.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;{{RP|138}} The US civil defense film ''[[Duck and Cover]]'' was produced with students in mind, in the hopes that they would learn how, in the event of a nuclear blast, to be shielded from glass and blast waves using desks and chairs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, educators, school administrators, and government officials soon realized that such measures would be inadequate, especially if a school received a direct hit from an atomic blast or was within the immediate blast radius of the weapon. One official argued that his school district was "in no position to guarantee physical protection… from a thermonuclear explosion or radioactive fallout."  Many state departments of education viewed the school shelter plans as "worthless".  California's Department of Education, for example, was given designs intended to reduce radiation levels inside the school to 1/100 the level outdoors. These plans were rejected. When the California Department of Education then specified protection which would increase the protection factor to 1/1,000, it judged the costs to be too high, and the plans were rejected.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;{{RP|137}}  Other departments of education and administrators rejected such plans because of their concern for the psychological well-being of their students, who, they believed, would be "constantly reminded of the possibility of a nuclear war" if kept in such a school for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;{{RP|148}}

==Construction==
Building the Abo Elementary School required that it be constructed with concrete reinforcing walls and a concrete outer shell to protect the inner parts of the school. To fulfill all requirements, Abo contained multiple drinking-water wells, a cafeteria, food storage, bedding and supplies for up to 2,160 people, air-filtration systems, an emergency power-generation system, decontamination systems, carpet, and a morgue.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;

Architect [[Frank Standhardt]], in designing the school said, "I consider my profession derelict on civil defense. We've had ten years of grace and done nothing about it."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Education: Underground School|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826586,00.html|work=Time|date=1960-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standhardt had built multiple aboveground windowless schools before Abo, believing them to positively influence pupils' ability to concentrate. He also cited reduced maintenance costs since there were no windows.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Loretta|title=Underground Buildings: More Than Meets the Eye|date=2004|publisher=Quill Driver Books/Word Dancer Press|location=Sanger, California|isbn=1884956270|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=4zuo4E6WLKwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA87&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|88}} Construction cost estimates were inconsistent: a ''Time'' magazine article (September 5, 1960) quotes Standhardt as estimating the costs at 10% above the cost of an average above-ground school,&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; while Loretta Hall in ''Underground Buildings: More than Meets the Eye. This school has carpet'' suggests a cost&lt;!--premium?--&gt; increase at 30 percent.&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt; Regardless, the U.S. Office of Civil Defense contributed the excess cost, assuming that it would benefit from any empirical testing performed on the students in the underground environment.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;{{RP|88-89}}

Standhardt designed the school in such a way as to make every element serve multiple purposes. To reduce cost of concrete, for example, the concrete shell roof of the school would double as a basketball court, and the drinking wells were designed to pump water into the air conditioning systems during peacetime. Two-way radio systems, [[Geiger counter]]s, and fire fighting equipment were also built into the design.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;

==Cultural impact and criticism==
Within Artesia, Abo Elementary School was lauded by teachers and many parents. Teachers often described Abo's students as less likely to cause trouble, more attentive, and less likely to require discipline. On the other hand, many of those same students described heightened awareness of the possibility of nuclear war, and some were terrified that they could be orphaned in the event of war. One of the most substantial fears raised by students involved the 2,160 person capacity of the school. In the event of a war, only the first 2,160 people would be allowed into the school for shelter, which would likely have left the majority of Artesia's nearly 12,000 residents, including the parents of some of Abo's students, without any shelter in the event of a nuclear attack.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;

Outside of Artesia, Abo Elementary School was condemned by many councils and groups, some of whom rejected the concept of an underground school entirely.&lt;ref name=Rose /&gt;{{RP|139}} Notwithstanding, the President of Artesia's Board of Education, C.P. Bunch, called the school "more a matter of insurance than fear", and expressed hope that future schools built in Artesia would follow its example.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; Federal studies concluded that the students suffered no long-term effects from their time in Abo, and many students who suffered from chronic allergies or asthma were transferred to Abo as its advanced air filtration systems reduced the impact of [[dust storms]] and allergens. Indeed, these studies concluded that many students' health improved as a result of extended time in the school.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;{{RP|89}}

==Closure==
Abo Elementary School was shut down in 1995 as a result of increased maintenance costs, aging mechanical equipment and difficulties associated with removing asbestos insulation from the underground, windowless structure. A new school, [[Yeso Elementary School]], was built next door and Abo was converted into a storage facility.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

In [[condensed matter physics]], an '''Arrott plot''' is a plot of the square of the [[magnetization]] &lt;math&gt;M^2&lt;/math&gt; of a substance, against the ratio of the applied magnetic field to magnetization &lt;math&gt;H/M&lt;/math&gt; at one (or several) fixed temperature(s). Arrott plots are an easy way of determining the presence of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic order]] in a material.&lt;ref name=yeung86&gt;

==Details==
According to the [[Ginzburg-Landau theory|Ginzburg-Landau]] mean field picture for magnetism, the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of a ferromagnetic material close to a phase transition can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;
F(M)=-H M+a\frac{T-T_c}{T_c} M^2+bM^4+\ldots
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the magnetization, is the order parameter, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the applied magnetic field, &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is the critical temperature, and &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; are material constants.

Close to the phase transition, this gives a relation for the magnetization order parameter:

&lt;math&gt;
M^2=\frac{1}{4b}\frac{H}{M}-\frac{a}{2b}\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\frac{T-T_c}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless measure of the temperature.

Thus in a graph plotting &lt;math&gt;M^2&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;H/M&lt;/math&gt; for various temperatures, the line without an intercept corresponds to the dependence at the critical temperature. Thus along with providing evidence for the existence of a ferromagnetic phase, the Arrott plot can also be used to determine the critical temperature for the phase transition.&lt;ref name=Hadimani2008&gt;

CdTe photovoltaics are used in some of the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] [[photovoltaic power station]]s, such as the [[Topaz Solar Farm]]. With a share of 5.1% of worldwide PV production, CdTe technology accounted for more than half of the thin film market in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Fraunhofer ISE [http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report], July 28, 2014, pages 18,19&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent manufacturer of CdTe thin film technology is the company [[First Solar]], based in [[Tempe, Arizona]].

== Background ==

[[Image:Cadmium telluride thin film solar cell.png|thumb|200px|right|Cross-section of a CdTe thin film solar cell.]]

The dominant PV technology has always been based on [[crystalline silicon]] wafers. [[Thin films]] and [[Concentrating solar power#Concentrating photovoltaics|concentrators]] were early attempts to lower costs. Thin films are based on using thinner [[Semiconductor material|semiconductor]] layers to absorb and convert sunlight. Concentrators lower the number of panels by using lenses or mirrors to put more sunlight on each panel.

The first thin film technology to be extensively developed was [[amorphous silicon]]. However, this technology suffers from low efficiencies and slow deposition rates (leading to high capital costs). Instead, the PV market reached some 4 gigawatts in 2007 with crystalline silicon comprising almost 90% of sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwatch.org/node/5449#notes Various estimates of world module production in 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725035832/http://worldwatch.org/node/5449 |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same source estimated that about 3 gigawatts were installed in 2007.

During this period cadmium telluride and [[Copper indium gallium selenide|copper indium diselenide]] or CIS-alloys remained under development. The latter is beginning to be produced in volumes of 1–30 megawatts per year due to very high, small-area cell efficiencies approaching 20% in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2008/574.html|title=NREL: News - Record Makes Thin-Film Solar Cell Competitive with Silicon Efficiency|website=nrel.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; CdTe cell [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]] is approaching 20% in the laboratory with a record of 22.1% as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://investor.firstsolar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/first-solar-achieves-yet-another-cell-conversion-efficiency&lt;/ref&gt;

Colman, July 28, 1964 {{US patent|3142586}}&lt;/ref&gt; because its band gap (~1.5 eV) is almost a perfect match to the distribution of photons in the solar spectrum in terms of conversion to electricity. A simple [[heterojunction]] design evolved in which p-type CdTe was matched with n-type [[cadmium sulfide]] (CdS). The cell was completed by adding top and bottom contacts. Early leaders in CdS/CdTe cell efficiencies were [[GE]] in the 1960s, and then [[Kodak]], Monosolar, [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.|Matsushita]], and AMETEK.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

By 1981, Kodak used close spaced sublimation (CSS) and made the first 10%{{clarify|date=July 2017}} cells and first multi-cell devices (12 cells, 8% efficiency, 30&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Y.

Rod, 1981, Thin film heterojunction photovoltaic cells and methods of making the same, Monosolar {{US patent|4388483}}. B. Basol patented numerous aspects of electrodeposition and CdTe contacting for Monosolar. Monosolar was subsequently bought by SOHIO, which was then absorbed by British Petroleum. Electrodeposition continued at BP Solar until about 2002 when it was canceled along with all thin film work at BP.&lt;/ref&gt; and AMETEK&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyers, originally of Ametek, provides a thread stretching from Ametek through Solar Cells Inc. to First Solar.

Matsushita started with [[screen printing]] but shifted in the 1990s to CSS. Cells of about 10% sunlight-to-electricity efficiency were produced by the early 1980s at Kodak, Matsushita, Monosolar and AMETEK.&lt;ref name="Zweibel"&gt;{{cite journal|author=K.

An important step forward occurred when cells were scaled-up in size to make larger area products called modules. These products required higher currents than small cells and it was found that an additional layer, called a [[transparent conducting oxide]] (TCO), could facilitate the movement of current across the top of the cell (instead of a metal grid). One such TCO, [[tin dioxide|tin oxide]], was available for other uses (thermally reflective windows). Made more conductive for PV, tin oxide became and remains the norm in CdTe PV modules.

[[Image:Juwi PV Field.jpg|thumb|left|The utility-scale [[Waldpolenz Solar Park]] in Germany uses CdTe PV modules]]

CdTe cells achieved above 15%{{clarify|date=July 2017}} in 1992 by adding a buffer layer to the TCO/CdS/CdTe stack and then thinned the CdS to admit more light. Chu used resistive tin oxide as the buffer layer and then thinned the CdS from several micrometres to under half a micrometre in thickness. Thick CdS, as it was used in prior devices, blocked about 5 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of light, or about 20% of the light usable by a CdTe device. The additional layer did not compromise the device's other properties.&lt;ref name="Zweibel"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, other players experienced mixed results.&lt;ref name="Zweibel"/&gt; Golden Photon held the record for a short period for the best CdTe module measured at NREL at 7.7% using a spray deposition technique. Matsushita claimed an 11%{{clarify|date=July 2017}} module efficiency using CSS and then dropped the technology. A similar efficiency and fate eventually occurred at BP Solar. BP used electrodeposition (inherited from Monosolar by a circuitous route when it purchased [[SOHIO]], Monosolar's acquirer).

=== SCI and First Solar ===

The major commercial success was by Solar Cells Incorporated (SCI). Its founder, [[Harold McMaster]], envisioned low-cost thin films made on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells Inc., which later became [[First Solar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toledoblade.com/Opinion/2008/04/29/After-long-wait-McMaster-to-join-hall-of-fame.html After long wait, McMaster to join hall of fame], April 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; McMaster championed CdTe for its high-rate, high-throughput processing. SCI shifted from an adaptation of the CSS method then shifted to vapor transport.&lt;ref&gt;SCI CSS patent: Foote et al. Process for making photovoltaic devices and resultant product, United States Patent 5248349; and their vapor transport patent, featuring the movement of vaporized cadmium and [[tellurium]] atoms through a closed, silicon carbide distributor: Apparatus and method for depositing a semiconductor material, United States Patent 6037241. Both are now owned by First Solar.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, who named it [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite book|author=D. H.

=== Cell efficiency ===

[[Image:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|200px|right|Solar cell [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiencies]]]]

In August 2014 First Solar announced a device with 21.1% [[Solar cell efficiency|conversion efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=864426|title=First Solar Builds the Highest Efficiency Thin Film PV Cell on Record|website=firstsolar.com|access-date=2014-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909083709/http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=864426|archive-date=2014-09-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, First Solar announced that they had reached a record 22.1% conversion efficiency in their CdTe cells. In 2014, the record module efficiency was also raised by First Solar from 16.1% up to 17.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=833971|title=First Solar Sets Thin-Film Module Efficiency World Record of 17.0 Percent|website=firstsolar.com|access-date=2014-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320173449/http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=833971|archive-date=2014-03-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the company projected average production line module efficiency for its CdTe PV to be 17% by 2017, but by 2016, they predicted a module efficiency closer to ~19.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinha|first=P.|title=Life cycle materials and water management for CdTe photovoltaics|journal=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells|year=2013|volume=119|pages=271–275|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024813004297|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.08.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/First-Solar-Hits-Record-22.1-Conversion-Efficiency-For-CdTe-Solar-Cell|title=First Solar Hits Record 22.1% Conversion Efficiency for CdTe Solar Cell|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since CdTe has the optimal band gap for single-junction devices, efficiencies close to 20% (such as already shown in CIS alloys) may be achievable in practical CdTe cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=M. Gloeckler, I. Sankin, Z. Zhao|title=CdTe Solar Cells at the Threshold to 20%|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|year=2013|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1389–1393|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6588601&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel7%2F5503869%2F6596156%2F06588601.pdf%3Farnumber%3D6588601|doi=10.1109/jphotov.2013.2278661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process optimization ===

Process optimization improved throughput and lowered costs. Improvements included broader [[substrate (materials science)|substrates]] (since capital costs scale sublinearly and installation costs can be reduced), thinner layers (to save material, electricity, and processing time), and better material utilization (to save material and cleaning costs). 2014 CdTe module costs were about $72 per {{convert|1|m2}},&lt;ref&gt;This number is calculated by multiplying efficiency (12.6%) by 1000 to get output watts per square meter (126 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and then multiplying power by the stated cost of $0.57 per watt to get $72/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or about $90 per module.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Ambient temperature ===

Module efficiencies are measured in laboratories at standard testing temperatures of 25&amp;nbsp;°C, however in the field modules are often exposed to much higher temperatures. CdTe’s relatively low temperature coefficient protects performance at higher temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Regenerative Energiesysteme|journal=Hanser Verlag|year=2012|url=http://www.volker-quaschning.de/publis/regen/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=P.

=== Solar tracking ===

Almost all thin film [[photovoltaic]] module systems to-date have been non-[[solar tracker|solar tracking]], because module output was too low to offset tracker capital and operating costs. But relatively inexpensive single-axis tracking systems can add 25% output per installed watt.&lt;ref name=solaradvmodel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/models_tools.html#solaradvisormodel|title=Parabolic Trough Technology Models and Software Tools|date=2008-07-25|accessdate=2008-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922195327/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/models_tools.html#solaradvisormodel|archive-date=2008-09-22|dead-url=yes|df=}} Like any solar price model, the Solar Advisory Model is quite sensitive to assumptions. Different sunlight, tax rates, interest rates, discount rates, loan durations, temperature coefficients, annual degradation rates, initial de-rating versus standard conditions, inverter efficiencies and O&amp;M, and others can each have as much as a 10% impact on costs per unit power.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, depending on the Tracker Energy Gain, the overall eco-efficiency of the PV system can be enhanced by lowering both system costs and environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=P. Sinha and S. Dailey|title=Tracking systems boost eco-efficiency|journal=Solar Industry|date=November 2013|url=http://www.solarindustrymag.com/issues/SI1311/FEAT_02_Tracking-Systems-Boost-Eco-Efficiency.html#|access-date=2013-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213233100/http://www.solarindustrymag.com/issues/SI1311/FEAT_02_Tracking-Systems-Boost-Eco-Efficiency.html|archive-date=2013-12-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is climate-dependent. Tracking also produces a smoother output plateau around midday, better matching afternoon peaks.

==Materials==
=== Cadmium ===

Cadmium (Cd), a [[toxic heavy metal]] considered a hazardous substance, is a waste byproduct of mining, smelting and refining sulfidic ores of zinc during [[zinc refining]], and therefore its production does not depend on PV market demand. CdTe PV modules provide a beneficial and safe use for cadmium that would otherwise be stored for future use or disposed of in landfills as hazardous waste. Mining byproducts can be converted into a stable CdTe compound and safely encapsulated inside CdTe PV solar modules for years. A large growth in the CdTe PV sector has the potential to reduce global cadmium emissions by displacing coal and oil power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=M. Raugei and V. Fthenakis|title=Cadmium flows and emissions from CdTe PV: future expectations|journal=Energy Policy|year=2010|pages=5223–5228|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510003563|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2010.05.007|volume=38|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tellurium ===

Tellurium (Te) production and reserves estimates are subject to uncertainty and vary considerably. Tellurium is a rare, mildly toxic metalloid that is primarily used as a machining additive to [[steel]]. Te is almost exclusively obtained as a by-product of copper refining, with smaller amounts from lead and gold production. Only a small amount, estimated to be about 800 metric tons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thin_film/docs/telluriumworldindustrialminerals2000.doc|title=Assessment of critical thin film resources|format=.doc file|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507182315/http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thin_film/docs/telluriumworldindustrialminerals2000.doc|archivedate=2009-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; per year, is available.

=== Cadmium chloride/magnesium chloride ===

The manufacture of a CdTe cell includes a thin coating with [[cadmium chloride]] ({{Chem|CdCl|2}}) to increase the cell's overall efficiency. Cadmium chloride is toxic, relatively expensive and highly soluble in water, posing a potential environmental threat during manufacture. In 2014 research discovered that abundant and harmless [[magnesium chloride]] ({{chem|MgCl|2}}) performs as well as cadmium chloride. This research may lead to cheaper and safer CdTe cells.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Field. [http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1322906 "Bean Curd Component Could Slash Solar Panel Costs"].

=== Safety ===

By themselves, cadmium and tellurium are toxic and carcinogenic, but CdTe forms a crystalline lattice that is highly stable, and is several orders of magnitude less toxic than cadmium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-safe-is-first-solars-cdte-thin-film|title=The Lowdown on the Safety of First Solar’s CdTe Thin Film|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass plates surrounding CdTe material sandwiched between them (as in all commercial modules) seal during a fire and do not allow any cadmium release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|authors=V.

=== Recycling ===

Due to the exponential [[growth of photovoltaics]] the number of worldwide installed [[PV system]]s has increased significantly. First Solar established the first global and comprehensive recycling program in the PV industry in 2005. Its recycling facilities operate at each of First Solar’s manufacturing plants and recover up to 95% of semiconductor material for reuse in new modules and 90% of glass for reuse in new glass products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/workshop/07_Andreas_WADE.pdf |website=FirstSolar |format=PDF |page=2 |title=Evolution of First Solar's Module Recycling Program |date=2013 |accessdate= July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.co.imperial.ca.us/icpds/eir/campo-verde-solar/final/life-cycle-cdte.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A life cycle assessment of CdTe module recycling by the University of Stuttgart showed a reduction in primary energy demand in End-Of-Life from 81 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to -12 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a reduction of around 93 MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and in terms of global warming potential from 6&amp;nbsp;kg CO2-equiv./m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to -2.5 CO2-equiv./m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a reduction of around -8.5 CO2-equiv./m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These reductions show a highly beneficial change in the overall environmental profile of CdTe photovoltaic module. The LCA also showed that the main contributors to considered environmental impact categories are due to required chemicals and energy within the processing of CdTe modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=M.|last=Held|date=2009-11-18|title=Life Cycle Assessment of CdTe PV Module Recycling|url=http://www.eupvsec-proceedings.com/proceedings?paper=5023|journal=24th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference, 21–25 September 2009, Hamburg, Germany|doi=10.4229/24thEUPVSEC2009-3CO.7.4|pages=2370-2375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grain boundaries===

Grain boundary is the interface between two grains of a crystalline material and occur when two grains meet. They are a type of crystalline defect. It is often assumed that the open-circuit voltage gap seen in CdTe, in comparison to both single crystal GaAs and the theoretical limit, may be in some way attributable to the grain boundaries within the material. There have however been a number of studies which have suggested not only that GBs are not deleterious to performance but may in fact be beneficial as sources of enhanced carrier collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Major, Jonathan D.|title=Grain boundaries in CdTe thin film solar cells: A review|journal=Semiconductor Science and Technology|year=2016|pages=093001|volume=31|issue=9|doi=10.1088/0268-1242/31/9/093001|bibcode=2016SeScT..31i3001M}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, the exact role of the grain boundaries in limitation of performance of CdTe-based solar cells remains unclear and the research is ongoing to address this question.

== Market viability ==
[[File:Topaz Solar Farm, California Valley.jpg|thumb|225px|The [[Topaz Solar Farm]] employs 9 million CdTe-modules. It was the [[List of photovoltaic power stations#World's largest photovoltaic power stations|world's largest PV power station]] in 2014.]]

* First Solar’s 290-[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Agua Caliente Solar Project|Agua Caliente project]] in Arizona is one of the largest [[photovoltaic power station]] ever built. Agua Caliente features First Solar’s plant control, forecasting and energy scheduling capabilities that contribute to grid reliability and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agua Caliente (limited access)|url=http://www.firstsolar.com/Projects/Agua-Caliente-Solar-Project|publisher=First Solar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.power-technology.com [http://www.power-technology.com/features/feature-largest-solar-power-plants-in-the-world/ The world's biggest solar power plants], 29 August 2013{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 550 MW [[Topaz Solar Farm]] in California, finished construction in November 2014 and was the [[List of photovoltaic power stations#World's largest photovoltaic power stations|world’s largest solar farm]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Projects"&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://www.firstsolar.com/en/about-us/projects/topaz-solar-farm|publisher=First Solar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First Solar's 13 MW project in [[Dubai]], operated by the [[Dubai Electricity and Water Authority]], is the first part of the [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], and was the region's largest PV power plant at the time of completion in 2013.&lt;ref name="Projects" /&gt;
* A 40 MW system installed by [[Juwi]] group in [[Waldpolenz Solar Park]], Germany, at the time of its announcement, was the world's largest and lowest cost planned PV system. The price was 130 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pennwd.com/htdocs/PDFs/Feb07Solar-PressRelease.pdf |title= Report at juwi.de |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113060231/http://www.pennwd.com/htdocs/PDFs/Feb07Solar-PressRelease.pdf |archivedate= 2012-01-13 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(401 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 128 MWp system installed by Belectric at Templin, Brandenburg, Germany is the current largest thin-film PV installation in Europe (as of January 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.belectric.com/fileadmin/MASTER/pdf/press_releases/pm_BEL_2013_0422_Inbetriebnahme_Templin_EN.pdf |title=Belectric press announcement }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(525 KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For the 21 MW [[Blythe Photovoltaic Power Plant]] in California, a [[power purchase agreement]] fixed the price for the generated electricity at $0.12 per [[kWh]] (after the application of all incentives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2008/JULY/FIRSTSOLAR_170708.htm|title=First Solar announces two solar projects with Southern California Edison|publisher=Semiconductor-Today.com|date=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defined in California as the "Market Referent Price," this set the price the PUC would pay for any daytime peaking power source, e.g., natural gas. Although PV systems are intermittent and not [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] the way natural gas is, natural gas generators have an ongoing fuel price risk that PV does not have.
* A contract for two megawatts of rooftop installations with [[Southern California Edison]]. The SCE program is designed to install 250 MW at a total cost of $875M (averaging $3.5/watt), after incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/15670|title=California Utility to Install 250MW of Roof-Top Solar|publisher=SustainableBusiness.com|date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">In mathematics, the '''caliber''' or '''calibre''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] ''κ'' such that for every set of ''κ'' nonempty open subsets of ''X'' there is some point of ''X'' contained in ''κ'' of these subsets. This concept was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Nikolai Aleksandrovich Shanin|last=Shanin|year=1948}}.

There is a similar concept for [[partially ordered set|posets]]. A '''pre-caliber''' of a poset ''P'' is a cardinal ''κ'' such that for any collection of elements of ''P'' indexed by ''κ'', there is a subcollection of cardinality ''κ'' that is centered. Here a subset of a poset is called centered if for any finite subset there is an element of the poset less than or equal to all of them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1981">A '''conductive elastomer''' is a form of [[elastomer]], often [[natural rubber]] or other rubber substitute, that is manufactured to [[electrical conductor|conduct electricity]]. This is commonly accomplished by distributing [[carbon]] or other conductive particles throughout the raw material prior to setting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pazhooh|first1=Hadi Najafi|last2=Bagheri|first2=Rouhollah|last3=Adloo|first3=Ali|title=Fabrication of semi-conductive natural rubber nanocomposites with low copper nanoparticle contents|journal=Polymer|date=January 2017|volume=108|pages=135–145|doi=10.1016/j.polymer.2016.11.059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conductive elastomers are often pressure-sensitive, with their conductivity varying with the amount of pressure put on it, and can be used to make [[pressure sensor]]s.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1331366 |title=A tactile sensor sheet using pressure conductive rubber with electrical-wires stitched method}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses of conductive elastomers include conductive flexible seals and gaskets, and conductive mats used to prevent electrostatic damage to electronic devices. These elastomers also have uses in the energy industry, where they could be used to make flexible solar cells or stretchable devices for converting mechanical energy to electrical energy. Making solar cells and various sensors able to stretch and bend would allow them to be incorporated into wearable electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noh|first=Jin-Seo|date=2016-04-05|title=Conductive Elastomers for Stretchable Electronics, Sensors and Energy Harvesters|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/8/4/123|journal=Polymers|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=123|doi=10.3390/polym8040123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1466">A '''designed landscape''' is an area of land which has been modified by people for primarily [[aesthetic]] effect. The term is used by historians to denote various types of site, such as [[garden]]s, [[park]]s, [[cemetery|cemeteries]], and [[estate (land)|estates]]. Such sites are often protected for their historic or artistic value. A designed landscape may comprise [[landform]], [[water body|water]], [[building|built structures]], [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s, all of which may be naturally occurring or introduced. 

Many designed landscapes take advantage of existing geographical features, emphasising them through the planting of woodlands, or the creation of artificial lakes. For example, the parklands created by [[landscape gardener]]s such as [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]], are designed landscapes. 

They may also be more subtle, resulting from the enclosure of land, and the planting of functional woodlands such as [[shelter belt]]s. Patterns of such features may be of use to historians in identifying the extent of country estates, and in dating agricultural improvements.

'''EnviroCAB''' is a [[taxicab]] service provider based in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], which provides service exclusively with a fleet of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s. When the company began operations in February 2008 it became the first all-hybrid taxicab fleet in the United States, and the first carbon-negative taxicab company in the world.&lt;ref name=CleanAirCab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/10/20/all-hybrid-taxi-fleet-debuts-sunny-phoenix|title=All-Hybrid Taxi Fleet Debuts in Sunny Phoenix|publisher=GreenBiz|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

==History==
In September 2007 the [[Arlington County]] Board authorized EnviroCAB, then a new taxi company, to operate with an all-hybrid fleet of 50 vehicles. In addition, the Board authorized existing companies permission to add 35 hybrid taxis. The introduction of [[Green transport|green]] taxis is part of a county campaign known as Fresh AIRE, or Arlington Initiative to Reduce Emissions. AIRE aims to cut production of greenhouse gases from county buildings and vehicles by 10% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/19/AR2007091902438.html|title=Arlinton County: Board Gives Go-Ahead to Eco-Friendly Taxicabs|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2009-10-17|first=Kirstin|last=Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
EnviroCAB taxi fleet consist of [[Toyota Prius]]es, [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]]s, [[Toyota Highlander Hybrid]]s, and [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]s.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

==Carbon footprint==
The company claims to be the first carbon-negative taxicab company in the world, as it will completely offset its own emissions by purchasing "clean-source" [[carbon credit|offset credits]]. Also, EnviroCAB expects to offset the emissions of 100 of the approximately 685 non-hybrid taxis operating in Arlington by March 2008.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envirotaxicab.com/pr05.html |title=EnviroCAB Launches in Greater Washington, D.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52526">'''Fatty acid metabolism''' consists of [[catabolic]] processes that generate energy, and [[anabolic]] processes that create biologically important molecules (triglycerides, phospholipids, second messengers, local hormones and [[ketone bodies]]).&lt;ref name=stryer1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Fatty acid metabolism. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 603–628 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fatty acids]] are a family of molecules classified within the [[lipid]] [[macronutrient]] class. One role of fatty acids in [[animal]] metabolism is energy production, captured in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). When compared to other macronutrient classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water by [[beta oxidation]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].&lt;ref name="oxidation_of_fats"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/oxidation-of-fatty-acids/ Oxidation of fatty acids]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatty acids (mainly in the form of [[triglyceride]]s) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals, and to a lesser extent in plants. In addition, fatty acids are important components of the [[phospholipid]]s that form the [[phospholipid bilayers]] out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the [[cell wall]], and the membranes that enclose all the [[organelles]] within the cells, such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], the [[mitochondria]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], and the [[Golgi apparatus]]). Fatty acids can also be cleaved, or partially cleaved, from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form [[second messenger]]s within the cell, and [[Paracrine signalling|local hormones]] in the immediate vicinity of the cell. The [[prostaglandin]]s made from [[arachidonic acid]] stored in the cell membrane, are probably the most well known group of these local hormones.

== Fatty acid catabolism ==
[[File:Metabolism1.jpg|thumb|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the process of lipolysis (in a fat cell) induced by high [[epinephrine]] and low [[insulin]] levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|beta-adrenergic receptor]] in the cell membrane of the adipocyte, which causes [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a [[protein kinase]], which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] in the fat cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the fat stored in the fat droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood. However more recent studies have shown that [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] has to first convert triacylglycerides to diacylglycerides, and that [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] converts the diacylglycerides to monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Monoglycerides are hydrolyzed by monoglyceride lipase.&lt;ref name="pmid15891395"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Zechner R, Strauss JG, Haemmerle G, Lass A, Zimmermann R |title=Lipolysis: pathway under construction |journal=Curr. Opin. Lipidol. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=333–40 |year=2005 |pmid=15891395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activity of hormone sensitive lipase is regulated by the circulation hormones [[insulin]], [[glucagon]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[epinephrine]], as shown in the diagram.]]

[[File:Metabolism2.jpg|thumb|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the transport of [[free fatty acids]] in the blood attached to [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], its diffusion across the cell membrane using a protein transporter, and its activation, using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to form [[acyl-CoA]] in the [[cytosol]]. The illustration is, for diagrammatic purposes, of a 12 carbon fatty acid. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long.]]

[[File:Metabolism3.jpg|thumb|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the transfer of an acyl-CoA molecule across the inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] by [[Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase|carnitine-acyl-CoA transferase]] (CAT). The illustrated acyl chain is, for diagrammatic purposes, only 12 carbon atoms long. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long. CAT is inhibited by high concentrations of [[malonyl-CoA]] (the first committed step in [[fatty acid synthesis]]) in the cytoplasm. This means that fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid catabolism cannot occur simultaneously in any given cell.]]

[[File:Metabolism4.jpg|thumb|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the process of the [[beta-oxidation]] of an acyl-CoA molecule in the mitochodrial matrix. During this process an acyl-CoA molecule which is 2 carbons shorter than it was at the beginning of the process is formed. Acetyl-CoA, water and 5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are the other products of each beta-oxidative event, until the entire acyl-CoA molecule has been reduced to a set of [[acetyl-CoA]] molecules.]]

Fatty acids are released, between meals, from the fat depots in [[adipose tissue]], where they are stored as [[triglycerides]], as follows:

* [[Lipolysis]], the removal of the fatty acid chains from the glycerol to which they are bound in their storage form as triglycerides (or fats), is carried out by [[lipases]]. These lipases are activated by high [[epinephrine]] and [[glucagon]] levels in the blood (or [[norepinephrine]] secreted by [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic nerves]] in adipose tissue), caused by declining blood [[glucose]] levels after meals, which simultaneously lowers the [[insulin]] level in the blood.&lt;ref name=stryer1 /&gt;
* Once freed from [[glycerol]], the free fatty acids enter the blood, which transports them, attached to plasma [[albumin]], throughout the body.&lt;ref name="mobilization_of_fats"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/mobilization-and-cellular-uptake-of-stored-fats-triacylglycerols-with-animation/ Mobilization and cellular uptake of stored fats (triacylglycerols) (with animation)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Long chain free fatty acids enter the metabolizing cells (i.e. most living cells in the body except [[Erythrocytes|red blood cells]] and [[neurons]] in the [[central nervous system]]) through specific [[transport proteins]], such as the [[Solute carrier family|SLC27]] family fatty acid transport protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stahl|first1=Andreas|title=A current review of fatty acid transport proteins (SLC27)|journal=Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology|date=1 February 2004|volume=447|issue=5|pages=722–727|doi=10.1007/s00424-003-1106-z|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00424-003-1106-z|accessdate=2 March 2015|pmid=12856180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Courtney M.|last2=Stahl|first2=Andreas|title=SLC27 fatty acid transport proteins|journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine|date=April 2013|volume=34|issue=2–3|pages=516–528|doi=10.1016/j.mam.2012.07.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299712000933|accessdate=2 March 2015|pmc=3602789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red blood cells do not contain [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and are therefore incapable of metabolizing fatty acids; the tissues of the central nervous system cannot use fatty acids, despite containing mitochondria, because long chain fatty acids (as opposed to medium chain fatty acids&lt;ref name="Ebert 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Ebert| first1=D.| last2=Haller| first2=RG.| last3=Walton| first3=ME.| title=Energy contribution of octanoate to intact rat brain metabolism measured by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy| journal=J Neurosci| volume=23| issue=13| pages=5928–35|date=Jul 2003|  pmid=12843297 | url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/13/5928.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marin Valencia 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Marin-Valencia| first1=I. | last2=Good| first2=LB.| last3=Ma| first3=Q.| last4=Malloy| first4=CR.| last5=Pascual| first5=JM.| title=Heptanoate as a neural fuel: energetic and neurotransmitter precursors in normal and glucose transporter I-deficient (G1D) brain| journal=J Cereb Blood Flow Metab| volume=33| issue=2| pages=175–82|date=Feb 2013 | doi=10.1038/jcbfm.2012.151| pmid=23072752| pmc=3564188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) cannot cross the [[blood brain barrier]]&lt;ref name=stryer10&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Fatty acid metabolism. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

# Acyl-CoA is transferred to the hydroxyl group of carnitine by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]], located on the cytosolic faces of the [[outer mitochondrial membrane|outer]] and [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]s.
# Acyl-carnitine is shuttled inside by a [[carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]], as a carnitine is shuttled outside.
# Acyl-carnitine is converted back to acyl-CoA by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]], located on the interior face of the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]]. The liberated carnitine is shuttled back to the cytosol, as an acyl-CoA is shuttled into the matrix.

* [[Beta oxidation]], in the mitochondrial matrix, then cuts the long carbon chains of the fatty acids (in the form of acyl-CoA molecules) into a series of two-carbon ([[Acetic acid|acetate]]) units, which, combined with [[Coenzyme A|co-enzyme A]], form molecules of [[acetyl CoA]], which condense with [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]] to form [[Citric acid|citrate]] at the "beginning" of the [[citric acid cycle]].&lt;ref name="oxidation_of_fats"/&gt;  It is convenient to think of this reaction as marking the "starting point" of the cycle, as this is when fuel - acetyl-CoA - is added to the cycle, which will be dissipated as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with the release of a substantial quantity of energy captured in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], during the course of each turn of the cycle.

: Briefly, the steps in beta oxidation (the initial breakdown of free fatty acids into acetyl-CoA) are as follows:&lt;ref name="oxidation_of_fats"/&gt;

# Dehydrogenation by [[acyl-CoA dehydrogenase]], yielding 1 [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
# Hydration by [[enoyl-CoA hydratase]]
# Dehydrogenation by [[3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]], yielding 1 [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
# Cleavage by [[thiolase]], yielding 1 [[acetyl-CoA]] and a fatty acid that has now been shortened by 2 carbons (forming a new, shortened [[acyl-CoA]])

:This beta oxidation reaction is repeated until the fatty acid has been completely reduced to [[acetyl-CoA]] or, in, the case of fatty acids with odd numbers of carbon atoms, [[acetyl-CoA]] and 1&amp;nbsp;molecule of [[propionyl-CoA]] per molecule of fatty acid. Each beta oxidative cut of the acyl-CoA molecule yields 5 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/oxidation-of-odd-carbon-chain-length-fatty-acids/ Oxidation of odd carbon chain length fatty acids]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/oxidation-of-unsaturated-fatty-acids/ Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The acetyl-CoA produced by beta oxidation enters the [[citric acid cycle]] in the mitochondrion by combining with [[Oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]] to form [[citric acid|citrate]]. This results in the complete combustion of the acetyl-CoA to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water. The energy released in this process is captured in the form of 1 [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and 11 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules per acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized.&lt;ref name="oxidation_of_fats"/&gt;&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; This is the fate of acetyl-CoA wherever beta oxidation of fatty acids occurs, except under certain circumstances in the [[liver]].

In the liver oxaloacetate can be wholly or partially diverted into the [[gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic pathway]] during fasting, starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged strenuous exercise, and in uncontrolled [[Diabetes mellitus#Type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Under these circumstances oxaloacetate is hydrogenated to [[Malic acid|malate]] which is then removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into [[glucose]] in the cytoplasm of the liver cells, from where it is released into the blood.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; In the liver, therefore, oxaloacetate is unavailable for condensation with acetyl-CoA when significant gluconeogenesis has been stimulated by low (or absent) [[insulin]] and high [[glucagon]] concentrations in the blood. Under these circumstances acetyl-CoA is diverted to the formation of [[Acetoacetic acid|acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|beta-hydroxybutyrate]].&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and their spontaneous breakdown product, [[acetone]], are frequently, but confusingly, known as [[ketone bodies]] (as they are not "bodies" at all, but water-soluble chemical substances). The ketones are released by the liver into the blood. All cells with mitochondria can take ketones up from the blood and reconvert them into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used as fuel in their citric acid cycles, as no other tissue can divert its oxaloacetate into the gluconeogenic pathway in the way that this can occur in the liver. Unlike free fatty acids, ketones can cross the [[blood-brain barrier]] and are therefore available as fuel for the cells of the [[central nervous system]], acting as a substitute for glucose, on which these cells normally survive.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; The occurrence of high levels of ketones in the blood during starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged heavy exercise and uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus is known as [[ketosis]], and, in its extreme form, in out-of-control type 1 diabetes mellitus, as [[ketoacidosis]].
:The glycerol released by lipase action is [[phosphorylate]]d by [[glycerol kinase]] in the liver (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting [[glycerol 3-phosphate]] is oxidized to [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]]. The glycolytic enzyme [[triose phosphate isomerase]] converts this compound to [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]], which is oxidized via [[glycolysis]], or converted to glucose via [[gluconeogenesis]].

[[Image:Fat triglyceride shorthand formula.svg|thumb|300px|Example of an unsaturated fat triglyceride. Left part: [[glycerol]], right part from top to bottom: [[palmitic acid]], [[oleic acid]], [[alpha-linolenic acid]]. Chemical formula: C&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;98&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Fatty acids, stored as triglycerides in an organism, are an important source of energy because they are both [[redox|reduced]] and [[anhydrous]]. The energy yield from a [[gram]] of fatty acids is approximately 9 [[calorie|kcal]] (37 kJ), compared to 4 kcal (17 kJ) for carbohydrates. Since the [[hydrocarbon]] portion of fatty acids is [[hydrophobic]], these [[molecule]]s can be stored in a relatively [[anhydrous]] (water-free) environment. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are more highly hydrated. For example, 1 g of [[glycogen]] can bind approximately 2 g of [[water]], which translates to 1.33 kcal/g  (4 kcal/3 g). This means that fatty acids can hold more than six times the amount of energy per unit of storage mass. Put another way, if the human body relied on carbohydrates to store energy, then a person would need to carry 31&amp;nbsp;kg (67.5 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) of hydrated glycogen to have the energy equivalent  to 4.6&amp;nbsp;kg (10&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[fat]].&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt;

[[Hibernation|Hibernating]] animals provide a good example for utilizing fat reserves as fuel. For example, bears hibernate for about 7 months, and, during this entire period, the energy is derived from degradation of fat stores. Migrating birds similarly build up large fat reserves before embarking on their intercontinental journeys.&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |page=777|isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the young adult human’s fat stores average between about 10–20&amp;nbsp;kg, but varies greatly depending on age, gender, and individual disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sloan |first1=A.W |last2=Koeslag |first2=J.H. |last3=Bredell |first3=G.A.G. |date=1973 |title= Body composition work capacity and work efficiency of active and inactive young men |journal= European Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=32 |pages=17–24 |doi=10.1007/bf00422426}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the human body stores only about 400&amp;nbsp;g of [[glycogen]], of which 300&amp;nbsp;g is locked inside the skeletal muscles and is unavailable to the body as a whole. The 100&amp;nbsp;g or so of glycogen stored in the liver is depleted within one day of starvation.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; Thereafter the glucose that is released into the blood by the liver for general use by the body tissues, has to be synthesized from [[Citric acid cycle#Major metabolic pathways converging on the TCA cycle|the glucogenic amino acids]] and a few other [[Gluconeogenesis|gluconeogenic substrates]], which do not include fatty acids.&lt;ref name=stryer1 /&gt; Please note however that lipolysis releases glycerol which can enter the pathway of gluconeogenesis.

===Animals and plants synthesize carbohydrates from both glycerol and fatty acids===
Fatty acids are broken down to [[acetyl-CoA]] by means of [[beta oxidation]] inside the mitochondria, whereas [[Fatty acid synthesis|fatty acids are synthesized]] from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] reaction.&lt;ref name=stryer1 /&gt; It can also not be converted to [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] as the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] reaction is irreversible.&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt; Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with [[oxaloacetic acid|oxaloacetate]], to enter the [[citric acid cycle]]. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by [[isocitrate dehydrogenase]] and [[alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]]. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form [[citric acid]]. The decarboxylation reactions occur before [[malic acid|malate]] is formed in the cycle.&lt;ref name=stryer1 /&gt; Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.&lt;ref name=stryer1 /&gt;

However acetyl-CoA can be converted to acetoacetate, which can decarboxylate to [[acetone]] (either spontaneously, or by [[acetoacetate decarboxylase]]). It can then be further metabolized to isopropanol which is excreted in breath/urine, or by [[CYP2E1]] into [[hydroxyacetone]] (acetol). Acetol can be converted to [[propylene glycol]]. This converts to [[formate]] and [[acetate]] (the latter converting to glucose), or [[pyruvate]] (by two alternative enzymes), or [[propionaldehyde]], or to [[lactaldehyde|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-lactaldehyde]] then [[lactic acid|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-lactate]] (the common lactate isomer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruddick JA | year = 1972 | title = Toxicology, metabolism, and biochemistry of 1,2-propanediol | journal = Toxicol Appl Pharmacol | volume = 21 | pages = 102–111 | doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(72)90032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glew2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?np10002|author=Glew, Robert H|title=You Can Get There From Here: Acetone, Anionic Ketones and Even-Carbon Fatty Acids can Provide Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ParkKlapa1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Sung M.|last2=Klapa|first2=Maria I.|last3=Sinskey|first3=Anthony J.|last4=Stephanopoulos|first4=Gregory|title=Metabolite and isotopomer balancing in the analysis of metabolic cycles: II.

The glycerol released into the blood during the [[lipolysis]] of triglycerides in adipose tissue can only be taken up by the liver. Here it is converted into [[glycerol 3-phosphate]] by the action of [[glycerol kinase]] which hydrolyzes one molecule of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] per glycerol molecule which is phosphorylated. Glycerol 3-phosphate is then oxidized to [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]], which is, in turn, converted into [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] by the enzyme [[triose phosphate isomerase]]. From here the three carbon atoms of the original glycerol can be  oxidized via [[glycolysis]], or converted to glucose via [[gluconeogenesis]].&lt;ref name=stryer2 /&gt;

==Other functions and uses of fatty acids==

===Intracellular signaling===
[[File:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol.svg|Chemical structure of the diglyceride 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol|thumb|upright=2.0|right]]
Fatty acids are an integral part of the phospholipids that make up the bulk of the [[plasma membrane]]s, or cell membranes, of cells. These phospholipids can be cleaved into [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG) and  [[inositol trisphosphate]] (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) through [[hydrolysis]]  of the phospholipid, [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), by the cell membrane bound enzyme [[phospholipase C]] (PLC).&lt;ref name=stryer4&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Signal transduction cascades. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 343–350 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a diacyl-glycerol shown on the right. This DAG is 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, which contains side-chains derived from [[palmitic acid]] and [[oleic acid]]. Diacylglycerols can also have many other combinations of fatty acids attached at either the C-1 and C-2 positions or the C-1 and C-3 positions of the glycerol molecule. 1,2 disubstituted glycerols are always chiral, 1,3 disubstituted glycerols are chiral if the substituents are different from each other.
[[File:PIP2 cleavage to IP3 and DAG.jpg|thumb|PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleavage to IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DAG. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; initiates intracellular calcium release, while DAG activates PKC (protein kinase C). Note: PLC (phospholipase C) is not an intermediate, as possibly suggested by the diagram, but is the enzyme that catalyzes the IP3/DAG separation.&lt;ref name=stryer4 /&gt;]]
[[Inositol trisphosphate]] (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) functions as an intracellular [[second messenger]], which initiates the [[Calcium metabolism#Biological functions|intracellular release of calcium ions]] (which activates intracellular enzymes, causes the release of hormones and neurotransmitters from the cells in which they are stored, and causes [[smooth muscle]] contraction when released by IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and the activation of [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), which is then translocated from the cell cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Although inositol trisphosphate, (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), diffuses into the [[cytosol]], [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG) remains within the [[plasma membrane]], due to its [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] properties. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological activator of [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), promoting its translocation from the cytosol to the [[plasma membrane]]. PKC is a multifunctional protein kinase which phosphorylates [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues in many target proteins. However PKC is only active in the presence of calcium ions, and it is DAG that increases the affinity of PKC for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and thereby renders it active at the physiological intracellular levels of this ion.&lt;ref name=stryer4 /&gt;

Diacylglycerol and IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; act transiently because both are rapidly metabolized. This is important as their message function should not linger after the message has been” received” by their target molecules. DAG can be phosphorylated to [[phosphatidate]] or it can be it can be hydrolysed to glycerol and its constituent fatty acids. IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is rapidly converted into derivatives that do not open calcium ion channels.&lt;ref name=stryer4 /&gt;

===Eicosanoid paracrine hormones===
[[File:Arachidonic_acid_structure.svg|thumb|right|[[Arachidonic acid]]]]
[[File:Prostaglandin E1.svg|thumb|right|[[Alprostadil|Prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - Alprostadil]]]]

The [[prostaglandin]]s are a group of [[physiology|physiologically]] active [[lipid]] compounds having diverse [[hormone]]-like effects in animals. Prostaglandins have been found in almost every [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in humans and other animals. They are [[enzymatically]] derived from [[arachidonic acid]] a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid. Every prostaglandin therefore contains 20 [[carbon]] atoms, including a [[carbon ring|5-carbon ring]]. They are a subclass of [[eicosanoid]]s  and form the [[prostanoid]] class of fatty acid derivatives.&lt;ref name=stryer3&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Eicosanoid hormones are derived from fatty acids.|edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 624–627 |isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prostaglandins are synthesized in the cell membrane by the cleavage of arachidonate from the phospholipids that make up the membrane. This is catalyzed either by [[Phospholipase A2|phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] acting directly on a membrane phospholipid, or by a lipase acting on DAG (diacyl-glycerol). The arachidonate is then acted upon by the [[cyclooxygenase]] component of [[prostaglandin synthase]]. This forms a [[cyclopentane]] ring in roughly the middle of the fatty acid chain. The reaction also adds 4 oxygen atoms derived from two molecules of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting molecule is prostaglandin G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is converted by the hydroperoxidase component of the enzyme complex into prostaglandin H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This highly unstable compound is rapidly transformed into other prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes.&lt;ref name=stryer3 /&gt; These are then released into the interstitial fluids surrounding the cells that have manufactured the eicosanoid hormone.

If arachidonate is acted upon by a [[lipoxygenase]] instead of cyclooxygenase, [[Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]s and [[leukotrienes]] are formed. They also act as local hormones.

Prostaglandins were originally believed to leave the cells via passive diffusion because of their high lipophilicity. The discovery of the [[prostaglandin transporter]] (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of prostaglandin, demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of prostaglandin through the cellular membrane. The release of prostaglandin has now also been shown to be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the [[multidrug resistance protein 4]] (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the [[ATP-binding cassette transporter]] superfamily. Whether MRP4 is the only transporter releasing prostaglandins from the cells is still unclear.

The structural differences between prostaglandins account for their different biological activities. A given prostaglandin may have different and even opposite effects in different tissues. The ability of the same prostaglandin to stimulate a reaction in one tissue and inhibit the same reaction in another tissue is determined by the type of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] to which the prostaglandin binds. They act as [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] factors with their target cells present in the immediate vicinity of the site of their [[secretion]]. Prostaglandins differ from [[endocrine system|endocrine]] [[hormone]]s in that they are not produced at a specific site but in many places throughout the human body.

Prostaglandins have two derivatives: [[prostacyclin]]s and [[thromboxane]]s. Prostacyclins are powerful locally acting [[vasodilator]]s and inhibit the aggregation of blood [[platelets]]. Through their role in vasodilation, prostacyclins are also involved in [[inflammation]]. They are synthesized in the walls of blood vessels and serve the physiological function of preventing needless clot formation, as well as regulating the contraction of [[smooth muscle]] tissue.&lt;ref name="isbn0-87893-617-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nelson, Randy F. |title=An introduction to behavioral endocrinology |edition=3rd |language= |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2005 |origyear= |pages=100 |quote= |isbn=0-87893-617-3 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, thromboxanes (produced by platelet cells) are [[vasoconstrictor]]s and facilitate platelet aggregation. Their name comes from their role in clot formation ([[thrombosis]]).

==Dietary sources of fatty acids, their digestion, absorption, transport in the blood and storage&lt;!--Linked from 'Monoglyceride'--&gt;==
[[File:Emulsion formation.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Dietary fats are emulsified in the duodenum by soaps in the form of bile salts and phospholipids, such as [[phosphatidylcholine]]. The fat droplets thus formed can be attacked by pancreatic lipase.]]

[[File:Cholic acid micelles.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Diagrammatic illustration of mixed micelles formed in the duodenum in the presence of bile acids (e.g. cholic acid) and the digestion products of fats, the fat soluble vitamins and cholesterol.]]

A significant proportion of the fatty acids in the body are obtained from the diet, in the form of triglycerides of either animal or plant origin. The fatty acids in the fats obtained from land animals tend to be saturated, whereas the fatty acids in the triglycerides of fish and plants are often polyunsaturated and therefore present as oils.

These [[triglyceride]]s, cannot be absorbed by the [[intestine]].&lt;ref name="mehta_digestion"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/digestion-of-fats-triacylglycerols/ Digestion of fats (triacylglycerols)]&lt;/ref&gt; They are broken down into [[Monoglyceride|mono-]] and [[Diglyceride|di-glycerides]] plus free fatty acids (but no free glycerol) by [[pancreatic lipase]], which forms a 1:1 complex with a protein called [[colipase]] (also a constituent of pancreatic juice), which is necessary for its activity. The activated complex can work only at a water-fat interface. Therefore, it is essential that fats are first  [[Emulsion|emulsified]] by [[bile salt]]s for optimal activity of these enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid14097367"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hofmann AF |title=The function of bile salts in fat absorption.

The contents of these micelles (but not the bile salts) enter the [[enterocytes]] (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) where they are resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into [[chylomicrons]] which are released into the [[lacteals]] (the capillaries of the [[lymph system]] of the intestines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Sareen S.

[[File:2512 Chylomicrons Contain Triglycerides Cholesterol Molecules and Other Lipids.jpg|thumb|right| 200 px| A schematic diagram of a chylomicron.]]

The chylomicrons circulate throughout the body, giving the [[blood plasma]] a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Lipoprotein lipase]] on the [[Endothelium|endothelial surfaces]] of the capillaries, especially in [[adipose tissue]], but to a lesser extent also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, glycerol and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}, but the glycerol and [[Chylomicron#Chylomicron remnant|chylomicron remnants]] remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the fuel requirements of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the [[adipocyte]].

The [[liver]] absorbs a proportion of the glucose from the blood in the [[portal vein]] coming from the intestines. After the liver has replenished its [[glycogen]] stores (which amount to only about 100 g of glycogen when full) much of the rest of the glucose is converted into fatty acids as described below. These fatty acids are combined with glycerol to form triglycerides which are packaged into droplets very similar to chylomicrons, but known as [[very low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL). These VLDL droplets are handled in exactly the same manner as chylomicrons, except that the VLDL remnant is known as an [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), which is capable of scavenging cholesterol from the blood. This converts IDL into [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), which is taken up by cells that require cholesterol for incorporation into their cell membranes or for synthetic purposes (e.g. the formation of the [[steroid hormones]]). The remainder of the LDLs is removed by the liver.&lt;ref name=stryer6&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter=Biosynthesis of membrane lipids and steroids. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

[[Adipose tissue]] and lactating [[mammary gland]]s also take up glucose from the blood for conversion into triglycerides. This occurs in the same way as it does in the liver, except that these tissues do not release the triglycerides thus produced as VLDL into the blood. Adipose tissue cells store the triglycerides in their fat droplets, ultimately to release them again as free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood (as described [[Fatty acid metabolism#Fatty acid catabolism|above]]), when the plasma concentration of insulin is low, and that of glucagon and/or epinephrine is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stralfors|first1=Peter|last2=Honnor|first2=Rupert C.|title=Insulin-induced dephosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry|year=1989|volume=182|issue=2|pages=379–385|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14842.x|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14842.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammary glands discharge the fat (as cream fat droplets) into the milk that they produce under the influence of the [[anterior pituitary]] hormone [[prolactin]].

All cells in the body need to manufacture and maintain their membranes and the membranes of their organelles. Whether they rely for this entirely on free fatty acids absorbed from the blood, or are able to synthesize their own fatty acids from the blood glucose, is not known. The cells of the central nervous system will almost certainly have the capability of manufacturing their own fatty acids, as these molecules cannot reach them through the [[blood brain barrier]], while, on the other hand, no cell in the body can manufacture the required [[essential fatty acid]]s which have to be obtained from the diet and delivered to each cell via the blood.

==Fatty acid synthesis==
{{Main|Fatty acid synthesis}}

[[File:Saturated Fatty Acid Synthesis.png|thumb|left|px150| Synthesis of saturated fatty acids via Fatty Acid Synthase II in E. coli]]
Much like [[beta-oxidation]], straight-chain fatty acid synthesis occurs via the six recurring reactions shown below, until the 16-carbon [[palmitic acid]] is produced.&lt;ref name=transFA&gt;Dijkstra, Albert J., R. J. Hamilton, and Wolf Hamm. "Fatty Acid Biosynthesis." Trans Fatty Acids. Oxford: Blackwell Pub., 2008. 12.

The diagrams presented show how fatty acids are synthesized in microorganisms and list the enzymes found in [[Escherichia coli]].&lt;ref name=transFA /&gt; These reactions are performed by [[fatty acid synthase]] II (FASII), which in general contain multiple enzymes that act as one complex. FASII is present in [[prokaryotes]], plants, fungi, and parasites, as well as in [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name=lipidlib&gt;"Fatty Acids: Straight-chain Saturated, Structure, Occurrence and Biosynthesis."

In animals, as well as some fungi such as yeast, these same reactions occur on fatty acid synthase I (FASI), a large dimeric protein that has all of the enzymatic activities required to create a fatty acid. FASI is less efficient than FASII; however, it allows for the formation of more molecules, including "medium-chain" fatty acids via early chain termination.&lt;ref name=lipidlib /&gt;  Enzymes, acyltransferases and transacylases, incorporate fatty acids in phospholipids, triacylglycerols, etc. by transferring fatty acids between an acyl acceptor and donor.

Once a 16:0 carbon fatty acid has been formed, it can undergo a number of modifications, resulting in desaturation and/or elongation. Elongation, starting with stearate (18:0), is performed mainly in the ER by several membrane-bound enzymes. The enzymatic steps involved in the elongation process are principally the same as those carried out by FAS, but the four principal successive steps of the elongation are performed by individual proteins, which may be physically associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetaCyc pathway: stearate biosynthesis I (animals)|url=http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-5972&amp;detail-level=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MetaCyc pathway: very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis II|url=http://www.biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-7036&amp;detail-level=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that during fatty synthesis the reducing agent is [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], whereas  [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]] is the oxidizing agent in [[beta-oxidation]] (the breakdown of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA). This difference exemplifies a general principle that NADPH is consumed during biosynthetic reactions, whereas NADH is generated in energy-yielding reactions.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 559–565, 614–623|isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thus NADPH is also required for the synthesis of [[cholesterol]] from acetyl-CoA; while NADH is generated during [[glycolysis]].) The source of the NADPH is two-fold. When [[Malic acid|malate]] is oxidatively decarboxylated by “NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-linked malic enzyme" [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NADPH are formed. NADPH is also formed by the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] which converts glucose into ribose, which can be used in synthesis of [[nucleotides]] and [[nucleic acids]], or it can be catabolized to pyruvate.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;

===Glycolytic end products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids===
{{Main|Citric acid cycle#Glycolytic end products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids}}

In humans, fatty acids are formed from carbohydrates predominantly in the [[liver]] and [[adipose tissue]], as well as in the  [[mammary glands]] during lactation. The cells of the [[central nervous system]] probably also make most of the fatty acids needed for the phospholipids of their extensive membranes from glucose, as blood-born fatty acids cannot cross the [[blood brain barrier]] to reach these cells.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; However, how the [[essential fatty acid]]s, which mammals cannot synthesize themselves, but are nevertheless important components of cell membranes (and [[Fatty acid metabolism#Eicosanoid paracrine hormones|other functions]] described above) reach them is unknown.

The [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] produced by [[glycolysis]] is an important intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA  needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, [[Citric acid|citrate]] (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate) is removed from the [[citric acid cycle]] and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt; There it is cleaved by [[ATP citrate lyase]] into acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The oxaloacetate is returned to mitochondrion as malate (and then converted back into oxaloacetate to transfer more acetyl-CoA out of the mitochondrion).&lt;ref name= ferre&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000100426 | title = SREBP-1c Transcription Factor and Lipid Homeostasis: Clinical Perspective | journal = Hormone Research | year = 2007 | first = P. | last = Ferre |author2=F.

===Regulation of fatty acid synthesis===

Acetyl-CoA is formed into [[malonyl-CoA]] by [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]], at which point malonyl-CoA is destined to feed into the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the point of regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both [[phosphorylation]] and [[allosteric regulation]]. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of saturated fatty acid synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the [[Krebs cycle]] and produce energy.&lt;ref&gt;Diwan, Joyce J. "Fatty Acid Synthesis." Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) :: Architecture, Business, Engineering, IT, Humanities, Science. Web. 30 Apr. 2011. &lt;{{cite web |url=http://rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/fasynthesis.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607051537/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb2/part1/fasynthesis.htm |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

High plasma levels of [[insulin]] in the blood plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation and activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus promoting the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while [[epinephrine]] and [[glucagon]] (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting [[lipogenesis]] in favor of fatty acid oxidation via [[beta-oxidation]].&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Voet /&gt;

==Disorders==
Disorders of fatty acid metabolism can be described in terms of, for example, [[hypertriglyceridemia]] (too high level of [[triglyceride]]s), or other types of [[hyperlipidemia]]. These may be familial or acquired.

Familial types of disorders of fatty acid metabolism are generally classified as [[inborn errors of lipid metabolism]]. These disorders may be described as [[fatty oxidation disorder]]s or as a ''[[lipid storage disorder]]s'', and are any one of several [[inborn errors of metabolism]] that result from enzyme defects affecting the ability of the body to [[oxidize]] [[fatty acid]]s in order to produce energy within muscles, liver, and other [[cell (biology)|cell]] types.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10089">A '''Flood warning''' is closely linked to the task of [[flood forecasting]]. The distinction between the two is that the outcome of flood forecasting is a set of forecast time-profiles of channel flows or river levels at various locations, while "flood warning" is the task of making use of these forecasts to make decisions about whether warnings of floods should be issued to the general public or whether previous warnings should be rescinded or retracted.

==Description==
The task of providing warning for floods is divided into two parts:
* decisions to escalate or change the state of alertness internal to the flood warning service provider, where this may sometimes include partner organisations involved in emergency response;
* decisions to issue flood warnings to the general public.

The decisions made by someone responsible for initiating flood warnings must be influenced by a number of factors, which include:
* The reliability of the available forecasts and how this changes with lead-time.
* The amount of time that the public would need to respond effectively to a warning.
* The delay between a warning being initiated and it being received by the public.
* The need to avoid issuing warnings unnecessarily, because of the wasted efforts of those who respond and because a record of false alarms means that fewer would respond to future warnings.
* The need to avoid situations where a warning condition is rescinded only for the warning to be re-issued within a short time, again because of the wasted efforts of the general public and because such occurrences would bring the flood warning service into disrepute.

A [[computer system]] for flood warning will usually contain sub-systems for:
* [[flood forecasting]];
* automatic alerting of internal staff;
* tracking of alert messages and acknowledgements received;
* diversion of messages to alternates where no acknowledgement received.

== National Flood Warning Services ==
The type of flood warning service available varies greatly from country to country, and a location may receive warnings from more than one service.

=== United Kingdom ===
Arrangements for flood warnings vary across the United Kingdom with several agencies leading on warnings for emergency responders and the public. The [[Environment Agency]], [[Natural Resources Wales]] and [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] all undertake location specific flood warning activities for communities at risk depending upon the scale of flood risk, technical challenges and investment needed to deliver a reliable service.

Prior to issuing a flood warning consideration is given to:
* the needs of communities to activate emergency response plans
* the nature of the catchment or coastline and the lead time that may be provided
* meteorological observations and forecast information on rainfall and coastal water levels
* hydrological observations and flood forecasts
* reference to thresholds of historic or forecast flood levels

Dissemination of flood warnings has moved towards a service whereby those at risk can pre-register to receive warnings by phone, email or text message from an automatic system, Floodline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/38289.aspx|title=EA: Floodline Warnings Direct - our free flood warning service|website=environment-agency.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both warnings and updates about current conditions are also carried by local [[radio station]]s. In addition, live updates are carried by the Environment Agency's website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/31618.aspx|title=Flood warnings for England - GOV.UK|website=www.environment-agency.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing which locations have flood warnings in place and the severity of these warnings.

There is currently no flood warning system in Northern Ireland, but the [[Met Office]] does issue weather warnings. Flood risk management is the responsibility of [[Rivers Agency]] in Northern Ireland. Consideration will be given to the introduction of a warning system as part of the implementation of the EU [[Floods directive]].

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the [[National Weather Service]] issues flood watches and warnings for large-scale, gradual river flooding. Watches are issued when flooding is possible or expected within 12–48 hours, and warnings are issued when flooding over a large area or river flooding is imminent or occurring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonnc.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=728 Burlingtonnc.gov] National Weather Service: Watch, Warning, and Advisory Criteria&lt;/ref&gt; Both can be issued on a county-by-county basis or for specific rivers or points along a river. When rapid flooding from heavy rain or a dam failure is expected, [[flash flood watch]]es and [[flash flood warning|warnings]] are issued. 

In the U.S. and [[Canada]], dissemination of flood warnings is covered by [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) code FLW, which is used by the U.S. [[Emergency Alert System]] and [[NOAA Weather Radio]] network and in Canada's [[Weatheradio Canada]] network.

"Flood statements" are issued by the [[National Weather Service]] to inform the public of flooding along major streams in which there is not a serious threat to life or property. They may also follow a flood warning to give later information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=f|title=Glossary - NOAA's National Weather Service|first=NOAA's National Weather|last=Service|website=www.weather.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg Matthias Bose''' (22 September 1710 – 17 September 1761), also known as '''Mathias Bose''', was a famous electrical experimenter in the early days of the development of [[electrostatic generator|electrostatics]].  He is credited with being the first to develop a way of temporarily storing static charges by using an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulated]] [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (called a prime conductor). His demonstrations and experiments raised the interests of the German scientific community and the public in the development of electrical research.

==Early life==
He was born the son of a merchant and educated at the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], receiving his Master's degree in 1727. In 1738, he became the professor of [[natural philosophy]] at the [[University of Wittenberg]].  As part of his course in physics, he revived experimentation with a glass-globe machine following the design of [[Francis Hauksbee|Francis Hauksbee the Elder]], and he later vastly improved on the machine by adding a "'''prime conductor'''" which allowed the machine to accumulate the generated static charge at a higher level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwgNAtqSHuQC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=Georg+Matthias+Bose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MEhix_h1bi&amp;sig=x6wnxaj9WJDLxZF3W_TnZ243Byg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfjI3HicXRAhXK5IMKHfR7CccQ6AEITjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Georg%20Matthias%20Bose&amp;f=false |title=The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements: From 500 BC to the 1940s |last=Keithley |first=Joseph F. |website=books.googlebook.ca |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was said to be a flamboyant demonstrator and an assiduous self-promoter, and he corresponded extensively with the Royal Society in London and with similar groups in Prussia, France, Italy and even Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hipstwiki.wikifoundry.com/page/Travelling+Showmen+-+Electricity,+Entertainment,+and+the+Construction+of+Scientificality Illustrations of Bose demonstrations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime conductor==
Bose's initial prime conductor consisted of an assistant standing on a block of [[resin]] (an effective insulator) holding a metal bar in one hand while touching the spinning globe with the other. The friction-generated charge would have flowed through the assistant to the metal bar and accumulated on the external surface of the bar. In effect, this was an extension of [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]]'s 1730 Flying Boy demonstration, but with the addition of a metal conductor which, over time, became the only effective storage device.

What was novel was Bose's use of metal (the bar) at a time when it had long been accepted that only [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] (then called "electrics") could successfully accumulate [[static electricity]]. Metal [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] were known to dissipate any charge relatively quickly and the need to insulate charged objects from electrical contact with the earth was not well appreciated. Later experiments by other experimenters showed that it was not the mass of the prime conductor which set the limit of static accumulation so much as its exterior dimensions—since like-charges repel and so the cumulative effect only exists on the external skin of the conductor.

For three years, from 1742 to 1745, Bose promoted the study of electricity in Germany, and became famous for spectacular experiments including one where he set alight alcoholic spirits floating on the surface of water via a spark generated by his friction machine which passed through the water. Since water and fire were seen as direct opposites, this created a minor sensation among the observers and became widely mentioned in scientific correspondence.

===Electric Kiss===
[[File: Georg Matthias Bose.JPEG|thumb|upright|right|The Electric Kiss demo]]
Bose's "Electric Kiss" (also called "Electric Venus") demonstration was immensely popular with spectators, and it was little more than a variation on [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]]'s "Flying Boy" demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/RevoltingIdeas/week7j.html Priestley's explanation of the Flying Boy experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; An attractive young lady was invited to stand on a block of insulating resin, and she was given a moderate static charge from a spinning globe. A young man from the audience was then invited to give her a kiss, and, in the process, the pair received a reasonable shock.

This demonstration combined both the scientific illustration of [[Electric charge|charge]] accumulation with the naughtiness of a stolen kiss, so it became a mainstay of all electrical showmen and scientific demonstrators.

===Beatification===
One of the public demonstrations developed by Bose became known as "Beatification", and Bose purposefully concealed the means by which he generated the effect. Eventually he was accused of fabrication, and so he revealed the technique to a colleague who published it in the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''.

In essences this was an extension of his Prime Conductor developments. A person dressed in a metal helmet or suit of armour would sit on a highly insulated chair and receive a high level of static charge—enough to produce sparkling points and possibly plasma glows around conductive surfaces. Bose eventually admitted to exaggeration, and explained the effect:

{{quote|Now, sir, it is true that I have embellished a little my beatification by my style and expressions; but it is also true, that the basis of the phenomenon is constant.  I found in our armoury at [[Leipzig|Leipzic]],{{sic}} a whole suit of armour, which was decked with many bullions of steel: some pointed like a nail: others in form like a wedge; others pyramidal.
In the dark, you well know, that not all, but very many, of the said bullions will sparkle and glister with tails like comets: and it is clear, that when the electricity is very vigorous, the helmet on the head of the person electrized will dart forth rays like those round the head of a canonized saint; and that is my beatification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lateralscience.blogspot.com.au/2015/11/the-high-voltage-beatification-of.html Philosophical Transactions explanation].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Leyden jar===
The news of Bose's alcohol experiment quickly spread to Pomerania, a small independent state on the Baltic coast, where the dean of the Camin cathedral was also experimenting with a friction generator. [[Ewald Georg von Kleist|J.G. von Kleist]] (aka Jurgen Georg) had suspended a large stove-pipe above his machine on silk threads which, by coincidence rather than design, turned out to be the best possible shape and mass for a prime conductor in its ability to accumulate charge.

Von Kleist wondered whether Bose's experiment at transmitting electricity through water to the flammable spirits would extend to capturing electricity in a small medicine bottle filled with alcohol, since he knew that the glass of the bottle would act as an insulator and prevent the electricity from escaping. He therefore fitted his bottle with a cork through which protruded a nail in contact with the fluid to provide a point of entry.

Holding the bottle in one hand, he applied the nail to the prime conductor.  Nothing happened immediately, but while carrying the bottle back into a dark room he noticed a slight plasma glow which suggested to him that the alcohol was charge with St Elmo's fire.  When he touched the nail with his spare hand he experienced a most violent shock.  He said in correspondence that it threw him across the room.

Von Kleist had invented the [[Leyden Jar]], but he did not understand the significance of his cupped hand held around the outside of the bottle which provided the one exterior conductive element needed to allow the Leyden Jar to accumulate a massive amount of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/RevoltingIdeas/week7k.html Joseph Priestley's ''The History and Present State of Electricity with Original Experiments'' (1769)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having experienced such a shock, he was naturally loath to hold the bottle in his hand again and he seems not to have been able to duplicate the experiment. When he advised his scientific correspondents, they were also naturally very wary of holding the jar, and for some time they failed to duplicate the experiment.  He is known to have corresponded his finding to a: Dr Lieberkuhn in Berlin, Mr Winckler at Lepzick (Leipzig), Mr Świetlicki of Dantzick (Danzig) and Mr Krugar of Hall as well as the professors of the academy of Lignitz.(sic)

Von Kleist had been educated at the [[University of Leyden]], and it is now widely assumed that he would also have corresponded with fellow ex-students Andreas Cunaeus (a lawyer),  and [[Jean-Nicolas-Sébastien Allamand|Prof. Jean Allamand]] (theologian professor) at the University. Allmand attempted to duplicate the experiment with a glass of beer and eventually succeeded.

Cunaeus and Allmand worked occasionally with the professor of physics at [[Leyden University]], [[Pieter van Musschenbroek|Pieter Musschenbroek]] on  new electrical experiments, and it took time for them to discover the secret. They finally worked out the importance of the outside conduction surface provided by the hand which was needed to prevent the development of electrostatic backpressure, and, as a result, it was the Leyden University experimenters who received the bulk of the credit.

===Thirty Years War===
In 1744, Bose published his major works on electricity in the form of pamphlets released in London and Paris. However, many of his manuscripts were later lost during the [[Thirty Years War]]. He is now mainly celebrated for his spectacular demonstrations rather than for his scientific contributions. In 1757 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27bose%27%29|title=Fellow Details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1760, during the [[Seven Years' War]] with Prussia, Bose was kidnapped from Wittenberg as a strategic asset, and taken to Magdeburg where he was held as a hostage. This, ironically, was the site of [[Otto von Guericke]]'s famous sulphur ball experiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/19254/1/7.2b.10N.Tucker-history.pdf The History of the Science and Technology of Electrospinning from 1600 to 1995 (Tucker et al)]&lt;/ref&gt; He died at Magdeburg two years later.

The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s '''Great Green Fleet''' was an energy cost saving measure (ECM) announced in 2009 to begin using a combination of conventional diesel fuel and biofuels in a 50/50 mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|title=Eco-Warriors: The Next Wave|journal=New Scientist|year=2012|volume=216|issue=2889|pages=6–8|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=225317a2-6b29-4f1a-8ee3-3720397f1124%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a2h&amp;AN=83051154&amp;anchor=toc|accessdate=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(12)62796-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration by the USS Nimitz carrier task group during RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific exercise) in 2012 was completed without incident.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddwoody/2012/07/19/the-navys-great-green-fleet-strikes-back/#3edff86f4b0a&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Green Fleet is the popular nickname is an homage to the [[Great White Fleet]] of the early 20th century.

== Overview ==

Since the 1970s the world has begun to be acutely aware of the impact of climate change and the influence fossil fuels has had on the progress of the natural migrations of climate.  
It is with that in mind that the US military is seeking to change the profile of its energy usage.  
While each branch of the military has its own goals and plans, the Navy's goals are particularly lofty:
* Use 50% less petroleum by 2015
* At least 50% of all energy used by the Navy and Marines come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Phil|title=US Navy Chief: I'm On a Mission to Stop Using Oil|journal=New Scientist|date=May 2011|issue=2811|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028110.200-us-navy-chief-im-on-a-mission-to-stop-using-oil.html#.Uk6vmT9y3gY|accessdate=3 October 2013|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(11)61043-9|volume=210|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy's efforts are highlighted by the design of the Great Green Fleet. The carrier, the USS Nimitz, was nuclear powered, but everything else, including the Nimitz's strike aircraft, ran on a 50:50 mix of petroleum and biofuel derived from cooking oil and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|title=Eco-Warriors: The Next Wave|journal=New Scientist|year=2012|volume=216|issue=2889|pages=6–8|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=225317a2-6b29-4f1a-8ee3-3720397f1124%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=109&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a2h&amp;AN=83051154&amp;anchor=toc|accessdate=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(12)62796-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set to fully deploy in 2016, the fleet will combine advances in fuels, equipment, and navigation all in an effort to deploy the most energy efficient and modern fleet anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Navy|first=US|title=Great Green Fleet Factsheet|url=http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil/files/2012/12/20121203_Great-Green-Fleet-Factsheet.pdf|publisher=Office of the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, DC|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than six years after it was first announced, the Great Green Fleet made its maiden voyage on late January 20, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2015/12/14/great-green-fleet-readies-to-sail-in-january/&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, the 2016 Great Green Fleet initiative was a year-long event. The Department of the Navy obtained 77.66 million gallons of cost-competitive, drop-in biofuels blends in support of the launch of the Great Green Fleet at $2.05 per gal. One of the goals of the Navy in its biofuels program is “not to have to sail to the Middle East every time we re-fuel."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2016/01/07/navy-to-launch-great-green-fleet-with-77-million-gallon-buy-of-cost-competitive-non-food-advanced-biofuels/&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy aims to deploy a permanent green strike force after 2016.

"The Great Green Fleet will signal to the world America's continued naval supremacy, unleashed from the tether of foreign oil." - Ray Mabus, Secretary of the Navy

== Strike group composition ==

The 2012 fleet was composed of the aircraft carrier [[USS Nimitz (CVN 68)|USS ''Nimitz'' (CVN 68)]], the cruiser [[USS Princeton (CG 59)|USS ''Princeton'' (CG 59)]], the two destroyers [[USS Chafee (DDG 90)|USS ''Chafee'' (DDG 90)]] and [[USS Chung Hoon (DDG 93)|USS ''Chung Hoon'' (DDG 93)]], and the fuel tanker [[USNS Henry J. Kaiser (T-AO-187)|USNS ''Henry J. Kaiser'' (T-AO-187)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Navy|first=U.S.|title=Great Green Fleet|url=http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil/energy/great-green-fleet/|publisher=Office of the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, DC|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 fleet was composed of the aircraft carrier [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74)|USS ''John C. Stennis'' (CVN 74)]], guided-missile cruiser [[USS Mobile Bay (CG 53)|USS ''Mobile Bay'' (CG 53)]], and guided-missile destroyers [[USS Chung Hoon (DDG 93)|USS ''Chung Hoon'' (DDG 93)]], [[USS Stockdale (DDG 106)|USS ''Stockdale'' (DDG 106)]] and [[USS William P. Lawrence (DDG 110)|USS ''William P. Lawrence'' (DDG 110)]] are all operating in the Indo-Asia-Pacific using alternative fuel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=95398&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns ==

There are reservations from some politicians, as well as military officials that the transition to alternative fuel sources would be too costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumberg|first=Gary A.|title=The origin of the Department of the Navy's biofuel initiative and the volatility problem for defense energy|journal=Calhoun Institutional Archive of the Naval Post-Graduate School|date=June 2013|pages=1–67|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10945/34632|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beyond the strict fuel costs, there are also concerns about the time and resources which would be required to create the necessary support structure to produce the volume of fuel sufficient for the military's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biello |first=David |title=The False Promise of Biofuels |journal=Scientific American |date=July 2011 |issue=305 |pages=58–65 |url=http://courses.csusm.edu/es100pa/internal_pages/chem311/chapter%20outlines%202011/biofuels%20false%20promise.pdf |accessdate=3 October 2013 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0811-58 |volume=305 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220644/http://courses.csusm.edu/es100pa/internal_pages/chem311/chapter%20outlines%202011/biofuels%20false%20promise.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the oil embargo of 1973 there were extensive and costly efforts to develop alternative fuels. A market for these fuels failed to develop, and economical fuels and research and development was not pursued. Many economists and scientists fear that this atmosphere will not develop for the current fuels.

== Benefits ==

The Navy's goals will further their own objectives, but will also have far-reaching effects in the US and beyond.  Reducing U.S reliance on foreign petroleum has numerous strategic advantages, and could work to avert future conflicts centered around the acquisition of petroleum stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Tom|title=A Dialogue with Thomas Hicks, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy|journal=Industrial Biotechnology |date=August 2012|volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=168–171 |doi=10.1089/ind.2012.1534 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ind.2012.1534 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The call for alternative fuels has already begun to drive innovation, with companies striving to create efficient processes to bring biofuel availability to the necessary scale the military requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=Philip E.|title=Algae Under Pressure and in Hot Water|journal=Science|date=November 2012|volume=338|issue=6110|pages=1039–1040|doi=10.1126/science.1224310|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1039.full|accessdate=3 October 2013|pmid=23180853}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy companies Solazyme (CA) and Dynamic Fuels (LA) are working towards numerous fuels and competing for the contracts offered by the U.S Department of Defense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Carin|title=US Navy's 'Great Green Fleet' Remains Armed With Algae|url=http://www.energydigital.com/press_releases/alternative-energy/us-navys-great-green-fleet-remains-armed-with-algae-in-energy-digital|publisher=Energy Digital|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued studies by military and civilian researchers will build momentum in both the scientific community, as well as the energy marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Joseph|title=GREENING THE MIXTURE: AN EVALUATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE'S ALTERNATIVE AVIATION FUEL STRATEGY|journal=Army Command and General Staff College Archives|date=June 2012|pages=1–70|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA563008|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown a decrease in particulate emissions from the use of algal biofuels versus naval diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=M.

[[File:Dolwin Beta (14823021740).jpg|thumb|right|The DolWin Beta platform arriving in [[Haugesund]] in August 2014.]]
'''HVDC DolWin2''' is a [[high voltage direct current]] (HVDC) link to transmit [[offshore wind power]] to the [[power grid]] of the [[Germany|German mainland]]. The project differs from most HVDC systems in that one of the two [[HVDC converter station|converter stations]] is built on a platform in the sea.

'''Harold Ray Denton''' (February 24, 1936 – February 13, 2017) was the Director of the [[Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation]] at the United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (USNRC) and is best known for his role as [[Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter's]] personal adviser for the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island (TMI) accident]].

After graduating in 1958 with a Bachelor of Science in [[nuclear engineering]] from [[North Carolina State University College of Engineering]], Denton first worked at [[DuPont]] as an engineer for several years, before being hired by the [[USNRC]]. After 10 years, he became the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, a position he held until his retirement in 1998.

== At Three Mile Island ==
[[File:Carter TMI-2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Harold Denton on left at Three Mile Island facility in 1979]]
In 1979, President Carter sent Denton to the [[Three Mile Island]] [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], as his personal representative.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mike and Rosen, Ira (2003) ''The Warning: Accident at Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Omen for the Age of Terror'' Norton, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n4XZlY6Zd-MC&amp;pg=PA224 page 224], {{ISBN|0-393-32469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of Denton seemed to immediately calm the frayed nerves of public officials and stem the anger of a frustrated [[press corps]]. As reporter Steve Liddick of WCMB radio explained to writer Mark Stephens, "Harold Denton was trusted because he looked like a regular, down-to-earth kind of guy. And people wanted someone to believe."&lt;ref name="PBS-1"&gt;Public Broadcasting Service (1999) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/three/peopleevents/pandeAMEX87.html "People &amp; Events: Harold Denton"] ''The American Experience: Meltdown at Three Mile Island''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Denton's task to inform Pennsylvania Governor [[Dick Thornburgh]] and the President about the discovery of a possibly explosive [[hydrogen]] bubble above the cooling water, at the top of the reactor pressure vessel. The debate over whether the bubble would mix with [[oxygen]] and set off an [[explosion]], fueled speculation of a [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].

At the time of Carter's arrival Sunday morning on 1 April, whether the bubble would explode was still under debate. Denton informed the President of the risk just as he was preparing to enter the plant. "...I briefed the President on this bubble and the possibility of an explosive mixture and tried to give him the two sides that were out there, but we still didn't have [a] single view on that," Denton recalled.&lt;ref name="PBS-1"/&gt;

Denton has won multiple awards for his contribution at Three Mile Island, including the [[James Nobel Landis|James N. Landis]] Medal. In an interview with Dick Thornburgh concerning TMI, Thornburg said, "[Denton] proved to be a genuine hero with respect to this event. He was a much needed source of information for those of us who had the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the people in the area and the quality of the environment."&lt;ref&gt;Public Broadcasting Service (1999) [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/three/filmmore/reference/interview/thornburgh07.html "Dick Thornburgh on: Harold Denton, NRC Official"] ''The American Experience: Meltdown at Three Mile Island''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 11 July 1959, he married Lucinda Vaden Oliver, and they subsequently had three children.&lt;ref&gt;"Harold Ray Denton" ''In'' Marquis ''Who's Who in America – 1994'' (48th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

HAROLD R. DENTON

Mr. Denton had over 30 years experience in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s nuclear safety regulation program. He was the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation for almost a decade. In this position, he was responsible for assuring the safety of all commercial nuclear power reactors, test reactors and research reactors, and was the official authorized by the Atomic Energy Act to issue construction permits and operating licenses. He directed a technical staff of over 500 reactor safety and environmental professionals. Later in his career, he directed the Commission's interactions with Congress, State Governments, the media and other countries.

Immediately following the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, President Carter appointed Mr. Denton as his personal representative at the TMI site. He subsequently worked closely with Gov. Thornburgh and other public officials. He was the news media spokesman for the federal government during the crisis and directed NRC staff activities to assess and mitigate the consequences. As a nuclear safety expert, he has visited essentially all U.S. power reactors and has traveled extensively to nuclear facilities worldwide. He was in the first group of Americans allowed to visit the Chernobyl site and was instrumental in establishing nuclear safety cooperation with the former USSR.

In a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House, President Carter presented him with the Presidential Distinguished Executive Award for extraordinary accomplishment and leadership.

Mr. Denton issued operating licenses to over forty nuclear power reactors during his career. He often testified before Senate and House committees concerning NRC's positions and activities. Later in his career, he directed the Commission's interactions with Congress, State Governments, foreign countries, the Nuclear Energy Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the media.
  
He attended North Carolina State College, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear engineering and did graduate work at the University of Maryland. Before joining the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), he was employed as a reactor physicist by the Dupont Company at the AEC’s Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. He was awarded honorary 
degrees from Gettysburg College, Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania and the University of Pennsylvania.
Since retiring from the NRC, he has provided advice on nuclear safety matters to a variety of national and international clients, including the US Department of Energy and its National Laboratories, the National Science Foundation, private power companies, and to the Governments of Austria,  Japan, Taiwan, and Turkey.

He was awarded the James M. Landis Medal by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for outstanding personal performance related to designing, constructing, and managing the operation of major steam-powered electric stations using nuclear.

In December 2011, he participated in a symposium sponsored by the Japanese Society of  Mechanical Engineers in Tokyo. This included a visit to several reactor sites damaged by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami where restoration and enhanced safety counter measures are in progress.

Denton died at his home in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]] from complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/harold-denton-nuclear-regulator-who-calmed-fears-at-three-mile-island-dies-at-80/2017/02/21/e3ac577c-f527-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html|title=Harold Denton, nuclear regulator who calmed fears at Three Mile Island, dies at 80|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|author=Matt Schudnel|accessdate=February 23, 2017|date=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22958">[[File:PMS evolution tracks.svg|thumb|Stellar evolution tracks (blue lines) for the pre-main-sequence. The nearly vertical curves are Hayashi tracks.&lt;br&gt;
Low-mass stars have nearly vertical evolution tracks until they arrive on the main sequence. For more-massive stars, the Hayashi track bends to the left into the [[Henyey track]]. Even more-massive stars are born directly onto the Henyey track.&lt;br&gt;
The end (leftmost point) of every track is labeled with the star's mass in [[solar masses]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), and represents its position on the main sequence.
The red curves labeled in years are isochrones at the given ages. In other words, stars &lt;math&gt;10^5&lt;/math&gt; years old lie along the curve labeled &lt;math&gt;10^5&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for the other 3 isochrones.]]

The '''Hayashi track''' is a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than {{Solar mass|3|link=y}} in the [[pre-main-sequence star|pre-main-sequence phase]] (PMS phase) of stellar evolution. It is named after Japanese astrophysicist [[Chushiro Hayashi]]. On the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], which plots luminosity against temperature, the track is a nearly vertical curve. After a [[protostar]] ends its phase of rapid contraction and becomes a [[T Tauri star]], it is extremely luminous. The star continues to contract, but much more slowly.  While slowly contracting, the star follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature, until either a [[radiative zone]] develops, at which point the star starts following the [[Henyey track]], or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [[main sequence]].

The shape and position of the Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram depends on the star's mass and chemical composition. For solar-mass stars, the track lies at a temperature of roughly 4000 K. Stars on the track are nearly fully convective and have their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] dominated by hydrogen ions. Stars less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} are fully convective even on the main sequence, but their opacity begins to be dominated by [[Kramers' opacity law]] after nuclear fusion begins, thus moving them off the Hayashi track. Stars between 0.5 and {{Solar mass|3}} develop a radiative
zone prior to reaching the main sequence. Stars between 3 and {{Solar mass|10}} are fully radiative at the beginning of the pre-main-sequence. Even heavier stars are born onto the main sequence, with no PMS evolution.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

At an end of a low- or intermediate-mass star's life, the star follows an analogue of the Hayashi track, but in reverse—it increases in luminosity, expands, and stays at roughly the same temperature, eventually becoming a [[red giant]].

==History==
In 1961, Professor [[Chushiro Hayashi]] published two papers&lt;ref name=hayashi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=hayashi2/&gt; that led to the concept of the [[pre-main-sequence]] and form the basis of the modern understanding of early stellar evolution. Hayashi realized that the existing model, in which stars are assumed to be in [[radiative equilibrium]] with no substantial convection zone, cannot explain the shape of the [[red giant branch]].&lt;ref name=Stahler1988/&gt;  He therefore replaced the model by including the effects of thick [[convection zone]]s on a star's interior.

A few years prior, [[Donald Edward Osterbrock|Osterbrock]] proposed deep convection zones with efficient convection, analyzing them using the opacity of H- ions (the dominant opacity source in cool atmospheres) in temperatures below 5000K.  However, the earliest numerical models of Sun-like stars did not follow up on this work and continued to assume radiative equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

In his 1961 papers, Hayashi showed that the convective envelope of a star is determined by:

&lt;math&gt;E = 4\pi G^{3/2}(\mu H/k)^{5/2}M^{1/2}R^{3/2}P/T^{5/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where E is unitless, and not the [[energy]].  Modelling stars as [[polytrope]]s with index 3/2—in other words, assuming they follow a pressure-density relationship of &lt;math&gt;P=K\rho^{5/3}&lt;/math&gt;—he found that E=45 is the maximum for a [[quasistatic process|quasistatic]] star.  If a star is not contracting rapidly, E=45 defines a curve on the HR diagram, to the right of which the star cannot exist.  He then computed the evolutionary tracks and [[Stellar isochrone|isochrones]] (luminosity-temperature distributions of stars at a given age) for a variety of stellar masses and noted that [[NGC2264]], a very young star cluster, fits the isochrones well.  In particular, he calculated much lower ages for solar-type stars in NGC2264 and predicted that these stars were rapidly contracting [[T Tauri stars]].

In 1962, Hayashi published a 183-page review of stellar evolution.  Here, he discussed the evolution of stars born in the forbidden region.  These stars rapidly contract due to gravity before settling to a quasistatic, fully convective state on the Hayashi tracks.

In 1965, numerical models by Iben and Ezer &amp; Cameron realistically simulated pre-main-sequence evolution, including the [[Henyey track]] that stars follow after leaving the Hayashi track.  These standard PMS tracks can still be found in textbooks on stellar evolution.

==Forbidden zone and Hayashi limit==

The '''forbidden zone''' is the region on the HR diagram to the right of the Hayashi track where no star can be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], even those that are partially or fully radiative.  Newborn [[protostar]]s start out in this zone, but are not in hydrostatic equilibrium and will rapidly move towards the Hayashi track.

Because stars emit light via [[blackbody radiation]], the power per unit surface area they emit is given by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\star} = \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;
The star's luminosity is therefore given by:
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

For a given L, a lower temperature implies a larger radius, and vice versa. Thus, the Hayashi track separates the HR diagram into two regions: the allowed region to the left, with high temperatures and smaller radii for each luminosity, and the forbidden region to the right, with lower temperatures and correspondingly higher radii.  The '''Hayashi limit''' can refer to either the lower bound in temperature or the upper bound on radius defined by the Hayashi track.

The region to the right is forbidden because it can be shown that a star in the region must have a temperature gradient of:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P} &gt; 0.4&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt; for a monatomic ideal gas undergoing [[adiabatic]] expansion or contraction.  A temperature gradient greater than 0.4 is therefore called superadiabatic.

Consider a star with a superadiabatic gradient.  Imagine a parcel of gas that starts at radial position r, but moves upwards to r+dr in a sufficiently short time that it exchanges negligible heat with its surroundings—in other words, the process is adiabatic.  The pressure of the surroundings, as well as that of the parcel, decreases by some amount dP.  The parcel's temperature changes by &lt;math&gt;dT = 0.4\frac{T}{P}dP&lt;/math&gt;.  The temperature of the surroundings also decreases, but by some amount dT' that is greater than dT.  The parcel therefore ends up being hotter than its surroundings.  Since the [[ideal gas law]] can be written &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\rho RT}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, a higher temperature implies a lower density at the same pressure.  The parcel is therefore also less dense than its surroundings.  This will cause it to rise even more, and the parcel will become even less dense than its new surroundings.

Clearly, this situation is not stable.  In fact, a superadiabatic gradient causes [[convection]].  Convection tends to lower the temperature gradient because the rising parcel of gas will eventually be dispersed, dumping its excess thermal and kinetic energy into its surroundings and heating up said surroundings.  In stars, the convection process is known to be highly efficient, with a typical &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P}&lt;/math&gt; that only exceeds the adiabatic gradient by 1 part in 10 million.&lt;ref name=struct_evol/&gt;

If a star is placed in the forbidden zone, with a temperature gradient much greater than 0.4, it will experience rapid convection that brings the gradient down.  Since this convection will drastically change the star's pressure and temperature distribution, the star is not in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and will contract until it is.

A star far to the left of the Hayashi track has a temperature gradient smaller than adiabatic. This means that if a parcel of gas rises a tiny bit, it will be more dense than its surroundings and sink back to where it came from. Convection therefore does not occur, and almost all energy output is carried radiatively.

==Star formation==
Stars form when small regions of a [[giant molecular cloud]] collapse under their own gravity, becoming [[protostar]]s. The collapse releases gravitational energy, which heats up the protostar.  This process occurs on the [[Free fall|free-fall timescale]], which is roughly 100,000 years for solar-mass protostars, and ends when the protostar reaches approximately 4000 K.  This is known as the Hayashi boundary, and at this point, the protostar is on the Hayashi track.  At this point, they are known as [[T Tauri stars]] and continue to contract, but much more slowly.  As they contract, they decrease in luminosity because less surface area becomes available for emitting light. The Hayashi track gives the resulting change in temperature, which will be minimal compared to the change in luminosity because the Hayashi track is nearly vertical.  In other words, on the HR diagram, a T Tauri star starts out on the Hayashi track with a high luminosity and moves downward along the track as time passes.

The Hayashi track describes a fully [[convective]] star.  This is a good approximation for very young pre-main-sequence stars they are still cool and highly [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], so that [[radiative transport]] is insufficient to carry away the generated energy and convection must occur.  Stars less massive than {{Solar mass|0.5}} remain fully convective, and therefore remain on the Hayashi track, throughout their pre-main-sequence stage, joining the main sequence at the bottom of the Hayashi track. Stars heavier than {{Solar mass|0.5}} have higher interior temperatures, which decreases their central opacity and allows radiation to carry away large amounts of energy.  This allows a [[radiative zone]] to develop around the star's core. The star is then no longer on the Hayashi track, and experiences a period of rapidly increasing temperature at nearly constant luminosity.  This is called the [[Henyey track]], and ends when temperatures are high enough to ignite hydrogen fusion in the core.  The star is then on the [[main sequence]].

Lower-mass stars follow the Hayashi track until the track intersects with the main sequence, at which point hydrogen fusion begins and the star follows the main sequence.  Even lower-mass 'stars' never achieve the conditions necessary to fuse hydrogen and become [[brown dwarfs]].

==Derivation==
The exact shape and position of the Hayashi track can only be computed
numerically using computer models.  Nevertheless, we can make an extremely
crude analytical argument that captures most of the track's properties.  The
following derivation loosely follows that of Kippenhahn, Weigert, and Weiss in
''Stellar Structure and Evolution''.&lt;ref name=struct_evol/&gt;

In our
simple model, a star is assumed to consist of a fully convective interior
inside of a fully radiative atmosphere.

The convective interior is assumed to be an ideal monatomic gas with a perfectly adiabatic temperature gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\ln{T}}{d\ln{P}} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is sometimes labelled &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.  The following
adiabatic equation therefore holds true for the entire interior:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma} = C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic gamma]], which is 5/3 for an ideal
monatomic gas.  The ideal gas law says:

:&lt;math&gt;P = NkT/V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{\rho kT}{\mu H}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (\frac{k\rho C}{\mu H})^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight per particle and H is (to a very good
approximation) the mass of a hydrogen atom.  This equation represents a
[[polytrope]] of index 1.5, since a polytrope is defined by 
&lt;math&gt;P = K\rho^{1 + 1/n}&lt;/math&gt;, where n=1.5 is the polytropic index.  Applying 
the equation to the center of the star gives:
&lt;math&gt;P_c = (\frac{k\rho_c C}{\mu H})^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
We can solve for C:
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\mu HP_c^{1/\gamma}}{\rho_c k}&lt;/math&gt;

But for any polytrope, &lt;math&gt;P_c = W_n\frac{GM^2}{R^4}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = K_n\rho_{avg}&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;R^{\frac{3-n}{n}} M^{\frac{n-1}{n}} = \frac{K}{GN_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;W_n, K_n,
N_n,&lt;/math&gt; and K are all constants independent of pressure and density,
and the average density is defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\rho_{avg} \equiv \frac{M}{4/3 \pi R^3}&lt;/math&gt;.  Plugging all 3 equations
into the equation for C, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; C \sim M^{2-\gamma} R^{3\gamma - 4}&lt;/math&gt;

where all multiplicative constants have been ignored.  Recall that our original
definition of C was:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^\gamma = C&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore have, for any star of mass M and radius R:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^\gamma \sim M^{2 - \gamma} R^{3\gamma - 4}&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln P = \frac{2-\gamma}{1-\gamma}\ln M + \frac{3\gamma - 4}
{1 - \gamma}\ln R - \gamma \ln T&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

We need another relationship between P, T, M, and R, in order to eliminate P.
This relationship will come from the atmosphere model.

The atmosphere is assumed to be thin, with average [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] k.  Opacity is
defined to be optical depth divided by density. Thus, by definition, the
optical depth of the stellar surface, also called the [[photosphere]], is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\tau}{dr} = k\rho&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int_R^\infty k\rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = k\int_R^\infty \rho dr&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the stellar radius, also known as the position of the photosphere.
The pressure at the surface is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = \int_R^\infty g\rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{GM}{R^2}\int_R^\infty \rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \frac{GM\tau}{kR^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The optical depth at the photosphere turns out to be &lt;math&gt;\tau = 2/3&lt;/math&gt;. By
definition, the temperature of the photosphere is &lt;math&gt;T = T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; where effective
temperature is given by &lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2T_{eff}^4&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,
the pressure is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = \frac{GM}{R^2}\frac{2}{3k}&lt;/math&gt;

We can approximate the opacity to be:

:&lt;math&gt;k = k_0P^aT^b&lt;/math&gt;

where a=1, b=3.  Plugging this into the pressure equation, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = const(\frac{M}{R^2T_{eff}^b})^{\frac{1}{a+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln P_0 = \ln{const} + \frac{1}{a+1}(\ln{M} - 2\ln{R} - 
b\ln{T_{eff}}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Finally, we need to eliminate R and introduce L, the luminosity.  This can be
done with the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T_{eff}^4&lt;/math&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln{R} = 0.5\ln{L} - 2\ln{T_{eff}} + const
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Equation {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can now be combined by
setting &lt;math&gt;T=T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P=P_0&lt;/math&gt; in Equation 1, then eliminating &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;.
R can be eliminated using Equation {{EquationNote|3}}.  After some algebra,
and after setting &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 5/3&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln{T_{eff}} = A\ln{L} + B\ln{M} + const&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{0.75a-0.25}{5.5a+b+1.5}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{0.5a + 1.5}{5.5a+b+1.5}&lt;/math&gt;

In cool stellar atmospheres (T &lt; 5000 K) like those of newborn stars, 
the dominant source of opacity is the H- ion, for which 
&lt;math&gt;a \approx 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \approx 3&lt;/math&gt;, we get 
&lt;math&gt;A = 0.05&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since A is much smaller than
1, the Hayashi track is extremely steep: if the luminosity changes by a factor
of 2, the temperature only changes by 4 percent.  The fact that B is positive
indicates that the Hayashi track shifts left on the HR diagram, towards higher
temperatures, as mass increases.  Although this model is extremely crude, these
qualitative observations are fully supported by numerical simulations.

At high temperatures, the atmosphere's opacity begins to be dominated by
[[Kramers' opacity law]] instead of the H- ion, with a=1 and b=-4.5  In that
case, A=0.2 in our crude model, far higher than 0.05, and the star is no longer
on the Hayashi track.

In ''Stellar Interiors'', Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble go through a similar
derivation without neglecting multiplicative constants,&lt;ref name=interiors/&gt; 
and arrived at:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{eff} = (2600 K)\mu^{13/51}(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}})^{7/51}(\frac{L}{L_{\odot}})^{1/102}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight per particle.  The authors note that the coefficient of 2600K is too
low—it should be around 4000K—but this equation nevertheless shows that
temperature is nearly independent of luminosity.

==Numerical results==
[[File:Hayashi composition.png|thumb|Hayashi tracks of a {{Solar mass|0.8}} star with helium mass fraction 0.245, for 3 different metallicities]]

The diagram at the top of this article shows numerically computed stellar 
evolution
tracks for various masses.  The vertical portions of each track is the Hayashi
track.  The endpoints of each track lie on the main sequence.
The horizontal segments for higher-mass stars show the [[Henyey track]].

It is approximately true that: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \ln{T_{eff}}}{\partial \ln{M}} \approx 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagram to the right shows how Hayashi tracks change with changes in
chemical composition.  Z is the star's [[metallicity]], the mass fraction not
accounted for by hydrogen or helium.  For any given hydrogen mass fraction,
increasing Z leads to increasing molecular weight.  The dependence of 
temperature on molecular weight is extremely steep—it is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \ln{T_{eff}}}{\partial \ln{\mu}} \approx -26&lt;/math&gt;.
Decreasing Z by a factor of 10 shifts the track right, changing 
&lt;math&gt;\ln{T_{eff}}&lt;/math&gt; by about 0.05.

Chemical composition affects the Hayashi track in a few ways.  The
track depends strongly on the atmosphere's opacity, and this opacity is
dominated by the H- ion.  The abundance of the H- ion is proportional to the
density of free electrons, which, in turn, is higher if there are more metals
because metals are easier to ionize than hydrogen or helium.

==Observational status==
[[File:Ngc 2264.png|thumb|The young star cluster NGC 2264, with a large number of T Tauri stars contracting towards the main sequence.  The solid line represents the main sequence, while the two lines above that are the &lt;math&gt;10^{6.5}&lt;/math&gt; yr (upper) and &lt;math&gt;10^{6.7}&lt;/math&gt; yr (lower) isochrones.]]

Observational evidence of the Hayashi track comes from color-magnitude plots—the observational equivalent of HR diagrams—of young star clusters.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt; For
Hayashi, [[NGC 2264]] provided the first evidence of a population of contracting
stars. In 2012, data from NGC 2264 was re-analyzed to account for dust
reddening and extinction.  The resulting color-magnitude plot is shown at
right.

In the upper diagram, the isochrones are curves along which stars of a certain 
age
are expected to lie, assuming that all stars evolve along the Hayashi track.
An isochrone is created by taking stars of every conceivable mass, evolving
them forwards to the same age, and plotting all of them on the color-magnitude
diagram.
Most of the stars in NGC 2264 are already on the main sequence (black line), 
but a substantial population lies between the isochrones for 3.2 million and 5
million years, indicating that the cluster is 3.2-5 million years old and a large population of T Tauri stars is still on their respective Hayashi tracks.
Similar results have been obtained for NGC 6530, IC 5146, and NGC 6611.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

[[File:T Tauri tracks.png|thumb|The numbered curves show the Hayashi tracks of stars of that mass (in solar masses).  The small circles represent observational data of T Tauri stars.  The bold curve to the right is the birthline, above which few stars exist.]]

The lower diagram shows Hayashi tracks for various masses, along with T Tauri
observations collected from a variety of sources.  Note the bold curve to
the right, representing a [[stellar birthline]].  Even though some Hayashi tracks
theoretically extend above the birthline, few stars are above it.  In effect,
stars are 'born' onto the birthline before evolving downwards along their
respective Hayashi tracks.

The birthline exists because stars formed from overdense cores of giant molecular
clouds in an inside-out manner.&lt;ref name=Stahler1988/&gt;  That is, a small central region first
collapses in on itself while the outer shell is still nearly static.  The outer
envelope then accretes onto the central protostar.  Before the accretion is 
over, the protostar is hidden from view, and therefore not plotted on the
color-magnitude diagram.  When the envelope finishes accreting, the star is
revealed and appears on the birthline.

A common design principle of these devices is a special [[galvanic isolation]] module between the input (control) and the output (switching) circuits of the relay. Interface relays are widely used in control and protection systems of high voltage (10-100 kV) electronic and electrophysical equipment and in high power installations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Interface relays and Optocouplers R600 Series|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|publisher=ABB Corportaion|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Overvoltage Protection of Low Voltage Systems|last=Hasse|first=Peter|publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2000|isbn=978-0852967812|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

Any electromagnetic relay has a certain level of isolation between the input and output circuits. However, in ordinary relays, this function is not prevalent and, hence, not considered in the existing system of relay classification. In interface relays, however, the property of [[galvanic isolation]] (decoupling) between the input and output circuits is significantly bolstered, and parameters of the galvanic isolation have an utmost importance from standpoint of the functions performed by this relay. On the other hand, the parameters associated with switching capacity are secondary and can significantly vary in interface relays with the same level of galvanic decoupling.

In this respect, categorization of interface relays into existing classes of ordinary relays is arguable. Rather, it seems more appropriate to categorize them as a separate class of electrical relays and classify according to characteristics of the galvanic decoupling unit&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electronic Devices on Discrete Components for Industrial and Power Engineering|last=Gurevich|first=Vladimir|publisher=CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis Group)|year=2008|isbn=9781420069822|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;by insulation voltage level:&lt;/u&gt;
* low level (to 10 kV)
* medium level (10 to 100 kV)
* high level (above 100 kV)
&lt;u&gt;by construction of galvanic isolation module:&lt;/u&gt;
* opto-electronic
* electromagnetic (transformer)
* pneumatic
* radio frequency
* ultrasonic
* electrohydrolic
* with mechanical transmission
&lt;u&gt;by operational (execution) speed:&lt;/u&gt;
* super fast (up to 100 μsec)
* fast (100 μsec to 3 ms)
* inertial (above 3 ms)

Although such classification may seem arbitrary, it fully reflects the most important properties of interface relays that have a critical effect on the functions performed by them.

==Opto-electronic interface relays==
[[File:Opto-electronic interface relay.jpg|thumb|Opto-electronic interface relay. The HV insulator provides decoupling of circuits under different potentials.|202x202px]]
The developmental trends of interface relay technology suggest the use of [[opto-isolator]] as the prevailing design principle of interface relays. An opto-isolator can be implemented in terms of an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and a [[Photodiode#Other modes of operation|phototransistor]] (or [[Thyristor#Photothyristors|photothyristor]] or a [[photodiode]]) or a lamp and a [[photoresistor]]. An example of an opto-electronic interface relay is shown in the figure. The transparent high voltage insulating barrier provides galvanic isolation of the circuits under the difference of potentials up to 5-7 kV.  For higher voltages, they use an optical fiber, the length of which (depending on the voltage level) can take from dozens of centimeters to several meters.

&lt;u&gt;Criticism&lt;/u&gt;

It is agreed that the most important characteristic of opto-electronic systems is their noise robustness and insensitivity to electromagnetic fields. What is not considered, however, is that, in addition to the fiber optic line and the output actuator, such a system includes the source of light pulses on the transmitting side and the amplifier on the receiving side that are generally based on micro-circuitry. It is precisely these elements, with low trigger levels, that get damaged by pulse noise (interference, voltage spikes and discharges) of the high voltage power equipment, which negates the main advantage of opto-electronic systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the optical fibers themselves are subject to a severe negative effect of ionizing radiation and external mechanical impacts (which is critically important in military applications). The arrangement of input and output circuits of such systems needs to be widely spaced (requiring a lengthy optical fiber), which drives up the overall dimensions of interface unit. As such, the preferred use of an opto-electronic galvanic decoupling module in interface relays is not always warranted, and is merely the consequence of a stereotypical thinking of design engineers&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reed switch based HV interface relays ==
[[File:A 75 kV reed switch based interface relay (gerkotrone).jpg|thumb|364x364px|A 75 kV reed switch based interface relay (gerkotrone) 1 – HV part of main insulator formed as dielectric glass; 2 – flange; 3 – main separation part between HV and LV; 4 – LV part of main insulator; 5, 6 – internal and external thread; 7 – control winding; 8 – ferromagnetic core; 9 – reed switch; 10 – capsule for reed switch rotation; 11 – conducting coating of external surface of capsule 10 and internal surface of LV part of main insulator 4; 12 – LV bushing; 13 – reed switch mounting plate; 14 – HV bushing; 15 – reed switch position fixation element; 16 – dielectric nut; 17 – lower layer of epoxy compound with cooper powder (60-70%); 18 – dielectric epoxy resin.]]A special kind of high voltage (HV) interface relays (which do not fall under the existing classification discussed above) are called ''gerkotrones''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; — see the figure on the right. They were designed and developed by [[Vladimir Igorevich Gurevich|Vladimir Gurevich]] and offer a number of benefits over other types of interface relays. These include: design parsimony; mechanical, environmental and operational robustness; reliability and relatively low cost. Another important advantage of gerkotrones is the possibility of their installation directly on HV buses, which minimizes the dimensions of a protection system (unlike the aforementioned opto-electronic interfaces that require lengthy optical fibers).

These advantages command gerkotrones' widespread use in commercial and military applications in on-board, mobile and stationary powerful radio-electronic equipment,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in relay protection and automation systems of electrical networks,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in electrophysical installations, in power converter technology,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; etc.

The '''International Council on Large Electric Systems''' ({{Lang-fr|Conseil International des Grands Réseaux Électriques}}, ''CIGRÉ'')  is a global organization in the field of [[high voltage#Electricity|high voltage]] [[electricity]]. It was founded in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of CIGRÉ – A key player in the development of electric power systems since 1921 | publisher=CIGRÉ | location=Paris | isbn=978 2 85873 166 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scope of its activities include the technical and economical aspects of the [[electrical grid]], as well as the environmental and regulatory aspects.

More specifically, the objectives of CIGRÉ are to:
*facilitate technical exchanges among those involved in the production, transmission and distribution of electrical energy;
*communicate the state of the art and the technical knowledge in these fields;
*inform the decision makers and regulators in the field of high voltage electricity by means of publication in its magazine ''Electra'' or through the organization of biennial conferences, named ''Sessions'', that take place in even years in Paris, France.

CIGRÉ membership is open to individuals, companies and organisations involved with any aspect of high voltage engineering.  Member organisations and companies are known as collective members.

== Organisation ==

The activities of CIGRÉ are divided into sixteen study committees(SC) :
*A1  Rotating Electrical Machines
*A2  Transformers
*A3  High Voltage Equipment
*B1  Insulated Cables
*B2  Overhead Lines
*B3  Substations
*B4  HVDC and Power Electronics
*B5  Protection and Automation
*C1  System Development and Economics
*C2  System Operation and Control
*C3  System Environmental Performance
*C4  System Technical Performance
*C5  Electricity Markets and Regulation
*C6  Distribution Systems and Dispersed Generation
*D1  Materials and Emerging Test Techniques
*D2 Information Systems and Telecommunication

In addition, CIGRÉ has (as of 2012) 57 ''National Committees'' (NC) which support the Study Committees in identifying experts to participate in working groups. Beginning with the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Italy in 1923, National Committees have developed progressively around the world to give CIGRÉ a global footprint.&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of CIGRÉ - Creation and Development of National Committees since the 1920s | publisher=CIGRÉ | year=2013 | location=Paris | pages=4 | isbn=978 2 85873 221 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the Turkish National Committee was established.

CIGRÉ organises several types of conference, of which the biennial ''Sessions'', which take place in Paris in even-numbered years, are the most important and broad-ranging.  The first CIGRÉ session took place on 21–28 November 1921 at 7 Rue de Madrid, Paris&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt; and was attended by 231 high voltage engineers and technicians.

The 46th CIGRÉ session will be held at the Palais des congrès de Paris on 21–26 August 2016. The CIGRE Session and its Technical Exhibition bring together more than 8500 senior executives, engineers and experts from the worldwide Power Industry. The CIGRE Session provides a unique opportunity to listen to contributions from international senior executives as well as experts and specialists through official presentations, panel discussions, technical meetings and poster sessions. The Session also offers a social program to engage further discussions in a relaxed atmosphere.

In parallel of the Session, a Technical Exhibition is held in the same location on levels 1, 2 and 3. The exhibition offers the opportunity to all visitors, including CIGRE delegates, to discover new services, tools, equipment and materials as well as the most advanced technologies in the field of power systems.

In addition to the biennial sessions, CIGRÉ organises several other types of conference in locations other than Paris, including: 
* Symposia in odd-numbered years.  These usually involve a sub-set of the study committees and concentrate on one common theme.
* Regional conferences covering a variety of subjects but for one specific country or region 
* Colloquia which usually involve only one or two study committees.

The Study Committees of CIGRÉ appoint ''Working Groups'' of internationally recognised experts to investigate and publish the state of the art in their chosen field.  The output of Working Groups is in the form of ''Technical Brochures''.  Technical Brochures are frequently used to inform and act as precursor documents for the activities of national and international [[Standards organization]]s, notably the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC).

CIGRÉ publishes a bimonthly magazine called ''Electra'' which contains executive summaries of recently published Technical Brochures, as well as selected scientific papers and invited papers.

The Technical Committee of CIGRE recently updated the CIGRE White Paper “Network of the Future” issued in 2011 and published in Electra (N°256). This summary paper provides CIGRE’s views on the know-how needed to manage the transition towards future energy supply systems].

==Applications==
===Proton Transfer Reaction Chamber===
[[Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry]] has traditionally used drift tubes as ion traps.  However, radio frequency ion funnels offer an attractive alternative, as they improve compound specific sensitivity significantly.  This is due to increasing the effective reaction time and focusing the ions.  The same pressure ranges are required for ion funnels and drift tubes, so the technology is not difficult to implement.  Ion funnels have been shown to favor transmission of ions with high m/z.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = International Journal of Mass Spectrometry | year = 2017  | volume = 414 | pages = 31-38 | title = Implementation and Characterization of an RF Ion Funnel Ion Guide as a Proton Transfer Reaction Chamber |vauthors=Brown P, Cristescu S, Mullock S, Reich D, Lamont-Smith C, Harren F | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387380616301993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breath Analysis===
Breath analysis is a convenient and non-invasive way to determine whether a person is intoxicated, monitor the levels of anesthetics in the body during surgical procedures, identify performance-enhancing substances in the system of athletes, etc.  However, conventional techniques are ineffective at low concentrations.  An [[electrospray ionization]] interface assisted by an ion funnel used in a linear trap quadrupole [[Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance]] mass spectrometer was shown to greatly increase sensitivity with high resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Journal of Mass Spectrometry | year = 2012  | volume = 47 | pages = 1571-1575 | title = High Mass Resolution Breath Analysis using Secondary Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Assisted by an Ion Funnel |vauthors=Meier L, Berchtold C, Schmid S, Zenobi R | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jms.3118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''JFE Holdings, Inc.'''|JFE ホールディングス株式会社|Jeiefuī Hōrudingusu Kabushiki-gaisha}} is a [[corporation]] headquartered in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was formed in 2002 by the [[merger]] of {{nihongo|'''NKK'''|日本鋼管株式会社|Nippon Kōkan Kabushiki Kaisha}} and {{nihongo|'''Kawasaki Steel Corporation'''|川崎製鉄株式会社|Kawasaki Seitetsu Kabushiki-gaisha}} and owns [[JFE Steel]], [[JFE Engineering]] and [[Japan Marine United]]. JFE is from Japan, Fe (the [[chemical element]] symbol of [[iron]]) and [[Engineering]].

==Mergers and Spinoffs==
At the time JFE Holdings was created in 2002, NKK Corporation was Japan's second largest steelmaker and Kawasaki Steel was the third largest steelmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-04-14/business/0104140018_1_nkk-corp-nippon-steel-kawasaki-steel |title=JJapan steel merger to join No. 2, No. 3 |publisher=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=April 14, 2001 |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both companies were major military vessel manufacturers during [[World War II]].

JFE's main business is [[steel]] production. It also engages in [[engineering]], [[ship building]], real-estate redevelopment, and LSi business. The company also operates several overseas [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]], including [[California Steel Industries]] in the [[United States]], Fujian Sino-Japan Metal in [[China]], and Minas da Serra Geral in [[Brazil]].  Other than steel, they are also known for products such as the [[bicycle tree]].&lt;ref name="Picken2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stuart D. B. |last=Picken|title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Business|date=December 19, 2016|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]]|isbn=978-1-4422-5589-0|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JFE Holdings owns [[JFE Steel]], the fifth largest steel maker in the world with revenue in excess of US$30 billion. JFE Holdings has other subsidiaries including JFE Engineering, JFE Steel and JFE Shoji &lt;ref name="Picken2016"/&gt;, and part-owns [[Japan Marine United]], a major [[shipbuilding]] company. 

NKK and Siderca S.A. of Argentina established a seamless pipe joint venture by spinning off the seamless pipe division of NKK's Keihin Works in 2000.&lt;ref name="Picken2016"/&gt; In November 2009, JFE agreed to partner with JSW Steel, India's third-largest steel producer, to construct a joint steel plant in [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JSW Steel, Japan JFE to consider steel plant in India |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSBMB00911220091119 |author=Sunil Nair |date=November 19, 2009 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its shipbuilding unit, Universal Shipbuilding was created in 2002 when NKK Corporation a predecessor of JFE, merged its shipbuilding unit with that of [[Hitachi Zosen Corporation|Hitachi Zosen]]. In 2012, JFE merged its ship building unit, Universal Shipbuilding Corporation, with Marine United Inc. of [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] after discussion started in April 2008 to form [[Japan Marine United]] Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suga |first=Masumi |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-30/jfe-ihi-to-merge-shipbuilding-units-to-survive-competition-1-.html |title=JFE, IHI to Merge Shipbuilding Units to Survive Competition |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to become Japan’s largest shipbuilder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-02/jfe-ihi-shipbuilding-merger-to-target-6-2-billion-of-sales-in-five-years.html |title=JFE, IHI Ship Merger to Target $6.2 Billion of Sales in 5 Years - Bloomberg Business |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
===Super-rapid charging===
JFE Engineering Corporation is developing a quick [[charging station|charge system]] that it claims can take a battery from zero charge to 50% full in about 3 minutes. It has two batteries, one that stores electrical energy from the [[electrical grid|grid]] and another that delivers it to the car at extremely high current (500-600 [[Ampere|amp]]s), which allows it to use a [[low voltage|low-voltage]] power supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20100621/183598/ |title=JFE Engineering Announces 'Super-rapid' EV Charging System |author=Keisuke Ogawa |date=June 21, 2010 |work=Tech-On! |publisher=[[Nikkei Business Publications]] |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims that even though one station costs about $63,000, that’s roughly 40% less than the competing [[CHAdeMO]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gas2.org/2010/05/05/ultra-quick-battery-charge-system-developed-50-full-in-3-minutes/#more-7511 |title=Ultra Quick Battery Charge System Developed: 50% Full in 3 Minutes |author=Nick Chambers |date=May 5, 2010 |publisher=gas2.0 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle Tree===
The bicycle tree is an automatic storage system for bicycles that can hold up to 6,000 bikes. The systems works by fitting the bicycle with an electronic tag and a computer saves the owner's data. Then a mechanical arm pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it in a free location. When the owner wants to retrieve the bike, a card is swiped through a reader and the computer retrieves the bike based on the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2009/nov/05/japan-best-bike-shed |title=Has Japan designed the world's best bike shed? |first= David |last=Munk |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2017 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first physics experiment located, and largely built, in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Symmetry: Dimensions of Particle Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NPyAAAAMAAJ|date=2006|publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Lab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research topics include detector development for a [[neutrino]]less double beta decay search and the creation of an extreme low temperature diamond [[calorimeter]].

==History==
The KIMS experiment was funded in 2000 to search for WIMP dark matter.  To avoid the cost of creating a new underground tunnel for testing, the Yangyang Pumped Storage Power Plant belonging to Korea Middleland Power Co. in [[Yangyang]], Korea was used. Construction was completed in 2003. The CsI(Tl) [[scintillator|scintillating]] crystal used has a high light yield is affordable for large mass.  After a substantial effort for the initial setup and crystal development, KIMS began recording data in 2004 with one full-size 6&amp;nbsp;kg crystal.&lt;ref name="ChoiKim2005" /&gt;  A 4 crystal setup was run in 2005-2006 to optimize the WIMP search.  In 2008, the 12 crystal array with mass 103.4&amp;nbsp;kg was completed and ran until December 2012 for a detector upgrade replacing the PMTs.

== Results ==
The first WIMP cross section search was published in 2006 using the one crystal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = |title=First limit on WIMP cross section with low background CsI(Tℓ) crystal detector |author=KIMS Collaboration |date=9 February 2006 |journal=Phys.

Originally published in sets of ten between 1899 and 1904 and collectively in two volumes in 1904,&lt;ref name="KreinikArts2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Juliana D. Kreinik |author2=New York University. Institute of Fine Arts |title=The Canvas and the Camera in Weimar Germany: A New Objectivity in Painting and Photography of the 1920s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khRzA67DzkgC&amp;pg=PA232 |year=2008 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] |isbn=978-0-549-58248-9 |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; it consists of 100 prints of various organisms, many of which were first described by Haeckel himself.  Over the course of his career, over 1000 [[engraving]]s were produced based on Haeckel's [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es and [[watercolor]]s; many of the best of these were chosen for ''Kunstformen der Natur'', translated from sketch to print by lithographer Adolf Giltsch.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition of ''Kunstformen'', containing only 30 prints, was produced in 1924.

==Themes==

According to Haeckel scholar Olaf Breidbach, the work was "not just a book of illustrations but also the summation of his view of the world."  The over-riding themes of the ''Kunstformen'' plates are [[symmetry in biology|symmetry]] and [[Evolution of biological complexity|level of organization&lt;!--in evolution, not molecule/cell/tissue/organ level--&gt;]].  The subjects were selected to embody these to the full, from the scale patterns of [[boxfish]]es to the spirals of [[ammonite]]s to the perfect symmetries of jellies and microorganisms, while images composing each plate are arranged for maximum visual impact.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 229-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the notable prints are numerous [[radiolarian]]s, which Haeckel helped to popularize among amateur [[microscope|microscopists]]; at least one example is found in almost every set of 10.  [[Cnidaria]] also feature prominently throughout the book, including [[sea anemones]] as well as [[Siphonophorae]], [[Semaeostomeae]], and other [[medusa (biology)|medusae]].  The first set included ''Desmonema annasethe'' (now ''[[Cyanea (jellyfish)|Cyanea]] annasethe''), a particularly striking [[jellyfish]] that Haeckel observed and described shortly after the death of his wife Anna Sethe.&lt;ref name=Innes&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Innes |first1=Shelley |title=From Here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and Scientific Faith, Religion, Theology, and Natural Science, Vol. 3 by Mario di Gregorio |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2006 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=214–216 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-006-0001-9 |jstor=4332000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

''Kunstformen der Natur'' was influential in early 20th-century art, architecture, and design, bridging the gap between science and art.  In particular, many artists associated with [[Art Nouveau]] were influenced by Haeckel's images, including [[René Binet (artist)|René Binet]], [[Karl Blossfeldt]], [[Hans Christiansen (artist)|Hans Christiansen]], and [[Émile Gallé]].  One prominent example is the [[Beurs van Berlage|Amsterdam Commodities Exchange]] designed by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]]: it was in part inspired by ''Kunstformen'' illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Breidbach, ''Visions of Nature'', pp. 231, 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
For several decades [[uranium mining]] has been a major part of the [[Politics of Australia|Australian political landscape]], with opposition groups citing the wide ranging environmental impacts, [[Indigenous Australia|indigenous land]] access and [[nuclear proliferation]] as reasons for ceasing or restricting the industry.  The debate has resulted in limitations on mining and export activities, with Federal and State governments occasionally [[flip-flopping]] on public policy.  In the meantime, mining companies have pursued exploration activities, and in some instances stockpiled mined ore.

[[File:Air cooled load bank.jpg|thumb|An air-cooled load bank, being used for acceptance testing of a 3000 kW standby diesel generator set. This is one of three banks used to load the generator to verify performance on load changes and for factory run-in.]]
A '''load bank''' is a device which develops an [[electrical load]], applies the load to an electrical power source and converts or dissipates the resultant power output of the source.
A load bank includes load elements with protection, control, metering and accessory devices required for operation. Load banks can either be permanently installed at a facility and permanently connected to a power source or portable versions can be used for testing power sources such as standby generators and batteries. Load banks are the best way to replicate, prove and verify the real-life demands on critical power systems. . &lt;ref name=ComRent&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comrent.com/what-we-do/|title=ComRent: What is a Load Bank|website=comrent.com|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascopower.com/en-us/resource/our-resources/articles/load-bank-basics/|title=Load Bank Basics|last=|first=|date=|website=ascopower.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Load banks are used in a variety of applications, including:

*Factory testing of [[turbine]]s and engine [[diesel generator]] sets
*Reduction of [[wet stacking]] problems in diesel engines run at light load
*Periodic exercising of stand-by engine generator sets
*[[Battery (electricity)|Battery]] and [[uninterruptible power supply|UPS system]] testing
*Ground power testing
*Load optimization in [[prime power (electrical)|prime power]] applications
*Removal of carbon build-up on generator [[piston]] rings
*[[Load rejection]] tests
*[[Data center]] tests (electricity and air-conditioning)

==Load bank types==

The three most common types of load banks are resistive, inductive, and capacitive. Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is known as reactance in an AC circuit. [[Electrical reactance|Reactance]] is a circuit element's opposition to an [[alternating current]], caused by the buildup of electric or [[magnetic field]]s in the element due to the current and is the "imaginary" component of impedance, or the resistance to AC signals at a certain frequency. Capacitive reactance is equal to 1/(2⋅π⋅f⋅C), and inductive reactance is equal to 2⋅π⋅f⋅L. The unit of reactance is the [[ohm]]. Inductive reactance resists the change to current, causing the circuit current to lag voltage. Capacitive reactance resists the change to voltage, causing the circuit current to lead voltage. 

[[File:ASCO Froment 8000 Series Load bank.jpg|thumb|2 x ASCO 6MVA resistive/reactive containerised load banks testing diesel gen-sets on board a shipping vessel.]]

===Resistive load bank===
A resistive load bank, the most common type, provides equivalent loading for both [[electrical generator|generator]]s and [[prime mover (engine)|prime mover]]s. That is, for each [[kilowatt]] (or [[horsepower]]) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A resistive load bank, therefore, removes energy from the complete system: load bank from generator—generator from prime mover—prime mover from fuel. Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank operation: waste heat from coolant, exhaust and generator losses and energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive load bank impacts upon all aspects of a generating system.

The load of a resistive load bank is created by the conversion of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as [[resistor#Grid resistor|grid resistor]]s. This heat must be dissipated from the load bank, either by air or by water, by forced means or [[convection]].

In a testing system, a resistive load simulates real-life resistive loads, such as [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lighting]] and heating loads as well as the resistive or unity [[power factor]] component of magnetic (motors, transformers) loads.

The most common type uses wire resistance, usually with fan cooling, and this type is often portable and moved from generator to generator for test purposes. Sometimes a load of this type is built into a building, but this is unusual.&lt;ref name=simplex&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comrent.com/what-we-do/|title=Simplex: What is a Load Bank|website=comrent.com|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarely a [[salt water rheostat]] is used. It can be readily improvised, which makes it useful in remote locations.

For testing [[car battery|automotive batteries]], a carbon pile load bank allows an adjustable load to be placed on the battery or charging system, allowing accurate simulation of the heavy load on the battery during cranking of the engine.  Such devices are usually portable and may include metering to show voltage and current. &lt;ref&gt;Ken Pickerill, '' Today's Technician: Automotive Engine Performance Classroom Manual and Shop Manual '',Nelson Education, 2009, {{ISBN|1111782385}}, page 51 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductive load bank===
An inductive load includes inductive (lagging [[power factor]]) loads.

An inductive load consists of an iron-core reactive element which, when used in conjunction with a resistive load bank, creates a lagging power factor load. Typically, the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100&amp;nbsp;kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment.&lt;ref name=simplex/&gt;

[[File:Prague asterix laser system-capacitor bank.jpeg|thumb|Capacitor bank.]]
===Capacitive load bank===
A capacitive load bank or capacitor bank is similar to an inductive load bank in rating and purpose, except leading power factor loads are created, so reactive power is supplied from these loads to the system, hence improves the power factor. These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries.

=== Resistive Reactive (Combined) load bank ===
A combined load bank usually consists of both resistive elements and inductors that can be used to provide load testing at non-unity PF (lagging) including the capability to test the generator set fully at 100% nameplate kVA rating. Combined load banks incorporate resistors and inductors all in a single construction which can be independently switched to allow resistive only, inductive only, or varying lagging power factor testing. Combined load banks are rated in kilovolt-amperes (kVA). It’s worth noting that combined load banks can consist of resistive, inductive, and capacitive (RLC) also.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Typically, facilities require motor-driven devices, transformers and capacitors. If this is the case, then the load banks used for testing require reactive power compensation. The ideal solution is a combination of both resistive and reactive elements in one load bank package. 

Resistive/reactive loads are able to mimic motor loads and electromagnetic devices within a power system, as well as provide purely resistive loads.

Many backup generators and turbines need to be commissioned at nameplate capacity using a combination of resistive and reactive load to fully qualify their operating capability. Using a resistive/reactive load bank enables comprehensive testing from a single unit. A range of resistive/reactive load banks are available to simulate these types of loads on a power source and the transformers, relays and switches which will distribute the power throughout the facility.

Resistive/reactive load banks are great choices for testing turbines, switchgear, rotary UPS, generators and UPS systems. They can also be used for integrated system testing of utility substation protection systems, particularly for more complex relays like distance, directional overcurrent, power directional and others. A resistive/reactive inductive and/or capacitive load is often required to test solar inverters to ensure solar panels can be stopped from producing electricity in the event of a power outage. The resistive/reactive combination load banks are used to test the engine generator set at its rated power factor. In most cases this is 0.8 power factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascopower.com/globalassets/documents/asco-white-papers/asco-reactive-load-bank-wp-en-na-v3.pdf|title=Application of Resistive/Reactive Load Banks for kVA Testing|last=|first=|date=|website=ascopower.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic load bank===
An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable, air- or water-cooled design used to simulate a solid state load and to provide constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing.

==Railways==
Where a [[diesel-electric locomotive]] is equipped for [[dynamic braking]], the braking resistor may be used as a load bank for testing the engine-generator set.

The '''Meghri Dam''' (also known as the '''Aras Dam''' or '''Aras Watershed Dam''') is a hydroelectric dam currently under construction on the [[Aras River]] near Armenia's southern town of [[Meghri]] on the [[Armenia]]–[[Iran]] border.

The joint Iranian–Armenia project was proposed in the 1990s and was discussed between Iranian and Armenian authorities.&lt;ref name=project/&gt;&lt;ref name=shana280604&gt;

'''''Moringa stenopetala''''', commonly called the '''cabbage-tree'''&lt;ref name=grin1/&gt; (along with a number of other species), is a tree in the flowering plant genus ''[[Moringa]]'', native to [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="AAA2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leone A, Spada A, Battezzati A, Schiraldi A, Aristil J, Bertoli S | title = Cultivation, Genetic, Ethnopharmacology, Phytochemistry and Pharmacology of ''Moringa oleifera'' Leaves: An Overview | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | pages = 12791–12835 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.3390/ijms160612791 | pmid=26057747 | pmc=4490473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now extirpated in the wild in Ethiopia, though still grown there as a crop on the terraces built to conserve water high up the mountains.&lt;ref name=grin1/&gt; It is a multipurpose tree producing edible leaves, seeds used for the purification of water, and traditional medicinal products.

==History==
The cabbage-tree was planted by agriculturalists on the complex system of terraces built high up in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], where they became domesticated and were bred to improve productivity, the taste of their leaves, and the size of their seeds. Since then, the improved trees have been introduced into other areas such as the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Samia Al Azharia Jahn |year=1991 |title=The Traditional Domestication of a Multipurpose Tree ''Moringa stenopetala'' (Bak.f.) Cuf. in the Ethiopian Rift Valley |journal=Ambio |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=244–247 |jstor=4313833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The cabbage-tree is a small tree up to {{convert|12|m|0|abbr=on}}, with a many-branched crown and sometimes with multiple trunks. The leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate, with about five pairs of pinnae and three to nine elliptic or ovate leaflets on each pinna. The fragrant flowers have creamy-pink sepals, white or  yellow petals, and white stamens. The fruits are long reddish pods with a greyish bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seedvendor.com/50--seeds-moringa-stenopetala--african-moringa-cabbage--tr50.html |title=''Moringa stenopetala'': African Moringa |publisher=Seed People |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
''Moringa stenopetala'' is mostly known for its importance as a nutritious [[vegetable]] food crop in the [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] fields of [[Konso]], [[Ethiopia]]. In this way, it is similar to its Indian relative, ''[[Moringa oleifera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=6297 "Birdlife Data Zone: Konso - Segen"], Birdlife International website . Retrieved 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TreesforLife"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treesforlife.org/documents/moringa/presentation/Moringa%20Presentation%20%28General%29%20screen.pdf |title=The Moringa Tree ''Moringa oleifera'' |publisher=Trees for Life International |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621093813/http://www.treesforlife.org/documents/moringa/presentation/Moringa%20Presentation%20%28General%29%20screen.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for shading of ''[[Capsicum]]'' and ''[[Sorghum]]'' crops, as a [[companion planting|companion plant]];&lt;ref name=grin1/&gt; and additionally in [[folk medicine]].&lt;ref name=grin1/&gt;

Another use is the clarification and purification of water to make it potable. A powder made by grinding the seeds is found to be more effective at coagulating substances in suspension than the seeds of the closely related [[Moringa oleifera|horseradish tree]] (''M. oleifera''), which is used for this purpose in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3362/0262-8104.1985.019 |title=Water purification with ''Moringa'' seeds |year=1985 |last1=Desa |first1=Dian |journal=Waterlines |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=22–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Hydrocarbons Commission''' (CNH)  is an agency of the Federal Executive, with legal personality, budgetary autonomy and self-sufficiency technique whose operates in strict compliance with maximum transparency and accountability principles. These principles are established in the Constitution, the Coordinated Energy Regulatory Bodies Law, as well as its internal regulations, setting a new national and international benchmark.

The CNH was founded as a Federal Executive Agency, with full legal capacities, technical autonomy and budgetary self-sufficiency.  CNH´s highest authority is the Board of Commissioners, composed of seven members. For each of their appointments, the President nominates three candidates and the Senate designates one of them. Currently, this board is made up of Juan Carlos Zepeda, President Commissioner and Commissioners Alma America Porres Moon, Nestor Martinez Romero, Hector Felix Alberto Acosta, Sergio Pimentel Vargas, Hector Moreira Rodriguez and Franco Gaspar

== Objectives ==
# Develop information and knowledge of Mexico´s basins. CNH manages the National Data Repository, which contains information from seismic, gravimetric and magnetometric studies, obtained through exploration and production activities. In addition, it will keep and preserve well cores, drill cuttings and oil samples, necessary for the country´s historical and prospective hydrocarbon knowledge.
# Conduct public tenders and sign contracts for exploration and production of hydrocarbon knowledge.
# Manage assignments and E&amp;P Contracts.
# Regulate and supervise geophysical and geological prospection activities as well as hydrocarbon exploration and production, including its collection and integration to transportation and storage systems.

==History==

On April 8, 2008 the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] presented a series of reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution of Mexico and to secondary laws regulation the oil sector in Mexico.

Among the proposals to Congress the creation of a National Hydrocarbons Commission which shall endeavor to found "that the exploration and extraction are carried maximizing oil rents in the extraction of crude oil and natural gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gob.mx/comisiones/energia/docs/marco_LCNH.pdf|title=Ley de la Comisión Nacional de Hidrocarburos|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Cnh.gob.mx|accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was approved in October 2008, including as regards the Commission, which is formally established with the publication in the Official Journal of the Federation of Law of the National Hydrocarbons Commission on November 28, 2008

CNH was formally installed on May 20, 2009 when Felipe Calderon, President of Mexico, appointed by the five members of the commissioners who formed its governing. This first Board of Commissioners were Juan Carlos Zepeda Molina, Edgar Rene Rangel Germán, Javier Humberto Estrada Estrada, Guillermo Cruz Dominguez Vargas and Eduardo Alfredo Guzman. The first was appointed as commissioner in May presidente.

The Reform Proposals of the government of Enrique Peña Nieto on energy carried out under the so-called Pact for Mexico, whose goals include reforming the functions of the National Hydrocarbons Commission to give greater strength and give authority to sign contracts and tenders in energy.  Also given powers of supervision and promotion of activities petroleras. In early April 2014 the drafting of the amendments to articles 25, 27 and 28 of the Constitution and the Law on the National Commission of Hydrocarbons you were finished and It is waiting to be approved by both Cámaras.

On April 29, 2014 Juan Carlos Zepeda Molina was reelected as president of the Commission for a period of 5 years.

'''Neptunium hexafluoride'''&amp;nbsp;(NpF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is the highest fluoride of [[neptunium]], it is also one of seventeen known binary [[hexafluoride]]s. It is an orange volatile crystalline solid.&lt;ref name="GMELIN_108_114"/&gt; It is relatively hard to handle, being very corrosive, volatile and radioactive. 

At normal pressure , it melts at 54.4 ° C and boils at 55.18 ° C. It is the only neptunium compound that is easily converted into the gas phase. Due to these properties, it is possible to separate neptunium from spent fuel . This quickly increased the interest in his presentation and in the exact examination of its properties.

==Preparation==

=== Usual method ===
It is prepared by fluorination of [[neptunium(IV) fluoride]]&amp;nbsp;(NpF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) by powerful fluorinating agents such as elemental fluorine.&lt;ref name="NPF6_PREPARATION"&gt;John G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7173">A '''polyamide''' is a [[macromolecule]] with [[repeating unit]]s linked by [[amide]] bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, R. J. 2001. Polyamides, Plastics. Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science and Technology. {{DOI|10.1002/0471440264.pst251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyamides occur both naturally and artificially. Examples of naturally occurring polyamides are [[protein]]s, such as [[wool]] and [[silk]]. Artificially made polyamides can be made through [[step-growth polymerization]] or [[solid-phase synthesis]] yielding materials such as [[nylon]]s, [[aramid]]s, and [[sodium poly(aspartate)]]. Synthetic polyamides are commonly used in textiles, automotive applications, carpets and sportswear due to their high durability and strength. The transportation manufacturing industry is the major consumer, accounting for 35% of polyamide (PA) consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/engineering-plastics/ Market Study Engineering Plastics, Ceresana, Sep 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Polymers of [[Amino acid|amino acids]] are known as [[polypeptides]] or [[proteins]].

According to the composition of their main chain, synthetic polyamides are classified as follows:

All polyamides are made by the formation of an amide function to link two molecules of monomer together. The monomers can be amides themselves (usually in the form of a cyclic lactam such as [[caprolactam]]), α,ω-amino acids or a stoichiometric mixture of a diamine and a diacid. Both these kinds of precursors give a homopolymer. Polyamides are easily copolymerized, and thus many mixtures of monomers are possible which can in turn lead to many copolymers. Additionally many nylon polymers are miscible with one another allowing the creation of blends.

==Polymerization chemistry==
Production of polymers requires the repeated joining of two groups to form an amide linkage. In this case this specifically involves [[amide]] bonds, and the two groups involved are an [[amine]] group, and a terminal [[carbonyl]] component of a [[functional group]]. These react to produce a carbon-nitrogen bond, creating a singular [[amide]] linkage. This process involves the elimination of other atoms previously part of the functional groups. The carbonyl-component may be part of either a [[carboxylic acid]] group or the more reactive [[acyl halide]] derivative. The amine group and the carboxylic acid group can be on the same monomer, or the polymer can be constituted of two different [[bifunctional]] monomers, one with two amine groups, the other with two carboxylic acid or acid chloride groups.

The [[condensation reaction]] is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry. Nylons must specifically include a straight chain ([[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]]) monomer. The amide link is produced from an amine group (alternatively known as an amino group), and a [[carboxylic acid]] group. The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine, and gives rise to water, the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction. 

As an example of condensation reactions, consider that in living organisms, [[Amino acid]]s are condensed with one another by an enzyme to form amide linkages (known as [[Peptide bond|peptides]]). The resulting polyamides are known as proteins or polypeptides. In the diagram below, consider the amino-acids as single aliphatic monomers reacting with identical molecules to form a polyamide, focusing on solely the amine and acid groups. Ignore the substituent [[Alkyl|R groups]] &amp;ndash; under the assumption the difference between the R groups are negligible:

[[Image:2-amino-acidsb.png|centre|thumbnail|600px| The reaction of two amino acids. Many of these reactions produce long chain [[protein]]s]]

For fully aromatic polyamides or 'aramids' e.g. [[Kevlar]], the more reactive [[acyl chloride]] is used as a monomer. The polymerization reaction with the amine group eliminates [[hydrogen chloride]]. The acid chloride route can be used as a laboratory synthesis to avoid heating and obtain an almost instantaneous reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making nylon: The "nylon rope trick"| url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/res00000755/making-nylon-the-nylon-rope-trick| publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry| accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aromatic [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] itself does not participate in elimination reaction, but it does increase the rigidity and strength of the resulting material which leads to Kevlar's renowned strength.

In the diagram below, [[Aramid]] is made from two different monomers which continuously alternate to form the polymer. Aramid is an aromatic polyamide:

[[Image:Kevlar_reaction.svg|centre|frame|The reaction of 1,4-phenyl-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride to produce Aramid]]

Polyamides can also be synthesized from dinitriles using acid catalysis via an application of the Ritter reaction.  This method is applicable for preparation of [[nylon 1,6]] from [[adiponitrile]], [[formaldehyde]] and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magat|first=Eugene E.|last2=Faris|first2=Burt F.|last3=Reith|first3=John E.|last4=Salisbury|first4=L.

[[File:Musée zoologique de Strasbourg-Rhinograde (Rhinogradentia, cropped).jpg|thumb|A mock [[taxidermy]] of a rhinograde, using its ''nasorium'' to [[fishing|fish]] at the [[Musée zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg]].]]

'''Rhinogradentia''' is a fictitious [[order (biology)|order]] of [[mammal]] invented by German [[zoologist]] [[Gerolf Steiner]]. Members of the order, known as '''rhinogrades''' or '''snouters''', are characterized by a [[nose|nose-like]] feature called a ''nasorium'', which evolved to fulfill a wide variety of functions in different species. Steiner also created a fictional persona, [[naturalist]] Harald Stümpke, who is credited as author of the 1957 book ''Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia'' (translated into English in 1967 as ''The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades''). According to Steiner, it is the only remaining record of the animals, which were wiped out, along with all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, when the small Pacific [[archipelago]] they inhabited sank into the ocean due to nearby atomic bomb testing.

Successfully mimicking a genuine scientific work, Rhinogradentia has appeared in several publications without any note of its fictitious nature, sometimes in connection with [[April Fools' Day]].

==Background==
Rhinogradentia, their island home of Hy-yi-yi, zoologist Harald Stümpke, and a host of other people, places, and documents are fictional creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]] (1908–2009), a German zoologist. Steiner is best known for his fictional work as Stümpke, but he was an accomplished zoologist in his own right. He held a professorship at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and later the [[Technical University of Karlsruhe]], where he occupied the department chair from 1962 to 1973.&lt;ref name=karlsruhe/&gt;

According to [[Bud Webster]], Steiner's motivation for the work was instructional, to illustrate "how animals evolve in isolation".&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;
&lt;!-- NEED MORE HERE --&gt;

==Harald Stümpke's account==
Steiner's fictional author, credited as "quondam curator of the Museum of the Darwin Institute of Hy-yi-yi, Mairuwili," provides a very detailed account of the order and individual species, written in a dry, scholarly tone.&lt;ref name=steiner2/&gt; The evidently expert voice of the author, his competent writing, and apparent familiarity with conventions of academic literature set the work apart as a rare example at the intersection of fiction and scholarship.&lt;ref name=caverna/&gt; Steiner credits himself by name as illustrator of the book, and explains how that role led him to possess the only remaining record of Rhinogradentia.&lt;ref name=steiner1/&gt;

===Discovery and study at Hy-yi-yi===
According to Stümpke, Rhinogradentia were native to Hy-yi-yi, a small [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[archipelago]] comprising eighteen islands: Annoorussawubbissy, Awkoavussa, Hiddudify, Koavussa, Lowlukha, Lownunnoia, Mara, Miroovilly, Mittuddinna, Naty, Nawissy, Noorubbissy, Osovitissy, Ownavussa, Owsuddowsa, Shanelukha, Towteng-Awko, and Vinsy. The islands occupied {{convert|1,690|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the archipelago's highest peak, {{convert|2,230|m|ft|abbr=on}}, was on its main island, Hiddudify (Hy-dud-dye-fee).&lt;ref name=steiner1/&gt;

The first description of Hy-yi-yi published in Europe was that of Einar Pettersson-Skämtkvist, a Swedish explorer who arrived in Hiddudify by chance in 1941, after escaping from a Japanese [[POW camp|prisoner of war camp]].&lt;ref name=steiner1/&gt;&lt;ref name=caverna/&gt;&lt;ref name=gendron/&gt; Each of the islands was home to distinctive fauna, dominated by Rhinogradentia, the only mammals other than humans. In the time after the war, a number of scientists took interest in the rhinogrades and began formal research into their physiology, morphology, behaviors, and evolution.&lt;ref name=gendron/&gt;

In the late 1950s, nearby [[nuclear weapons testing]] by the [[United States military]] accidentally caused all of the islands of Hy-yi-yi to sink into the ocean, destroying all traces of the rhinogrades and their unique [[ecosystem]]. Also killed were all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, who were attending a conference on Hy-yi-yi at the time.&lt;ref name=steiner1/&gt;&lt;ref name=caverna/&gt; The book's epilogue, credited to Steiner in his capacity as the book's illustrator, explains that Stümpke had sent the book's materials to Steiner to serve as the basis for illustrations in preparation for publication. Following the disaster, it is the only remaining record of the subjects it describes.&lt;ref name=steiner2/&gt;

===Biological characteristics and behavior===

Rhinogrades are [[mammal]]s characterized by a nose-like feature called a ''nasorium'', the form and function of which vary significantly between species.&lt;ref name=steiner2/&gt;&lt;ref name=steiner1/&gt; According to Stümpke, the order's remarkable variety was the natural outcome of [[evolution]] acting over millions of years in the remote Hy-yi-yi islands. All the 14 [[family (biology)|families]] and 189 known snouter [[species (biology)|species]] descended from a small [[shrew]]-like animal, which gradually evolved and diversified to fill most of the [[ecology|ecological]] niches in the archipelago &amp;mdash; from tiny worm-like beings to large herbivores and predators.&lt;ref name=steiner2/&gt;

Many rhinogrades used their nose for locomotion, for example the "snout leapers" like ''Hopsorrhinus aureus'', whose nasorium was used for jumping, or the "earwings" like ''Otopteryx'', which flew backwards by flapping its ears and used its nose as a [[rudder]]. Some species used their nasorium for catching food, for example by using it to [[fishing|fish]] or to attract and trap insects.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; Other species included the fierce ''Tyrannonasus imperator'' and the shaggy ''Mammontops''.&lt;ref name=naish1/&gt;&lt;ref name=naish2/&gt;&lt;ref name=gehring/&gt;&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt;

Pettersson-Skämtkvist's early descriptions of the animals he encountered on Hy-yi-yi led zoologists to name them after the title creature in a short [[nonsense]] poem by [[Christian Morgenstern]], ''[[The Nasobame]]'' (''Das Nasobēm''). In the poem, which exists outside of this fictional universe and also served as an inspiration for Steiner, the Nasobame is seen "striding on its noses" (''auf seinen Nasen schreitet'').&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=morgen/&gt;

&lt;!-- ADD QUOTE TO GO WITH IMAGE --&gt;
Rhinogradentia is considered one of the best known biological [[hoax]]es and [[parody science|scientific jokes]] and Steiner's pseudonymous works on the subject continue to be reprinted and translated.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt;&lt;ref name=cain/&gt;&lt;ref name=supercurioso/&gt;

Since the book's original publication several scientists and publishers have written about Rhinogradentia as though Steiner's account were true, though it is unclear how many of those who continued and popularized the joke did so intentionally. [[Wulf Ankle]] wrote that the order "is not a poetic invention, but has really lived".&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; [[Erich von Holst]] celebrated the discovery of "a completely new animal world".&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; Timothy E. Lawlor's widely read textbook ''Handbook to the Orders and Families of Living Mammals'', includes an entry for Rhinogradentia that does not acknowledge its fictional nature.&lt;ref name=lewin/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawlor/&gt;&lt;ref name=sciencejokers/&gt;
[[File:Hyorhinomys07.JPG|thumb|180px|left|''[[Hyorhinomys stuempkei]]'', a real species of shrew rat named for Stümpke]]

Prior to the publication of Leigh Chadwick's English translation, an abbreviated version ran in the April 1967 edition of ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'', a magazine published by the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. It comprised material from the book's introduction, first chapter, selected descriptions of genera, and the epilogue, and was presented as the lead story, without qualification, by the normally serious publication.&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt;&lt;ref name=naturalhistory/&gt; The following month, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a story about the snouters on the front page, based on the ''Natural History'' article. According to the magazine's editorial director, they had "received more than 100 letters and telegraphs about the snouters, most of them from people who forgot that the article was published on April Fool's Day."&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt; ''Natural History'' printed several letters to the editor in its June–July issue, and conveyed to the ''Times'' the content of several more, ranging from skeptical to fascinated and continuations of the joke.&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt;&lt;ref name=naturalhistory/&gt; One reader, entomologist [[Alice Gray]], expressed thanks for the article, which enabled her family to identify an animal-shaped metal bracelet from the South Pacific as having been modeled after a "Hoop Snouter", and included a drawing to preserve the record because, she said, it had been melted down with some toy soldiers and a spoon by a young cousin with a new casting set.&lt;ref name=lyons/&gt;&lt;ref name=naturalhistory/&gt;

Decades later, papers are still published purporting to continue Stümpke's research or otherwise paying homage to Steiner's hoax. In a 2004 paper in the ''Russian Journal of Marine Biology'', authors Kashkina &amp; Bukashkina claim to have discovered two new marine genera: ''Dendronasus'' and an as yet unnamed parasitic taxon.&lt;ref name=kashkina/&gt;&lt;ref name=bukashkina/&gt; On [[April Fools' Day]] in 2012, the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|National Museum of Natural History]] in France announced the discovery of a wood-eating [[termite]]-like genera, ''Nasoperferator'', with a rotating nose resembling a [[drill]].&lt;ref name=avenir/&gt;&lt;ref name=gentside/&gt;

Rhinogradentia has been included in a number of museum exhibitions and collections. The National Museum of Natural History's ''Nasoperferator'' announcement was accompanied by a two-month exhibit honoring the animals, featuring purported stuffed specimens in its gallery of extinct species.&lt;ref name=linternaute/&gt; Mock [[taxidermy|taxidermies]] of rhinogrades have also been included in an exhibit at the [[Musée d'ethnographie de Neuchâtel]],&lt;ref name=ne/&gt; and in the permanent collections of the [[Musée zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg]] and the [[Salzburg]] [[:de:Haus der Natur Salzburg|Haus der Natur]].&lt;ref name=strasbourg/&gt;&lt;ref name=freezer/&gt;

Two real species have been named after Steiner and Stümpke: ''[[Rhinogradentia steineri]]'', a [[Pyralidae|snout moth]],&lt;ref name=eol/&gt; and ''[[Hyorhinomys stuempkei]]'', a shrew rat also known as the Sulawesi snouter,&lt;ref name=scinews/&gt;&lt;ref name=esselstyn/&gt; while the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] of ''[[Tateomys rhinogradoides]]'' pays homage to the fictitious order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tateomys | work = Animalia — Etymology of animal names | date = 29 September 2016 | accessdate = 17 March 2018 | url = http://metazoa.us/tateomys | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161018175057/http://metazoa.us/tateomys | archivedate = 18 October 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, Steiner's work influenced or inspired works of art. Japanese [[noise music]]ian [[Merzbow]], for example, gave the name Rhinogradentia to both a song and an album in the ''[[Merzbox#Rhinogradentia|Merzbox]]'' box set.&lt;ref name=merzbow/&gt;

'''''Storm Track''''' was the first [[magazine]] for and about [[storm chasing]]. The magazine was in circulation between 1977 and 2002.

==History and profile==
''Storm Track'' was started in 1977 by chasing pioneer [[David K. Hoadley|David Hoadley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History of Storm Track|url=https://stormtrack.org/community/faq/history-of-stormtrack.2/category|accessdate=December 13, 2015|work=Storm Track}}&lt;/ref&gt; following an informal meeting of storm chasers at an [[American Meteorological Society]] conference. In the beginning, it was published in newsletter format but in time assumed a magazine format and was published bimonthly throughout its history. In 1986, editorship was handed over to [[Timothy P. Marshall|Tim Marshall]], a storm damage [[Civil engineer|engineer]] (and [[meteorologist]]). Production of paper issues ceased in 2002 after a 25-year run; however, an accompanying website started in 1996 and continues primarily in the form of a large discussion board.&lt;ref name="online archive"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Marshall|authorlink=Timothy P. Marshall|author2=David Hoadley|title=''Storm Track'' Archive|work=Storm Track|url=http://www.stormtrack.org/archive/|accessdate=August 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822141406/http://www.stormtrack.org/archive/|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Storm Track'', among other topics, published storm chase accounts, discussions of issues affecting storm chasing, history of storm chasing and meteorology, meteorological analysis and case studies, climatology, reviews, biographies, photography, cartoons, poetry, and classifieds.&lt;ref name="online archive"/&gt;

''Storm Track'' was a non-profit publication aimed at scientists and amateurs interested in severe storms. Rich Herzog was an associate editor since 1991 and Phil Sherman an assistant editor from 1986-1990. Another associate editor and a founding member was Randy Zipser. Gene Rhoden contributed significantly to the cover design in 1986.&lt;ref name="20yrs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Storm Track is 20 Years Old! |journal=Storm Track|volume=20|issue=1|year=1996 |url= http://www.stormtrack.org/library/archives/20anniv.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published with Master Graphics in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Tim Vasquez was online editor. Most articles and photographs were submitted by subscribers. More than 180 people wrote articles for the magazine. David Hoadley made all the drawings and sketches and did many of the cartoons which were known as "Funnel Funnies". It began with 10 subscribers in 1977 and grew to several hundred over the years.

The '''Superconductor Insulator Transition''' is an example of a [[quantum phase transition]], whereupon tuning some parameter in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], a dramatic change in the behavior of the electrons occurs. The nature of how this transition occurs is disputed, and many studies seek to understand how the order parameter, &lt;math&gt;\Psi =\Delta \exp(i\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, changes. Here &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the order parameter, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the phase. Most theories involve either the destruction of the amplitude of the order parameter - by a reduction in the density of states at the [[Fermi surface]], or by destruction of the phase coherence; which results from the proliferation of vortices.

==Destruction of superconductivity==
In two dimensions, the subject of superconductivity becomes very interesting because the existence of true long-range order is not possible. How then is superconductivity obtained?  In the 70's, [[J. Michael Kosterlitz|Kosterlitz]] and [[David J. Thouless|Thouless]] (along with [[Vadim Berezinskii|Berezinski]]) showed that a different kind of long-range order could exist - topological order - which showed [[power law]] correlations (meaning that by measuring the two-point correlation function &lt;math&gt;\langle\Psi(0)\Psi(r)\rangle\propto r^{-\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; it decays algebraically).

This picture changes if disorder is included. Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior can be obtained, but the fluctuations of the order parameter are greatly enhanced, and the transition temperature is suppressed.

The model to keep in mind in the understanding of how superconductivity occurs in a two-dimensional disordered superconductor is the following. At high temperatures, the system is in the normal state. As the system is cooled towards its transition temperature, superconducting grains begin to fluctuate in and out of existence. When one of these grains "pops" into existence, it is accelerated without dissipation for a time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; before decaying back into the normal state. This has the effect of increasing the conductivity even before the system has condensed into the superconducting state. This increased conductivity above &lt;math&gt; T_{c0} &lt;/math&gt; is referred to as paraconductivity, or fluctuation conductivity, and was first correctly described by Aslamazov and [[Anatoly Larkin|Larkin]]. As the system is cooled further, the lifetime of these fluctuations increase, and becomes comparable to the Ginzburg-Landau time &lt;math&gt;\tau_{GL}=\frac{\pi\hbar}{8k_B(T_{c0}-T)}&lt;/math&gt;. Eventually, the amplitude &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; of the order parameter becomes well defined (it is non-zero wherever there are superconducting patches), and it can begin to support phase fluctuations. These phase fluctuations set in at a lower temperature, and are caused by vortices - which are topological defects in the order parameter. It is the motion of vortices that gives rise to inflation of resistance below &lt;math&gt;T_{c0}&lt;/math&gt;. Eventually the system is cooled further, below the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature &lt;math&gt;T_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, all of the free vortices become bound into vortex-antivortex pairs, and the systems attains a state with zero resistance.

==Finite magnetic field==
Cooling the system to &lt;math&gt;T=0&lt;/math&gt; and turning on a magnetic field has certain effects. For very small fields (&lt;math&gt;B &lt; B_{c1}&lt;/math&gt;) the magnetic field is shielded from the interior of the sample. Above &lt;math&gt;B_{c1}&lt;/math&gt; however, the energy cost to keep out the external field becomes too great, and the superconductor allows the field to penetrate in quantized fluxons. Now the superconductor has transitioned into the "mixed state", in which there is a superfluid along with vortices - which now have only one circulation.

Increasing the field adds vortices to the system. Eventually the density of vortices becomes so large that they overlap. The core of the vortex contains normal electrons (i.e. the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter is zero), so when they overlap, superconductivity is killed by destroying the amplitude of the order parameter. Increasing the field further leads to a very interesting possibility - in two-dimensions where the fluctuations are enhanced - that the vortices may condense into a Bose-condensate, which localizes the superconducting pairs.

'''Surface layering''' is a quasi-crystalline structure at the surfaces of otherwise disordered liquids, where [[atoms]] or [[molecules]] of even the simplest liquid are stratified into well-defined layers parallel to the surface. While in crystalline solids such atomic layers can extend periodically throughout the entire dimension of a crystal, surface layering decays rapidly away from the surface and is limited to just a few near-surface region layers. Another difference between surface layering and crystalline structure is that atoms or molecules of surface-layered liquids are not ordered in-plane, while in crystalline solids they are.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Croxton, Liquid State Physics (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, England, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface layering was predicted theoretically by [[Stuart Rice]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;M. P. D’Evelyn and S. A. Rice, J. Chem. Phys. 78, 5081 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been experimentally discovered by [[Peter Pershan]] (Harvard) and his group, working in collaboration with Ben Ocko (Brookhaven) and Moshe Deutsch (Bar-Ilan) in 1995 in elemental liquid [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Magnussen, B. M. Ocko, M. J. Regan, K. Penanen, P. S. Pershan and M. Deutsch, "X-ray reflectivity measurements of surface layering in liquid mercury", Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 4444 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and liquid [[gallium]]&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Regan, et al., "Surface layering in liquid gallium: x-ray reflectivity study", Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2498 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  using [[x-ray reflectivity]] techniques.

More recently layering has been shown to arise from electronic properties of metallic liquids, rather than thermodynamic variables such as surface tension, since surfaces of low-surface tension metallic liquids such as liquid [[potassium]] are layered,&lt;ref&gt;O. Shpyrko, P. Huber, A. Grigoriev, P. Pershan, B. Ocko, H. Tostmann, and M. Deutsch, Phys. Rev. B 67, 115405 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; while those of dielectric liquids such as [[water]], are not.&lt;ref&gt;O. G. Shpyrko, M. Fukuto, P. S. Pershan, B. M. Ocko, T. Gog, I. Kuzmenko, “Surface Layering of Liquids: The Role of Surface Tension” Phys. Rev. B 2004, 69, 245423&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''utilization factor''' or '''use factor''' is the ratio of the time that a piece of equipment is in use to the total time that it could be in use. It is often averaged over time in the definition such that the ratio becomes the amount of energy used divided by the maximum possible to be used. These definitions are equivalent.

== Electrical engineering ==

In [[electrical engineering]], ''utilization factor'', &lt;math&gt; k_\text{u} &lt;/math&gt;, is the ratio of the maximum [[electrical load|load]] which could be drawn to the rated capacity of the system. This is closely related to the concept of [[Load factor (electrical)|Load factor]]. The Load factor is the ratio of the load that a piece of equipment actually draws (time averaged) when it is in operation to the load it could draw (which we call full load).

For example, an oversized motor - 15 kW - drives a constant 12 kW load whenever it is on. The motor load factor is then 12/15 = 80%. The motor above may only be used for eight hours a day, 50 weeks a year. The hours of operation would then be 2800 hours, and the motor use factor for a base of 8760 hours per year would be 2800/8760 = 31.96%. With a base of 2800 hours per year, the motor use factor would be 100%.

== Other definitions ==

In offshore pipeline engineering, it is the ratio of the maximum allowable stress to the stress generally modelled at that section.

In [[power plant]], utilization varies according to the demand on the plant from the electricity market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4441">In [[chemistry]] the [[Descriptor (Chemistry)|descriptor]] '''vicinal''' (from [[Latin]] ''vicinus'' = neighbor), abbreviated ''vic'', describes any two [[functional group]]s bonded to two adjacent [[carbon]] atoms (i.e., in a 1,2-relationship). For example, the [[molecule]] 2,3-dibromobutane carries two vicinal [[bromine]] atoms and 1,3-dibromobutane does not. Mostly, the use of the term vicinal is restricted to two ''identical'' functional groups.

Likewise in a ''gem-''dibromide the prefix ''gem'', an abbreviation of '''[[geminal]]''', signals that both bromine atoms are bonded to the ''same'' atom (i.e., in a 1,1-relationship). For example, 1,1-dibromobutane is geminal.  While comparatively less common, the term '''hominal''' has been suggested as a descriptor for groups in a 1,3-relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Organic Chemistry: The Name Game|last=Nickon|first=Alex|last2=Silversmith|first2=Ernest F.|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1987|isbn=0-08-034481-X|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other such [[Descriptor (Chemistry)|descriptors]] as [[Syn addition|syn]], anti, [[exo isomer|exo]] or endo, the description ''vicinal'' helps explain how different parts of a molecule are related to each other either structurally or spatially. The vicinal adjective is sometimes restricted to those molecules with two ''identical'' functional groups. The term can also be extended to substituents on aromatic rings.

==&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy==
In &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy, the coupling of two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms is called vicinal coupling. The vicinal coupling constant is referred to as &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''J'' because the hydrogen atoms couple through three bonds. Depending on the other substituents, the vicinal coupling constant assumes values between 0 and +20&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Williams, I. Fleming: ''Strukturaufklärung in der organischen Chemie; Eine Einführung in die spektroskopischen Methoden'', 6. überarbeitete Auflage, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt; The dependence of the vicinal coupling constant on the [[dihedral angle]] &lt;math&gt;\!\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; is described by the [[Karplus equation|Karplus relation]].

After the death of Steve Irwin on 4 September 2006, thousands of people from around the world offered their support and donations to the conservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[[News Limited|news.com.au]] [http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,20438837-5008780,00.html "Irwin charity braces for donations"] 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 2006, Wildlife Warriors executive manager Michael Hornby reported that donations to the fund in the past month had reached $2 million&amp;nbsp;– enough to fund its animal hospital and international programs for six to nine months. The conservationist's one-hour [[Steve Irwin#Memorial service|public memorial service]], which aired worldwide from [[Australia Zoo]] in September, has also been made into a [[DVD]] which was released across Australia on 14 October, all proceeds of which are to be used to fund the future of the charity.

Irwin's daughter [[Bindi Irwin]], then nine years old, became the new public face of Wildlife Warriors after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[ninemsn]] [http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=146141 "Irwin donations tip $2 million"] 14 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
