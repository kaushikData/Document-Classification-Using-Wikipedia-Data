[[File:A42NWLeics.jpg|thumb|Looking north bound towards restricted junction 14.]]

The '''A42''' is a major [[trunk road]] in the [[East Midlands]] region of the United Kingdom. It links junction 23A of the [[M1 motorway]] to junction 11 of the [[M42 motorway]]. The A42 is in effect a continuation of the M42, and its junctions are numbered accordingly.

It is built to a similar standard to the M42, being a grade separated [[dual carriageway]]. The {{convert|6|mi|adj=on}} [[Measham]] and [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] bypass section was opened in August 1989 at a cost of £33m.

==Bridging link==
The A42 was built by the UK Government in 1989 to link the northern section of the M42 to the M1.  Although it is not designated as motorway, and has no hard shoulder, the road is fully grade separated and runs with two lanes each way, the same as the M42 to the south.

The original planned line of the M42 saw it joining the M1 further to the north, crossing what is now the A50 Derby Southern Bypass and meeting the M1 north of Bardills Island (A52/M1 interchange).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pathetic.org.uk/unfinished/m42_appleby_magna_to_nottingham/maps/M42 - Appleby Magna - Nottingham (maps)]. Jukes, Steven. Pathetic Motorways.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the road number==

The current road is the second incarnation of the A42.  The original (1923) route was [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to [[Birmingham]] via [[Oxford]].  The whole road disappeared in 1935 - the section from Reading to [[Shillingford]] became part of the [[A329 road|A329]], Shillingford to Oxford became part of the [[A423 road|A423]] and Oxford to Birmingham became part of the [[A34 road (England)|A34]]. In 1993 the A423 was itself renumbered, with the section formerly the A42 becoming part of the [[A4074 road|A4074]] from Reading to Oxford. The modern [[M42 motorway|M42]] does interchange with the former A42 at junction 4 near [[Solihull]]: Stratford Road now being numbered A34 to the north of the junction and A3400 to the south.

'''Abell 2744''', nicknamed '''Pandora's Cluster''', is a giant [[galaxy cluster]] resulting from the simultaneous pile-up of at least four separate, smaller galaxy clusters that took place over a span of 350 million years.&lt;ref name="HubbleSite" /&gt; The [[Galaxy|galaxies]] in the cluster make up less than five percent of its mass.&lt;ref name="HubbleSite" /&gt; The gas (around 20&amp;nbsp;percent) is so hot that it shines only in [[X-rays]].&lt;ref name="HubbleSite" /&gt; [[Dark matter]] makes up around 75&amp;nbsp;percent of the cluster's mass.&lt;ref name="HubbleSite" /&gt;

This cluster also shows a [[radio halo]] along with several other [[List of Abell clusters|Abell clusters]]. It has a strong central halo, along with an extended tail, which could either be relic radiation, or an extension of the central halo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0101418 |title=A Comparison of Radio and X-Ray Morphologies of Four Clusters of Galaxies Containing Radio Halos  |first1=F. |last1=Govoni |first2=T.

Renato Dupke, a member of the team that discovered the Cluster, explained the origin of the name in an interview: "We nicknamed it ‘''Pandora's Cluster''’ because so many different and strange phenomena were unleashed by the collision."&lt;ref&gt;Renato Dupke quoted at [http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1111/ Pandora's Cluster - a galactic crash investigation] Press release of 22 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; on affective haptics and real-time communication system with rich emotional and haptic channels. Driven by the motivation to enhance social interactivity and emotionally immersive experience of users of real-time messaging, virtual, augmented realities, the idea of reinforcing (intensifying) own feelings and reproducing (simulating) the emotions felt by the partner was proposed.
Four basic haptic (tactile) channels governing our emotions can be distinguished: (1) physiological changes (e.g., heart beat rate, body temperature, etc.), (2) physical stimulation (e.g., tickling), (3) social touch (e.g., hug, handshake), (4) emotional haptic design (e.g., shape of device, material, texture).

&lt;/ref&gt; the conscious experience of emotion occurs after the cortex receives signals about changes in physiological state. Researchers argued that feelings are preceded by certain physiological changes. Thus, when we see a venomous snake, we feel fear, because our cortex has received signals about our racing heart, knocking knees, etc. Damasio&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes primary and secondary emotions. Both involve changes in bodily states, but the secondary emotions are evoked by thoughts. Recent empirical studies support non-cognitive theories of nature of emotions. It was proven that we can easily evoke our emotions by something as simple as changing facial expression (e.g., smile brings on a feeling of happiness).&lt;ref&gt;

== Sense of touch in affective haptics ==

Human emotions can be easily evoked by different cues, and the sense of touch is one of the most emotionally charged channels. Affective haptic devices produce different senses of touch including kinesthetic and coetaneous channels. Kinesthetic stimulations, which are produced by forces exerted on the body, are sensed by mechanoreceptors in the tendons and muscles. On the other hand, mechanoreceptors in the skin layers are responsible for the perception of cutaneous stimulation. Different types of tactile corpuscles allow us sensing thermal property of the object, pressure, vibration frequency, and stimuli location.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce hugging is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by hugging animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while hugging is achieved.

=== Intimate touch ===
Affection goes further than hugging alone. People in long distance relationships are faced with a lack of physical intimacy on a day-to-day basis. Haptic technology allows for kinesthetic and tactile interface design. The field of digital co-presence envelops Teledildonics as well. The Kiiroo SVir is a good example of an Adult CyberToy that incorporates tactile input, by means of a surface that is touch capacitive, and an inside that is kinesthetic in nature. 12 rings contract, pulse and vibrate according to the movements one's partner makes in real time. The SVir mimics the actual motion of its OPue counterpart and is also compatible with other SVir models.
The SVir enables women to have intercourse with their partner through use of the OPue interactive vibrator no matter how great the distance that separates the couple.

=== Implicit emotion elicitation ===
Different types of devices can be used to produce the physiological changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception. HaptiButterfly&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; reproduces “butterflies in your stomach” (the fluttery or tickling feeling felt by people experiencing love) through arrays of vibration motors attached to the user’s abdomen. HaptiShiver&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “shivers up and down your spine” through a row of vibration motors. HaptiTemper&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; sends “chills up and down your spine” through both cold airflow from a fan and the cold side of a Peltier element. HaptiTemper is also intended for simulation of warmth on the human skin to evoke either pleasant feeling or aggression

=== Explicit emotion elicitation ===
HaptiTickler&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; directly evokes joy by tickling the user’s ribs. It includes four vibration motors reproducing stimuli similar to human finger movements

=== Affective (emotional) haptic design. ===
Recent findings show that attractive things make people feel good, which in turn makes them think more creatively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of emotional haptic design was proposed.&lt;ref name="Affective Haptics" /&gt; The core idea is to make user to feel an affinity for the device through:
* appealing shapes evoking the desire to touch and haptically explore them,
* material pleasurable to touch, and
* the anticipation of the pleasure of wearing the device.

=== Affective computing ===
[[Affective computing]] can be used to measure and to recognize emotional information in systems and devises employing affective haptics. Emotional information is extracted by using such techniques as speech recognition, natural language processing, facial expression detection, and measurement of physiological data.

== Potential applications ==
[[Image:iFeelIM.png|thumb|400px | The iFeel_IM! architecture]]
Possible applications are as follows:
* treating depression and anxiety (problematic emotional states),
* controlling and modulating moods on the basis of physiological signals,
* affective and collaborative games,
* psychological testing,
* assistive technology and augmentative communication systems for children with autism.
Affective Haptics is in the vanguard of emotional telepresence,&lt;ref&gt;

The philosophy behind the iFeel_IM! (intelligent system for Feeling enhancement powered by affect sensitive Instant Messenger) is “I feel [therefore] I am!”. In the iFeel_IM! system, great importance is placed on the automatic sensing of emotions conveyed through textual messages in 3D virtual world Second Life (artificial intelligence), the visualization of the detected emotions by avatars in virtual environment, enhancement of user’s affective state, and reproduction of feeling of social touch (e.g., hug) by means of haptic stimulation in a real world. The control of the conversation is implemented through the Second Life object called EmoHeart&lt;ref&gt;

'''Alipogene tiparvovec''' (marketed under the [[trade name]] '''Glybera''') is a [[gene therapy]] treatment designed to reverse [[lipoprotein lipase deficiency]] (LPLD), a rare inherited disorder which can cause severe [[pancreatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/health/european-agency-recommends-approval-of-a-gene-therapy.html European Agency Backs Approval of a Gene Therapy] July 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended it for approval (the first recommendation for a gene therapy treatment in either Europe or the United States), and the recommendation was endorsed by the [[European Commission]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, James.

The drug is administered via a series of injections into the leg muscles—as many as 60, all in one session.&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt; It is a one-time treatment intended to last at least ten years.

Glybera gained infamy as the "million-dollar drug," causing its manufacturer, uniQure, to remove the drug after two years on the European market and just a single patient treated. As of 2018, only 31 people worldwide have ever been administered Glybera, and uniQure has no plans to sell the drug in the US or Canada.&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

==History==
Glybera was developed over a period of decades by researchers at the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crowe |first1=Kelly |title=The million-dollar drug |url=https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/glybera |website=CBC News |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Michael R. Hayden]] and [[John Kastelein]] began research at UBC, confirming the hypothesis that LPLD was caused by a gene mutation. Years later, in 2002, Hayden and Colin Ross successfully performed gene therapy on test mice to treat LPLD; their findings were featured on the September 2004 cover of ''[[Human Gene Therapy]]''. Hayden next succeeded in treating cats in the same manner, with the help of Boyce Jones.&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

===Trials and approval===
Meanwhile, Kastelein—who had, by 1998, become an international expert in lipid disorders—co-founded Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics (AMT), which took over Hayden's research with the aim of releasing the drug in Europe.

Since LPLD is a rare condition (prevalence worldwide 1–2 per million), related clinical tests and trials have involved unusually small cohort sizes. The first main trial (CT-AMT-011-01) involved just 14 subjects,&lt;ref name="StroesNierman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroes|first1=E. S.|last2=Nierman|first2=M. C.|last3=Meulenberg|first3=J.

===Price===
After over two years of testing and lobbying by AMT, Glybera was approved in Europe in 2012.&lt;ref name=MIT-TR2016/&gt; However, after spending millions of euros on Glybera's approval, AMT went bankrupt and its assets were acquired by [[uniQure N.V.]].&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

Alipogene tiparvovec was expected to cost around $1.6 million per treatment in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wall Street Journal | author=Jeanne Whalen  | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203707604578095091940871524 | date=November 2, 2012 | title=Gene-Therapy Approval Marks Major Milestone}}&lt;/ref&gt;—revised to $1 million in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=TradeSecrets | author=Chris Morrison | date= March 3, 2015 | title=$1-million price tag set for Glybera gene therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;—making it the most expensive medicine in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_204696.asp Gene therapy approved in Europe for first time]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[replacement therapy]], a similar treatment, can cost over $300,000 per year, for life.&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

In 2015, uniQure dropped its plans for approval in the US and exclusively licensed rights to sell the drug in Europe to [[Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.|Chiesi Farmaceutici]] for €31 million.&lt;ref name=MIT-TR2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

As of 2016, only one person had been treated with the drug, a German woman.&lt;ref name=MIT-TR2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|title=The World’s Most Expensive Medicine Is a Bust|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601165/the-worlds-most-expensive-medicine-is-a-bust/amp/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=May 4, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Chiesi quit selling Glybera and uniQure announced that it would not pursue the renewal of the marketing authorization in Europe when it was scheduled to expire that October, due to lack of demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sagonowsky|first1=Eric|title=With its launch fizzling out, UniQure gives up on $1M+ gene therapy Glybera|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/uniqure-gives-up-1m-gene-therapy-glybera|work=FiercePharma|date=April 20, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the three remaining doses in Chiesi's inventory were administered to three patients for €1 each.&lt;ref name="cbc-glybera" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
The [[adeno-associated virus]] serotype 1 (AAV1) viral vector delivers an intact copy of the human [[lipoprotein lipase]] (LPL) gene to muscle cells. The LPL gene is not inserted into the cell's chromosomes but remains as free floating DNA in the nucleus.

The '''Allais effect''' is the alleged anomalous behavior of [[pendulums]] or [[gravimeters]] which is sometimes purportedly observed during a [[solar eclipse]]. The effect was first reported as an anomalous [[precession]] of the plane of [[oscillation]] of a [[Foucault pendulum]] during the [[solar eclipse of June 30, 1954]] by [[Maurice Allais]], a [[France|French]] [[polymath]] who went on to win the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]].&lt;ref name="21st CST 2010"&gt;{{cite magazine

==Experimental observations==

Maurice Allais emphasized the "dynamic character" of the effects he observed:&lt;ref name="Allais NASA"&gt;{{cite report
 |last1=Allais |first1=Maurice
 |title=The 'Allais Effect' and my experiments with the paraconical pendulum (1954-1960)

 |format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote
 |The observed effects are only seen when the pendulum is moving. They are not connected with the intensity of weight (gravimetry), but with the ''variation of weight'' (or of inertia) ''in the space swept by the pendulum''. Actually, while the movement of the plane of oscillation of the pendulum is ''inexplicable'' by the theory of gravitation, the deviations from the vertical are ''explained perfectly'' by that theory. The deviations from the vertical […] correspond to a ''static'' phenomenon, while my experiments correspond to a ''dynamic'' phenomenon.
}}

Besides Allais' own experiments, related research about a possible effect of [[the Moon]]'s shielding, absorption or bending of the [[Sun]]'s [[gravitational field]] during a solar eclipse have been conducted by scientists around the world. Some observations have yielded positive results, seemingly confirming that minute but detectable variations in the expected behavior of devices dependent on gravity do indeed occur within the [[umbra]] of an eclipse, but others have failed to detect any noticeable effect.

===Anomalous results===

Romanian physicist Gheorghe Jeverdan ''et al.'' observed the Allais effect and the so-called ''Jeverdan-Rusu-Antonescu effect'' or ''Jeverdan effect'' (i.e. the change in the oscillation period of a pendulum during an eclipse) while monitoring a Foucault pendulum during the [[solar eclipse of February 15, 1961]]. The authors made two hypotheses regarding their observation: during an eclipse, the Moon exerts a screening effect on the [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] of the Sun so that the attraction of the Earth is indirectly increased, a phenomenon that could also be studied with [[tide]]s. If the hypothesis of the screening effect is wrong, another explanation could be that the variation of the [[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] might be considered as a result of the [[diffraction]] of [[gravitational wave]]s.&lt;ref name="Jeverdan 1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeverdan|first1=G.

Dr. Leonid Savrov of the [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]] built a dedicated paraconical pendulum to test the Allais effect during the [[solar eclipse of July 11, 1991]] in Mexico and the [[Solar eclipse of November 3, 1994|eclipse of November 3, 1994]] in Brazil. While he could not observe Allais' claim that there is a diurnal periodicity in the motion of a paraconical pendulum, he did, however, write: "The most interesting result of the Mexico and Brazil experiments is the increase of rotational velocity of the pendulum oscillation plane in the direction of the Foucault effect during the eclipse. It seems that we have some kind of special effect."&lt;ref name="Savrov 1995 A"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savrov|first1=L. A.|last2=Yushkin|first2=V.

Various other experiments using [[atomic clock]]s and [[gravimeter]]s instead of pendulums also recorded significant anomalous gravitational effects which can neither be caused by a tidal effect or drift of the gravimeters, nor by high-frequency noise which has special patterns. These experiments were set up by different teams during solar eclipses in [[Solar eclipse of December 24, 1992|China in 1992]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = S.

Dutch physicist Chris Duif, who surveys the field of gravitational anomalies in general, concludes that the question remains open because Allais observations do not satisfy conventional explanations, and that such investigations should be pursued, in view of their relatively inexpensive nature and the enormous implications if genuine anomalies are actually confirmed, but the article was self-published and has not undergone any [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="Duif 2004"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Duif|first1=Chris P.|title=A review of conventional explanations of anomalous observations during solar eclipses|date=9 August 2004|eprint=gr-qc/0408023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total [[solar eclipse of August 11, 1999]] had been a good opportunity to solve a 45-year mystery, thanks to an international collaboration. [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] first inquired about experimental protocols to Maurice Allais,&lt;ref name="Allais NASA" /&gt; in order to coordinate ahead of the event a worldwide effort to test the Allais effect between observatories and universities over seven countries ([[US|United States]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]], [[England]] and four sites in the [[United Arab Emirates]]). The lead supervisor then stated: "The initial interpretation of the record points to three possibilities: a systematic error, a local effect, or the unexplored. To eliminate the first two possibilities, we and several other observers will use different kinds of measuring instruments in a distributed global network of observing stations."&lt;ref name="NASA 1999 A"&gt;{{cite web

Further observations conducted by the team led by [[Xin-She Yang]] appear to have yielded much weaker evidence of anomalies than their first 1997 study.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible yet controversial explanation was finally proposed by the same author and [[Tom Van Flandern]] which conjectured that the anomaly is due to the gravitational effect of an increased air density spot in the upper atmosphere created by cooling winds during the solar eclipse. They conclude there have been "no unambiguous detections &lt;nowiki&gt;[of an Allais effect]&lt;/nowiki&gt; within the past 30 years when consciousness of the importance of &lt;nowiki&gt;[experimental]&lt;/nowiki&gt; controls was more widespread." They point out that "the gravitation anomaly discussed here is about a factor of 100,000 too small to explain the Allais excess pendulum precession […] during eclipses" and from this conclude that the original Allais anomaly was merely due to poor controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Flandern|first1=T.|last2=Yang|first2=X.

==Aether hypothesis==
{{main|Luminiferous aether|Aether drag hypothesis}}

Maurice Allais states that the eclipse effect is related to a gravitational anomaly that is inexplicable in the framework of the currently admitted [[Gravity|theory of gravitation]], without giving any explanation of his own.&lt;ref name="Allais' book 1997" /&gt; Allais' explanation for another anomaly (the [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] periodicity in variations of the [[azimuth]] of a pendulum) is that space evinces certain [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] characteristics, which he ascribes to motion through an [[luminiferous aether|aether]] which is partially entrained by planetary bodies.

His hypothesis leads to a [[speed of light]] dependent on the moving direction with respect to a terrestrial observer, since the Earth moves within the aether but the rotation of the Moon induces a "wind" of about 8&amp;nbsp;km/s. Thus Allais rejects [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s interpretation of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] and the subsequent verification experiments of [[Dayton Miller]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the Michelson–Morley experiment did not give a zero speed difference, but at most 8&amp;nbsp;km/s, without being able to detect any regularity. This difference was therefore interpreted as due to measurement uncertainties. Similarly, Miller's experiments corroborated these results over a long period of time, but Miller could not explain the source of the irregularities. At the time, temperature problems were invoked to explain the cause, as concluded by [[Robert S. Shankland]].&lt;ref name="Shankland"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By re-analyzing the data from this experiment, Allais reported a [[Periodic function|periodicity]] using [[sidereal time]] rather than [[civil time]] used by Miller (daytime sidereal variation of the speed of light over a period of 23 hours 56 minutes with an amplitude of about 8&amp;nbsp;km/s).&lt;ref name="Miller reanalyzed"&gt;{{cite web

 |url=http://www.fondationmauriceallais.org/the-physicist/the-re-examination-of-millers-interferometric-observations-and-of-esclangons-observations/?lang=en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the [[Titius–Bode law]] to the Earth–Moon system, which he generalizes to aether, Allais calculates a "wind" of 7.95&amp;nbsp;km/s, which is comparable to the values found by the experiments of Michelson and Miller. Hence Allais deduces that the aether turns with the stars, as proposed by the [[aether drag hypothesis]], and is not fixed as [[Hendrik Lorentz]] thought when inventing his famous [[Lorentz transformation|transformation]] and his [[Lorentz ether theory|ether theory]]. But the majority of scientists at the end of the 19th century imagined that such an aether crossed the Earth so that the rotation of the Earth around the Sun would cause an important variation of 30&amp;nbsp;km/s. Consequently, since the third postulate on which [[special relativity]] is based is the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum, Allais considers it unfounded. In order to measure a change in the speed of light, one would have to get back to the definition of the [[History of the metre#Krypton standard|1960 meter]], since confidence in the [[theory of relativity]] nowadays is such that current [[metrology]] uses constancy of the speed of light as an [[axiom]].

Allais summarized his experimental work in English in his 1999 memoir on behalf of NASA.&lt;ref name="Allais NASA" /&gt; He detailed his aether hypothesis in the books ''L'Anisotropie de l'Espace'', published in 1997,&lt;ref name="Allais' book 1997"&gt;{{ cite book

''Malaria: Genetic and Evolutionary Aspects.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26248">'''Cognitive specialization''' suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an [[adaptive]] purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival.  Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of [[language]], [[theory of mind]], and specific social skills such as [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]]. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with [[autism spectrum disorder]] or who lack language abilities.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995"&gt;Povinelli D., Preuss T (1995). Theory of mind: evolutionary history of a cognitive specialization, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 18, Issue 9, Pages 418–424, ISSN 0166-2236, doi:10.1016/0166-2236(95)93939-U. {{PMID|7482808}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as [[self-awareness]], [[navigation]], and problem solving skills in several animal species such as [[chimpanzees]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]].

== Background ==
First studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans,&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their [[habitats]]; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]], which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes,&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z., &amp; Cantlon, J. F. (2011). The specialization of function: Cognitive and neural perspectives. Cognitive neuropsychology, 28(3–4), 147–155. doi:10.1080/02643294.2011.633504 {{PMID|22185234}}&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the [[neocortex]] unique to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1994). The language instinct: The new science of language and mind (Vol. 7529). Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in [[foraging]] behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A.

== Social behavior ==
Social communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., Cosmides, L., &amp; Price, M. E. (2006). Cognitive adaptations for n‐person exchange: the evolutionary roots of organizational behavior. Managerial and Decision Economics, 27(2–3), 103–129. {{PMID|23814325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, S. (2006). Cognition at the heart of human interaction. Discourse Studies, 8(1), 85–93&lt;/ref&gt; Some social behaviors, such as helping and [[wikt:altruism|altruism]], are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, H. C., Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (2010) Coevolution of cooperation, causal cognition and mindreading. Communicative &amp; integrative biology, 3(6), 522–4. {{PMID|21331228}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] argue that the human mind contains "specialized mechanisms" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992"&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive adaptations for social exchange. The adapted mind, 163–228. doi: 10.1073/pnas.122352999&lt;/ref&gt; Without this specialized "[[algorithm]]",&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including "cheater detection" and "precautionary reasoning," both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, V. E., Cosmides, L., Tooby, J., Kroll, N., &amp; Knight, R. T. (2002) Selective impairment of reasoning about social exchange in a patient with bilateral limbic system damage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11531–11536. doi  10.1073/pnas.122352699 {{PMID|12177408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults,&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Prince, C. G., &amp; Preuss, T. M. (2005). Parent-Offspring Conﬂict and the Development of Social Understanding. The Innate Mind: Structure and Contents: Structure and Contents, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; across cultures,&lt;ref name="Shiw"&gt;Sugiyama, L. S., Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (2002). Cross-cultural evidence of cognitive adaptations for social exchange among the Shiwiar of Ecuadorian Amazonia. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(17), 11537–11542. doi 10.1073/pnas.122352999 {{PMID|12177409}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[neuropsychiatric]] populations.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

=== Evidence for universality ===
If social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides  investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon.&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were "as highly proficient" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt; This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social "algorithms" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.&lt;ref name="Cosmides Tooby 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiw" /&gt;

== Theory of mind ==
[[Theory of mind]], or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C.M. (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101-114. doi 10.1017/s0140525x98000703 {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jellema, T., Baker, C. I., Wicker, B., &amp; Perrett, D. I. (2000). Neural representation for the perception of the intentionality of actions. Brain and cognition, 44(2), 280–302. doi 10.1006/brcg.2000.1231 {{PMID|11041992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between [[Vagrancy (biology)|accidental]] and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own.&lt;ref name ="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, H. M., Cross, D., &amp; Watson, J. (2001). Meta‐analysis of theory‐of‐mind development: the truth about false belief. Child development, 72(3), 655–684. {{PMID|11405571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind research in [[chimpanzees]] by social psychologists [[David Premack]] and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Premack, D., and Woodruff, G. (1978). Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind? Behav. Sci. 4: 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of [[cooperation]] and interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S. (1999). How the mind works. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 882(1), 119–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In autism ===
Theory of mind appears to be lacking in children with [[autism| autism spectrum disorders]], and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a [[developmental delay]] in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, "putting oneself in another person's shoes") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large [[social groups]]. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of [[human evolution]]: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt;

== Language ==
Though some (including Bates et al.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Thal, D., &amp; Marchman, V. (1991). Symbols and syntax: A Darwinian approach to language development. Biological and behavioral determinants of language development, 29, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). Language as an adaptation to the cognitive niche. STUDIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF LANGUAGE, 3, 16–37.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, [[Steven Pinker]] argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and [[ontogeny]] of language. Pinker also uses the [[double dissociation]] between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]] but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt; Using language "multiplies the benefit of knowledge" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.&lt;ref name="Pink" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
Arbib puts forth a hypothesis that [[mirror neurons]] in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="Arbib"&gt;Arbib, M. A. (2005). From monkey-like action recognition to human language: An evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 28(02), 105–124 {{PMID|16201457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without these neurons in [[Broca's area]] in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities.&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative [[gestures]] (such as threat gestures and "food begs" among [[baboons]]) established a foundation on which to build human language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Meguerditchian, A., &amp; Vauclair, J. (2009). Contrast of hand preferences between communicative gestures and non-communicative actions in baboons: Implications for the origins of hemispheric specialization for language. Brain and language, 108(3), 167–174. {{PMID|19091390}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a [[hunting|hunt]], but recent research has focused on [[ecological]] theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a "social [[arms race]]" against non-human primates.&lt;ref name = Flinn&gt;Flinn, M. V., Geary, D. C., &amp; Ward, C. V. (2005). Ecological dominance, social competition, and coalitionary arms races: Why humans evolved extraordinary intelligence. Evolution and Human Behavior, 26(1), 10–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful "intermediary stages," human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, [[syntax]]) can be spared in [[amnesia]], while other abilities (like [[memory]] retention) are drastically reduced.&lt;ref name="Fer"&gt;Ferreira, V. S., Bock, K., Wilson, M. P., &amp; Cohen, N. J. (2008). Memory for syntax despite amnesia. Psychological science, 19(9), 940–946. {{PMID|18947361}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.&lt;ref name="Fer" /&gt;

=== Universal Grammar ===
Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed a biological component of language, which he termed [[Universal Grammar]].&lt;ref name="Chom"&gt;Chomsky, N. (1972). Language and mind (p. 100). New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the [[poverty of the stimulus]] argument).&lt;ref name="Chom" /&gt;  All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species.&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Hauser; Noam Chomsky; W. Tecumseh Fitch (November 22, 2002). "The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has It, and How Did It Evolve?". Science 298 (5598): 1569–1579. doi 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569. {{PMID|12446899}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a "pre-existing cognitive specialization":&lt;ref name="Jack"&gt;Jackendoff, R. (2001). Language in the ecology of mind. The Routledge companion to semiotics and linguistics, 52–65.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having [[vocabulary]] and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be [[genetically]] pre-disposed to ''learn'' language.&lt;ref name="Jack" /&gt; Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains,&lt;ref name="Arbib" /&gt; the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hinzen, Wolfram (September 2012). "The philosophical significance of Universal Grammar". Language Sciences 34 (5): 635–649. doi:10.1016/j.langsci.2012.03.005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
According to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;Nowak, M. A., &amp; Sigmund, K. (2005). Evolution of indirect reciprocity. Nature, 437(7063), 1291–1298 {{PMID|16251955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt; Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. [[Gossip]], viewed by many &lt;ref name="gossip"&gt;Miller, G. (2011). The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature. Random House LLC. doi:10.1525/aa.2001.103.4.1196&lt;/ref&gt; to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter [[wikt:illicit|illicit]] behaviors.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' [[social standing]], it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language.&lt;ref name="gossip" /&gt; Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), [[linguists]] argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.&lt;ref name="NS" /&gt;

== Other possible specializations ==
Watson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent [[humor]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, K. K., Matthews, B. J., &amp; Allman, J. M. (2007). Brain activation during sight gags and language-dependent humor. Cerebral Cortex, 17(2), 314–324. {{PMID|16514105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[adaptive]] value has both [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Frey, S. H. (2003). What's so special about human tool use?. Neuron, 39(2), 201–204. doi:10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00424-0 {{PMID|12873378}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced [[motor skill|sensorimotor]] skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in [[motor areas]] of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more [[philosophical]] level, Boyer (2003) argues that "[[religious]] thought and behavior" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, P. (2003). Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function. Trends in cognitive sciences, 7(3), 119–124. {{PMID|12639693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, F., McCabe, K., Moll, J., Kriegeskorte, N., Zahn, R., Strenziok, M., &amp; Grafman, J. (2007). Neural correlates of trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104(50), 20084–20089. doi 10.1073/pnas.0710103104 {{PMID|18056800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-human specialization ==

=== In non-human primates ===
Humankind’s closest ancestors, the [[great apes]], have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: [[orangutans]] are specialists at climbing trees, while [[chimpanzees]] and [[gorillas]] have evolved to walk on their knuckles.&lt;ref name="Povinelli 1995" /&gt; However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the "profound continuity" [[Charles Darwin]] noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a "profound discontinuity" between human and non-human animal minds.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, D. C., Holyoak, K. J., &amp; Povinelli, D. J. (2008). Darwin's mistake: Explaining the discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 31(02), 109–130. {{PMID|18479531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the "[[mirror test]]").&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Heyes (1998). Theory of mind in nonhuman primates. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, pp 101–114. {{PMID|10097012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development.&lt;ref&gt;Povinelli, D. J., Eddy, T. J., Hobson, R. P., &amp; Tomasello, M. (1996). What young chimpanzees know about seeing. Monographs of the society for research in child development, i–189. doi 10.2307/1166159 {{PMID|8795292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rhesus monkeys]] have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, R. R. (2001). Rhesus monkeys know when they remember. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 98(9), 5359–5362. doi 10.1073/pnas.071600998 {{PMID|11274360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other animals ===
More recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in [[primates]]: domesticated [[dogs]] may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Hare, B., Tomasello, M. (2005) Human-like social skills in dogs?, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Volume 9, Issue 9, pages 439–444, ISSN 1364-6613 {{PMID|16061417}} doi 10.1016/j.tics.2005.07.003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]] have also been shown to pass the "mirror test" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the [[Animal|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Marten, K. &amp; Psarakos, S. (1995). "Evidence of self-awareness in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)". In Parker, S.T., Mitchell, R. &amp; Boccia, M. Self-awareness in Animals and Humans: Developmental Perspectives.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 103 (45): 17053–17057. doi 10.1073/pnas.0608062103 {{PMID|19514017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ants, bees, and other insects have also evolved behaviors consistent with various specializations, including advanced [[navigational]] skills and several basic social communication abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Toth, A. Robinson, G. (2007). Evo-devo and the evolution of social behavior, Trends in Genetics, Volume 23, Issue 7, pages 334–341, ISSN 0168-9525 {{PMID|17509723}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptive cognitive evolution has been examined in [[pigeons]]' ability to group objects (which is argued to support their processing of and adaptation to novel environments),&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, J.

'''Congelation ice''' is [[ice]] that forms on the bottom of an established ice cover.

== Seawater ==
{{see also|sea ice#Formation of sea ice|l1=Formation of sea ice}}
On [[seawater]], congelation ice is ice that forms on the bottom of an established [[sea ice]] cover, usually in the form of platelets which coalesce to form solid ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/~eicken/he_teach/GEOS615icenom/form/types.html Sea Ice Types, Sea Ice Geophysics, University of Alaska]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/formation.html National Snow and Ice Data Center: All About Sea Ice: Ice Formation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230162634/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/formation.html |date=2009-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the water freezes to ice, the salt from the seawater is concentrated into [[brine]], some of which is contained in pockets in the new ice. Due to the brine pockets, congelation ice on seawater is neither as hard nor as transparent as fresh water ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/brine_salinity.html National Snow and Ice Data Center: All About Sea Ice: Salinity and Brine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218093622/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/brine_salinity.html |date=2009-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fresh water ==

On the surface of  lakes, or other bodies of still [[freshwater]], ''congelation ice'' is often called ''black Ice''. This ice has frozen without many air bubbles trapped inside, making it [[transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Its transparency reveals the colour, usually black, of the water beneath it, hence the name. This is in contrast to ''snow ice'', sometimes called ''slush ice'', which is formed when  [[slush]] (water saturated snow) refreezes. Snow ice is white  due to the presence of air bubbles.

Black ice grows downward from the bottom of the existing ice surface. The growth rate of the ice is proportional to the rate that heat is transferred from the water below the ice surface to the air above the ice surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gi.alaska.edu/alison/ALISON_SCIENCE_Lake.html LAKE ICE, from Alaska Lake Ice and Snow Observation Network]&lt;/ref&gt; The total ice thickness can be approximated from [[Stefan's equation]].

Black ice is very hard, strong and smooth, which makes it ideal for [[ice skating]], [[skate sailing]], [[ice yachting]] and some other ice sports.

Thin, clear ice also has [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties which are useful to [[Tour skating|tour skaters]]. Skating on clear ice radiates a tone whose [[frequency]] depends on the thickness of the ice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acuvib.com/ice.html  The Acoustics of Thin Ice, by Gunnar Lundmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103012/http://www.acuvib.com/ice.html |date=2008-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Danger Room''' is a fictional training facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutanthigh.com/tech/dangerroom.jpg |title=Danger Room and 2nd Sub-Basement |publisher=Mutanthigh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017044154/http://www.mutanthigh.com/tech/dangerroom.jpg |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The facility is depicted as built for the [[X-Men]] as part of the various incarnations of the [[X-Mansion]].

==Publication history==
An obstacle course in which the X-Men train appears in ''The X-Men'' #1 (September 1963), but the Danger Room is never mentioned by name. The name "Danger Room" is first used in ''The X-Men'' #2 (November 1963). According to X-Men writer/editor/co-creator [[Stan Lee]], "the Danger Room was [[Jack Kirby]]'s idea. I thought it was great because we could always open with an action sequence if we needed to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | authorlink2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early designs==
[[File:X-Men1DangerRoom.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Panel from ''The X-Men'' #1 (Sept. 1963) showing [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] training. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
In the early books it was filled with traps, projectile firing devices, flamethrowers, and mechanical dangers such as presses, collapsing walls and the like intended to challenge the trainee. Meanwhile, an observer is in the overhanging control booth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutanthigh.com/tech/dangerroom2.jpg |title=Danger Room Control Hub |publisher=Mutanthigh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002036/http://www.mutanthigh.com/tech/dangerroom2.jpg |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; managing the room's mechanisms to oversee the exercise while manually ensuring the subject's safety. Later the Danger Room was upgraded with machines and robots for the X-Men to fight against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/mutantagenda/07.jpg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022155850/http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/episode/mutantagenda/07.jpg|title=[episode screen shot]|archive-date=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After befriending the [[Shi'ar]] the X-Men rebuilt the Danger Room with Shi'ar hard-light [[holographic]] technology. These upgrades were largely added by Dr. Hank McCoy (''[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]''). The Danger Room is located in the X-Mansion; every destruction of the latter led to a rebuilding, and usually upgrading, of the Danger Room. The training facility has endured extensive damage over the years, usually from X-Men training or X-Men going rogue, as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] did during The [[Muir Island Saga]]. [[Supervillains]] have dealt critical damage to it as well as taking over the facility, especially [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. The security and safety protocols that ensure the safety of anyone using the Danger Room have frequently been disrupted, tampered with by villains, failed, or have been completely negated in all the years of its use, each time happening more frequently as the room began to get more and more upgraded.

It is suggested in the ''X-Men Official Guide'' that the objects in the Danger Room are holograms surrounded by force fields, supposedly confirmed in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' when a student managed to kill himself by jumping from a holographic cliff face. It is also revealed that the Danger Room can display holograms in only [[color depth|32-bit color]].

}}

===Gaining self-awareness===
In [[Joss Whedon]]'s ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', the Danger Room developed [[self-awareness]]. It is mentioned by Wolverine as 'acting twitchy all semester.' The first thing it does is convince Wing, who has recently been depowered by Ord's cure, to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #7&lt;/ref&gt; The next thing it does is take control of an old, broken Sentinel robot and knock out all the psychics within the X-Mansion. During the Sentinel's attack, Cyclops orders Shadowcat and the students to go hide in the Danger Room for safety. While there, they find the corpse of Wing. The Danger Room reanimates the corpse and attacks the students.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Wing, there are no additional fatalities among the students. After being freed from its prison, it takes the form of a woman. She is dubbed '''Danger''' and attacks the X-Men. After defeating them, she travels to [[Genosha]] to kill [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]].&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #10&lt;/ref&gt;

Xavier was revealed to have known of the Danger Room's sentience and chosen not to reveal it, much to the dismay of the X-Men who seem to view this deception as taking on one of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto's]] former ideals.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} During the battle on Genosha, she takes control of Cassandra Nova's second Wild Sentinel and engages Beast in a vicious and brutal fight while the other X-Men take on the Wild Sentinel. After Beast destroys her body, "Danger's" consciousness was presumed to still exist within the conflicted consciousness of the Wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ord and the Breakworld===
Later, Danger reappears in a new humanoid form, similar to her previous one, in which she infiltrated [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] headquarters to speak with [[Ord (comics)|Ord of the Breakworld]] and offer her assistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #15&lt;/ref&gt;

Danger and Ord both ended up on Breakworld, along with the X-Men and S.W.O.R.D., and after the robot encountered [[Emma Frost]] and an unconscious [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], Emma told the robot that despite its supposed enmity it has let the mutants live too often, meaning it hasn't overcome its parent programming, so it cannot kill any mutant. Cyclops recovers, and Emma tells Danger to help the X-Men in Breakworld, and in exchange, it will be given Professor Xavier. Danger later attacks some of Breakworld's inhabitants and sides with the X-Men and S.W.O.R.D.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #21-24, Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge===
After the Breakworld incident, S.W.O.R.D. takes Danger into custody. When the S.W.O.R.D. headquarters is destroyed during [[Secret Invasion]], Danger escapes and goes to Australia, taking on the form of an anthropologist from [[Melbourne University]]. She approaches [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in her disguise but is targeted by a low flying [[Shi'ar]] salvage spacecraft, where she reveals who she really is and that she is going to use Rogue as a conduit so she can get her revenge on Professor Xavier.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #220&lt;/ref&gt;

After being damaged by the crew, she warps the entire area with her holographic projections of past moments within Rogue's life as well as other famous moments from the X-Men's history.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #221-222&lt;/ref&gt; Xavier confronts Danger and she reveals she intended to make Rogue absorb all his powers and memories permanently, leaving him crippled and useless. Xavier reveals that when she first said ''Where am I?'', he consulted her Shi'ar makers who assured him it was not possible she could have gained self-awareness and that he had no way of knowing what she was or would become. He tried to free her but because she was really billions of lines of machine code, he didn't know which lines to erase without lobotomizing her. Because of not knowing what she was capable of, if he had freed her, she might have killed his X-Men because she had the knowledge and power, so instead he did nothing and watched her suffer. Xavier ends her suffering by repairing her. She then sides with Xavier, Rogue, and Gambit and takes out the Shi'ar salvage crew. Afterwards, with Xavier, she helps Rogue gain full control over her powers.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #223-224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopia===
Danger joins Rogue and Gambit to help the X-Men settle the unrest in San Francisco. She saves a child who mistakes her for a [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformer]]. She comes to aid Rogue and Gambit during a fight with [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] and later departs with them to find Trance and any other students still out during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #226&lt;/ref&gt; After locating Trance, they are attacked by [[Moonstone (comics)|Ms. Marvel]] who manages to seriously damage her shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy'' #227&lt;/ref&gt;

After the events of Utopia, Danger is seen being repaired by [[Madison Jeffries]] when they are attacked by [[Emplate]]. Danger tries to defend Madison only to be further damaged by Emplate. After being repaired, at the request of Cyclops, she informs the inhabitants of Utopia who Emplate is and his history.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Legacy Annual'' #1 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; She works alongside Madison, Rogue and the X-Club on erasing Legion's many personalities,&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #5&lt;/ref&gt; and is offered the position of warden of Utopia by Emma Frost, which she accepts because it also allows her to study the best and the worst of what humanity has to offer.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #515&lt;/ref&gt; Danger's first job was to interrogate [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], who was forced into bringing five [[Predator X (comics)|Predator Xs]] to Utopia.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #517&lt;/ref&gt; Armor confronts Danger, due to her being responsible for Wing's death. The get into a tussle. Danger was able to discover Armor's weakness and insists that they talk. Armor angrily expresses to Danger that her presence with the X-Men pisses on Wing's memory. Danger tells Armor, that she constantly reboots herself, but can't wipe out Wing's image in her memory. Armor is surprised that Danger can experience feelings of guilt, and she proceeds to tell her about Wing.

===Necrosha===
As warden of Utopia, some of the prisoners she guards include [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and [[Donald Pierce]]. She uses her Virtual Reality technology in an attempt to rehabilitate them.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #515&lt;/ref&gt; During the invasion from Selene's forces, she detects an energy source, but then malfunctions and crashes. Then, [[Shinobi Shaw]] and [[Harry Leland]], who have been resurrected by the [[techno-organic virus|T-O virus]], appear, ready to kill Shaw for preventing [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s ascent to godhood.&lt;ref&gt;''Necrosha One-shot''&lt;/ref&gt; However, Danger is able to adapt to the mass increase and severed Shinobi's hand before he could kill his father.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Force'' vol.3 #21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Coming===
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Danger appears to have been compromised as she is not aware that Donald Pierce has free rein to sabotage Utopia's defenses.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Wolverine and the X-Men===
Beast rebuilds the Westchester School at the behest of Wolverine at the aftermath of the Schism event. Built on the ruins of the previous Xavier Institute, the school is rechristened the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and is built with state of the art Shi'ar Technology, gifted to him by the current Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire Gladiator (Kallark) whose son Kid Gladiator is enrolled (presumably to learn control over his vast powers.) The school incorporates a decentralized Danger Room that is integrated into the entire building itself instead of just one room. This is seen in the first issue of Wolverine and the X-Men when hidden defense weapons are activated in the boys' bathroom. Whether the danger room's holographic functions are fitted throughout the school as well remains to be seen.

===All-New X-Factor===
Danger reappears in the ''[[All-New X-Factor]]'' series. She appears as a prisoner of a member of the Thieves Guild, which Gambit is running, and when he discovers this, he orders her freed. After restoring her memory which was lost due to the imprisonment, he invites her to join the new X-Factor team.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New X-Factor'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Men: Blue===
Danger appears in the form of the Blackbird jet plane and is used as the main transport for the original time-displaced X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Blue'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Danger takes Jean Grey and [[Jimmy Hudson]] to a prison stronghold to rescue their captured teammates. During the ensuing battle, she reveals her true form and projects holograms of the adult X-Men to keep the guards occupied.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Blue #8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As Danger gained self-awareness and adopted a more humanoid appearance, she has shown enhanced strength and durability, create hard-light holographic projections that can affect entire areas, energy blasts, flight, the ability to rebuild herself after her body is destroyed (at one point even rebuilding herself with butterfly-like wings which are soon destroyed by Beast) and control over other machines. She is able to bring other machines into self-awareness and upload herself into other machines to build and operate new bodies.  She also possesses more detailed knowledge of the X-Men and their combat skills than any other source, having trained against them as the Danger Room.

==Danger Cave==
With the Danger Room gone, the X-Men have resorted to using the empty room to train with their students. Also, the student [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]], using the borrowed knowledge from several X-Men, built a "Danger Cave" underneath the X-Mansion that is a giant stone room with a large metal circle control center.

The Danger Cave is similar to the Danger Room, but what makes the Danger Cave unique is that it uses holograms to train the students by re-enacting renowned battles the X-Men were involved in, like Inferno, Broodworld, Planet X, or Onslaught, even going so far as to dress the participants up in what the X-Men wore at that time.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
The Danger Room equivalent in the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality was the Killing Zone. The facility was located in Mount Wundagore&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and was apparently destroyed by [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Nemesis]]. Later, it was [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] who replaced the Danger Room and acted as a one-woman training facility for the fully fledged X-Men.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] from the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe also have a Danger Room with similar technology, including smaller holographic training rooms in the hidden [[safehouse]]s prepared by [[Professor X]]. However, these are prone to malfunctions, such as a fight sequence producing [[Hasidic]] [[rabbi]]s instead of [[ninja]]s (though to no less of an effect towards the latter intent).{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

* The Danger Room appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series. It should also be noted that [[Master Mold]]'s characterization (voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]) has elements of Danger.

===Film===
* The Danger Room was supposed to appear in the 2000 film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', but it was deleted.
* The Danger Room was alluded in the 2003 film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''. there is a brief scene where a room saying "Danger" can be seen. The room was to make an appearance in which Wolverine would do an exercise, but after construction began on the site, the idea was quickly scrapped due to budget concerns. 
* The Danger Room makes its first true appearance in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' where the team has a training exercise against a holographic [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], among other threats in the [[Days of Future Past]] storyline. In the film, the Danger Room slightly resembles the [[Holodeck]] from ''[[Star Trek]]''. 
* The room's existence is foreshadowed in the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' when Charles Xavier uses a nuclear bunker designed by his father to help [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] learn how to control his own powers. 
* In the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the Danger Room is featured as a training ground for the new X-Men team.

===Video games===
* The Danger Room, out of control, was the basis for all but the last level of the first Sega Genesis console's ''[[X-Men (1993 video game)|X-Men]]'' video game.
* The Danger Room is Cyclops' stage in the arcade and console-imported game ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]''. The holographic backdrops change occasionally, and Professor X is in the background. The stage music is also called 'Danger Room' on the game's official soundtrack.
* In both ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' and ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', the Danger Room is used by the X-Men (and the Brotherhood of Mutants in ''Legends II'') for training and gaining levels, items, new powers, and rare character exclusive equipment.
* The Danger Room appears as the training stage in the 2011 fighting game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.

===Pinball machines===
* The Danger Room and Danger are featured as a wizard mode in Stern's X-Men Pinball machines.

==Characteristics==
Both species, ''Dehalococcoides ethenogenes'' and ''Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens'' are irregular [[coccus]] (coccoid) bacteria capable of [[Dehalogenation|dehalogenating]] polychlorinated aliphatic alkanes and alkenes, such as [[tetrachloroethene]], [[trichloropropane]], [[trichloroethane]], [[dichloropropane]], and [[dichloroethane]].&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maymo-Gatell X, Chien Y, Gossett JM, Zinder SH | year = 1997 | title = Isolation of a bacterium that reductively dechlorinates tetrachloroethene to ethene | journal =  Science  | volume =  276 | pages = 1568&amp;ndash;1571 | pmid = 9171062 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5318.1568 | issue = 5318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the features of the members of the phylum [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] is the unusual [[cell wall|cell wall structure]], which is [[monoderm]] but with great variation in presence or structure of the [[peptidoglycan]] resulting in many members staining [[Gram-negative]] and other [[Gram-positive]].&lt;ref name=Bergey&gt;&lt;!--REF COPY PASTE FROM Talk:Bergey%27s_Manual_of_Systematic_Bacteriology--&gt;{{cite book |series=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology|volume=2A|title=Introductory Essays|editor=George M.

As a DEW line base, it was disbanded in years 1990/1991.&lt;ref name=DEW/&gt;

An [[ice core]] is a [[core sample]] from the accumulation of snow and ice that has re-crystallized and trapped air bubbles over many years. The composition of these ice cores, especially the presence of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, provides a picture of the climate at the time. Ice cores contain an abundance of climate information.

Inclusions in the snow, such as wind-blown dust, ash, bubbles of atmospheric gas and radioactive substances, remain in the ice. The variety of climatic [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]] is greater than in any other natural recorder of climate, such as [[tree ring]]s or [[Varve|sediment layer]]s. These include (proxies for) [[temperature]], [[ocean]] volume, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], chemistry and gas composition of the lower [[atmosphere]], volcanic eruptions, solar variability, sea-surface productivity, desert extent and forest fires.

Typical ice cores are removed from an ice sheet such as the ice cap internal to [[Greenland]]. Greenland is, by area, the [[List of islands by area|world's largest island]]. The [[Greenland ice sheet]] covers about 1.71 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and contains about 2.6 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice.&lt;ref name=NSIDC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsidc.org/news/press/2007_seaiceminimum/20070810_index.html |title=NSIDC Arctic Sea Ice News Fall 2007 |publisher=nsidc.org |accessdate=2008-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greenland ice sheet==
{{main article|Greenland ice sheet}}
[[File:Greenland 42.74746W 71.57394N.jpg|thumbnail|right|Satellite composite image of Greenland.]]

The 'Greenland ice sheet' ({{lang-kl|Sermersuaq}}) is a vast body of [[ice]] covering 1.71 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, roughly 80% of the surface of [[Greenland]]. It is the second largest ice body in the [[World]], after the [[Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The [[ice sheet]] is almost 2,400 kilometers long in a north-south direction, and its greatest width is 1,100 kilometers at a latitude of [[77th parallel north|77°N]], near its northern margin. The mean altitude of the ice is 2,135 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. 1999 Multimedia edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice in the current ice sheet is as old as 110,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091015054212/http://www.agu.org/revgeophys/mayews01/node2.html "The Summit Ice Cores (GISP2 and GRIP)"]. National Report to IUGG, Rev. Geophys. Vol. 33 Suppl., American Geophysical Union, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; However,
it is generally thought that the Greenland Ice Sheet formed in the late [[Pliocene]] or early [[Pleistocene]] by coalescence of ice caps and glaciers. It did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very rapidly with the first continental [[glaciation]].

The ice surface reaches its greatest altitude on two north-south elongated domes, or ridges. The southern dome reaches almost 3,000 metres at latitudes [[63rd parallel north|63°]]–[[65th parallel north|65°N]]; the northern dome reaches about 3,290 metres at about latitude [[72nd parallel north|72°N]]. The crests of both domes are displaced east of the centre line of Greenland. The unconfined ice sheet does not reach the sea along a broad front anywhere in Greenland, so that no large ice shelves occur.

On the ice sheet, temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland. The lowest mean annual temperatures, about −31&amp;nbsp;°C (−24&amp;nbsp;°F), occur on the north-central part of the north dome, and temperatures at the crest of the south dome are about −20&amp;nbsp;°C (−4&amp;nbsp;°F).

During winter, the ice sheet takes on a strikingly clear blue/green color. During summer, the top layer of ice melts leaving pockets of air in the ice that makes it look white. Positioned in the [[Arctic]], the Greenland ice sheet is especially vulnerable to [[global warming]]. Arctic climate is now rapidly warming.

==Distant Early Warning Line==
[[File:Dye Stations in Greenland.jpg|500px|frame|left|Map of Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line Stations in Greenland, west to east: Dye 1, Dye 2, Dye 3, and Dye 4.]]

Dye-2 and 3 were among 58 Distant Early Warning ([[DEW]]) Line radar stations built by the United States of America (USA) between 1955 and 1960 across Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Iceland at a cost of billions of dollars.

After extensive studies in late 1957, the US Air Force (USAF) selected sites for two radar stations on the ice cap in southern Greenland. The DYE stations were the eastern extension of the DEW Line. DYE-1 was on the West Coast at Holsteinsborg; DYE-4 on the East Coast at Kulusuk. Dye 2 (66°29'30"N 46°18'19"W, 2338 masl) was built approximately 100 miles east of Sondrestrom AB and 90 miles south of the Arctic Circle at an altitude of 7,600 feet. Dye 3 was located approximately 100 miles east of Dye 2 and slightly south at an elevation of 8,600 feet, contrary to USAF map above.

The sites were constructed with materials provided through airlift from [[LC-130]]'s flying out of [[Kangerlussuaq]], Greenland.

The new radar sites were found to receive from three to four feet of snow each year. The snow was formed into large drifts by winds constantly blowing as much as 100&amp;nbsp;mph. To overcome this, the Dye sites were elevated approximately 20 feet above the ice cap surface. Dye 3 was completed in 1960. Due to snow accretion, the station was "jacked up" again in the late 1970s, but by the 1990s needed further elevation.

Instead, Dye 3 was closed as a radar station in the years 1990/1991.

Today, it is used as a training site for the [[139th Airlift Squadron]].

==Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP)==
{{main article|Greenland Ice Sheet Project}}
The Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP) was a decade-long project to drill 20&lt;ref name=ncdc&gt;{{ cite web |title=NOAA Paleoclimatology World Data Centers Dye 3 Ice Core |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/gisp/dye3/dye3.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ice core]]s in [[Greenland]]. GISP involved scientists and funding agencies from Denmark, Switzerland and the United States. Besides the U.S. National Science Foundation, funding was provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland. The ice cores provide a proxy archive of temperature and atmospheric constituents that help to understand past climate variations.

Annual field expeditions were carried out to drill intermediate depth cores at various locations on the [[ice sheet]]:

* Dye 3 in 1971 to 372 m
* [[Ice core#North Site|North Site]] (75°46’N 42°27’W, 2870 masl) in 1972 to 15 m

==Dye 3 cores==

Although available GISP data gathered over the earlier seven years, pointed to north-central Greenland as the optimum site location for the first deep drilling, financial restrictions forced the selection of the logistically convenient Dye-3 location.

===Dye 3 1971===

Preliminary GISP [[field work]] started in 1971 at Dye 3 ({{coord|65|11|N|43|49|W|name=Dye 3}}), where a 372 meter deep, 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter core was recovered using a Thermal (US) drill type. Three more cores to depths of 90, 93, and 95 m were drilled with different drill types.

===Dye 3 1973===

For an intermediate drilling c. 390 m, the drill was installed 25 m below the surface at the bottom of the Dye 3 radar station. Some 740 seasonal δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; cycles were counted, indicating that the core reached back to 1231 AD. Evident in this coring was that as melt water seeps through the porous snow, it refreezes somewhere in the cold firn and disturbs the layer sequence.

===Dye 3 1975===

A second core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1975 with a Shallow (Swiss) drill type to 95 m at 7.6&amp;nbsp;cm diameter.

===Dye 3 1976===

A third core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1976 with a Wireline (US) drill type, 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, to 93 m.

===Dye 3 1978===

Another core at Dye 3 was drilled in 1978 using a Shallow (US) drill type, 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, to 90 m.

Measurements of [SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;] and [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;] in [[firn]] samples spanning the period 1895–1978 were taken from the Dye 3 1978 core down to 70 m.&lt;ref name=Neftel&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/314611a0| title = Sulphate and nitrate concentrations in snow from South Greenland 1895–1978| journal = Nature| volume = 314| issue = 6012| pages = 611–613| year = 1985| last1 = Neftel | first1 = A.| last2 = Beer | first2 = J.| last3 = Oeschger | first3 = H.| last4 = Zürcher | first4 = F.| last5 = Finkel | first5 = R.

===Dye 3 1979===

In 1979, the initial Dye-3 deep bedrock drilling was started using a 22.2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter [[CRREL]] thermal (US) coring drill to produce an 18&amp;nbsp;cm diameter access hole, which was cased, to a depth of 77 m. The large diameter casing was inserted over the porous firn zone to contain the drilling fluid.&lt;ref name=Langway&gt;{{ cite web|author=Langway CC Jr. |title=The history of early polar ice cores |url=http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/library/technicalreports/ERDC-CRREL-TR-08-1.pdf |date=January 2008 |work=US Army Corps of Engineers |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217134353/http://www.crrel.usace.army.mil/library/technicalreports/ERDC-CRREL-TR-08-1.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working out various [[logistics|logistical]] and [[engineering]] problems related to the development of a more sophisticated [[drilling rig]], drilling to [[bedrock]] at Dye 3 began in the summer of 1979 using a new Danish electro-mechanical ice drill yielding a 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter core. From July to August 1979 using ISTUK, 273 m of core was removed.&lt;ref name=DansgaardBook&gt;{{ cite book|year=2004 |author=Dansgaard W |title=Frozen Annals Greenland Ice Sheet Research |isbn=87-990078-0-0 |publisher=Narayana Press |location=Odder, Denmark |pages=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1980 field season ISTUK had gnawed down to 901 m. In 1981 at a depth of 1785 m dust and conductivity measurements indicated the beginning of ice from the last glaciation.&lt;ref name=DansgaardBook/&gt; Coring continued and on August 10, 1981, bedrock was reached at a depth of 2038 m. The depth range for the Danish drill was 80–2038 m.

The Dye 3 site was a compromise: [[glaciology|glaciologically]], a higher site on the [[ice divide]] with smooth bedrock would have been better; logistically, such a site would have been too remote.

The borehole is 41.5&amp;nbsp;km east of the local ice divide of the south Greenland ice sheet.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen&gt;{{ cite book |author=Dahl-Jensen D|author2= Gundestrup NS |title=Constitutive properties of ice at Dye 3, Greenland  in "The Physical Basis of Ice Sheet Modelling" (Proceedings of the Vancouver Symposium) |date=August 1987 |publisher=IAHS |volume=170 |pages=31–43 |editor=Waddington ED|editor2= Walder JS |location=Wallingford, Oxfordshire, UK |isbn=0-947571-36-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shear conditions===

The Dye 3 cores were part of the [[GISP]] and, at 2037 meters, the final Dye 3 1979 core was the deepest of the 20 ice cores recovered from the Greenland ice sheet.&lt;ref name=ncdc/&gt; The surface ice velocity is 12.5 ma&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 61.2° true.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt; At 500 m above bedrock, the ice velocity is ~10 ma&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 61.2° true.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt; The ice upstream and downstream from Dye 3 is flowing downhill (-) on ~0.48 % mean slope.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt; The bedrock temperature is −13.22&amp;nbsp;°C (as of 1984).&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt;

===Core continuity===

The Dye 3 1979 core is not completely intact and is not undamaged. “Below 600 m, the ice became brittle with increasing depth and badly fractured between 800 and 1,200 m. The physical property of the core progressively improved and below ~1,400 m was of excellent quality.”&lt;ref name=Shoji&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/298548a0| title = Air hydrate inclusions in fresh ice core| journal = Nature| volume = 298| issue = 5874| pages = 548–550| year = 1982| last1 = Shoji | first1 = H. | last2 = Langway | first2 = C. C. | bibcode = 1982Natur.298..548S}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The deep ice core drilling terminated in August 1981. The ice core is 2035 m long and has a diameter of 10 cm. It was drilled with less than 6° deviation from vertical, and less than 2 m is missing. The deepest 22 m consists of silty ice with an increasing concentration of pebbles downward. In the depth interval 800 to 1400 m the ice was extremely brittle, and even careful handling unavoidably damaged this part of the core, but the rest of the core is in good to excellent condition.”&lt;ref name=Dansgaard&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.218.4579.1273| pmid = 17770148| title = A New Greenland Deep Ice Core| journal = Science| volume = 218| issue = 4579| pages = 1273–7| year = 1982| last1 = Dansgaard | first1 = W.| last2 = Clausen | first2 = H.

The depth interval 800 to 1400 m would be a period approximately from about two thousand years ago to about five or six thousand years ago.&lt;ref name=Rose43&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Rose LE |title=Some preliminary remarks about ice cores |journal=Kronos |date=Winter 1987 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |url=http://saturniancosmology.org/files/.cdrom/journals/kronos/vol1201/043ice.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410194535/http://saturniancosmology.org/files/.cdrom/journals/kronos/vol1201/043ice.htm |archivedate=2015-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting has been commonplace throughout the Holocene. Summer melting is usually the rule at Dye 3, and there is occasional melting even in north Greenland. All of these meltings disturb the clarity of the annual record to some degree. “An exceptionally warm spell can produce features which extend downwards by percolation, along isolated channels, into the snow of several previous years. This can happen in regions which generally have little or no melting at the snow surface as exemplified during mid July 1954 in north-west Greenland&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Such an event could lead to the conclusion that two or three successive years had abnormally warm summers, whereas all the icing formed during a single period which lasted for several days. The location where melt features will have the greatest climactic significance is high in the percolation facies where summer melting is common but deep percolation is minimal&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Dye 3 in southern Greenland (65°11’N; 43°50’W) is such a location.”&lt;ref name=Herron&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/293389a0| title = Climatic signal of ice melt features in southern Greenland| journal = Nature| volume = 293| issue = 5831| pages = 389–391| year = 1981| last1 = Herron | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Herron | first2 = S. L. | last3 = Langway | first3 = C. C. | bibcode = 1981Natur.293..389H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counting annual layers===

As the drill site of Dye 3 receives more than twice as much accumulation as central Greenland, the annual layers are well resolved and relatively thick in the upper parts, making the core ideal for dating the most recent millennia.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{ cite book |author=Rasmussen SO |title=Improvement, dating, and analysis  of Greenland ice core stratigraphies |date=August 2006 |pages=166 |publisher=University of Copenhagen |location=Copenhagen, Denmark |url=http://www.glaciology.gfy.ku.dk/papers/afhandlinger/PhDthesis_Sune_Olander_Rasmussen.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the high accumulation rate has resulted in relatively rapid ice flow (flow-induced layer thinning and diffusion of isotopes), Dye 3 1979 cannot be used for annual layer counting much more than 8 kyr back in time.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

===Ice crystal diameter distribution===

Crystal diameters range from ~0.2&amp;nbsp;cm at 1900 m from bedrock (depth 137 m) to ~0.42&amp;nbsp;cm vertical diameter (v) and ~0.55&amp;nbsp;cm horizontal diameter (h) at 300 m above bedrock (depth 1737 m).&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt; However, below 300 m crystal diameter decreases rapidly with increasing dust concentration to a minimum of ~0.05&amp;nbsp;cm at 200 m above bedrock (depth 1837 m), increasing again linearly to ~0.25&amp;nbsp;cm v and ~0.3&amp;nbsp;cm h just above bedrock.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt; Crystal diameters remain approximately constant between 1400 and 300 m above bedrock (depths 637–1737 m), with the largest crystals and the largest distortion (~0.55&amp;nbsp;cm v and ~0.7&amp;nbsp;cm h) occurring at 1100 m above bedrock (depth 937 m).&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt;

The brittle zone mentioned above under "Core continuity" corresponds in Dye 3 1979 with the steady state grain size (crystal size) from ~637 to ~1737 m depth range. This is also the [[Holocene climatic optimum]] period.

===Beryllium 10 variations===

As of 1998 the only long record available for &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is from Dye 3 1979.&lt;ref name=Aldahan&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Aldahan A|author2= Possnert G|author3= Johnsen SJ|author4= Clausen HB|author5= Isaksson E|author6= Karlen W|author7= Hansson M |title=Sixty year &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be record from Greenland and Antarctica |journal=J Earth Sys Sci. |date=June 1998 |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=139–47 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02840464 |doi=10.1007/BF02840464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions were raised whether all parts of the Dye 3 1979 record reflect the sun activity or are affected by climatic and/or ice dynamics.&lt;ref name=Aldahan/&gt;

===Dust concentration===

The dust concentration has a peak of ~3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg at 200 m above bedrock (depth 1837 m), second only to the silty ice (&gt;20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) of the bottom 25 m, which has a very high deformation rate.&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt;

===Ice ages===

The uppermost 1780 m is considered [[Holocene]] ice, and the lower portion is considered as deposited during the [[Last glacial period|Wisconsin period]].&lt;ref name=Dahl-Jensen/&gt;

From the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; O profile of the Dye 3 core it is relatively easy to differentiate the [[Holocene climatic optimum|post-glacial climatic optimum]], portions thereof and earlier: the [[Boreal (period)#Subdividing the Boreal|Pre-Boreal]] transition, the [[Allerød oscillation|Allerød]], [[Bølling oscillation|Bølling]], [[Younger Dryas]], and [[Oldest Dryas]]. In the Dye 3 1979 oxygen isotope record, the [[Older Dryas]] appears as a downward peak establishing a small, low-intensity gap between the Bølling and the Allerød.

During the transition from the Younger Dryas to the Pre-Boreal, the South Greenland temperature increased by 15&amp;nbsp;°C in 50 years. At the beginning of this same transition the deuterium excess and dust concentration shifted to lower levels in less than 20 years.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt;

The [[Holocene climatic optimum|post-glacial climatic optimum]] lasted from ~9000–4000 yrs B.P. as determined from Dye 3 1979 and Camp Century 1963 δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; O profiles. Both Dye 3 1979 and Camp Century 1963 cores exhibit the [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2 ka event]] and the boundary event separating Holocene I from Holocene II.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt;

===Fossils===

Samples from the base of the 2&amp;nbsp;km deep Dye 3 1979 and the 3&amp;nbsp;km deep [[Greenland ice core project|GRIP]] cores revealed that high-altitude southern Greenland has been inhabited by a diverse array of [[conifer]] trees and [[insects]] within the past million years.&lt;ref name=Willerslev&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1141758|pmc=2694912| pmid = 17615355| title = Ancient Biomolecules from Deep Ice Cores Reveal a Forested Southern Greenland| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5834| pages = 111–4| year = 2007| last1 = Willerslev | first1 = E.| last2 = Cappellini | first2 = E.| last3 = Boomsma | first3 = W.| last4 = Nielsen | first4 = R.| last5 = Hebsgaard | first5 = M.

To investigate the possibility of climatic cooling, scientists drilled into the Greenland ice caps to obtain core samples. The oxygen isotopes from the ice caps suggested that the [[medieval climate optimum|Medieval Warm Period]] had caused a relatively milder climate in Greenland, lasting from roughly 800 to 1200. However, from 1300 or so the climate began to cool. By 1420, we know that the  "[[Little Ice Age]]" had reached intense levels in Greenland.&lt;ref name=Fitzhugh&gt;{{cite book| title=Vikings: the North Atlantic saga|editor1=Fitzhugh, William W. |editor2=Ward, Elisabeth I. | page=330| location=Washington| publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press in association with the National Museum of Natural History|isbn=1560989955| year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camp Century 1963===

The Camp Century, Greenland, ice core (cored from 1963–1966) is 1390 m deep and contains climatic oscillations with periods of 120, 940, and 13,000 years.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard1969&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.166.3903.377| pmid = 17796550| title = One Thousand Centuries of Climatic Record from Camp Century on the Greenland Ice Sheet| journal = Science| volume = 166| issue = 3903| pages = 377–80| year = 1969| last1 = Dansgaard | first1 = W.| last2 = Johnsen | first2 = S.

===GRIP 1989===

GRIP successfully drilled a 3028-metre [[ice core]] to the bed of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] at Summit, Central [[Greenland]] from 1989 to 1992 at {{coord|72|35|N|37|38|W}}, 3238 masl.

====Inclusions in the ice====

Eight ash layers have been identified in the central Greenland ice core GRIP.&lt;ref name=Gronvold&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0012-821X(95)00145-3| title = Ash layers from Iceland in the Greenland GRIP ice core correlated with oceanic and land sediments| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 135| pages = 149–155| year = 1995| last1 = Grönvold | first1 = K. | last2 = Óskarsson | first2 = N.

The Saksunarvatn tephra via [[radiocarbon dating]] is ca 10,200 years BP.

===GISP2 1989===

The follow-up U.S. GISP2 project drilled at a glaciologically better location on the summit (72°36'N, 38°30'W, 3200 masl). This hit bedrock (and drilled another 1.55 m into bedrock) on July 1, 1993 after five years of drilling. [[Europe]]an scientists produced a parallel core in the [[Greenland ice core project|GRIP]] project. GISP2 produced an ice core 3053.44 meters in depth, the deepest ice core recovered in the world at the time.&lt;ref name=Alley&gt;{{ cite web |title=Ice Core |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/document/gispinfo.htm |work=NOAA.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRIP site was 30&amp;nbsp;km to the east of GISP2. "Down to a depth of 2790 m in GISP2 (corresponding to an age of about 110 kyr B.P.), the GISP2 and GRIP records are nearly identical in shape and in many of the details."&lt;ref name=Alley/&gt;

====Visual stratigraphy====

The GISP2 time scale is based on counting annual layers primarily by visual stratigraphy.

[[File:GISP2 1855m ice core layers.png|thumb|385px|19 cm long section of GISP 2 ice core from 1855 m showing annual layer structure illuminated from below by a fiber optic source. Section contains 11 annual layers with summer layers (arrowed) sandwiched between darker winter layers.]]

The isotopic temperature records show 23 interstadial events correlateable between the GRIP and GISP2 records between 110 and 15 kyr B.P.&lt;ref name=Alley/&gt; Ice in both cores below 2790 m depth (records prior to 110 kyr B.P.) shows evidence of folding or tilting in structures too large to be fully observed in a single core.&lt;ref name=Alley/&gt;

The bulk of the GISP2 ice core is archived at the [[National Ice Core Laboratory]] in [[Lakewood, Colorado]], United States.

===North Greenland Ice Core Project 1996===

The drilling site of the '''North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP)''' is near the center of [[Greenland]] (75.1 N, 42.32 W, 2917 m, ice thickness 3085). Drilling began in 1999 and was completed at [[bedrock]] in on July 17, 2003.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;{{ cite web |author=Whitehouse D |title=Breaking through Greenland's ice cap |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3090279.stm  | work=BBC News | date=July 23, 2003 | accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NGRIP site was chosen to extract a long and undisturbed record stretching into the last [[glacial]], and it was apparently successful.

Unusually, there is melting at the bottom of the NGRIP core – believed to be due to a high [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] heat flux locally. This has the advantage that the bottom layers are less compressed by thinning than they would otherwise be: NGRIP annual layers at 105 kyr age are 1.1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, twice the GRIP thicknesses at equal age.

====Shear conditions====

The site was chosen for a flat basal [[topography]] to avoid the flow distortions that render the bottom of the [[Greenland ice core project|GRIP]] and [[Greenland Ice Sheet Project|GISP]] cores unreliable.

====Ice crystal diameter distribution====

In the upper 80 m of the ice sheet, the firn or the snow gradually compacts to a close packing of ice crystals of typical sizes 1 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1502-3885.1994.tb00601.x| title = The last glacial cycles in East Greenland, an overview| journal = Boreas| volume = 23| issue = 4| pages = 283–293| year = 2008| last1 = Funder | first1 = S. | last2 = Hjort | first2 = C. | last3 = Landvik | first3 = J. N. Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal size distributions were obtained from fifteen vertical thin sections of 20&amp;nbsp;cm × 10&amp;nbsp;cm (height × width) and a thickness of 0.4 ±0.1&amp;nbsp;mm of ice evenly distributed in the depth interval 115 – 880 m.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen/&gt; Peak sizes with depth were ~1.9&amp;nbsp;mm 115 m, ~2.2&amp;nbsp;mm 165 m, ~2.8&amp;nbsp;mm 220 m, ~3.0&amp;nbsp;mm 330 m, ~3.2&amp;nbsp;mm 440 m, ~3.3&amp;nbsp;mm 605 m, whereas mean sizes with depth were ~1.8 115 m, ~2.2&amp;nbsp;mm 165 m, ~2.4&amp;nbsp;mm 220 m, ~2.8&amp;nbsp;mm ~270 m, ~2.75&amp;nbsp;mm 330 m, ~2.6&amp;nbsp;mm ~370 m, ~2.9&amp;nbsp;mm 440 m, ~2.8&amp;nbsp;mm ~490 m, ~2.9&amp;nbsp;mm ~540 m, ~2.9&amp;nbsp;mm 605 m, ~3.0 ~660 m, ~3.2&amp;nbsp;mm ~720 m, ~2.9&amp;nbsp;mm ~770 m, ~2.7&amp;nbsp;mm ~820 m, ~2.8&amp;nbsp;mm 880 m.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen/&gt; And, here again as with Dye 3, steady state in grain growth was reached and continued through the [[Holocene climatic optimum|post-glacial climatic optimum]].

The size distribution of ice crystals changes with depth and approaches the Normal Grain Growth law via competing mechanisms of fragmentation (producing smaller polygonal grains) and grain boundary diffusion (producing larger, vertically compressed, horizontally expanded grains).&lt;ref name=Mathiesen/&gt; Although some of the peaks for the deeper distributions appear to be slightly greater, the predicted steady state average grain size is 2.9±0.1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Mathiesen/&gt;

====Ice ages====

The NGRIP record helps to resolve a problem with the GRIP record – the unreliability of the [[Eemian Stage]] portion of the record. NGRIP covers 5 kyr of the Eemian, and shows that temperatures then were roughly as stable as the pre-industrial [[Holocene]] temperatures were. This is confirmed by [[sediment]] cores, in particular MD95-2042.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, Jamais (10 September 2004) [http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001199.html Not-So-Abrupt Climate Change?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006173154/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001199.html |date=2008-10-06 }}. worldchanging.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fossils====

In 2003, NGRIP recovered what seem to be plant remnants nearly two miles below the surface, and they may be several million years old.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

"Several of the pieces look very much like blades of grass or pine needles," said University of Colorado at Boulder geological sciences Professor James White, an NGRIP principal investigator. "If confirmed, this will be the first organic material ever recovered from a deep ice-core drilling project," he said.

''For the application of engineering economics in the practice of [[civil engineering]] please see this [[Engineering economics (Civil Engineering)|article]].''

'''Engineering Economics''', previously known as '''engineering economy''', is a subset of [[economics]] concerned with the use and "...application of economic principles" &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009"&gt;Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in the analysis of engineering decisions.&lt;ref name="Morris1960"&gt; Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as [[microeconomics]] in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Copied content from [[Microeconomics]]; see that page's history for attribution ...&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment.&lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; But, it is also a simplified application of microeconomic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt;  As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as [[statistics]], [[mathematics]] and [[cost accounting]]. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. &lt;ref name="Dharmaraj2009" /&gt; 

[[Engineer]]s seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.
Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets''|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2193/mod_resource/content/0/LecturePresentation1.pdf|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some U.S. undergraduate [[civil engineering]] curricula, engineering economics is a required course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/civil/undergraduate Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering]. Retrieved 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a topic on the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]ination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the [[Professional Engineering]] registration process.

Considering the [[time value of money]] is central to most engineering economic analyses.  [[Cash flow]]s are [[Discounting|''discounted'']] using an [[interest rate]], except in the most basic economic studies.

For each problem, there are usually many possible ''alternatives''. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the ''choice'', is the ''do nothing alternative''.  The ''opportunity cost'' of making one choice over another must also be considered.  There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed ''attributes''.&lt;ref&gt;''Engineering Economy'', 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

''Costs'' as well as ''revenues'' are considered, for each alternative, for an ''analysis period'' that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project.  The ''salvage value'' is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.

Some other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are [[inflation]], [[uncertainty]], replacements, [[depreciation]], [[resource depletion]], [[taxes]], [[tax credits]], [[accounting]], cost estimations, or [[Capital (economics)|capital financing]]. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of [[cost engineering]].

Since engineering is an important part of the [[manufacturing]] sector of the [[economy]], engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are:

* The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms;
* Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues;
* Engineering product markets and demand influences; and
* The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BE1v91Qlj64C&amp;dq=isbn:090632128X Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth &amp; Performance]'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd. Revised edition 2003, page 1. {{ISBN|978-0-906321-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benefit–cost ratio]]

== Examples of Usage ==
Some examples of engineering economic problems range from value analysis to economic studies. Each of these is relevant in different situations, and most often used by engineers or project managers. For example, engineering economic analysis helps a company not only determine the difference between fixed and incremental costs of certain operations, but also calculates that cost, depending upon a number of variables. Further uses of engineering economics include:

* Value Analysis
* [[Linear programming|Linear Programming]]
* Critical Path Economy
* Interest and Money - Time Relationships
* Depreciation and Valuation
* Capital Budgeting
* Risk, Uncertainty, and Sensitivity Analysis
* Fixed, Incremental, and Sunk Costs
* Replacement Studies
* Minimum Cost Formulas
* Various Economic Studies in relation to both Public and Private Ventures

Each of the previous components of engineering economics is critical at certain junctures, depending on the situation, scale, and objective of the project at hand. Critical path economy, as an example, is necessary in most situations as it is the coordination and planning of material, labor, and capital movements in a specific project. The most critical of these "paths" are determined to be those that have affect upon the outcome both in time and cost. Therefore, the critical paths must be determined and closely monitored by engineers and managers alike. Engineering economics helps provide the Gantt charts and activity-event networks to ascertain the correct use of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;DeGarmo E., Canada J., Engineering Economy, fifth edition, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value Analysis ===
Proper value analysis finds its roots in the need for industrial engineers and managers to not only simplify and improve processes and systems, but also the logical simplification of the designs of those products and systems. Though not directly related to engineering economy, value analysis is nonetheless important, and allows engineers to properly manage new and existing systems/processes to make them more simple and save money and time. Further, value analysis helps combat common "roadblock excuses" that may trip up managers or engineers. Sayings such as "The customer wants it this way" are retorted by questions such as; has the customer been told of cheaper alternatives or methods? "If the product is changed, machines will be idle for lack of work" can be combated by; can management not find new and profitable uses for these machines? Questions like these are part of engineering economy, as they preface any real studies or analyses.  

=== Linear Programming ===
[[Linear programming]] is the use of mathematical methods to find optimized solutions, whether they be minimized or maximized in nature. This method uses a series of lines to create a polygon then to determine the largest, or smallest, point on that shape. Manufacturing operations often use linear programming to help mitigate costs and maximize profits or production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

=== Interest and Money - Time Relationships ===
Considering the prevalence of capital to be lent for a certain period of time, with the understanding that it will be returned to the investor, money-time relationships analyze the costs associated with these types of actions. Capital itself must be divided into two different categories, ''equity capital'' and ''debt capital''. Equity capital is money already at the disposal of the business, and mainly derived from profit, and therefore is not of much concern, as it has no owners that demand its return with interest. Debt capital does indeed have owners, and they require that its usage be returned with "profit", otherwise known as interest. The interest to be paid by the business is going to be an expense, while the capital lenders will take interest as a profit, which may confuse the situation. To add to this, each will change the income tax position of the participants. 

Interest and Money - Time Relationships comes into play when the capital required to complete a project must be either borrowed or derived from reserves. To borrow brings about the question of interest and value created by the completion of the project. While taking capital from reserves also denies its usage on other projects that may yield more results. [[Interest]] in the simplest terms is defined by the multiplication of the principle, the units of time, and the [[interest rate]]. The complexity of interest calculations, however, becomes much higher as factors such as compounding interest or [[Annuity|annuities]] come into play. 

=== Depreciation and Valuation ===
The fact that assets and material in the real world eventually wear down, and thence break, is a situation that must be accounted for. [[Depreciation]] itself is defined by the decreasing of value of any given asset, though some exceptions do exist. [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] can be considered the basis for depreciation in a basic sense, as any decrease in ''value'' would be based on an ''original value''. The idea and existence of depreciation becomes especially relevant to engineering and project management is the fact that capital equipment and assets used in operations will slowly decrease in worth, which will also coincide with an increase in the likelihood of machine failure. Hence the recording and calculation of depreciation is important for two major reasons. 

# To give an estimate of "recovery capital" that has been put back into the property.
# To enable depreciation to be charged against profits that, like other costs, can be used for income taxation purposes. 

Both of these reasons, however, cannot make up for the "fleeting" nature of depreciation, which make direct analysis somewhat difficult. To further add to the issues associated with depreciation, it must be broken down into three separate types, each having intricate calculations and implications. 

* Normal Depreciation, due to physical or functional losses.
* Price Depreciation, due to changes in market value.
* Depletion, due to the use of all available resources.

Calculation of depreciation also comes in a number of forms; ''straight line, declining balance, sum-of-the-year's,'' and ''service output''. The first method being perhaps the easiest to calculate, while the remaining have varying levels of difficulty and utility. Most situations faced by managers in regards to depreciation can be solved using any of these formulas, however, company policy or preference of individual may affect the choice of model.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Capital Budgeting ===
[[Capital budgeting]], in relation to engineering economics, is the proper usage and utilization of capital to achieve project objectives. It can be fully defined by the statement; "... as the series of decisions by individuals and firms concerning how much and where resources will be obtained and expended to meet future objectives."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition almost perfectly explains capital and its general relation to engineering, though some special cases may not lend themselves to such a concise explanation. The actual acquisition of that capital has many different routes, from equity to bonds to retained profits, each having unique strengths and weakness, especially when in relation to income taxation. Factors such as risk of capital loss, along with possible or expected returns must also be considered when capital budgeting is underway. For example, if a company has $20,000 to invest in a number of high, moderate, and low risk projects, the decision would depend upon how much risk the company is willing to take on, and if the returns offered by each category offset this perceived risk. Continuing with this example, if the high risk offered only 20% return, while the moderate offered 19% return, engineers and managers would most likely choose the moderate risk project, as its return is far more favorable for its category. The high risk project failed to offer proper returns to warrant its risk status. A more difficult decision may be between a moderate risk offering 15% while a low risk offering 11% return. The decision here would be much more subject to factors such as company policy, extra available capital, and possible investors. &lt;blockquote&gt;"In general, the firm should estimate the project opportunities, including investment requirements and prospective rates of return for each, expected to be available for the coming period. Then the available capital should be tentatively allocated to the most favorable projects. The lowest prospective rate of return within the capital available then becomes the minimum acceptable rate of return for analyses of any projects during that period."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Economy|last=DeGarmo|first=E. Paul|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|location=New York|pages=209-210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Minimum Cost Formulas ===
Being one of the most important and integral operations in the engineering economic field is the minimization of cost in systems and processes. Time, resources, labor, and capital must all be minimized when placed into any system, so that revenue, product, and profit can be maximized. Hence, the general equation;

&lt;math&gt;C=ax +b/x+k&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is total cost, ''a b'' and ''k'' are constants, and ''x'' is the variable number of units produced.  

There are a great number of cost analysis formulas, each for particular situations and are warranted by the policies of the company in question, or the preferences of the engineer at hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Economic Studies, both Private and Public in Nature ===
Economic studies, which are much more common outside of engineering economics, are still used from time to time to determine feasibility and utility of certain projects. They do not, however, truly reflect the "common notion" of economic studies, which is fixated upon macroeconomics, something engineers have little interaction with. Therefore, the studies conducted in engineering economics are for specific companies and limited projects inside those companies. At most one may expect to find some feasibility studies done by private firms for the government or another business, but these again are in stark contrast to the overarching nature of true economic studies. Studies have a number of major steps that can be applied to almost every type of situation, those being as follows;

* Planning and Screening - Mainly reviewing objectives and issues that may be encountered.
* Reference to Standard Economic Studies - Consultation of standard forms.
* Estimating - Speculating as to the magnitude of costs and other variables.
* Reliability - The ability to properly estimate.
* Comparison between Actual and Projected Performance - Verify savings, review failures, to ensure that proposals were valid, and to add to future studies.
* Objectivity of the Analyst - To ensure the individual that advanced proposals or conducted analysis was not biased toward certain outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Italic title}}
The German '''''{{Lang|de|Fach}}''''' '''system''' ({{IPA-de|fax}}; literally "compartment" or "subject of study", here in the sense of "vocal specialization") is a method of classifying singers, primarily [[opera]] singers, according to the [[Vocal range|range]], [[Vocal weight|weight]], and [[tone color|color]] of their voices. It is used worldwide, but primarily in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries and by [[Repertory theatre|repertory]] opera houses.

The ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' system is a convenience for singers and opera houses. It prevents singers from being asked to sing roles which they are incapable of performing. Opera companies keep lists of available singers by ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' so that when they are casting roles for an upcoming production, they do not inadvertently contact performers who would be inappropriate for the part.

Below is a list of ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɛçɐ}}), their ranges as written on [[sheet music]], and roles generally considered appropriate to each. When two names for the ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' are given, the first is in more common use today. Where possible, an English and/or Italian equivalent of each ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' is listed; however, not all ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' have ready English or Italian equivalents. Note that some roles can be sung by more than one ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' and that many singers do not easily fit into a ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'': for instance some sopranos may sing both ''{{Lang|de|Koloratursopran}}'' and ''{{Lang|de|Dramatischer Koloratursopran}}'' roles. In addition, roles traditionally more difficult to cast may be given to a voice other than the traditional ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}''. For instance, the "[[The Magic Flute|Queen of the Night]]" is more traditionally a dramatic [[coloratura]] role, but it is difficult to find a dramatic coloratura to sing it (particularly given the extreme range). Therefore, the role is often sung by a lyric coloratura.

== [[Soprano]] ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' ==

=== {{Lang|de|Lyrischer Koloratursopran / Koloratursoubrette}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to F.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[coloratura soprano]] or [[Coloratura soprano#Lyric coloratura soprano|lyric coloratura soprano]]
* Range: From about middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the F two-and-a-half octaves above middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Usually (but not always) a light soprano who has a high voice. Can often have small voices lacking the richness and resonance of a dramatic soprano. Must be able to do fast acrobatics with easy high notes. Many have extremely high ranges (with notes above the F of the "[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Queen of the Night]]"), but there are also singers in this ''{{Lang|de|Fach}}'' who do not regularly sing higher than the high E{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Roles:
** Adina, ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' ([[Gaetano Donizetti]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Aminta, ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{cn|date=March 2017}}
** Marie, ''[[La fille du régiment]]'' (Gaetano Donizetti){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Olympia, ''[[Les contes d'Hoffman]]'' ([[Jacques Offenbach]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
** Oscar, ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' ([[Giuseppe Verdi]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
** Zerbinetta, ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Koloratursopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to F.svg|right|200px]]
*English equivalent: [[Coloratura soprano#Dramatic coloratura soprano|Dramatic coloratura soprano]]
*Range: From about middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the F two and a half octaves above middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
*Description: The same as above, only with a more dramatic, rich voice. Often heavier and more lyrical than a coloratura soprano. Must also be able to do fast vocal acrobatics and reach high notes, such as the F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; of the "[[Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Queen of the Night]]".
*Roles:
**Abigalle, ''[[Nabucco]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Donna Anna, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Elvira, ''[[I puritani]]'' (Vincenzo Bellini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Fiordiligi, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
** Gilda, ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Konstanze, ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Leonora, ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Norma, ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' (Vincenzo Bellini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Odabella, ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**The Queen of the Night, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
**Violetta, ''[[La traviata]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=900}}
One must not mistake the Mozartian dramatic coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and are most often sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.

=== {{Lang|de|Deutsche Soubrette / Charaktersopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano C to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Soubrette]]
* Range: From about [[middle C]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A beautiful, sweet light lyric voice usually capable of executing florid passages similarly to that of a coloratura. The range is usually intermediate between that of a coloratura and lyric soprano. Most sopranos start out as soubrettes, changing fach as the voice matures.
* Roles:
** Barbarina, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Papagena, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=899}}
** Susanna, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Zerlina, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}

=== {{Lang|de|Lyrischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano B to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Lyric soprano#Full lyric soprano|lyric soprano]]
* Range: From about B below middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A more supple soprano, capable of [[legato]], [[portamento]], and some agility; generally has a more soulful and sensuous quality than a soubrette, who tends to be largely flirtatious and somewhat tweety. The voice is very common; thus the purity and character of the basic timbre is essential. It is the "basic" soprano voice which is at neither extremes of the soprano range of voices; it is not known for having particular vocal attributes such as power, stamina, technical prowess, or agility. However, there are several lyric sopranos that possess a quantity of many of these vocal attributes, thus allowing them to sing a broader variety of roles. Nevertheless, the core of the true fundamentally lyric voice does not encompass such traits. Innocence, vulnerability and pathos are usually conveyed in the music written for the characters portrayed by the lyric soprano because of this endearing simplicity. This fach is also famous because the voices usually remain especially fresh until advanced age.
* Roles:
** Gretel, ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' ([[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Lauretta, ''[[Gianni Schicchi]] '' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Liù, ''[[Turandot]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Micaëla, ''[[Carmen]]'' ([[Georges Bizet]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Pamina, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Sophie, ''[[Werther]]'' (Jules Massenet){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Susanna, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}

=== {{Lang|de|Jugendlich dramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano A to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[spinto soprano|lyric dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about A below middle C (A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: The Italian version of this fach is the ''[[spinto]]'', which literally translated means pushed. However this is not accurate in terms of these singers' vocal production. A lyric dramatic soprano has a lyric instrument that can also create big sounds, cutting through an orchestral or choral climax. This voice is sometimes referred to as a "young" or "youthful" dramatic soprano although this term doesn't necessarily refer to the singer's age but rather to the tonal quality of the voice. This fach is more clearly delineated in the German system than in the American system. Depending on the singer, however, this voice type can be versatile, as it lies at neither extreme of the soprano spectrum. Spintos are occasionally able to take on lighter mezzo roles, or, conversely, lyric and even coloratura roles.
* Roles:
** Agathe, ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' ([[Carl Maria von Weber]]){{cn|date=March 2017}}
** Amelia, ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' (Giuseppe Verdi){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Cio-Cio San, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' ([[Giacomo Puccini]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}

** Donna Elvira, ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Elisabeth, ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' ([[Richard Wagner]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Elsa, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' (Richard Wagner){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Eva, ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' (Richard Wagner){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Giulietta, ''[[Les contes d'Hoffman]] ([[Jacques Offenbach]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Liza, ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' ([[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]])

** Marie, ''[[Wozzeck]]'' ([[Alban Berg]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=901}}
** Marie/Marietta, ''[[Die tote Stadt]]'' ([[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}

** Suor Angelica, ''[[Suor Angelica]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano A to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[dramatic soprano|full dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about the A below middle C (A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Characterized by their rich, full sounding voices, dramatic sopranos are expected to project across large orchestras, a feat that requires a powerful sound. Dramatic sopranos are not expected to have the vocal flexibility of the lighter ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}''. Although most dramatic sopranos have a darker, more robust quality to the voice, there are some that possess a lighter lyrical tone. In these instances, however, the substantial amount of volume and endurance normally associated with the dramatic soprano voice is still present. The darker voiced dramatic soprano may even make a foray into the dramatic mezzo-soprano territory with great success.
* Roles:
** Ariadne, ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Cassandre, ''[[Les Troyens]]'' ([[Hector Berlioz]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Leonore, ''[[Fidelio]]'' ([[Ludwig van Beethoven]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Marschallin, ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' ([[Richard Strauss]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Minnie, ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Salome, ''[[Salome (opera)| Salome]]'' (Richard Strauss)
** Santuzza, ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' ([[Pietro Mascagni]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}
** Tosca, ''[[Tosca]]'' (Giacomo Puccini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=902}}

Two roles mentioned above, Salome and the Marschallin, are relatively high dramatic sopranos and require that the soprano can endure long stretches of very high tessitura. Richard Strauss himself said that Salome should be sung by someone with the flexibility of a dramatic coloratura due to the high tessitura.

=== {{Lang|de|Hochdramatischer Sopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano F to C.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[dramatic soprano|High dramatic soprano]]
* Range: From about the F below middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the C two octaves above middle C (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: A voice capable of answering the demands of operas of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s maturity. The voice is substantial, very powerful, and even throughout the registers. It is immense, stentorian and even larger than the voice of the "normal" dramatic soprano. Although the two voices are comparable and are sometimes hard to distinguish between, this voice has even greater stamina, endurance and volume than the former. The top register is very strong, clarion and bright. Successful ''{{Lang|de|hochdramatische}}'' are rare.

== [[Mezzo-soprano]] and [[Contralto]] ''{{Lang|de|Fächer}}'' ==

=== {{Lang|de|Koloratur-Mezzosopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano G to B.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[Mezzo-soprano#Coloratura|coloratura mezzo-soprano]]
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Found especially in [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s operas, these roles were written originally for altos with agility and secure top notes. Today they are often played by mezzo-sopranos and sometimes even by sopranos. At times a lyric or full [[lyric soprano]] with a flexible voice will assume the roles as written while a true coloratura soprano will sing the same music transposed  to a higher key.
* Roles:
** Angelina, ''[[La Cenerentola]]'' (Gioachino Rossini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Isabella, ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' (Gioachino Rossini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Rosina, ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' ([[Gioachino Rossini]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Tancredi, ''[[Tancredi]]'' (Gioacchino Rossini){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

=== {{Lang|de|Lyrischer Mezzosopran / Spielalt}} ===
[[File:Soprano G to B.svg|right|200px]]
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* English equivalent: [[mezzo-soprano#Lyric|lyric mezzo-soprano]]
* Description: A lyric soprano's instrument in a lower range; the resulting sound is less piercing, more lachrymose and rather sensitive. The voices are similar, giving rise to the term 'short soprano' i.e. a soprano without the highest notes. In fact, many lyric mezzos with strong extensions to their upper vocal registers make the transition to singing as sopranos at some point in their careers.
* Roles:
** Cherubino, ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'' ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Dorabella, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Hänsel, ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' ([[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** Suzuki, ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' ([[Giacomo Puccini]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Mezzosopran}} ===
[[File:Soprano G to B.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: [[mezzo soprano#Dramatic|dramatic mezzo-soprano]]
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B two octaves above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges very similar to a dramatic soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease in which the two voice-types sing – a mezzo will concentrate singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and will go up to notes like high B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower [[tessitura]].
* Roles:
** Dido, ''Les Troyens'' (Hector Berlioz){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}
** The Composer, ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' (Richard Strauss){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

** Ortrud, ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' ([[Richard Wagner]]){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=903}}

=== {{Lang|de|Dramatischer Alt}} ===
[[File:Soprano F to A.svg|right|200pxl]]
* English equivalent: [[Contralto#Dramatic|dramatic contralto]]
* Range: From about the F below middle C (F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the G or A two octaves above (G–A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Description: Stylistically similar to the dramatic mezzo, just lower. Sings usually around the break between the chest voice and middle voice. Many mezzos tried their luck in these roles, yet real altos fare better. A deep, penetrating low female voice. This is a very rare voice type with a darker, richer sound than that of a typical alto.

=== {{Lang|de|Tiefer Alt}} ===
* English equivalent: [[Contralto|low contralto]]
* Range: From about the E below middle C (E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the E two octaves above (E&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)

[[File:Tenor C to B.svg|right|200px]]
* English equivalent: (lyric) comic tenor. It is quite possible for a young ''{{Lang|de|Spieltenor}}'' to eventually work into the lighter ''{{Lang|de|lyrischer Tenor}}'' category; the deciding factor will be the beauty of voice.
* Range: From about low C (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to the B an octave above middle C (B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Roles:
** Monostatos, ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart){{sfn|Kloiber|2002|p=905}}

which is a multidisciplinary, interoperable and updatable knowledge base about the subsurface.

Geomodelling is commonly used for managing [[natural resources]], identifying [[natural hazards]], and quantifying [[geology|geological processes]], with main applications to [[Petroleum|oil]] and gas fields, groundwater [[aquifer]]s and [[ore]] deposits.  For example, in the [[oil and gas industry]], realistic geologic models are required as input to [[reservoir simulator]] programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various [[hydrocarbon]] recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and wasteful. Using geological models and [[reservoir simulation]] allows [[reservoir engineers]] to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.

Geologic modelling is a relatively recent subdiscipline of [[geology]] which integrates [[structural geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[paleoclimatology]], and [[diagenesis]];

In 2-dimensions (2D), a [[geologic formation]] or unit is represented by a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) triangulated or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a triangulated mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, often referred to as [[voxel]]s (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.

Geomodelling generally involves the following steps: 
# Preliminary analysis of geological context of the domain of study.
# Interpretation of available data and observations as point sets or polygonal lines (e.g. "fault sticks" corresponding to faults on a vertical seismic section).
# Construction of a structural model describing the main rock boundaries (horizons, unconformities, intrusions, faults)&lt;ref name="StructMod"&gt;Caumon, G., Collon-Drouaillet, P., Le Carlier de Veslud, C., Sausse, J. and Viseur, S. (2009), Surface-based 3D modeling of geological structures, ''Mathematical Geosciences'', 41(9):927-945&lt;/ref&gt;
# Definition of a three-dimensional mesh honoring the structural model to support volumetric representation of heterogeneity (see [[Geostatistics]]) and solving the [[Partial differential equation|Partial Differential Equations]] which govern physical processes in the subsurface (e.g. [[Seismology|seismic wave propagation]], fluid transport in porous media).

Incorporating the spatial positions of the major formation boundaries, including the effects of [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], [[Fold (geology)|folding]], and [[erosion]] ([[unconformity|unconformities]]).  The major stratigraphic divisions are further subdivided into layers of cells with differing geometries with relation to the bounding surfaces (parallel to top, parallel to base, proportional).  Maximum cell dimensions are dictated by the minimum sizes of the features to be resolved (everyday example:  On a digital map of a city, the location of a city park might be adequately resolved by one big green pixel, but to define the locations of the basketball court, the baseball field, and the pool, much smaller pixels - higher resolution - need to be used).

=== Rock type ===
Each cell in the model is assigned a rock type.  In a coastal [[clastic|clastic environment]], these might be beach sand, high water energy marine [[upper shoreface]] sand, intermediate water energy marine [[lower shoreface]] sand, and deeper low energy marine [[silt]] and [[shale]].  The distribution of these rock types within the model is controlled by several methods, including map boundary polygons, rock type probability maps, or statistically emplaced based on sufficiently closely spaced well data.

=== Reservoir quality ===
Reservoir quality parameters almost always include [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], but may include measures of clay content, cementation factors, and other factors that affect the storage and deliverability of fluids contained in the pores of those rocks. [[Geostatistics|Geostatistical]] techniques are most often used to populate the cells with porosity and permeability values that are appropriate for the rock type of each cell.

=== Fluid saturation ===
[[Image:MODFLOW 3D grid.png|thumb|right|A 3D [[finite difference]] grid used in [[MODFLOW]] for simulating groundwater flow in an aquifer.]]
Most rock is completely [[aquifer|saturated]] with [[groundwater]].  Sometimes, under the right conditions, some of the pore space in the rock is occupied by other liquids or gases.  In the energy industry, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] are the fluids most commonly being modelled.  The preferred methods for calculating hydrocarbon saturations in a geologic model incorporate an estimate of pore throat size, the [[density|densities]] of the fluids, and the height of the cell above the [[water contact]], since these factors exert the strongest influence on [[capillary action]], which ultimately controls fluid saturations.

=== Geostatistics ===
An important part of geologic modelling is related to [[geostatistics]]. In order to represent the observed data, often
not on regular grids, we have to use certain interpolation techniques. The most widely used technique is [[kriging]]
which uses the spatial correlation among data and intends to construct the interpolation via semi-variograms. To reproduce more realistic spatial variability and help assess spatial uncertainty between data, geostatistical simulation based on variograms, training images, or parametric geological objects is often used.

=== Mineral Deposits ===
Geologists involved in [[mining]] and [[mineral exploration]] use geologic modelling to determine the geometry and placement of [[mineral]] deposits in the subsurface of the earth.  Geologic models help define the volume and concentration of minerals, to which [[Economic geology|economic constraints]] are applied to determine the economic value of the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].  Mineral deposits that are deemed to be economic may be developed into a [[mining|mine]].

== Technology ==

Geomodelling and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] share a lot of common technologies. Software is usually implemented using object-oriented programming technologies in [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] on one or multiple computer platforms. The graphical user interface generally consists of one or several 3D and 2D graphics windows to visualize spatial data, interpretations and modelling output. Such visualization is generally achieved by exploiting [[graphics hardware]]. User interaction is mostly performed through mouse and keyboard, although 3D pointing devices and [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|immersive environments]] may be used in some specific cases. GIS (Geographic Information System) is also a widely used tool to manipulate geological data.

Geometric objects are represented with parametric curves and surfaces or discrete models such as [[polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]].&lt;ref name="StructMod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet02"&gt;Mallet, J.-L., Geomodeling, Applied Geostatistics Series.

Problems pertainting to Geomodelling cover:&lt;ref&gt;Caumon, G., Towards stochastic time-varying geological modeling (2010), ''Mathematical Geosciences'', 42(5):(555-569)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perrin, M., Zhu, B., Rainaud, J.F. and Schneider, S. (2005), Knowledge-driven applications for geological modeling, "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", 47(1-2):89-104&lt;/ref&gt;
* Defining an appropriate [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology]] to describe geological objects at various scales of interest,
* Integrating diverse types of observations into 3D geomodels: geological mapping data, borehole data and interpretations, seismic images and interpretations, potential field data, well test data, etc.,
* Better accounting for geological processes during model building,
* Characterizing uncertainty about the geomodels to help assess risk. Therefore, Geomodelling has a close connection to [[Geostatistics]] and [[Inverse problem|Inverse problem theory]],

== History ==

In the 70's, geomodelling mainly consisted of automatic 2D cartographic techniques such as contouring, implemented as [[FORTRAN]] routines communicating directly with [[plotter|plotting hardware]]. The advent of workstations with [[3D graphics]] capabilities during the 80's gave birth to a new generation of geomodelling software with graphical user interface which became mature during the 90's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html Dynamic Graphics History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725233528/http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocad.org/w4/index.php/gocad/origin Origin of the Gocad software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Mallet, P. Jacquemin, and N. Cheimanoff (1989). GOCAD project: Geometric modeling of complex geological surfaces, SEG Expanded Abstracts 8, 126, {{doi|10.1190/1.1889515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, geomodelling has been mainly motivated and supported by oil and gas industry.

==Geologic modelling software==
Software developers have built several packages for geologic modelling purposes. Such software can display, edit, digitise and automatically calculate the parameters required by engineers, geologists and surveyors. Current software is mainly developed and commercialized by oil and gas or mining industry software vendors:

The '''Haush''' or '''Manek'enk''' were an indigenous people, considered the oldest inhabitants of [[Tierra del Fuego]], who spoke the [[Haush language]]. Their autonym, or name for themselves was '''Manek'enk'''.&lt;ref name="furlong"/&gt; 
==History==
At the time of European encounter and settlement, they inhabited the far eastern tip of the island on [[Mitre Peninsula]]. Land to their west, still in the northeast of Tierra del Fuego, was occupied by the [[Selknam people|Ona or Selk'nam]], a related linguistic and cultural group, but distinct.&lt;ref name="furlong"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Furlong |first=Charles Wellington |authorlink=Charles W.

The Haush were nomadic hunters, hunting the [[guanaco]]. They used every part of it, making clothing out of the skin. They shared many customs with their neighbors the Selk'nam, including the use of small bows and stone-tipped arrows, making clothing from the skins of animals, and an initiation ritual for male youth called ''hain.''&lt;ref name="furlong"/&gt; Their languages, part of the [[Chonan languages|Chonan]] family, were similar.

[[Salesian]] [[missionaries]] ministered to the Manek'enk, and worked to preserve their culture and language. Father [[José María Beauvoir]] prepared a vocabulary. [[Lucas Bridges]], an Anglo-Argentine born in the region, whose father had been an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]] in Tierra del Fuego, compiled a dictionary of the Haush language.&lt;ref name="furlong"/&gt;

Hilbert C*-modules were first introduced in the work of [[Irving Kaplansky]] in [[1953 in science|1953]], which developed the theory for [[commutative]], [[unital algebra]]s (though Kaplansky observed that the assumption of a unit element was not "vital").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kaplansky| first = I.| authorlink = Irving Kaplansky| title = Modules over operator algebras| journal = [[American Journal of Mathematics]]| volume = 75| issue = 4| pages = 839–853| year = 1953| doi = 10.2307/2372552| jstor = 2372552}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the theory was extended to non-commutative C*-algebras independently by William Lindall Paschke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Paschke| first = W.

== Definitions ==

=== Inner-product ''A''-modules ===
Let ''A'' be a C*-algebra (not assumed to be commutative or unital), its [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] denoted by *. An '''inner-product ''A''-module''' (or '''pre-Hilbert ''A''-module''') is a [[complex number|complex]] linear space ''E'' which is equipped with a compatible right [[Module (mathematics)|''A''-module]] structure, together with a map
:&lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle : E \times E \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following properties:

*For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''E'', and α, β in '''C''':

::&lt;math&gt; \langle x, \alpha y + \beta z \rangle = \alpha \langle x, y \rangle + \beta \langle x, z \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

:(''i.e.'' the inner product is linear in its second argument).

*For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''E'', and a in ''A'':
::&lt;math&gt; \langle x, y a \rangle = \langle x, y \rangle a &lt;/math&gt;

*For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''E'':

::&lt;math&gt; \langle x, y \rangle = \langle y, x \rangle^*,&lt;/math&gt;

:from which it follows that the inner product is [[conjugate linear]] in its first argument (''i.e.'' it is a [[sesquilinear form]]).

*For all ''x'' in ''E'':

::&lt;math&gt; \langle x, x \rangle \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;

:and

::&lt;math&gt; \langle x, x \rangle = 0 \iff x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

:(An element of a C*-algebra ''A'' is said to be ''positive'' if it is [[self-adjoint]] with non-negative [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Arveson| first = William| authorlink = William Arveson|title = An Invitation to C*-Algebras| publisher = Springer-Verlag| year = 1976| page = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the case when ''A'' is non-unital, the spectrum of an element is calculated in the C*-algebra generated by adjoining a unit to ''A''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hilbert ''A''-modules ===
An analogue to the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] holds for an inner-product ''A''-module ''E'':&lt;ref&gt;This result in fact holds for semi-inner-product ''A''-modules, which may have non-zero elements ''x'' such that &lt;''x'',''x''&gt; = 0, as the proof does not rely on the [[nondegeneracy]] property.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y \rangle \langle y, x \rangle \leq \Vert \langle y, y \rangle \Vert \langle x, x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for ''x'', ''y'' in ''E''.

On the pre-Hilbert module ''E'', define a norm by

:&lt;math&gt;\Vert x \Vert = \Vert \langle x, x \rangle \Vert^\frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The norm-completion of ''E'', still denoted by ''E'', is said to be a '''Hilbert ''A''-module''' or a '''Hilbert C*-module over the C*-algebra ''A'''''.
The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality implies the inner product is jointly continuous in norm and can therefore be extended to the completion.

The action of ''A'' on ''E'' is continuous: for all ''x'' in ''E''

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\lambda} \rightarrow a \Rightarrow xa_{\lambda} \rightarrow xa.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if {''e&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''} is an [[Approximate identity|approximate unit]] for ''A'' (a [[Net (mathematics)|net]] of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' for which ''ae''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''a'' tend to ''a'' for each ''a'' in ''A''), then for ''x'' in ''E''

:&lt;math&gt; xe_\lambda \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;

whence it follows that ''EA'' is [[Dense set|dense]] in ''E'', and ''x''1 = ''x'' when ''A'' is unital.
 
Let

:&lt;math&gt; \langle E, E \rangle = \operatorname{span} \{ \langle x, y \rangle | x, y \in E \},&lt;/math&gt;

then the [[Closure (topology)|closure]] of &lt;''E'',''E''&gt; is a two-sided ideal in ''A''. Two-sided ideals are C*-subalgebras and therefore possess approximate units. One can verify that ''E''&lt;''E'',''E''&gt; is dense in ''E''. In the case when &lt;''E'',''E''&gt; is dense in ''A'', ''E'' is said to be '''full'''. This does not generally hold.

== Examples ==

=== Hilbert spaces ===
A complex Hilbert space ''H'' is a Hilbert '''C'''-module under its inner product, the complex numbers being a C*-algebra with an involution given by [[complex conjugation]].

===Vector bundles===
If ''X'' is a [[locally compact Hausdorff space]] and ''E'' a [[vector bundle]] over ''X'' with a [[Riemannian metric]] ''g'', then the space of continuous sections of ''E'' is a Hilbert ''C(X)''-module. The inner product is given by
::&lt;math&gt; \langle f,h\rangle (x):=g(f(x),h(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

The converse holds as well: Every countably generated Hilbert C*-module over a commutative C*-algebra ''A = C(X)''  is isomorphic to the space of sections vanishing at infinity of a continuous field of Hilbert spaces over ''X''.

=== C*-algebras ===
Any C*-algebra ''A'' is a Hilbert ''A''-module under the inner product &lt;''a'',''b''&gt; = ''a''*''b''.  By the C*-identity, the Hilbert module norm coincides with C*-norm on ''A''.

The (algebraic) [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of ''n'' copies of ''A''

:&lt;math&gt; A^n = \oplus_1^n A&lt;/math&gt;

can be made into a Hilbert ''A''-module by defining

:&lt;math&gt;\langle (a_i), (b_i) \rangle = \sum a_i^* b_i.&lt;/math&gt;

One may also consider the following subspace of elements in the countable direct product of ''A''

:&lt;math&gt; \ell_2(A)= \mathcal{H}_A = \{ (a_i) | \sum a_i^{*}a_i\text{ converges in }A \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Endowed with the obvious inner product (analogous to that of ''A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''), the resulting Hilbert ''A''-module is called the '''standard Hilbert module'''.

A '''hydathode''' is a type of pore, commonly found in [[angiosperm]]s, that secretes water through [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s in the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] or leaf margin, typically at the tip of a marginal tooth or serration. Hydathodes occur in the leaves of submerged aquatic plants such as ''[[Ranunculus fluitans]]''&lt;ref name=Mortlock&gt;{{cite journal|first=C.|last=Mortlock|year=1952|title=The structure and development of the hydathodes of ''Ranunculus fluitans'' Lam.|journal=New Phytologist|volume=51|pages=129–138|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1952.tb06121.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as herbaceous plants of drier habitats such as ''[[Campanula rotundifolia]]''.&lt;ref name=Stevensetal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens| first1=C.J.|last2=Wilson |first2= J|last3= McAllister|first3= H.A.|year=2012|title=Biological Flora of the British Isles: ''Campanula rotundifolia''|journal=[[Journal of Ecology]]|volume=100|pages=821–839|DOI=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.01963.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are connected to the plant vascular system by a vascular bundle. Hydathodes are commonly seen in [[water lettuce]], water hyacinth, rose, balsam, and many other species.

Hydathodes are made of a group of living cells with numerous intercellular spaces filled with water, but few or no chloroplasts, and represent modified bundle-ends. These cells (called ''[[epithem]] cells''&lt;ref name="Cutter"&gt;{{cite book|first=E.G.|last=Cutter|year=1978|title=Plant Anatomy. Part 1.

These, in turn, communicate with the exterior through an '''open water stoma''' or '''open pore'''. The water stoma structurally resembles an ordinary stoma, but is usually larger and has lost the power of movement. 

Hydathodes are involved in the process of [[guttation]], in which positive xylem pressure (due to root pressure) causes liquid to exude from the pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taiz |first1=Lincoln |last2=Zeiger |first2=Eduardo |date=2010 |title=Plant Physiology |edition=5th (International) |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |pages=90 |isbn=9780878935659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some halophytes possess glandular trichomes that actively secrete salt in order to reduce the concentration of cytotoxic inorganic ions in their cytoplasm; this may lead to the formation of a white powdery substance on the surface of the leaf.
 
Hydathodes are of two types:
# passive hydathodes, formed when a leaf vein terminates in an epithem (an area of thin-walled [[parenchyma]]).
# active hydathodes, formed when epidermal cells lose water actively.

'''Inductive reasoning aptitude''' (also called '''differentiation''' or '''inductive learning ability''') measures how well a person can [[pattern recognition (psychology)|identify a pattern]] within a large amount of data. It involves applying the rules of logic when inferring general principles from a constellation of particulars. 

Measurement is generally done in a timed test by showing four pictures or words and asking the test taker to identify which of the pictures or words does not belong in the set. The test taker is shown a large number of sets of various degrees of difficulty. The measurement is made by timing how many of these a person can properly identify in a set period of time. The test resembles the [[game]] 'Which of These Is Not Like the Others'.

[[Inductive reasoning]] is very useful for scientists, auto mechanics, [[system integrator]]s, lawyers, network engineers, medical doctors, [[system administrator]]s and members of all fields where substantial diagnostic or data interpretation work is needed. Inductive reasoning [[aptitude]] is also useful for learning a [[graphical user interface]] quickly, because highly inductive people are very good at seeing others' categorization schemes. Inductive reasoning aptitude is often counter-productive in fields like sales where tolerance is very important, because highly inductive people tend to be good at seeing faults in others. {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} 

==Example==
Here is an example question:

Find the set of letters that doesn’t belong with the other sets.

 A) cdef       B) mnpo        C) hikj        D) vwyx

The correct answer is...

→("A", as it is the only set with four letters in sequential order, although set "D" arguably differs by both lacking a vowel and being separated from the previous set by more than one intervening letter.)

Practitioners match their observations to ''iris charts,'' which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body. Iridologists see the eyes as "windows" into the body's state of health.

Iridologists claim they can use the charts to distinguish between healthy systems and organs in the body and those that are overactive, inflamed, or distressed. Iridologists claim this information demonstrates a patient's susceptibility towards certain illnesses, reflects past medical problems, or predicts later health problems.

As opposed to [[evidence-based medicine]], iridology is not supported by quality research studies&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt; and is widely considered [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hockenbury|first1=Don H.|last2=Hockenbury|first2=Sandra E.|title=Psychology|year=2003|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=0-7167-5129-1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The features of the iris are one of the most stable features on the human body throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehrotra|first1=H|last2=Vatsa|first2=M|last3=Singh|first3=R|last4=Majhi|first4=B|title=Does iris change over time?|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e78333|pmid=24244305|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0078333|bibcode=2013PLoSO...878333M|pmc=3820685}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=December 2016}} The stability of iris structures is the foundation of the [[biometric]] technology which uses [[iris recognition]] for identification purposes.&lt;ref name="Chellappaedited"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chellappa|first=edited by Massimo Tistarelli, Stan Z.

In 1979, Bernard Jensen, a leading American iridologist, and two other iridology proponents failed to establish the basis of their practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not.&lt;ref name="simona"&gt;{{citation|author=Simon A|title=An evaluation of iridology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=242|issue=13|pages=1385–1387|date=1979|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300130029014|pmid=480560|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iris.eye.225px.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is the greenish-yellow area surrounding the transparent pupil (showing as black). The white outer area is the [[sclera]], the central transparent part of which is the [[cornea]].]]

Iridologists generally use equipment such as a flashlight and magnifying glass, cameras or [[slit-lamp microscope]]s to examine a patient's irises for [[Biological tissue|tissue]] changes, as well as features such as specific pigment patterns and irregular [[stroma of iris|stroma]]l architecture. The markings and patterns are compared to an ''iris chart'' that correlates zones of the iris with parts of the body. Typical charts divide the iris into approximately 80–90 zones. For example, the zone corresponding to the kidney is in the lower part of the iris, just before 6 o'clock.  There are minor variations between charts' associations between body parts and areas of the iris.

According to iridologists, details in the iris reflect changes in the tissues of the corresponding body organs. One prominent practitioner, [[Bernard Jensen]], described it thus: "Nerve fibers in the iris respond to changes in body tissues by manifesting a reflex physiology that corresponds to specific tissue changes and locations."&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Jensen B; "''Iridology Simplified''". 2nd ed., Escondido 1980.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that a bodily condition translates to a noticeable change in the appearance of the iris, but this has been disproven through many studies.&lt;ref name="simona" /&gt; (See section on Scientific research.) For example, ''acute inflammatory'', ''chronic inflammatory'' and ''catarrhal'' signs may indicate involvement, maintenance, or healing of corresponding distant tissues, respectively. Other features that iridologists look for are ''contraction rings'' and ''Klumpenzellen'', which may indicate various other health conditions, as interpreted in context.

==History==
The first ''explicit'' description of iridological principles such as homolaterality (without using the word ''iridology'') are found in ''[[Chiromatica Medica]]'', a famous work published in 1665 and reprinted in 1670 and 1691 by [[Philippus Meyeus]] (Philip Meyen von Coburg).

[[Image:Iridology iris eye chart left mirror.jpg|thumb|200px|This is an example of an iridology chart, correlating areas of the left iris, as seen in the mirror, with portions of the left hand side of the body. Changes in color or appearance of the iris are said to indicate changes in the health of the corresponding section of the body.]]

[[Image:Iridology iris eye chart right mirror.jpg|thumb|200px|This is the corresponding chart for the right iris, which relates to the right side of the body.]]

The first use of the word ''Augendiagnostik'' ("eye diagnosis", loosely translated as ''iridology'') began with [[Ignaz von Peczely]], a 19th-century Hungarian physician who is recognised as its founding father.&lt;ref name=Irydolog&gt;{{cite web|last=Zygadlo|first=Krzysztof|title=Iridology |url=http://irydolog.pl/en/iridology|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common story is that he got the idea for this diagnostic tool after seeing similar streaks in the eyes of a man he was treating for a broken leg and the eyes of an owl whose leg von Peczely had broken many years before. At the First International Iridological Congress, Ignaz von Peczely's nephew, [[August von Peczely]], dismissed this myth as apocryphal, and maintained that such claims were irreproducible.

The second 'father' to iridology is thought to be [[Nils Liljequist]] from [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=ANPA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=A.N.P.A.|title=Iridology |url=http://www.anpa.asn.au/therapies/iridology|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who greatly suffered from the outgrowth of his lymph nodes. After a round of medication made from iodine and quinine, he observed many differences in the colour of his iris. This observation inspired him to create and publish an atlas in 1893, which contained 258 black and white illustrations and 12 colour illustrations of the iris, known as the [[Diagnosis]] of the Eye.&lt;ref name=Irydolog /&gt;

The German contribution in the field of natural healing is due to a minister Pastor [[Emanuel Felke]], who developed a form of [[homeopathy]] for treating specific illnesses and described new ''iris signs'' in the early 1900s. However, Pastor Felke was subject to long and bitter litigation. The Felke Institute in Gerlingen, Germany, was established as a leading center of iridological research and training.

Iridology became better known in the United States in the 1950s, when [[Bernard Jensen]], an American chiropractor, began giving classes in his own method. This is in direct relationship with P. Johannes Thiel, Eduard Lahn (who became an American under the name of Edward Lane) and J Haskell Kritzer. Jensen emphasized the importance of the body's exposure to toxins, and the use of natural foods as detoxifiers.

==Criticism==
The majority of [[physician|medical doctors]] reject all the claims of all branches of iridology and label them as [[pseudoscience]] or even [[quackery]].&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Iridology Is Nonsense|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics, including most practitioners of medicine, dismiss iridology given that published studies have indicated a lack of success for its claims. To date, [[scientific method|clinical data]] does not support correlation between illness in the body and coinciding observable changes in the iris. In controlled experiments,&lt;ref name="Ernst"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archopht.118.1.120 |title=Iridology: Not Useful and Potentially Harmful |year=2000 |last1=Ernst |first1=E. |journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |volume=118 |pages=120–1 |pmid=10636425 |issue=1 |url=http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=118&amp;page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; practitioners of iridology have performed statistically no better than chance in determining the presence of a disease or condition solely through observation of the iris.

It has been pointed out that the premise of iridology is at odds with the fact that the iris does not undergo substantial changes in an individual's life. Iris texture is a [[phenotypical]] feature that develops during [[gestation]] and remains unchanged after birth. There is no evidence for changes in the iris pattern other than variations in pigmentation in the first year of life and variations caused by [[glaucoma]] treatment.  The stability of iris structures is the foundation of the [[biometric]] technology which uses [[iris recognition]] for identification purposes.&lt;ref name="Chellappaedited" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pankantiedited" /&gt;

==Scientific research into iridology==
Well-controlled scientific evaluation of iridology has shown entirely negative results, with all rigorous [[double blind]] tests failing to find any statistical significance to its claims.

In 2015 the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Australian Government's Department of Health]] published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by [[health insurance]]. Iridology was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found.&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S. Australian review finds no benefit to 17 natural therapies. Science-Based Medicine. |lay-date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German study from 1957 which took more than 4,000 iris photographs of more than 1,000 people concluded that iridology was not useful as a diagnostic tool.&lt;ref name="kibler"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kibler, Max |author2=Sterzing, Ludwig |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14682831|title=Wert und Unwert der Irisdiagnose|location=Stuttgart, Germany|publisher=Hippocrates|date=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Bernard Jensen, a leading American iridologist, and two other iridology proponents failed to establish the basis of their practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not. One iridologist, for example, decided that 88% of the normal patients had kidney disease, while another judged through his iris analysis that 74% of patients who needed artificial kidney treatment were normal.&lt;ref name="simona" /&gt;

Another study was published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' which selected 39 patients who were due to have their gall bladder removed the following day, because of suspected gallstones. The study also selected a group of people who did not have diseased gall bladders to act as a control. A group of 5 iridologists examined a series of slides of both groups' irises. The iridologists could not correctly identify which patients had gall bladder problems and which had healthy gall bladders. For example, one of the iridologists diagnosed 49% of the patients with gall stones as having them and 51% as not having them. The author concluded:, ''"...this study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic aid."''&lt;ref name="Knipschild"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.297.6663.1578 |title=Looking for gall bladder disease in the patient's iris |year=1988 |last1=Knipschild |first1=P. |journal=BMJ |volume=297 |issue=6663 |pages=1578–81 |pmid=3147081 |pmc=1835305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]] raised the question in 2000: "Does iridology work? [...] This search strategy resulted in 77 publications on the subject of iridology. [...] All of the uncontrolled studies and several of the unmasked experiments suggested that iridology was a valid diagnostic tool.  The discussion that follows refers to the 4 controlled, masked evaluations of the diagnostic validity of iridology. [...] In conclusion, few controlled studies with masked evaluation of diagnostic validity have been published. None have found any benefit from iridology."&lt;ref name="Ernst" /&gt;

A 2005 study tested the usefulness of iridology in diagnosing common forms of cancer. An experienced iridology practitioner examined the eyes of 110 total subjects, of which 68 people had proven cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus, prostate, or colorectum, and 42 for whom there was no medical evidence of cancer. The practitioner, who was unaware of their gender or medical details, was asked to suggest a diagnosis for each person and his results were then compared with each subject's known medical diagnosis. The study conclusion was that "Iridology was of no value in diagnosing the cancers investigated in this study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Münstedt K|title=Can iridology detect susceptibility to cancer? A prospective case-controlled study|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 11|volume=11|issue=3|pages=515–519|date=2005|doi=10.1089/acm.2005.11.515|pmid=15992238|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation, licensure, and certification==
In Canada and the United States, iridology is not regulated or licensed by any governmental agency. Numerous organizations offer certification courses.

==Possible harms==
Medical errors—treatment for conditions diagnosed via this method which do not actually exist ([[false positive]] result) or a false sense of security when a serious condition is not diagnosed by this method (false negative result)—could lead to improper or delayed treatment and even loss of life.&lt;ref name="Ernst"/&gt;

'''Kino Border Initiative (KBI)''' since 2008 has united six [[Catholic church|Catholic]] organizations in an effort to be a humanizing presence and to foster bi-national solidarity on the issue of migration on the U.S.-Mexico border through direct assistance and accompaniment, education, research, and advocacy.

==History==
In 2008 and 2009 in [[Nogales, Arizona]], and [[Nogales, Sonora]], Mexico, this work was begun by six organizations: the California Province of the [[Society of Jesus]], [[Jesuit Refugee Service]]/USA, the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, the Mexican Province of the Society of Jesus, the [[Diocese of Tucson]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]]. Its purpose is to break down barriers to humane, just, and workable migration, affirming human dignity and solidarity. KBI gives direct assistance and accompanies migrants, educates communities on both sides of the border, and collaborates with networks of research and advocacy to transform policy at all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asucatholic.org/MissionTrip|title=Mission Trip|website=All Saints Catholic Newman Center|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sees its work in continuity with the historic record of the USA in welcoming immigrants, and in support of international standards for the treatment of refugees.

[[File:SchiaparelliMOLA.jpeg|thumb|200px|Elevation map of crater [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli]] imaged by [[Mars Global Surveyor|MGS]]]]

This is a [[list of craters on Mars]]. There are hundreds of thousands of [[impact crater]]s on [[Mars]], but only some of them have names. This list here contains only named Martian craters starting with the letter O&amp;thinsp;–&amp;thinsp;Z ''(see also lists for [[List of craters on Mars: A–G|A&amp;thinsp;–&amp;thinsp;G]] and [[List of craters on Mars: H–N|H&amp;thinsp;–&amp;thinsp;N]])''.

Large Martian craters (greater than 60 kilometers in diameter) are named after famous scientists and [[science fiction]] authors; smaller ones (less than 60&amp;nbsp;km in diameter) get their names from towns on [[Earth]]. Craters cannot be named for living people, and small crater names are not intended to be commemorative – that is, a small crater isn't actually named after a specific town on Earth, but rather its name comes at random from a pool of terrestrial place names, with some exceptions made for craters near landing sites.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer-Categories" /&gt; Latitude and longitude are given as planetographic coordinates with west longitude.

The [[home computer]]s between 1977 and about 1990 were different from today's uniform and predictable machines. During this time it made economic sense for manufacturers to make microcomputers aimed at the home user. By simplifying the machines, and making use of household items such as television sets and cassette recorders instead of dedicated computer peripherals, the home computer allowed the consumer to own a computer at a fraction of the price of computers oriented to small business. Today, the price of microcomputers has dropped to the point where there's no advantage to building a separate, incompatible series just for home users.

While many office-type personal computers were used in homes, in this list a "home computer" is a [[Factory|factory-assembled]] [[Mass market|mass-marketed]] [[consumer product]], usually at significantly lower cost than contemporary business computers. It would have an alphabetic keyboard and a multi-line alphanumeric display, the ability to run both games software as well as application software and user-written programs, and some removable mass storage device (such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] or [[floppy disk]]).

This list excludes [[smartphones]], [[PDA|personal digital assistant]]s, [[pocket computer]]s, [[laptop computer]]s, [[programmable calculator]]s and pure [[video game]] consoles. Single-board development or evaluation boards, intended to demonstrate a [[microprocessor]], are excluded since these were not marketed to general consumers.

Pioneering kit and assembled hobby microcomputers which generally required electronics skills to build or operate are listed separately, as are computers intended primarily for use in schools. A hobby-type computer often would have required significant expansion of memory and peripherals to make it useful for the usual role of a factory-made home computer. School computers usually had facilities to share expensive peripherals such as disk drives and printers, and often had provision for central administration.

== Attributes ==
Attributes are as typically advertised by the original manufacturer. Popular machines inspired third-party sources for adapters, add-on processors, mass storage, and other peripherals.

"Processor" indicates the microprocessor chip that ran the system. A few home computers had multiple processors, generally used for input/output devices. Processor speeds were not a competitive point among home computer manufacturers, and typically the processor ran either at its maximum rated speed ( between 1 and 4&amp;nbsp;MHz for most processor types here), or at some fraction of the [[Color television|television color subcarrier signal]], for economy of design. Since a crystal oscillator was necessary for stable color, it was often also used as the microprocessor clock source. Many processors were [[second-source]]d, with different manufacturers making the same device under different part numbers. Variations of a basic part number might have been used to indicate minor variations in speed or transistor type, or might indicate fairly significant alterations to the prototype's capabilities.  In the Soviet Bloc countries, manufacturers made functional duplicates of  Western microprocessors under different part number series.

''TV'' indicates the factory configuration produces composite video compatible with a home TV receiver. Some computers came with a built-in [[RF modulator]] to allow connection to the TV receiver antenna terminals; others output composite video for use with a free-standing monitor or external RF modulator. Still others had built-in or proprietary monitors. Often a composite video monitor (monochrome or color) would be substituted for the family TV.  Some standard types of video controller ICs were popular, but see the very detailed [[List of home computers by video hardware]] for a discussion of video capabilities of different models. Memory and TV bandwidth restrictions meant that typical home computers had only a few color choices and perhaps 20 lines of 40 characters of text as an upper limit to their video capabilities. Where the same model was sold in countries using [[PAL]] or [[NTSC]] television standards, sometimes there would be minor variations in the speed of the processor, because NTSC and PAL use different frequencies for the color information and the crystal for the video system was often also used for the processor clock. 

Base mass storage was whatever came in the basic configuration. Some machines had built-in cassette drives or optional external drives, others relied on the consumer to provide a cassette recorder. [[Compact_Cassette#Data_recording|Cassette recorders]] had the primary virtue of being widely available as a consumer product at the time. Typically a home computer would generate audio tones to encode data, that could be stored on audio tape through a direct connection to the recorder.  Re-loading the data required re-winding the tape. The home computer would contain some circuit such as a [[phase-locked loop]] to convert audio tones back into digital data.  Since consumer cassette recorders were not made for remote control, the user would have to manually operate the recorder in response to prompts from the computer.  Random access to data on a cassette was impossible, since the entire tape would have to be searched to retrieve any particular item. A few manufacturers integrated a cassette tape drive or cassette-like tape mechanism into the console, but these variants were made obsolete by the reduction in cost of floppy diskette drives.

Floppy disk drives were initially very costly compared to the system purchase price.  Plug-in [[ROM cartridge]]s containing game or application software were popular in earlier home computers since they were easier to use, faster, and more reliable than cassette tapes. Once diskette drives became available at low cost, cartridges declined in popularity since they were more expensive to manufacture than reproducing a diskette, and had comparatively small capacity compared to diskettes.  A few cartridges contained battery-backed memory that allowed users to save data (for example, game high scores) between uses of the cartridge.

Typically there were several models or variants within a product line, especially to account for different international video standards and power supplies; see the linked articles for variants and consequences of variations. "Compatibility" indicates some measure of compatibility with a parent type, however, sometimes incompatibility existed even within a product family. A "clone" system has identical hardware and is functionally interchangeable with its prototype; a few clone systems relied on illicit copies of system [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] to make them functional.

This type of microcomputer required significant electronics skills to assemble or operate. They were sometimes sold in [[Electronic kit|kit]] form that required the user to insert and solder components in a [[printed circuit board]]. They may have had just [[front panel|blinking lights and toggle switches]], or a hexadecimal display and a numeric keypad. While some units were possibly expandable to the "checkbook balancing/homework typing" stage, most were intended more for education on the use and application of microprocessors.

==School computers==
These were aimed at the class room, not the living room. Some types were popular in the centrally planned economies of eastern Europe where Western computers were scarce, or in the early days of computer education in Western schools. Popular home computers of the period{{clarify|date=July 2011}} were fitted with various types of network interfaces{{clarify|date=July 2011}} to allow sharing of files, large disk drives, and printers, and often allowed a teacher to interact with a student, supervise the system usage, and carry out administrative tasks from a host computer.

==Cardboard  and demonstrator "computers"==
Logic demonstrators illustrated some of the logical principles of computer circuits, but were incapable of automatic operation or non-trivial calculations. Some were literally cardboard, others used combinations of switches and lamps to show how logical operations worked. Some products demonstrated logical operations purely mechanically.

The '''NIROSETI''' ('''Near-InfraRed Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence''') is an astronomical program to search for artificial signals in the optical ([[Visible spectrum|visible]]) and [[near infrared]] (NIR) wavebands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. It is the first dedicated near-infrared [[SETI]] experiment. &lt;ref name='Centauri 2015'&gt;[https://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32837 SETI Explores the Near-Infrared]. Paul Gilster, ''Centauri Dreams'', 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='arXiv 2014'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2618.pdf A near-infrared SETI experiment: probability distribution of false coincidences] (PDF). Jerome Maire, Shelley A. Wright, Dan Werthimer, Richard R. Treffers, Geoffrey W. Marcy, Remington P. S. Stone, [[Frank Drake]], [[Andrew Siemion]]. arXiv. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was created by a collaboration of scientists from the [[University of California, San Diego]], [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of Toronto]], and the [[SETI Institute]]. It uses the [[Anna L. Nickel telescope|Anna Nickel]] 1-m telescope at the [[Lick Observatory]], situated on the summit of Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose, California, USA.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;Steven S.

==Overview==
[[Image:Lick Observatory Shane Telescope.jpg|right|thumb|Lick Observatory in California]]

The NIROSETI project is based on the assumption that hypothetical communicative extraterrestrials may send out pulsed [[laser]] signals in the optical, as well as infrared spectrum. Near-infrared offers a possible way for signal transmission since there is a decrease in both interstellar extinction and Galactic background compared to optical wavelengths.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G_Marcy/publication/305871297_A_near-infrared_SETI_experiment_commissioning_data_analysis_and_performance_results/links/59f64e30a6fdcc075ec5fe2f/A-near-infrared-SETI-experiment-commissioning-data-analysis-and-performance-results.pdf near-infrared SETI experiment: commissioning, data analysis, and performance results] (PDF).

Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, University of California San Diego. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The near-infrared bands remain largely unexplored because instruments capable of capturing short pulses of infrared light have only recently become available.&lt;ref name='OIR'/&gt;&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'/&gt;

The NIROSETI instrument makes use of the 1-meter optical [[Anna L. Nickel telescope|Nickel telescope]] located at the [[Lick Observatory]] in California to search for near-infrared ([[laser]]) transmissions from extraterrestrial communication or technosignatures. This project was funded by the Bill and Susan Bloomfield Foundation and is based upon a predecessor called Lick Optical SETI instrument, conducted between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref name='OIR'/&gt; Professor Shelley Wright leads the team that built and operates the NIROSETI program.&lt;ref name='Wright 2014'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2617.pdf A near-infrared SETI experiment: instrument overview]A near-infrared SETI experiment: instrument overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIROSETI instrument employs a new generation of near-infrared (900 to 1700&amp;nbsp;nm) detectors, cooled at -25&amp;nbsp;°C, that have a high speed response (&gt;1&amp;nbsp;GHz) and gain comparable to photomultiplier tubes, while also producing very low noise,&lt;ref name='arXiv 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='OIR'/&gt; and significantly reducing false positives.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; Its field-of-view is 2.5"x2.5" each,&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AAS...22812004D A near-Infrared SETI Experiment: Alignment and Astrometric precision].

on detecting short (nanosecond) pulsed laser emissions. The NIROSETI instrument is also being used to study variability of very short natural near-infrared transient stars.&lt;ref name='arXiv 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2015-03-extraterrestrial-intelligence-realms.html Search for extraterrestrial intelligence extends to new realms].

==Targets==

The NIROSETI survey has been designed for observing several thousand objects over a few years, and commenced full operations on 28 January 2016. During a clear night of observations, about 20 to 30 objects are observed.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; Because infrared light penetrates farther through gas and dust than visible light, this search will extend to stars thousands of [[light-years]] away.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'/&gt; The initial target sample is mostly main-sequence and giant stars located within 50 [[parsec]]s from Earth, drawn from the Breakthrough Listen program target list.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/BL_Target_Stars_All_Sky_3Jan2016.pdf Breakthrough Listen - Stellar Targets: All Sky]. [[Berkeley SETI Research Center]]. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06227.pdf The Breakthrough Listen Search for Intelligent Life: Target Selection of Nearby Stars and Galaxies] (PDF). Howard Isaacson, Andrew P. V. Siemion, et al. arXiv, 22 Jan 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample of targets also includes 82 galaxies for being the nearest representatives of the five major morphological classes of galaxies (20 [[Spiral galaxy|spirals]], 36 [[Elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], 15 dwarf [[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|spheroidals]], 9 [[Irregular galaxy|irregulars]], and 2 [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies),&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; as well as stars that triggered alarms on other targeted [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI surveys]].&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;

A significant drawback is that the extraterrestrial laser signals would need to be transmitted in the direction of the Solar System in order to be detected.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'/&gt;

'''Normalization process theory''' ('''NPT''') is a derivative  [[sociological theory]] of the implementation, embedding, and integration of new technologies and organizational innovations developed originally from a collective set of learning workshops and included a large number of people including [[Carl R. May]], Tracy Finch, Elizabeth Murray, Anne Rogers, Catherine Pope, Anne Kennedy, Pauline Ong and . The theory is a contribution to the field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS), and is the result of a programme of theory building by May and a range of academics from applied social science to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;May CR, Mair F, Finch T, Macfarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, Rapley T, Ballini L, Ong BN, Rogers A, Murray E, Elwyn G, Légaré F, Gunn J, Montori VM. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: normalization process theory. Implement Sci. 2009 May 21;4:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Through three iterations, the theory has built upon the [[normalization process model]] previously developed by May et al. to explain the social processes that lead to the routine embedding of innovative health technologies.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization process theory focuses attention on agentic contributions – the things that individuals and groups do to operationalize new or modified modes of practice as they interact with dynamic elements of their environments. It defines the implementation, embedding, and integration as a process that occurs when participants deliberately initiate and seek to sustain a sequence of events that bring it into operation. The dynamics of implementation processes are complex, but normalization process theory facilitates understanding by focusing attention on the mechanisms through which participants invest and contribute to them. It reveals  "the work that actors do as they engage with some ensemble of activities (that may include new or changed ways of thinking, acting, and organizing) and by which means it becomes routinely embedded in the matrices of already existing, socially patterned, knowledge and practices".&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43(3), 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt;  These have explored objects, agents, and contexts. In a paper published under a [[creative commons license]], May and colleagues describe how, since 2006, NPT has undergone three iterations.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Sibley, A. and Hunt, K. (2014) 'The nursing work of hospital-based clinical practice guideline implementation: An explanatory systematic review using Normalisation Process Theory', International Journal of Nursing Studies, 51(2), 289-299&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Objects''. The first iteration of the theory focused attention on the relationship between the properties of a complex healthcare intervention and the collective action of its users. Here, agents' contributions are made in reciprocal relationship with the emergent capability that they find in the objects – the ensembles of behavioural and cognitive practices – that they enact. These socio-material capabilities are governed by the possibilities and constraints presented by objects, and the extent to which they can be made workable and integrated in practice as they are mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2006. A rational model for assessing and evaluating complex interventions in health care. BMC Health Services Research. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, C., et al., 2007. Understanding the implementation of complex interventions in health care: the normalization process model. BMC Health Services Research. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Agents''. The second iteration of the theory built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this was linked to the mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., Finch, T., 2009. Implementation, embedding, and integration: an outline of Normalization Process Theory. Sociology. 43, 535-554.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what people do to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what people do to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what people do to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what people do to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core of the theory, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice. 
* ''Contexts''. The third iteration of the theory developed the analysis of agentic contributions by offering an account of centrally important structural and cognitive resources on which agents draw as they take action.&lt;ref&gt;May, C., 2013. Towards a general theory of implementation. Implementation Science. 8, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, dynamic elements of social contexts are experienced by agents as capacity (the social structural resources, that they possess, including informational and material resources, and social norms and roles) and potential (the social cognitive resources that they possess, including knowledge and beliefs, and individual intentions and shared commitments). These resources are mobilized by agents when they invest in the ensembles of practices that are the objects of implementation.

Normalization process theory is regarded as a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] that is located within the 'turn to materiality' in STS. It therefore fits well with the case-study oriented approach to empirical investigation used in STS. It also appears to be a straightforward alternative to [[actor–network theory]] in that it does not insist on the agency of non-human actors, and seeks to be explanatory rather than descriptive. However, because normalization process theory specifies a set of generative mechanisms that empirical investigation has shown to be relevant to implementation and integration of new technologies, it can also be used in larger scale structured and comparative studies. Although it fits well with the interpretive approach of [[ethnography]] and other [[qualitative research methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, May CR, Montori VM, Mair FS.  Understanding patients' experiences of treatment burden in chronic heart failure using normalization process theory.  Annals of Family Medicine 2011;14(4):351-360.&lt;/ref&gt; it also lends itself to [[systematic review]]&lt;ref&gt;Mair F, May C, O'Donnell C, Finch T, Sullivan F, Murray E.  Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.  Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2012;90:357-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gallacher K, Jani B, Morrison D, Macdonald S, Blane D, Erwin P, May CR, Montori VM, Eton DT, Smith F, Batty DG, Mair FS.  Qualitative systematic reviews of treatment burden in stroke, heart failure, and diabetes - Methodological challenges and solutions.  BMC Medical Research Methodology 2013;13(10).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Statistical survey|survey]] [[research methods]]. As a middle range theory, it can be federated with other theories to explain empirical phenomena. It is compatible with theories of the transmission and organization of innovations, especially [[diffusion of innovations]] theory, [[labor process theory]], and psychological theories including the [[theory of planned behavior]] and [[social learning theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1697">In [[robotics]], '''obstacle avoidance''' is the task of satisfying some control objective subject to non-intersection or non-collision position constraints. In [[unmanned air vehicle]]s, it is a hot topic {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. What is critical about [[obstacle]] avoidance concept in this area is the growing need of usage of unmanned aerial vehicles in urban areas for especially military applications where it can be very useful in city wars. Normally obstacle avoidance is considered to be distinct from [[motion planning|path planning]] in that one is usually implemented as a reactive control law while the other involves the [[pre-computation]] of an obstacle-free path which a controller will then guide a robot along.

'''Photoconductive atomic force microscopy''' ('''PC-AFM''') is a variant of [[atomic force microscopy]] that measures [[photoconductivity]] in addition to surface forces.

==Background==
Multi-layer photovoltaic cells have gained popularity since mid 1980s.&lt;ref name="tangten"/&gt; At the time, research was primarily focused on single-layer [[Photovoltaic effect|photovoltaic]] (PV) devices between two electrodes, in which PV properties rely heavily on the nature of the electrodes. In addition, single layer PV devices notoriously have a poor [[Fill factor (solar cell)|fill factor]]. This property is largely attributed to resistance that is characteristic of the organic layer. The fundamentals of pc-AFM are modifications to traditional AFM and focus on the use of pc-AFM in PV characterization. In pc-AFM the major modifications include: a second illumination laser, an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter. These components assist in the precise alignment of the illumination laser and the AFM tip within the sample. Such modifications must complement the existing principals and instrumental modules of pc-AFM so as to minimize the effect of mechanical noise and other interferences on the cantilever and sample.

The original exploration of the PV effect can be accredited to research published by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="span"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. Spanggaard |author2=F.C. Krebs |journal= Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2004.02.021 |year=2004|volume=83|page= 125|title=A brief history of the development of organic and polymeric photovoltaics|issue=2–3|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/a-brief-history-of-the-development-of-organic-and-polymeric-photovoltaics(027e5008-4922-47ea-95ab-b60f1fb2271b).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Becquerel noticed the generation of a [[photocurrent]] after illumination when he submerged platinum electrodes within an aqueous solution of either [[silver chloride]] or [[silver bromide]].&lt;ref name="AEB"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.

Sci. |year=1839|volume=9|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, Pochettino and Volmer studied the first organic compound, [[anthracene]], in which photoconductivity was observed.&lt;ref name="span" /&gt;&lt;ref name="poch"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Pochettino|journal= Acad. Lincei Rend. |year=1906|volume= 15|page= 355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vol"&gt;{{cite journal|author=M.

The working premises for all types of AFM techniques are largely dependent on the fundamentals of the AFM cantilever, metallic tip, scanning piezo-tube and the feedback loop that transfers information from lasers that guide the motion of the probe across the surface of a sample. The ultra-fine dimensions of the tip and the way the tip scans the surface produces lateral resolutions of 500&amp;nbsp;nm or less. In AFM, the cantilever and tip functions as a mass on a spring. When a force acts on the spring (cantilever), the spring response is directly related to the magnitude of the force.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt; ''k'' is defined as the force constant of the cantilever.

'''[[Hooke's law]] for cantilever motion:'''&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f = - kd &lt;/math&gt;

The forces acting on the tip are such that the spring (cantilever) remains soft but responds to the applied force, with a detectable resonant frequency, ''f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''. In Hooke's law, ''k'' is the spring constant of the cantilever and ''m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as the mass acting on the cantilever: the mass of the cantilever itself and the mass of the tip. The relationship between ''f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the spring constant is such that ''k'' must be very small in order to make the spring soft. Since ''k'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' are in a ratio, the value of ''m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' must also decrease to increase the value of the ratio. Manipulating the values in this way provides the necessary high resonance frequency. A typical ''m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' value has a magnitude of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg and creates an ''f&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Binning" /&gt;

'''Expression for [[resonant frequency]] of a spring:'''

&lt;math&gt;f_o = \frac{1}{2\pi }\sqrt{\frac{k}{m_o}}&lt;/math&gt;

Several forces affect the behavior of the [[cantilever]]: attractive and repulsive [[Van der Waals forces]], and [[electrostatic repulsion]].&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt; Changes in these forces are monitored by a guide laser that is reflected off the back of the cantilever and detected by a [[photodetector]].&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; Attractive forces between the atoms on the sample surface and the atom at the AFM tip draw the cantilever tip closer to the surface.&lt;ref name="coff"/&gt; When the cantilever tip and the sample surface come within a range of a few angstroms repulsive forces come into play as a result of [[electrostatic interactions]].&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DePaula" /&gt; There is also a force exerted from the cantilever pressing down on the tip. The magnitude of the force exerted by the cantilever is dependent upon the direction of its motion, whether it is attracted or repelled from the sample surface&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt; When the tip of the cantilever and the surface come into contact, the single atom at the point of the tip and the atoms on the surface exhibit a [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. The atoms exhibit attractive forces until a certain point and then experience repulsion from one another. The term ''r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the separation at which the sum of the potentials between the two atoms is zero &lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DePaula" /&gt;

'''Force on AFM tip in terms of [[Lennard-Jones potential]]''':&lt;ref name="Atkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DePaula" /&gt;

Modifications of this early work have been implemented to perform AFM analysis on both conducting and non-conducting materials. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) is one such modification technique. The c-AFM technique operates by measuring fluctuations in current from the biased tip and sample while simultaneously measuring changes in the topographical features.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt; In all techniques of AFM, two modes of operation can be used: contact mode and non-contact mode.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt; In c-AFM resonant contact mode is used to obtain topographical from current that is measured between the biased AFM tip and the sample surface.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt; In this type of operation, the current is measured in the small space between the tip and the sample surface.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt; This quantification is based on the relationship between the current traveling through the sample and layer thickness.&lt;ref name="Olbrich"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Olbrich, A.|journal=Appl.

The piezo-tube scanner is responsible for the direction of tip displacement during a sample analysis, and is dependent on the mode of analysis. The piezo components are either arranged orthogonally or manufactured as a cylinder.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; In all techniques, sample topography is measured by the movement of the x and y piezos. When performing non-contact mode pc-AFM, the piezo-tube keeps the probe from moving in the x and y direction and measures the photocurrent between the sample surface and conducting tip in the z-direction.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; 
[[File:Afmfig3.jpg|thumb|Sample scanning piezo-tube in AFM&lt;ref name="Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Xiaojun, T.|journal=Ultramicroscopy |volume=105|year=2005|pages=336–342|doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2005.06.046|title=System errors quantitative analysis of sample-scanning AFM |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
The principles of the piezo-tube is dependent upon how the [[piezo-electric]] material reacts with an applied voltage to either the interior or exterior of the tube. When voltage is applied to the two electrodes connected to the scanner, the tube will expand or contract causing motion to the AFM tip in the direction of this movement. This phenomenon is illustrated as the piezo-tube becomes displaced by an angle, θ. As the tube is displaced, the sample that, in traditional AFM is fixed to the tube generates lateral translation and rotation relative to the AFM tip, thus movement of the tip is generated in the x and y directions&lt;ref name="Xiao"/&gt; When voltage is applied of the inside of the tube, movement in the z-direction is implemented.
The relationship between the movement of the piezo-tube and the direction of the displacement of the AFM tip assumes that the tube is perfectly symmetric.&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt; When no voltage is applied to the tube the z-axis bisects the tube, sample and sample stage symmetrically. When a voltage is applied to the exterior of the tube (x and y motion), the expansion of the tube can be understood as a circular arc. In this equation, the ''r'' term indicates the outside radius of the piezo-tube, ''R'' is the curvature radius of the tube with applied voltage, ''θ'' is the bend angle of the tube, ''L'' is the initial length of the tube and ''ΔL'' is the extension of the tube after the voltage is applied.&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt; The change in length of the piezo-tube, ''ΔL'', is expressed as the intensity of the electric field applied to the exterior of the tube, the voltage along the x-axis, U&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and the thickness of the wall of the tube.

'''Expressions for bend geometry of piezo-tube:'''&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L-\Delta L = \left ( R-r \right )\Theta &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L+\Delta L = \left ( R+r \right )\Theta &lt;/math&gt;

'''Length displacement in terms of exterior electric field:'''&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta L = Ed_{31} = \left ( \frac{d_{31}L}{t} \right )U_x&lt;/math&gt;

'''Expression for tube displacement, ''θ'':'''&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Theta = \frac{L}{R} = \left ( \frac{d_{31}L}{t_{r}} \right )U_x&lt;/math&gt;

With the calculation of ''θ'', the displacement of the probe in the x and z directions can be calculated as:

'''Expressions for probe displacement in the x- and z-directions:'''&lt;ref name="Xiao" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dx = (R+\chi )\left ( 1-cos\Theta \right )+\left ( D_{ss} +D_{sp}\right )U_{x}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dz = \left ( \left ( R + \chi \right )sin\Theta - L \right )+\left ( D_{ss} + D_{sp} \right )\left ( cos\Theta -1 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Another fundamental concept of all AFM is the [[feedback loop]]. The feedback loop is particularly important in non-contact AFM techniques, particularly in pc-AFM. As previously mentioned, in non-contact mode the cantilever is stationary and the tip does not come into physical contact with the sample surface.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt; The cantilever behaves as a spring and oscillates at its resonance frequency. Topological variance causes the spring-like oscillations of the cantilever to change amplitude and phase in order to prevent the tip from colliding with sample topographies.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; The non-contact feedback loop is used to control that changes in the oscillations of the cantilever.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; 
The application of AFM on non-conducting samples (c-AFM) has in recent years evolved into the modification used for analysis of morphologies on the local scale, particularly morphologies at heterojunctions of multilayered samples.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangone"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dang, X.D., Nguyen, T.Q.|title= Photoconductive AFM of Organic Solar Cells|website= Asylum Research Atomic Force Microscopes. 2010 |url=http://www.asylumresearch.com/Applications/PhotoconductiveAFM/PhotoconductiveAFM.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sakaguchi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sakaguchi, H.|journal=Jpn.

==Instrumentation==
The instrumentation involved for pc-AFM is very similar to that necessary for traditional AFM or the modified conductive AFM. The main difference between pc-AFM and other types of AFM instruments is the illumination source that is focused through the inverted [[microscope objective]] and the [[neutral density filter]] that is positioned adjacent to the illumination source.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dant" /&gt; The technical parameters of pc-AFM are identical to those of traditional AFM techniques.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dant" /&gt; This section will focus on the instrumentation necessary for AFM and then detail the requirements for pc-AFM modification. 
The main instrumental components to all AFM techniques are the conductive AFM cantilever and tip, the modified [[Piezoelectricity|piezo]] components and the sample substrate.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geisse"&gt;Geisse, N. AFM and combined optical techniques. Application Note 12 Asylum research&lt;/ref&gt; The components for photoconductive modification include: the illumination source (532&amp;nbsp;nm laser), filter and inverted microscope. When modifying traditional AFM for pc application, all components must be combined such that they do not interfere with one another and so that various sources of noise and mechanical interference do not disrupt the optical components.&lt;ref name="geisse" /&gt;

In traditional instrumentation, the stage is a cylindrical piezo-tube scanner that minimizes the effect of [[Noise (electronics)|mechanical noise]].&lt;ref name="geisse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite web|author=Park Systems Inc. |title=Development of Crosstalk Eliminated (XE) Atomic Force Microscopy |url=http://www.parkafm.com/AFM_technology/technology.php |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022001329/http://www.parkafm.com/AFM_technology/technology.php |archivedate=October 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cylindrical piezos are between 12 and 24&amp;nbsp;mm in length and 6 and 12&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name="mayer" /&gt; The exterior of the piezo-tube is coated with a thin layer of conducting metal so that this region can sustain an [[electric field]].&lt;ref name="mayer" /&gt; The interior of the cylinder is divided into four regions (x and y regions) by non-conducting metallic strips.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park" /&gt; Electrical leads are fixed to one end and the exterior wall of the cylinder so that a current can be applied. When a voltage is applied to the exterior, the cylinder expands in x and y direction. Voltage along the interior of the tube causes cylinder expansion in the z-direction and thus movement of the tip in the z-direction.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geisse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park" /&gt; The placement of the piezo tube is dependent upon the type of AFM performed and the mode of analysis. However the z-piezo must always be fixed above the tip and cantilever to control the z-motion.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; This configuration is most often seen in the c-AFM and pc-AFM modifications to make room for additional instrumental components which are placed below the scanning stage.&lt;ref name="geisse" /&gt; This is particularly true for pc-AFM, which must have the piezo-components arranged above the cantilever and tip so that the illumination laser can transmit through the sample.

In some configurations, the piezo components can be arranged in a tripod design. In this type of set-up, the x, y and z components are arranged orthogonally to one another with their apex attached to a movable pivot point.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; Similar to the cylindrical piezo, in the tripod design the voltage is applied to the piezo corresponding to the appropriate direction of tip displacement.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; In this type of set-up the sample and substrate are mounted on top of the z-piezo component. When the x and y piezo components are in use, the orthogonal design causes them to push against the base of the z-piezo, causing the z-piezo to rotate about a fixed point.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; Applying voltage to the z-piezo causes the tube to move up and down on its pivot point.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt; 
[[File:Afmpiezofig1.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the tripod piezo&lt;ref name="mats"&gt;Materials Evaluation and Engineering Inc. Handbook of Analytical Methods For Materials. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The other essential components of AFM instrumentation include the AFM tip module, which includes: the AFM tip, the cantilever, and the guiding laser.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;
When the piezo-tube is positioned above the cantilever and tip, the [[Laser|guiding laser]] is focused through the tube and onto a mirror that rests on tip of the cantilever.&lt;ref name="mats"/&gt; The guiding laser is reflected off of the mirror and detected by a photodetector. The laser senses when the forces acting on the tip change. The reflected laser beam from this phenomenon reaches the [[detector]].&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park" /&gt; The output from this detector acts as a response to the changes in force and the cantilever adjusts the position of the tip, while keeping constant the force that acts on the tip.&lt;ref name="Skoog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="park" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mats"/&gt;

The instrumentation of conductive AFM (c-AFM) has evolved with the desire to measure local electrical properties of materials with high resolutions. The essential components are: the piezo-tube, the guide laser, the conducting tip, and cantilever. Although these components are identical to traditional AFM their configuration is tailored to measuring surface currents on the local scale. 
As mentioned previously, the piezo-tube can be placed either above or below the sample, depending on the application of the instrumentation. In the case of c-AFM, repulsive contact mode is the predominantly used to obtain electric current images from the surface as the sample moves in the x and y direction. Placing the z-piezo above the cantilever allows for better control of the cantilever and tip during analysis.&lt;ref name="Explorer" /&gt;
The material that comprises the conductive tip and cantilever can be customized for a particular application. Metal-coated cantilevers, gold wires, all-metal cantilevers and [[diamond]] cantilevers are used.&lt;ref name="osh"&gt;{{cite journal|author=O’Shea, S.J.|journal=Rev. Sci.

The main components and instrumentation of c-AFM instrumentation are identical to that required for a pc-AFM module. The only modifications are the illumination source, filter and inverted microscope objective that are located beneath the sample substrate. In fact, most pc-AFM instruments are simply modified from existing cp-AFM instrumentation. The first report of this instrumental modification came in 2008. In that paper, Lee and coworkers implemented the aforementioned modifications to examine the resolution of photocurrent imaging. Their design consisted of three main units: a conductive mirror plate, steering mirror and laser source.
The main difficulty with the previously existing c-AFM instrumentation is the inability of the technique for characterizing [[photonic]] devices.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee, J.|journal=Ultramicroscopy|doi=10.1016/j.ultramic.2008.04.077 |volume=108 |year=2008|pages= 1090–1093|title=Construction of pcAFM module to measure photoconductance with a nano-scale spatial resolution|issue=10|pmid=18562107|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it is difficult to measure changes in local and nano-scale electrical properties that result from the photonic effect.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The optical illumination component (laser) was added to the c-AFM module in order to make such properties visible. Early in development, the main concerns regarding pc-AFM include: physical configuration, laser disturbance and laser alignment.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Although many of these concerns have been resolved pc-AFM modules are still widely modified from c-AFM and traditional AFM instruments.

The first main concern deals with component configuration and whether or not there is physically enough space for modification in the cramped c-AFM module. The component configuration must be such the addition of the laser illumination component does not cause disturbance to other units.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madl|first=M.|last2=Brezna|first2=W.|last3=Klang|first3=P.|last4=Andrews|first4=A.

First attempts to address these two issues was to place a prism between the sample tip and the surface such that the prism would allow the illumination laser to reflect at the interface between the prism and the laser and thus be focused to a localized spot on the sample surface.&lt;ref name="Sakaguchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; However, lack of space for the prism and the production of multiple light reflections when introducing a prism required a different concept for configuration.

The module constructed by Lee et al. implemented a tilted mirror plate that was positioned underneath the sample substrate. This conductive mirror was tilted at 45° and successfully reflected the illuminating laser to a focused spot directly underneath the conductive tip.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The steering mirror was employed as a means of controlling the trajectory of the laser source, with this addition the position of the reflected beam on the sample could be easily adjusted for placement underneath the AFM tip.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The illumination laser source was a diode-pumped solid-state laser system that produced a wavelength of 532&amp;nbsp;nm and a spot of 1&amp;nbsp;mm in the sample.
[[File:Pcafmassemb.jpg|thumb|pc-AFM module with conducting mirror]]
The addition of the mirror and laser underneath the sample substrate results in a higher scanning level due to raising the sample substrate. This configuration has no effect on any other instrument component and does not affect AFM performance.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; This result was confirmed by identical topographical images that were taken with and without the placement of the mirror and laser. This particular set-up required the separation of the x, y and z piezo-scanners The separation of piezo-tubes accounts for the elimination of x-z cross-coupling and scanning-size errors, which is common in traditional AFM.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

In addition there was no evidence of laser interferences between the guiding laser and the irradiation laser. The guiding laser, at a wavelength of 650&amp;nbsp;nm, hits the mirror on the back of the conducting cantilever from vertical trajectory and is reflected away from the cantilever towards the position sensitive [[photodetector]] (PSPD).&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The illumination beam, on the other hand, travels from underneath the sample platform and is reflected into position by the reflecting mirror. The angle of the mirror plate ensures that the beam does not extend past the sample surface.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

The conductive AFM tip was easily aligned over the reflected illumination beam. The laser spot in the sample was reported to be 1mm in size and can be found using the AFM recording device.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; A convenience of this technique is that laser alignment is only necessary for imaging in the z-direction because the photocurrents are mapped in this direction.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Therefore, normal AFM/c-AFM can be implemented for analysis in the x and y directions.
The instrumental module proposed by Lee et al. produced spot sizes from the illumination laser of 1&amp;nbsp;mm in thicknesses. Recent applications have altered Lee’s design in order to decrease spot size while simultaneously increasing the intensity of this laser. Recent instrumentation has replaced the angled mirror with an inverted microscope and a neutral density filter.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grovestwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dant" /&gt; In this device the x and y piezos, illumination laser and inverted microscopy are confined underneath the sample substrate, while the z-piezo remains above the conductive cantilever.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grovestwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Westenhoff, S. |journal= J.

In more recent studies, pc-AFM has been employed to gather information regarding the photoactive regions from the use of [[quantum dots]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madl|first=M.|last2=Brezna|first2=W.|last3=Strasser|first3=G.|last4=Klang|first4=P.|last5=Andrews|first5=A.

==Sampling==
Sample preparation of the OPV is of the utmost importance when performing pc-AFM studies. The sampling substrate is recommended to be conductive, as well as transparent, to the light source which is irradiated upon it.&lt;ref name="taub"&gt;{{cite web|author1=M. Taub |author2=B. Menzel |author3=G. Khanna |author4=E. Lilleodden |title= SPM Training Manual, Vers. 2.0|publisher= Laboratory for Advanced Materials, Stanford University|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have used [[indium tin oxide|ITO]]-coated glass as their conductive substrate. Because of high cost of ITO, however, there have been attempts to utilize other semiconducting layers, such as [[zinc oxide]] (ZnO) and carbon nanotubes as an alternative to ITO.&lt;ref name="hop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Although these semiconductors are relatively inexpensive, high quality ITO layers are still being used extensively for PV applications. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate), more commonly known as [[PEDOT:PSS]], is a transparent, polymeric conductive layer which is usually placed between the ITO and the active OPV layer. The PEDOT:PSS is a conductive polymer is stable over various applied charges.&lt;ref name="dam"&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Damjanovic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88W3fMqNkRwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-12-369431-7|title= The Science of Hysteresis|year=2006|volume=3|editors= I. Mayergoyz and G.

==An example of OPV fabrication==
A recently developed OPV system based on tetrabenzoporphryin (BP) and either [6,6]-phenyl-C&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is explained in detail as follows.&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; In this study, the precursor to BP (1,4:8,11:15,18:22,25-tetraethano-29H,31H-tetrabenzo[b,g,l,q]porphyrin (CP) solution is applied as the starting film, and was thermally annealed which caused the CP to convert into BP.&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; The BP:fullerene layer serves as the undoped layer within the device. For surface measurements, the undoped layer is rinsed with a few drops of chloroform and spin-dried until the BP network is exposed at the donor/acceptor interface.&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; For bulk heterojunction characterization, an additional fullerene solution is spin-coated onto the undoped layer, a thin layer of lithium fluoride is then deposited followed by either an aluminum or gold cathode which is thermally annealed to the device.&lt;ref name="xin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; The thin layer of lithium fluoride is deposited to help prevent the oxidation of the device.&lt;ref name="angus"&gt;{{cite book|author=Macleod, H A|title= Thin-Film Optical Filters|edition= 3|isbn=978-1-4200-7302-7|place=London|publisher= Institute of Physics|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controlling the thickness of these layers plays a significant role in the generation of the efficiency of the PV cells. Typically, the thickness of the active layers is usually smaller than 100&amp;nbsp;nm to produce photocurrents. This dependence on layer thickness is due to the probability that an electron is able to travel distances on the order of exciton diffusion length within the applied electric field. It should be noted that many of the organic semiconductors used in the PV devices are sensitive to water and oxygen.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt; This is due to the likelihood of photo-oxidation which can occur when exposed to these conditions.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt; While the top metal contact can prevent some of this, many studies are either performed in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, or under [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV).&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;

Once the sample preparation is complete, the sample is placed onto the scanning stage of the pc-AFM module. This scanning stage is used for x-y piezo translation, completely independent of the z-direction while using a z-piezo scanner. The piezo-electric material within this scanner converts a change in the applied potential into mechanical motion which moves the samples with nanometer resolution and accuracy. There are two variations in which the z-piezo scanner functions; one is contact mode while the other is tapping mode.

Many commercial AFM cantilever tips have pre-measured resonant frequencies and force constants which are provided to the customer. As sampling proceeds, the cantilever tip’s position changes, which causes the scanning laser wavelength (650&amp;nbsp;nm) to deviate from its original position on the detector.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taub" /&gt; The z-piezo scanner then recognizes this deviation and moves vertically to return the laser spot to its set position.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt; This vertical movement by the z-piezo scanner is correlated to a change in voltage.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt; Sampling in contact mode relies upon intermolecular forces between the tip and surface as depicted by [[Van der Waals force]]. As the sampling begins, the tip is moved close to the sample which creates a weakly attractive force between them. Another force which is often present in contact mode is capillary force due to hydration on the sample surface. This force is due to the ability of the water to contact the tip, thus creating an undesirable attractive force. [[Capillary force]], along with several other sources of tip contamination, are key factors in the decreased resolution observed while sampling

[[File:Afmtiptwo.jpg|thumb|left|Decreased resolution caused by rounding of the AFM tip.]]

There are considerations which need to be taken into account when determining which mode is optimal for sampling for a given application. It has been shown that sampling in contact mode with very soft samples can damage the sample and render it useless for further studies.&lt;ref name="shah" /&gt; Sampling in non-contact mode is less destructive to the sample, but the tip is more likely to drift out of contact with the surface and thus it may not record data.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt; Drifting of the tip is also seen due to piezo hysteresis, which causes displacement due to molecular friction and polarization effects due to the applied electric field.
It is important to note the correlation between resolution and curvature of tip radius. Early STM tips used by Binning and Rohrer were fairly large, anywhere between some hundred nm to 1&amp;nbsp;µm in radius.&lt;ref name="binn" /&gt; In more recent work, the tip radius of curvature was mentioned as 10–40&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="hama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pingthree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taub" /&gt; By reducing the radius of curvature of the tip, it allows for the enhanced detection of deviations within the OPVs surface morphology. Tips often need to be replaced due to tip rounding, which leads to a decrease in the resolution.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt; Tip rounding occurs due to the loss of outermost atoms present at the apex of the tip which can be a result of excessive force applied or character of the sample.&lt;ref name="leeone" /&gt;

Because of the extremely small radius of the AFM tip, the illumination source is allowed to be focused tighter, thus increasing its efficiency. Typical arrangements for pc-AFM contain a low powered, 532&amp;nbsp;nm laser (2–5&amp;nbsp;mW) whose beam is reflected off mirrors located beneath the scanning stage.&lt;ref name="ping" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pingthree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shah" /&gt; Through the use of a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD), the tip can easily be positioned directly over the laser spot.&lt;ref name="taub" /&gt; [[Xenon arc lamp]]s have also been widely used as illumination sources, but are atypical in recent work.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; In a study by Coffey et al., lasers of two different wavelengths (532&amp;nbsp;nm and 405&amp;nbsp;nm) are irradiated onto the same sample area.&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt; With this work, they have shown images with identical contrast which proves that the photocurrent variations are less related to spatial absorbance variation.&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;

[[File:Photocurrent.jpg|thumb|The variation in the photocurrent from two different illumination sources.|Different illumination sources show nearly identical photocurrent maps&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;]] Most sampling procedures often begin by obtaining the [[dark current (physics)|dark current]] images of the sample. Dark current is referred to as the photocurrent generation created by the OPV in the absence of an illumination source. The cantilever and tip are simply rastered across the sample while topographic and current measurements are obtained. This data can then be used as a reference to determine the impact the illumination process exhibits on the OPV. Short circuit measurements are also commonly performed on the OPV devices. This consists of engaging the illumination source at open current (that is applied potential to the sample is zero). Nguyen and workers noted that a positive photocurrent reading correlated to the conduction of holes, while a negative reading correlated to the conduction of electrons.&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; This alone allowed the authors to make predictions regarding the morphology within the cell. The current density for the forward and reverse bias can calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;
'''Current density equation:'''

&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{8}{9}\varepsilon_o\varepsilon_r\mu \frac{V^3}{L^3}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''J'' is the current density, ''ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the permittivity of a vacuum, ''ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relative permeability of the medium, ''µ'' is the mobility of the medium, ''V'' is the applied bias and ''L'' is the film thickness in nanometers.&lt;ref name="dam" /&gt; The majority of the organic materials have relative permeability values of ~3 in their amorphous and crystalline states.&lt;ref name="dant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afmu"&gt;AFM Instrumentation.

The range of bias commonly applied is usually limited to between −5 V to +5 V for most studies.&lt;ref name="sloan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pingthree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shah" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; This can be achieved by applying a forward bias or [[reverse bias]] to the sample through the spotted gold contact. By adjusting this bias, along with the current passing through the cantilever, one can adjust the repulsive/attractive forces between the sample and the tip. When a reverse bias is applied (tip is negative relative to the sample), the tip and the sample experience attractive forces between them.&lt;ref name="pingthree" /&gt; This current density measurement is then combined with the topographical information previously gathered from the AFM tip and cantilever. The resulting image displays the local variations in morphology with the current density measurements superimposed onto of them.

Several methods have been employed to help reduce both mechanical and acoustic vibrations within the system. Mechanical vibrations are mainly attributed to traffic in and out of a building Other sources of mechanical vibrations have often been seen in the higher stories of a building due to reduced damping from building supports. This source of vibrational noise is easily controlled through the use of a vibration isolation table. Acoustical vibrations are far more common than mechanical vibrations. This type of vibration is a result of air movement near the instrument such as fans or human voices. Several methods have been developed to help reduce this source of vibration. An easy solution for this is separating the electronic components from the stage. The reason for this separation of components is due to the cooling fans within the electrical devices. While operating, the fans lead to a constant source of vibrational noise within the system. In most cases, other methods still need to be employed to help reduce this source of noise. For instance, the instrument can be placed within a sealed box constructed of acoustic dampening material. Smaller stages also result in less surface area for acoustic vibrations to collide with, thus reducing the noise recorded. A more in depth solution consists of removing all sharp edges on the instrument. These sharp edges can excite resonances within the piezo-electric materials which increase the acoustic noise within the system.&lt;ref name="dangthree" /&gt;

'''Piphilology''' comprises the creation and use of [[mnemonic]] techniques to remember a span of digits of the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The word is a play on the word "pi" itself and of the linguistic field of [[philology]].

There are many ways to memorize {{pi}}, including the use of ''piems'' (a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau]], formed by combining '''pi''' and po'''em'''), which are poems that represent {{pi}} in a way such that the length of each word (in letters) represents a digit. Here is an example of a piem: "Now I need a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics." Notice how the first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. In longer examples, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit [[0 (number)|zero]], and this rule is extended to handle repeated digits in so-called [[Pilish]] writing. The short story "[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]" records the first 3834 digits of {{pi}} in this manner, and a 10,000-word novel, ''Not A Wake'', has been written accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadaeic.net/notawake.htm|accessdate=2011-03-03|title=Not A Wake: A Dream Embodying π's Digits Fully For 10000 Decimals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, piems prove to be inefficient for large memorizations of {{pi}}. Other methods include remembering patterns in the numbers (for instance, the year 1971 appears in the first fifty digits of {{pi}}) and the [[method of loci]] (which has been used to memorize {{pi}} to 67,890 digits).&lt;ref&gt;Raz A, Packard MG, Alexander GM, Buhle JT, Zhu H, Yu S, Peterson BS.

|title=Pi calculation smashes records
}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Until the 20th century, the number of digits of pi which [[mathematician]]s had the stamina to calculate by hand remained in the hundreds, so that memorization of ''all'' known digits at the time was possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1949 a computer was used to calculate π to 2000 places, presenting one of the earliest opportunities for a more difficult challenge.

Later computers calculated pi to extraordinary numbers of digits (2.7 trillion as of August 2010),&lt;ref name="Pi calculation smashes records"/&gt; and people began memorizing more and more of the output.  The world record for the number of digits memorized has exploded since the mid-1990s, and it stood at 100,000 as of October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20061004-00000402-yom-soci |accessdate=2007-02-02 |title=(broken link) |website=[[Yahoo!

An institution from Germany provides the details of the "Pi World Ranking".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pi-world-ranking-list.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in English==
The most common mnemonic technique is to memorize a so-called "piem" (a wordplay on "pi" and "poem") in which the number of letters in each word is equal to the corresponding digit of π. This famous example for 15 digits has several variations, including:

:''How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum mechanics!'' - Sir James Hopwood Jeans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hawkesworth |first1=Alan S. |title=Two Mnemonics |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |date=March 1931 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=158 |doi=10.2307/2300971 |quote=The following mnemonic for π is due to Sir James Hopwood Jeans|jstor=2300971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short mnemonics such as these, of course, do not take one very far down π's infinite road. Instead, they are intended more as amusing [[doggerel]]. If even less accuracy suffices, the following examples can be used:

:''How I wish I could recollect pi easily today!''
:''May I have a large container of coffee, cream and sugar?''

This second one gives the value of π as 3.1415926535, while the first only brings it to the second five. Indeed, many published poems use [[truncation]] instead of one of the several [[rounding]]s, thereby producing a less-accurate result when the first omitted digit is greater than or equal to five. It is advantageous to use truncation in memorizing if the individual intends to study more places later on, otherwise one will be remembering erroneous digits.

Another mnemonic is:
: ''The point I said a blind Bulgarian in France would know''
In this mnemonic the word "point" represents the decimal point itself.

Yet another example is:
:''How I wish I could recollect, of circle round, the exact relation Arkimedes (or Archimede) learned''
In this example, the spelling of Archimedes is normalised to nine. (Although 'Archimedes' is, today, a more correct spelling of the ancient Greek mathematician's name in English, Archimede is also often seen when this mnemonic is given, since Archimède is the more correct spelling in some languages, such as French.)

Longer mnemonics employ the same concept. This example created by Peter M. Brigham incorporates twenty decimal digits:
:''How I wish I could enumerate pi easily, since all these bullshit mnemonics prevent recalling any of pi's sequence more simply.''

===Poems===
Some mnemonics, such as this poem which gives the three and the first 20 decimal digits, use the separation of the poem's title and main body to represent the decimal point:
: ''Pie''
: ''I wish I could determine pi''
: ''Eureka, cried the great inventor''
: ''Christmas pudding, Christmas pie''
: ''Is the problem's very center.''

Another, more poetic version is:
:''Sir, I have a rhyme excelling,''
:''In mystic power and magic spelling,''
:''Celestial spirits elucidate,''
:''For my own problems can't relate.''

Extensions to 30 or 31 decimals of the same proceed as follows:
{|
|
:''Sir, I send a rhyme excelling,''
:''In sacred truth and rigid spelling,''
:''Numerical sprites elucidate,''
:''For me the lexicon's full weight,''
:''If nature gain, who can complain,''
:''Tho' Dr Johnson fulminate?''
|
::''Sir, I bear a rhyme excelling''
::''In mystic force and magic spelling''
::''Celestial sprites elucidate''
::''All my own striving can't relate''
::''Or locate they who can cogitate''
::''And so finally terminate.  Finis.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbpimem.htm|title=Mnemonics for the Number Pi|website=camosun.bc.ca|access-date=2016-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219155554/http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/jbpimem.htm|archive-date=2016-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fun-with-words.com/mnem_numbers.html|title=Mnemonics &gt; Number mnemonics|website=fun-with-words.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are minor variations on the above rhyme, which still allow pi to be worked out correctly.  However, one variation replaces the word "lexicon's" with "lesson's" and in doing so, incorrectly indicates that the 18th digit is seven.

The logologist [[Dmitri Borgmann]] gives the following 30-word poem in his book, ''[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Dmitri Borgmann |last=Borgmann|first=Dmitri A.|title=Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities |year=1965|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|title-link=Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''Now, a moon, a lover refulgent in flight,''
:''Sails the black silence's loneliest ellipse.''
:''Computers use pi, the constant, when polite,''
:''Or gentle data for sad tracking aid at eclipse.''

The following [[sonnet]] is a mnemonic for pi to 75 decimal places in [[iambic pentameter]]:
:''Now I defy a tenet gallantly''
:''Of circle canon law: these integers''
:''Importing circles' quotients are, we see,''
:''Unwieldy long series of cockle burs''

:''Put all together, get no clarity;''
:''Mnemonics shan't describeth so reformed''
:''Creating, with a grammercy plainly,''
:''A sonnet liberated yet conformed.''

:''Strangely, the queer'st rules I manipulate''
:''Being followéd, do facilitate''
:''Whimsical musings from geometric bard.''

:''This poesy, unabashed as it's distressed,''
:''Evolvéd coherent - a simple test,''
:''Discov'ring poetry no numerals jarred.''

Note that in this example, 10-letter words are used to represent the digit [[0 (number)|zero]].

Other poems use sound as a mnemonic technique, as in the following poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://vimeo.com/41050242
|accessdate=2012-04-26
|title=Sonnet 72 (Ode to Pi)
|last1=Doerfel
|first1=Joel
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rhymes with the first 140 decimal places of pi using a blend of [[assonance]], [[slant rhyme]], and [[perfect rhyme]]:
:''dreams number us like pi.  runes shift.  nights rewind''
:''daytime pleasure-piles. dream-looms create our id.''
:''moods shift. words deviate. needs brew. pleasures rise.''
:''time slows. too late?  wait!  foreign minds live in''

:''us! quick-minds, free-minds, minds-we-never-mind,''
:''unknown, gyrate! neuro-rhymes measure our ''
:''minds, for our minds rhyme. crude ego-emanations''
:''distort nodes. id, (whose basic neuro-spacetime rhymes),''

:''plays its tune. space drones before fate unites''
:''dreams’ lore to unsung measures. whole dimensions''
:''gyrate. new number-games donate quick minds &amp;''
:''weave through fate’s loom. fears, hopes, digits, or devils''

:''collide here—labor stored in gold-mines, lives, lightcone-''
:''piles. fate loops through dreams &amp; pleasure-looms….''
Note that "dreams number us like pi" corresponds to "314159," and so on.  Sound-based mnemonic techniques, unlike pilish, do not require that the letters in each word be counted in order to recall the digits of pi.  However, where sound-based mnemonics use assonance, extra care must be taken to distinguish "nine" and "five," which contain the same vowel sound.  In this example, the author assumes the convention that [[0 (number)|zero]] is often called "O."

===Piku===

The piku follows the rules of conventional haiku (three lines of 5, 7 and 5 syllables), but with the added mnemonic trick that each word contains the same number of letters as the numerals of pi, e.g.

:''How I love a verse''
:''Contrived to unhusk dryly''
:''One image nutshell''

===Songs===
In 2004, [[Andrew Huang (musician)|Andrew Huang]] wrote a song that was a mnemonic for the first fifty digits of pi, titled "I am the first 50 digits of pi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/songs/i-am-the-first-fifty-digits-of-pi/|title=SONGS TO WEAR PANTS TO  " Blog Archive   " I AM THE FIRST FIFTY DIGITS OF PI|website=songstowearpantsto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songstowearpantsto.com/lyrics/|title=SONGS TO WEAR PANTS TO   " Lyrics|website=songstowearpantsto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first line is:
:''Man, I can’t - I shan’t! - formulate an anthem where the words comprise mnemonics, dreaded mnemonics for pi.''
In 2013, Huang extended the song to include the first 100 digits of pi, and changed the title to "Pi Mnemonic Song".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaDm9G4Ig18|title=PI MNEMONIC SONG|date=14 March 2013|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lengthier works===
There are piphilologists who have written texts that encode hundreds or thousands of digits. This is an example of [[constrained writing]], known as "[[Pilish]]".  For example, ''Poe, E.: Near a Raven''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadaeic.net/naraven.htm "Poe, E.: Near a Raven"], cadaeic.net&lt;/ref&gt; represents 740 digits, ''[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]'' encodes 3835, and ''Not A Wake''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadaeic.net/notawake.htm "Not A Wake"], cadaeic.net&lt;/ref&gt; extends to 10,000 digits.

===Sound-based mnemonics===
It is also possible to use the rhythm and sound of the spoken digits themselves as a memorization device. The mathematician [[John Horton Conway]] composed the following arrangement for the first 100 digits,
                         _     _   _
             3 point  1415  9265  35
                      ^ ^
              _ _  _ _    _ _   __
             8979  3238  4626  4338   3279
               **  **^^          ^^   ****
              .   _    _   __   _    _      _ . _ .
        502 884  197 169  399 375  105 820  974 944
         ^  ^                       ^  ^
                 59230 78164
                  _     _    _    _
               0628  6208  998  6280
                ^^   ^^         ^^
              .. _  .._
              34825 34211 70679,
                          ^  ^

where the accents indicate various kinds of repetition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=1375971&amp;tstart=0 "Math Forum » Discussions » History » math-history-list"], Math Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mnemonic system used commonly in the memorization of pi is the [[Mnemonic major system]], where single numbers are translated into basic sounds. A combination of these sounds creates a word, which can then be translated back into numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litemind.com/major-system/], Major Memory System&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with the [[Method of loci]], this becomes a very powerful memorization tool.

This statement yields π to twenty-two decimal places:
:Wie, o dies π macht ernstlich so vielen viele Müh. Lernt immerhin, Mägdelein, leichte Verselein, wie so zum Beispiel dies dürfte zu merken sein.

English translation that doesn't encode pi:
:How, oh this π seriously makes so many struggles to so many. Learn at least, girls, simple little verses, just such as this one should be memorizable.

Looser English translation that encodes pi:
:Woe! O this π makes seriously so muchly many's woe.

:τὸ κύκλου μῆκος ἵνα ὁρίσῃ διαμέτρῳ,
:παρήγαγεν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέραντον,
:καὶ ὅν, φεῦ, οὐδέποτε ὅλον θνητοὶ θὰ εὕρωσι

&lt;!--I don't think this is necessary.
If the reader's computer does not have the fonts necessary to render the above, here is a graphic version:
:[[File:Pipoem.gif]]

Translation:
:The Great God applies geometry forever;
:To define the length of the circle using its diameter,
:He produced an infinite number,
:Which, alas, mortals will never find in its entirety.

===Spanish===
The following [[piem]], giving π to 31 decimal places, is well known in [[Argentina]]:
:''Fue y cayó. Y queda solamente la inútil cifra con pocos destinos poderosos, tristes devenires sin el más sencillo bien. Idiota, re idiota, sabe que sus encantos son ya latosos decimales. Pobre...''

Translation:
:It went and it fell. And only the useless figure remains, with little powerful destinies, sad future without the simplest goodness. Idiotic, very idiotic, it knows that its charms are now boring decimals. Poor...

Another. This [[piem]] gives π (correctly rounded) to 10 decimal places. (If you prefer to not round π, then replace "cosmos" with "cielo".)
:''Sol y luna y mundo proclaman al eterno Autor del Cosmos.''

Translation:
:Sun and moon and world proclaim the eternal Author of the Cosmos. (Or "heaven", not Cosmos, if using "cielo".)

===Irish===
''Níl i mata, a shaoi, eolaíocht nó feidhm.'' (7 decimal places) — "Wise one, mathematics has neither science nor use."

===Romanian===
One of the Romanian versions of Pi poems is:&lt;ref name="pipoetry_ro"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lovendal.net/wp52/poezii-pentru-numarul-pi/ | title = Poezii pentru numărul Pi | publisher = Secretele lui Lovendal | date = 2009-01-02 | language = Romanian | accessdate = 2012-12-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100124075852/http://www.lovendal.net/wp52/poezii-pentru-numarul-pi/ | archivedate = 2010-01-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:;Dar o știm, e număr important ce trebuie iubit
::But we know, it's an important number which should be loved
:;Din toate numerele însemnate diamant neasemuit,
::Of all the significant numbers it is a peerless diamond
:;Cei ce vor temeinic asta prețui
::Those who will sincerely appreciate it
:;Ei veșnic bine vor trăi.
::Will live happy for ever.
There is another phrase known in Romanian that will help to memorize the number by eight decimal places:
''Așa e bine a scrie renumitul și utilul număr.'' — "This is the way to write the renowned and useful number."

===Russian===
In the [[Russian language]], there is a well-known phrase in the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|reform of 1917]] [[orthography]] of old tradition:  "Кто и шутя, и скоро пожелаетъ «Пи» узнать число — ужъ знаетъ." (The one who would wish to know the number pi easily and quickly already knows it.)

A more modern rhyme is:
:;Это я знаю и помню прекрасно,
::I know the following and remember it perfectly,
:;Пи многие знаки мне лишни, напрасны.
::Multitudes of the digits of pi are unnecessary and idle for me.

A short approximation is: "Что я знаю о кругах?" (What do I know about circles?)

In addition, there are several nonfolklore verses that simply rhyme the digits of pi "as is"; for examples, see [[:ru:Пи (число)|the Russian version of this article]].

===Polish===
The verse of Polish mathematician [[Witold Rybczyński]]: 
:''Daj, o pani, o boska [[Mnemosyne|Mnemozyno]], pi liczbę, którą też zowią ponętnie ludolfiną, pamięci przekazać tak, by jej dowolnie oraz szybko do pomocy użyć, gdy się problemu nie da inaczej rozwiązać, pauza — to zastąpić liczbami.'' (35 decimal places) - "Allow, o lady, o divine [[Mnemosyne]], the pi number, which also is called enticingly the ludolphine, to pass to memory, so as to use it freely and quickly for help, when the problem can not be otherwise resolved, pause — this replace by the numbers." (Note that the dash stands for zero.)

The verse of Polish mathematician [[Kazimierz Cwojdziński]]:
:''Kuć i orać w dzień zawzięcie, bo plonów niema bez trudu. Złocisty szczęścia okręcie kołyszesz … Kuć. My nie czekajmy cudu. Robota to potęga ludu.'' (23 decimal places) - "Hammer and plow by day obstinately, because there are no fruits without effort. Golden ship of happiness, rocking... Hammer. Let us not wait for a miracle. Labor is the power of the people."

:''Był i jest i wieki sławionym ów będzie, który kół obwód średnicą wymierzył.'' (12 decimal places) — "There was, and there is, and through centuries renowned will be, who circle's circumference measured with its diameter."

:''Kto z woli i myśli zapragnie Pi spisać cyfry, ten zdoła'' (10 decimal places) - "Who out of will and mind shall wish to write the digits of Pi, shall succeed."

An occasionally seen verse related to [[1978 FIFA World Cup|Mundial Argentina]] and the Polish football team:
:''Już i [[Grzegorz Lato|Lato]] i [[Kazimierz Deyna|Deyna]] / strzelili do bramki obcej / dwa karne / [[Włodzimierz Lubański|Lubański]] dostrzegł mistrza [[Andrzej Szarmach|Szarmacha]] / gdy on tak wypuścił cios szacha / że zdobyć musi cel gry / krzyknął Gol na Mundial Argentyna.'' (30 decimal places) - "Already both [[Grzegorz Lato|Lato]] and [[Kazimierz Deyna|Deyna]] have scored two penalty kicks to the opponent's goal. [[Włodzimierz Lubański|Lubański]] noticed the champion [[Andrzej Szarmach|Szarmach]], when he had so released a Shah's strike that he's got to attain the objective of the game; he shouted 'Goal' at the World Cup Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rstasz.rdkp.cba.pl/mnemo-pi.htm|title=Strona Renaty Staszkiewicz|website=cba.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
:''Cai a neve e novas ferrovias de marfim serão por casas trocadas.'' (11 decimal places) — "The snow falls and new ivory railroads will be exchanged by houses."

:''Com o zero o lente reprovará os alunos.'' (8 decimal places) — "With zero the university professor will fail the students."

Or in Brazilian Portuguese: 
:''Sim, é útil e fácil memorizar um número grato aos sábios.'' —  "Yes, it's useful and easy to memorize a number dear to the wisemen."

:''Nós e todo o mundo guardamos pi usando letra por número.'' — "We and all the world memorize pi using letter for number."

:''Sou o medo e temor constante do menino vadio.'' — "I'm the constant fear and dread of the stray boy."

A piem written in a more poetic manner:
: ''Sou o amor,''
: ''o homem impetuoso da libido''
: ''Homem que ataca mulheres atraentes,''
: ''meninas pecadoras que no céu imiscuem amor, paixão, fé, desejo, tudo!''
: ''Até que idolatro com as sereias pecadoras tanta fé!''
: ''Esbeltas mulheres para o musculado,''
: ''sereias e fêmeas pecadoras''
: ''Até idolatram serpentes com ardente macho.''
: ''O viril desejará as pecadoras iníquas doravante para amar.''

Translation:
: ''I am the love,''
: ''The impetuous man from the libido''
: ''Man who attacks attractive women,''
: ''sinful maidens who on heaven intrude love, passion, faith, desire, everything!''
: ''I even idolize with the mermaids so much faith!''
: ''Luscious women for the brawny,''
: ''sinful mermaids and females''
: ''They even idolize serpents with the burning buck.''
: ''The virile man will wish the sinful and the iniquitous henceforth to love.''

===Japanese===
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] piphilology has countless mnemonics based on [[pun]]ning words with numbers. This is especially easy in Japanese because there are [[Japanese numerals|two or three ways]] to pronounce each digit, and the language has relatively few [[phoneme]]s to begin with. For example, to 31 decimal places:&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014765/pi/memory.html 暗記法] Japanese mnemonics for π (and some other languages as well)&lt;/ref&gt;

:{|
|身||一つ||世||一つ||生||く||に||無||意||味||い||わ||く||な||く||身||ふ||み||や||読||む||似||ろ||よ||{{nowrap|さん}}||{{nowrap|ざん}}||colspan=2|闇||に||な||く

||ni||colspan=2|naku
|}

This is close to being ungrammatical nonsense, but a loose translation prioritizing word order yields:

:''A person is one; the world is one:''
:''to live this way, it's meaningless, one says, and cries,''
:''"step on it, will ya!" then reads—be the same!''
:''Crying uncontrollably in the dark.''

Japanese children also use songs built on this principle to memorize the [[multiplication table]].

===Chinese===

It is possible to construct piphilogical poems in Chinese by using homophones or near-homophones of the numbers zero through nine, as in the following well known example which covers 22 decimal places of π. In this example the character meaning "mountain" (山 ''shān'') is used to represent the number "three" (三 ''sān''), the character meaning "I" (吾 ''wú'') is used to represent the number "five" (五 ''wǔ''), and the characters meaning "temple" (寺 ''sì'') and "die" (死 ''sǐ'') are used to represent the number "four" (四 ''sì''). Some of the mnemonic characters used in this poem, for example "kill" (殺 ''shā'') for "three" (三 ''sān''), "jug" (壺 ''[[Hu (vessel)|hú]]'') for "five" (五 ''wǔ''), "happiness" (樂 ''lè'') for "six" (六 ''liù'') and "eat" (吃 ''chī'') for "seven" (七 ''qī''), are not very close phonetically in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin/Putonghua]].

:{|

This can be translated as:

:''On a mountain top a temple and a jug of wine.''
:''Your happiness makes me so bitter;''
:''Take some wine and drink, the wine will kill you;''
:''If it does not kill you, I will rejoice in your happiness.''

===Turkish===

''Sen, o alan o çevre bölününce ve sonsuz rakam ile çıkan değişken dizilimli sayısın.'' — "You are the number with infinite digits in changing order, which is found when the circumference and the area is divided."

===Czech===

''Sám u sebe v hlavě magického pí číslic deset mám.'' (nine decimal places) — "I have ten digits of magical pi in my head."

''Lín a kapr u hráze prohlídli si rybáře, udici měl novou, jikrnáči neuplovou.'' (12 decimal places) — "Tench and carp by the dam watched the fisher. He has a new rod, fish will not escape."

''Dej, ó Bože, a číslo Ludolfovo já navždy pomnu, pro větší naplnění moudrosti početní.'' (13 decimal places) — "Oh God, let me to remember the pi forever, for the increase of mathematical skills."

''Mám ó bože ó velký pamatovat si takový cifer řad, velký slovutný Archimedes, pomáhej trápenému, dej mu moc, nazpaměť nechť odříká ty slavné sice, ale tak protivné nám, ach, číslice Ludolfovy!'' (30 decimal places) — "Shall I, God oh almighty, remember such a long string of numbers, great and famous Archimedes, help my careworn being, give me the power, to recite by heart all the digits, which may be famous, but also hated by some of us, the digits of Ludolph van Ceulen."

===Serbian===

''Čak i Grci i stari Vavilonci su kazali: obime kad deliš krugovim prečnikom dobijaš neophodan nam pi.'' (16 decimal places) — "Even Greeks and Old Babylonians have told: when dividing circumferences with circle's diameter you obtain the indispensable pi."

===Italian===

''Non è dato a tutti ricordare il numero aureo del sommo filosofo Archimede. Certuni sostengon che si può ricordar tale numero, ma questi soli poi non recitano che un centone insensato.'' (30 decimal places) — "Not anybody can retain the golden number of the great philosopher Archimedes. There are who claim it is possible to recall this number, but then they just recite a senseless [[Cento (poetry)|cento]]"

===Sanskrit===

The Katapayadi System of verses is basically a system of code so that things can be defined in a way so that people can remember. The code is as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16139">'''Project Steve''' is a list of scientists with the [[given name]] [[Stephen|Stephen/Steven]] or a variation thereof (e.g., Stephanie, Stefan, Esteban, etc.) who "support [[evolution]]". It was originally created by the [[National Center for Science Education]] as a "[[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]]" of [[creationism|creationist]] attempts to collect a list of scientists who "doubt evolution," such as the [[Answers in Genesis]]' list of scientists who accept the biblical account of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/#presentsci List of living scientists who accept the biblical account of creation] from [[Answers in Genesis]]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Discovery Institute]]'s ''[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]''. The list pokes fun at such endeavors while making it clear that, "We did not wish to mislead the public into thinking that scientific issues are decided by who has the longer list of scientists!" It also honors [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve |title=Project Steve  |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|level of support for evolution among scientists]] is very high. A 2009 poll by [[Pew Research Center]] found that "Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pew Research Center]]: "[http://people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/ Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media]" July 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the same time the project is a genuine collection of scientists.  Despite the list's restriction to only scientists with names like "Steve", which in the [[United States]] limits the list to roughly 1 percent of the total population,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[United States Census]], about 1.6% of [[males]] and  0.4% of [[females]] have a first name that would qualify them to sign the [[petition]]. Therefore, about 1% of all people in the [[United States]] are called Steve or some name that is close to Steve. Therefore, if one can get N [[scientist]]s named Steve or something similar to endorse the petition, one might expect that roughly 100xN scientists with all kinds of names would endorse the petition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Steve is longer and contains many more eminent scientists than any creationist list. In particular, ''Project Steve'' contains many more [[biology|biologists]] than the creationist lists, with about 54% of the listed Steves being biologists.&lt;ref name=FAQs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve-faq|title=Project Steve: FAQs |publisher=National Center for Science Education |date=February 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "List of Steves" webpage provides an updated total of scientist "Steves" who have signed the list.&lt;ref name=List-of-Steves/&gt; {{As of|2018|9|27|df=US}}, Project Steve has 1,432 signatories.&lt;ref name="List-of-Steves"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ncse.com/list-of-steves|title=List of Steves|last=|first=|date=September 27, 2018|website=National Center for Science Education|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==
The statement that signatories agree to reads:

{{quotation|Evolution is a vital, well-supported, unifying principle of the biological sciences, and the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the idea that all living things share a common ancestry. Although there are legitimate debates about the patterns and processes of evolution, there is no serious scientific doubt that evolution occurred or that natural selection is a major mechanism in its occurrence. It is scientifically inappropriate and pedagogically irresponsible for creationist pseudoscience, including but not limited to "intelligent design," to be introduced into the science curricula of our nation's public schools.''}}

There have been some complaints that the statement left out the [[geology|geological sciences]], where evolution is an important principle as well. However, this oversight was noticed too late and it was decided that it would be more effort than it is worth to go back to correct it.&lt;ref name=FAQs/&gt;

== History ==
The project was named in honor of the [[palaeontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1941–2002). It began in 2003, with an official press release on February 16, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/taking-action/project-steve-press-release ''TEACH EVOLUTION! Over two hundred scientists named Steve agree''], [[National Center for Science Education]] [[press release]], February 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The press release was issued at the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s 2003 convention in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], after a lecture by [[Lawrence Krauss]] titled "Scientific Ignorance as a Way of Life: From Science Fiction in Washington to Intelligent Design in the Classroom." Krauss made the actual announcement and directed the reporters to NCSE Director [[Eugenie Scott]], who was sitting in the audience in the front row.&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;

The original goal was to collect the signatures of 100 Steves, but this goal was reached in about 10 days. Both [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Steves in science — [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Steven Chu]] (who has since served as [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] in [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]) — were among the first 100 Steves. Over 200 Steves responded in the first month.&lt;ref name=Geo&gt;[http://www.geotimes.org/may03/column.html ''All About Steve (and Darwin)''], Glenn Branch and Skip Evans, Geologic Column, [http://www.geotimes.org/current/ Geotimes], May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As the news of Project Steve spread by [[word of mouth]], ever-increasing numbers of Steves contacted the NCSE, and the list continued to grow.

Project Steve captured the attention of the media. The first media coverage included articles in the ''[[Washington Times]]'', ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'' and an interview of NCSE director [[Eugenie Scott]] by [[Australian]] science journalist and radio broadcaster [[Robyn Williams]] for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]’s radio show, ''The Science Show''. ''The Science Show'' arranged for Geoff Sirmai and David Fisher of the [[Australia|Australian]] musical comedy team "Comic Roasts" to write the "''Steve Song''", a parody of the [[Monty Python]] [[Spam (song)|song about Spam]], for Project Steve.&lt;ref name=FAQs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncse.com/files/pub/action/stevesong.wma Steve Song] [[wma audio file]], [[National Center for Science Education]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The song had its debut on ''The Science Show'' episode featuring the interview of Scott which aired on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio National on March 8, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s798387.htm ''The Steve Project''], [[radio show]] transcript, [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/default.htm The Science Show], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], March 8, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambridge University]] [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] [[Stephen Hawking]] was the 300th Steve to sign the list. By the time the announcement was made on April 21, 2003, another five had joined to bring the total number of Steves to 305.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2003/04/hawking-is-steve-300-00459 ''Hawking is Steve #300''], [[National Center for Science Education]], April 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 26, 2003, [[St. Stephen's Day]], ''Project Steve'' had grown to 400 scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2003/12/project-steve-update-00463  ''Project Steve Update''], [[National Center for Science Education]], December 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Project Steve reached the 400 scientist mark, the NCSE decided to offer a commemorative novelty Project Steve [[t-shirt]]. The t-shirt is emblazoned with the proclamation, "Over _00 Scientists named Steve Agree, Teach Evolution!" in large letters, where the blank contains the most recent hundreds mark. A list of the current signatories is included in a smaller typeface on the t-shirt as well.

[[Eugenie Scott]], Glenn Branch and [[Nick Matzke]] published an article in the July/August 2004 issue of the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' (with all the Steves that had signed up to that point listed as co-authors) called ''The Morphology of Steve'' which contained "the first scientific analysis of the sex, geographic location, and body size of scientists named Steve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Shortly after the second anniversary of Project Steve in February 2005, 543 Steves had signed the list. A front-page story in the [[Ottawa Citizen]] marking this event was published on February 20, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2005/02/project-steve-ottawa-00778 ''Project Steve in Ottawa''], [[National Center for Science Education]], February 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 12, 2005, the 600th Steve signed the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2005/09/project-steve-n-600-00766 ''Project Steve: n &gt; 600''], [[National Center for Science Education]], September 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By February 16, 2006, the third anniversary of ''Project Steve'''s official launch, the Steve-o-meter stood at 700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2006/02/announcing-ncse-700-club-001003 ''Announcing the NCSE 700 Club''], [[National Center for Science Education]], February 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24, 2007, the list had grown to 800 Steves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/news/2007/04/project-steve-n-800-001158 ''Project Steve: n &gt; 800''], [[National Center for Science Education]], April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, the milestone #1000 was assigned to professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Steven P.

There have been articles about ''Project Steve'' in ''[[The Times]]''{{dubious|maybe it was in the British paper, but my guess is that the New York Times is meant|date=February 2017}}, ''[[Scientific American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/count-on-steves-to-defend-darwin-09-02-20/#|title=Count On Steves to Defend Darwin|last=|first=|date=February 20, 2009|website=Scientific American|access-date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Yale Daily News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2003/02/25/steve-profs-collaborate-to-support-teaching-evolution/|title=‘Steve’ profs. collaborate to support teaching evolution|last=Tom|first=Jessica|date=February 25, 2003|website=Yale Daily News|access-date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus on the Family]]'s ''Family News in Focus'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[MIT]]'s ''TechTalk'', and ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/3563_project_steve_in_the_media_2_17_2003.asp Project Steve in the media], [[National Center for Science Education]], Last updated February 26, 2004, ''retrieved September 11, 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[William Dembski]], fellow of the [[Discovery Institute]], whose "''[[A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism|Scientific Dissent from Darwinism]]''" petition had eight Steves as of July, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&amp;id=660 ''A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism''], [[Discovery Institute]] website&lt;/ref&gt; has said that:

{{quotation|If Project Steve was meant to show that a considerable majority of the scientific community accepts a naturalistic conception of evolution, then the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) could have saved its energies—that fact was never in question. The more interesting question was whether any serious scientists reject a naturalistic conception of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=1393  ''Project Steve – Establishing the Obvious: A Response to the NCSE''], [[William Dembski]], [[Center for Science and Culture]], [[Discovery Institute]], March 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Project Steve, and motivated by media coverage of the [[Discovery Institute]]'s "''Dissent From Darwinism''" list, during the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' case, R. Joe Brandon initiated a four-day, word-of-mouth petition of scientists in support of evolution in October 2005.  During the four-day drive ''[[A Scientific Support For Darwinism]] And For Public Schools Not To Teach Intelligent Design As Science'' gathered 7733 signatures of verifiable scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shovelbums.org/content/view/156/527/ |title=Results of The Four Day Petition – 7733 Scientists Agree on: A Scientific Support For Darwinism And For Public Schools Not To Teach Intelligent Design As Science |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810185433/http://shovelbums.org/content/view/156/527/ |archive-date=August 10, 2006 |first=R.

'''Public Interest Research Groups''' ('''PIRGs''') are a federation of U.S. and Canadian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPIRG: Welcome to the Provincial Network|url=http://www.opirg.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[non-profit organization]]s that employ [[grassroots]] organizing and direct advocacy with the goal of effecting [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ali|first1=Ambreen|title=Liberal, Conservative Groups Join to Find Spending Cuts|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/liberal_conservative_groups_join_to_find_spending_cuts-208761-1.html|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Roll Call|date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]]. Ross helped students across the country set up the first PIRG chapters, then became the director of the [[New York Public Interest Research Group]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-670-10319-5|author2=Donald Ross }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Robert N.|title=Watchdogs and Whistleblowers: A Reference Guide to Consumer Activism|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781440830006|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Public Interest Research Group]], founded in 1971, was the first state PIRG to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]].&lt;ref name=pioneer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verges|first1=Josh|title=Macalester College students reject MPIRG on campus|url=http://www.twincities.com/education/ci_26969904/macalester-students-reject-mpirg-campus|accessdate=10 November 2015|publisher=Pioneer Press|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by [[Oregon]] (OSPIRG) and [[Massachusetts]] ([[MASSPIRG]]). The PIRGs were supportive of [[container deposit legislation in the United States]], popularly called "bottle bills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanier Hickman|first1=H.|title=American Alchemy: The History of Solid Waste Management in the United States|date=2003|publisher=ForesterPress|isbn=9780970768728|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the PIRGs established the [[Fund for the Public Interest]] as its fundraising and canvassing arm.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;

==Funding model==
PIRGs on college campuses have historically been funded with a portion of student activity fees in the form of a [[Union dues|labor checkoff]]. Students may elect to have the fees refunded to them, although many students are unaware that this is the case. This system of PIRG funding has been met with controversy and with a number of legal challenges.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; In 2014, students at [[Macalester College]] in Minnesota voted to end their relationship with MPIRG due to the group's revenue structure, which relied on MPIRG automatically receiving a cut of student activity fees.&lt;ref name=pioneer/&gt;

==Policy positions==
U.S. PIRG lobbied for the creation of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], an [[independent agency of the United States government|independent U.S. government agency]] which was founded as a result of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in the wake of the [[late-2000s recession]] and the [[Financial crisis (2007-present)|financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hill: Top 10 Lobbying Victories of 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/133691-the-top-10-lobbying-victories-of-2010 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIRGs have worked to make same-sex marriage legal, to increase the minimum wage, to enact increased environmental regulations, to oppose [[Voter ID laws in the United States]], build high speed rail in California, defend solar net metering in California, increase food labeling, expand open educational resources on campus, expand campus food pantries, and ban pesticides linked to colony collapse.&lt;ref name=pioneer/&gt;

==Transparency rating==
[[Charity Navigator]] rated the U.S. PIRG two out of four stars for accountability and transparency, and three out of four stars for financials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=5433#.Vj1SPrerS70|website=Charity Navigator|title=Charity Navigator Rating - U.S. PIRG Education Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliated non-profits==
Some PIRGs are members of a larger network of non-profit organizations called the Public Interest Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Interest Network |url=http://www.publicinterestnetwork.org/ |year=2012 |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, they have also helped to launch a number of other independent public interest non-profits, including:

[[File:ISS_impact_risk.jpg|thumb|300px|right|NASA's illustration showing high impact risk areas for the International Space Station]]
'''Safety engineering''' is an engineering discipline which assures that engineered systems provide acceptable levels of [[safety]]. It is strongly related to [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]],  and the subset [[system safety]] engineering. Safety engineering assures that a [[life-critical system]] behaves as needed, even when components fail.

==Analysis techniques==
Analysis techniques can be split into two categories: qualitative and quantitative methods. Both approaches share the goal of finding causal dependencies between a hazard on system level and failures of individual components. Qualitative approaches focus on the question "What must go wrong, such that a system hazard may not occur?", while quantitative methods aim at providing estimations about probabilities, rates and/or severity of consequences.

[[File:Risk Cost Analysis.jpg|thumb|Risk vs Cost/Complexity&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The complexity of the technical systems such as Improvements of Design and Materials, Planned Inspections, Fool-proof design, and Backup Redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost. The risk can be decreased to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) or ALAPA (as low as practically achievable) levels.

Traditionally, safety analysis techniques rely solely on skill and expertise of the safety engineer. In the last decade model-based approaches have become prominent. In contrast to traditional methods, model-based techniques try to derive relationships between causes and consequences from some sort of model of the system.

===Traditional methods for safety analysis===
The two most common fault modeling techniques are called [[failure mode and effects analysis]] and [[fault tree analysis]]. These techniques are just ways of finding problems and of making plans to cope with failures, as in [[probabilistic risk assessment]]. One of the earliest complete studies using this technique on a commercial nuclear plant was the [[WASH-1400]] study, also known as the Reactor Safety Study or the Rasmussen Report.

====Failure modes and effects analysis====
{{Main|Failure mode and effects analysis}}
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a bottom-up, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] analytical method which may be performed at either the functional or piece-part level. For functional FMEA, failure modes are identified for each function in a system or equipment item, usually with the help of a functional [[block diagram]]. For piece-part FMEA, failure modes are identified for each piece-part component (such as a valve, connector, resistor, or diode). The effects of the failure mode are described, and assigned a probability based on the [[failure rate]] and failure mode ratio of the function or component.   This quantiazation is difficult for software ---a bug exists or not, and the failure models used for hardware components do not apply.  Temperature and age and manufacturing variability affect a resistor; they do not affect software.

Failure modes with identical effects can be combined and summarized in a Failure Mode Effects Summary. When combined with criticality analysis, FMEA is known as [[Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis]] or FMECA, pronounced "fuh-MEE-kuh".

====Fault tree analysis====
{{Main|Fault tree analysis}}
Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] analytical method.  In FTA, initiating primary events such as component failures, human errors, and external events are traced through [[Boolean logic]] gates to an undesired top event such as an aircraft crash or nuclear reactor core melt. The intent is to identify ways to make top events less probable, and verify that safety goals have been achieved.

[[File:Fault tree.svg|thumb|A fault tree diagram]]

Fault trees are a logical inverse of success trees, and may be obtained by applying [[de Morgan's laws|de Morgan's theorem]] to success trees (which are directly related to [[reliability block diagram]]s).

FTA may be qualitative or quantitative. When failure and event probabilities are unknown, qualitative fault trees may be analyzed for minimal cut sets. For example, if any minimal cut set contains a single base event, then the top event may be caused by a single failure. Quantitative FTA is used to compute top event probability, and usually requires computer software such as CAFTA from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]] or [[SAPHIRE]] from the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].

Some industries use both fault trees and [[event tree]]s. An event tree starts from an undesired initiator (loss of critical supply, component failure etc.) and follows possible further system events through to a series of final consequences. As each new event is considered, a new node on the tree is added with a split of probabilities of taking either branch. The probabilities of a range of "top events" arising from the initial event can then be seen.

==Safety certification==
Typically, safety guidelines prescribe a set of steps, deliverable documents, and exit criterion focused around planning, analysis and design, implementation, verification and validation, configuration management, and quality assurance activities for the development of a safety-critical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rempel|first=Patrick|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|last3=Kuschke|first3=Tobias|last4=Cleland-Huang|first4=Jane|date=2014-01-01|title=Mind the Gap: Assessing the Conformance of Software Traceability to Relevant Guidelines|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2568225.2568290|journal=Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering|series=ICSE 2014|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=943–954|doi=10.1145/2568225.2568290|isbn=9781450327565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they typically formulate expectations regarding the creation and use of [[Requirements traceability|traceability]] in the project. For example, depending upon the criticality level of a requirement, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|US Federal Aviation Authority]] guideline [[DO-178C|DO-178B/C]] requires [[Requirements traceability|traceability]] from [[Requirement|requirements]] to [[design]], and from [[Requirement|requirements]] to [[source code]] and executable [[object code]] for software components of a system. Thereby, higher quality traceability information can simplify the certification process and help to establish trust in the maturity of the applied development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mäder|first=P.|last2=Jones|first2=P. L.|last3=Zhang|first3=Y.|last4=Cleland-Huang|first4=J.|date=2013-05-01|title=Strategic Traceability for Safety-Critical Projects|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6504885/|journal=IEEE Software|volume=30|issue=3|pages=58–66|doi=10.1109/MS.2013.60|issn=0740-7459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a failure in safety-[[product certification|certified]] systems is acceptable{{by whom|date=April 2015}} if, on average, less than one life per  10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours of continuous operation is lost to failure.{as per FAA document AC 25.1309-1A} Most Western [[nuclear reactors]], medical equipment, and commercial [[aircraft]] are certified{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to this level.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The cost versus loss of lives has been considered appropriate at this level (by [[FAA]] for aircraft systems under [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2025.1309-1A.pdf|title=System Design and Analysis|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|year=1988|page=|pages=|format=pdf|id=Advisory Circular AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309-1A|quote=|ref=|author=ANM-110|section=|sectionurl=|version=|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/arp4754a|title=Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems|last=S–18|first=|publisher=[[Society of Automotive Engineers]]|year=2010|isbn=|page=|pages=|format=|id=ARP4754A|quote=|ref=|author-link=|coauthors=|section=|sectionurl=|version=|accessdate=}}

==Preventing failure==
[[File:Survival redundancy.svg|thumbnail|A [[NASA]] graph shows the relationship between the survival of a crew of astronauts and the amount of [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] equipment in their spacecraft (the "MM", Mission Module).]]

Once a failure mode is identified, it can usually be mitigated by adding extra or redundant equipment to the system. For example, nuclear reactors contain dangerous [[radiation]], and nuclear reactions can cause so much [[heat]] that no substance might contain them. Therefore, reactors have emergency core cooling systems to keep the temperature down, shielding to contain the radiation, and engineered barriers (usually several, nested, surmounted by a [[containment building]]) to prevent accidental leakage. Safety-critical systems are commonly required to permit no [[single point of failure|single event or component failure]] to result in a catastrophic failure mode.

Most [[biology|biological]] organisms have a certain amount of redundancy: multiple organs, multiple limbs, etc.

For any given failure, a fail-over or redundancy can almost always be designed and incorporated into a system.

There are two categories of techniques to reduce the probability of failure:
Fault avoidance techniques increase the reliability of individual items (increased design margin, de-rating, etc.).
Fault tolerance techniques increase the reliability of the system as a whole (redundancies, barriers, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;

== Safety and reliability ==
{{details|Inherent safety}}{{details|Reliability engineering}}

Safety engineering and reliability engineering have much in common, but safety is not reliability.  If a medical device fails, it should fail safely; other alternatives will be available to the surgeon.  If the engine on a single-engine aircraft fails, there is no backup.  Electrical power grids are designed for both safety and reliability; telephone systems are designed for reliability, which becomes a safety issue when emergency (e.g. US "911") calls are placed.

[[Probabilistic risk assessment]] has created a close relationship between safety and reliability. Component reliability, generally defined in terms of component [[failure rate]], and external event probability are both used in quantitative safety assessment methods such as FTA. Related probabilistic methods are used to determine system [[Mean time between failures|Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)]], system availability, or probability of mission success or failure. Reliability analysis has a broader scope than safety analysis, in that non-critical failures are considered. On the other hand, higher failure rates are considered acceptable for non-critical systems.

Safety generally cannot be achieved through component reliability alone. Catastrophic failure probabilities of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; per hour correspond to the failure rates of very simple components such as  [[resistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. A complex system containing hundreds or thousands of components might be able to achieve a MTBF of 10,000 to 100,000 hours, meaning it would fail at 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; per hour. If a system failure is catastrophic, usually the only practical way to achieve 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; per hour failure rate is through redundancy.

When adding equipment is impractical (usually because of expense), then the least expensive form of design is often "inherently fail-safe". That is, change the system design so its failure modes are not catastrophic. Inherent fail-safes are common in medical equipment, traffic and railway signals, communications equipment, and safety equipment.

The typical approach is to arrange the system so that ordinary single failures cause the mechanism to shut down in a safe way (for nuclear power plants, this is termed a [[Passive nuclear safety|passively safe]] design, although more than ordinary failures are covered). Alternately, if the system contains a hazard source such as a battery or rotor, then it may be possible to remove the hazard from the system so that its failure modes cannot be catastrophic. The U.S. Department of Defense Standard Practice for System Safety (MIL–STD–882) places the highest priority on elimination of hazards through design selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One of the most common fail-safe systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow. Another common example is that in an [[elevator]] the cable supporting the car keeps [[spring-loaded brake]]s open. If the cable breaks, the brakes grab rails, and the elevator cabin does not fall.

Some systems can never be made fail safe, as continuous availability is needed. For example, loss of engine thrust in flight is dangerous. Redundancy, fault tolerance, or recovery procedures are used for these situations (e.g. multiple independent controlled and fuel fed engines). This also makes the system less sensitive for the reliability prediction errors or quality induced uncertainty for the separate items. On the other hand, failure detection &amp; correction and avoidance of common cause failures becomes here increasingly important to ensure system level reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Semantics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''semantic analysis''' is the process of relating [[syntactic structure]]s, from the levels of [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s and [[paragraph]]s to the level of the [[writing]] as a whole, to their language-independent [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. It also involves removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural contexts, to the extent that such a project is possible.  The elements of [[idiom]] and [[figure of speech|figurative speech]], being cultural, are often also converted into relatively invariant meanings in semantic analysis. Semantics, although related to [[pragmatics]], is distinct in that the former deals with word or sentence choice in any given context, while pragmatics considers the unique or particular meaning derived from context or tone. To reiterate in different terms, semantics is about universally coded meaning, and pragmatics, the meaning encoded in words that is then interpreted by an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Cliff|title=Semantic Analysis: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=17|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic analysis can begin with the relationship between individual words.  This requires an understanding of lexical hierarchy, including [[hyponymy and hypernymy]], [[meronomy]], [[polysemy]], synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Christopher|last2=Scheutze|first2=Hinrich|title=Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing|date=1999|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also relates to concepts like [[connotation (semiotics)]] and collocation, which is the particular combination of words that can be or frequently are surrounding a single word.  This can include idioms, metaphor, and simile, like, "white as a ghost."

With the availability of enough material to analyze, semantic analysis can be used to catalog and trace the style of writing of specific authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miranda-Garcıa|first1=Antonio|last2=Calle-Martın|first2=Javier|title=The Authorship of the Disputed Federalist Papers with an Annotated Corpus|journal=English Studies|date=May 2012|volume=93|issue=3|pages=371–390}}&lt;/ref&gt;
