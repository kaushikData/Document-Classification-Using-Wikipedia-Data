'''Allan Bernard Temko''' (February 4, 1924 – January 25, 2006) was an architectural critic and writer based in San Francisco.

== History ==
Born in New York City and raised in [[Weehawken]], New Jersey, Temko served as a [[U.S. Navy]] officer in World War II, graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1947, and continued his graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, France. He taught for several years in France and produced a landmark book about the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], ''Notre Dame of Paris,'' in 1955.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt; He wrote architectural criticism for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' from 1961 to 1993.  He also taught [[city planning]] and the social sciences at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[California State University, Hayward]] (now California State University, East Bay).

Following Finnish-born architect [[Eero Saarinen]]'s death in 1961, Temko published ''[[Eero Saarinen]]'' (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the [[General Motors Technical Center]] to the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] and its [[Gateway Arch]] (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in [[George Braziller]]'s ''Makers of Contemporary Architecture'' series.

Temko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, "a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and – in some ways worst of all – incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes."  One of these villains, an architect named [[Sandy Walker]], famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's [[Pier 39]] project which began, "Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

Temko was instrumental in the removal of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iK4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e3oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3258%2C1195153 |title=Chinatown Demands Highway Repair |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=AP |date={{date|1990-04-17|dmy}} |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and memorably described the 1971 [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] on the Embarcadero as a thing "deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

He described the [[City Center Building]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] in the early 1970s, calling it a "toaster", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building.

Temko, who met [[Jack Kerouac]] when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]'' as the model for the character "Roland Major".&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;  Temko also appeared in Kerouac's ''[[Book of Dreams (novel)|Book of Dreams]]'' as Irving Minko and in ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' as Allen Minko.

He called for an international design competition for the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|eastern span replacement]] of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by [[T.Y. Lin]]) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being "a world-famous work of engineering art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/COMMENTARY-Hold-On-We-Can-Do-Better-by-the-3002571.php |title=COMMENTARY: Hold On — We Can Do Better by the Bridge |author=Temko, Allan |date={{date|1998-06-23|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temko was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in [[Orinda, California]], in 2006.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Allan-Temko-architecture-watchdog-2542550.php |title=Allan Temko - architecture watchdog |author1=Taylor, Michael |author2=King, John |date={{date|2006-01-26|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American University of Afghanistan''' ('''AUAF'''; {{lang-fa|{{nastaliq|دانشگاه آمریکایی افغانستان}}}}; {{lang-ps|{{nastaliq|د افغانستان امریکايي پوهنتون}}}}) is [[Afghanistan]]’s first private, not-for-profit{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} institution of higher education. Chartered in 2004, AUAF offers an MBA program, four undergraduate degree programs, and continuing education and professional development training (the Professional Development Institute).

==History==
The idea for AUAF began in 2002 with Dr. [[Sharif Fayez]], then Afghan Minister of Higher Education. During his time as minister, he proposed the creation of Afghanistan’s first-ever private university. The following year in an address before [[UNESCO]], United States First Lady [[Laura Bush]] announced her support of educational initiatives in Afghanistan. The United States Ambassador [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], likely inspired from his own experience at The American University of Beirut, encouraged the establishment of The American University of Afghanistan.

The Afghanistan High Commission for Private Investment offered leases on two parcels of land totaling {{convert|55.354|acre|m2}} in the Darulaman area of Kabul until 2103. In addition, the non-profit American University of Afghanistan corporation was chartered in the State of [[Delaware]], under the leadership of Dr. Jacob van Lutsenburg Maas, who later became the non-profit corporation's President, to receive these leases. (In 2007, the non-profit corporation became a tax-exempt 501(c) 3 organization).

A charter for the establishment of The American University of Afghanistan was granted on July 26, 2004 by the Afghan Ministry of Higher Education, under Article 46, Chapter 2 of the new Afghan Constitution and Article 445 of the Civil Code. A feasibility study was initiated by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071115123316/http://www.cciuniversities.org/ Coordinating Council of International Universities], based in the United States, to recommend an institutional framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/nea/sasia/afghan/text2003/0709study.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050125041225/http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/nea/sasia/afghan/text2003/0709study.htm |date=January 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, the inaugural meeting of the Board of Trustees convened in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], where Dr. Fayez was elected president pro tempore, serving in this capacity until April 2007, when he was named “founder” by the new president.  He continues to lobby the Afghan government on the university's behalf, serves as an adviser to the current president, and maintains an office on campus.

In March 2005, then United States First Lady (and former teacher) Laura Bush visited the site and announced a substantial grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to launch the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2005/Apr/06-83303.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216110322/http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2005/Apr/06-83303.html |date=February 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USAID continues to be the primary financial backer of the organization as it pursues sources of private funding.

The first students of the American University of Afghanistan enrolled in March 2006. They began with classes to improve their English language and study skills.  The university that September began offering its first credit-bearing undergraduate courses. In 2006 the Professional Development Institute was also launched, providing adult professional courses and adult professional level programs.

On June 8, 2008, Mrs. Bush announced an additional $40 million (USD) in funding for the subsequent five years. Funding will cover more than half of the university's operating expenses during that period, leaving the university to pursue private funding for the remainder of its operating expenses and for the development of its new campus.

The university held its first commencement ceremony on May 26, 2011, awarding undergraduate degrees to 32 graduates. It held its fourth, and largest, graduation on December 5, 2014, where 180 undergraduate and graduate students graduated. On May 22, 2015, the university held its sixth commencement ceremony, honoring the class of 2015, at the university’s International campus. The highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of the Doctorate of Humane Letters Honorary Degree to distinguished guest H.E. Hamid Karzai, the former president of Afghanistan, who also delivered the commencement address.  Currently, more than 2,000 full and part-time students from all 34 provinces of Afghanistan are now enrolled in the university, including 1,190 students in undergraduate and graduate program, and 950 students in certification courses. About 35.9% of  students for Spring 2015 are women, and more than 85% of the students receive financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.auaf.edu.af/news/auaf-achieves-record-enrollment |title=AUAF Achieves Record Enrollment » American University of Afghanistan |publisher=Auaf.edu.af |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013022018/http://auaf.edu.af/news/auaf-achieves-record-enrollment/ |archivedate=2013-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Film Annex, Dr. C.

==Programs==
All programs are conducted entirely in English. The university runs on the U.S. semester system with the academic year starting in August, and in other respects also operates in the style of American universities.

; The Graduate Degree Program

AUAF in fall 2011 began its first graduate program, offering the master of business administration degree.  This program builds on the success of the university's undergraduate business program, which is the most popular major among AUAF students.  A total of 29 students were admitted in the first MBA class. The program is offered with a world-class curriculum taught by internationally qualified faculty with expertise in global business practices. It is now offering students an opportunity to pursue an optional bi-annual concentration program in Finance or Management. This special addition to the core curriculum gives students a unique opportunity to experience an enriched MBA program and gain additional knowledge. The program comprises 14 credit courses that provide a comprehensive view of general business management. Classes are admitted on a cohort basis. Each cohort progresses through an established sequence of courses that first develop the concepts, tools, and techniques used in “best-practices” organizations. The MBA program begins each fall.  The first cohort graduated in May 2013. On May 22, 2015 a total of 59 students graduated from MBA.
Masters of Arts in Education program was launched at AUAF in March 2014. It was a collaborative effort with Afghan Ministry of Education Teacher Training Directorate, and with funding from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) and the World Bank. On April 17, 2015, AUAF held the graduation ceremony for the inaugural cohort of students in this program. The program included 318 students (23% female), representing all of the country's 34 provinces.

; The Undergraduate Degree Program

The American University of Afghanistan currently offers four-year undergraduate degree programs in business administration with concentrations in management, accounting, finance and marketing, information technology and computer science, and political science and public administration.  Through required general studies in their first two years of undergraduate study, all students acquire knowledge in English composition, mathematics, the natural sciences, arts and humanities, and the social sciences. The department of Business provides students with theories and concepts related to international, world-class business practices, and seeks to graduate students who will be competitive in domestic and international firms. Students gain in-depth knowledge of information systems, software design, development and scientific approaches in ITCS.  A combination of political science and public administration exposes students to the subfields of political science in addition to field of public administration.  The law program provides in-depth exposure to all major areas of law. Graduates will be qualified to enter the court system, private legal practice, government and business. To graduate from the Undergraduate Program, students must complete a total of 120 credits, from both General Education and Major-specific requirements. AUAF held its sixth commencement ceremony of class 2015, on May 22, 2015.

'''''April Showers''''' is a 2009 American [[independent film|independent]] [[drama film]] written and directed by Andrew Robinson. It is based on the [[Columbine High School]] [[Columbine High School massacre|shootings]] of which Robinson is a survivor. The film was shot at [[Plattsmouth High School]] in [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska]] in May 2008.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Villarreal, Yvonne (April 16, 2009). [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/16/entertainment/et-columbine16 "Andrew Robinson's 'April Showers' focuses on survivors of Columbine"]. ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the aftermath of a school shooting, several survivors have evacuated to the elementary school to wait for more survivors to arrive. A senior named Sean Ryan calls his friend Vicki at a coffee shop, who tells him that the shooter is Ben Harris, a friend of Sean's. Sean is left speechless.

That morning, before the massacre begins, a student named Jason is being bullied and is struggling to pick up his books, but then Sean helps him. Sean reminds Jason that school is almost over and that he shouldn't let the bullying get to him. The two then go into their school, Jefferson High School; both are seniors there. It is a Monday, and Sean, his best friend Nick, and a few other students, are working on the school play. Sean learns that his friend Ben Harris, who works the lights, is absent, so Jason substitutes for him.

Later, during a lunch period, Sean talks to his math teacher, Martin Blackwell, about the crush he has on his friend, April Lauren. Mr. Blackwell tells him to let her know how he feels about her. Suddenly, the fire alarm rings, and everyone assumes that it is a senior prank. However, as they leave, they hear low rumbling. Mr. Blackwell and Sean then see a group of students, running for their lives and screaming. Three gunshots are heard, and everyone immediately realizes that someone is shooting a gun inside the school. Mr. Blackwell takes a group of students back into his classroom to hide, while Sean and Nick decide to flee for their lives, taking a panicked girl named Samantha ("Sam") with them.

Meanwhile, Jason is left to fend for himself, but he does manage to make it out of the school, carrying out the body of a dead girl in the process. Mr. Blackwell eventually decides to take his group of students and flee, but as they do, the shooter shoots him in the back from behind. Mr. Blackwell tells the students to run, but one student, Jonathan, instead drags Mr. Blackwell back into the math classroom. Jonathan attempts to save his life, but after several minutes, Mr. Blackwell tells him to wait in the closet until help arrives. Sean, Nick, Sam, and a few other students including their friend Mike, stumble upon a suburban area where the injured have evacuated. While searching for April, Sean runs into April's best friend, Jessica, who tells him that the police are having survivors congregate at an elementary school. Sean, Nick, and Mike then decide to go with Jessica.

Meanwhile, a SWAT team enters the school through the main entrance. A single gunshot is then heard, implying that the shooter has committed suicide. While searching, the police find Jonathan, but Jonathan is shocked to learn that Mr. Blackwell has died of his wounds. Jonathan goes into hysterics and blames himself for not doing anything to save him. The film then returns to the beginning scene, where Sean learns that the shooter is Ben. Sean is shocked after learning this, but Nick takes it the hardest, refusing to believe that Ben would cause any trouble. The last group of survivors then arrives, and Sean searches frantically for April. However, a teacher, Sally Reedman, comes in and informs Sean that April is dead.

Sean struggles to cope with April's death, and Jason learns that the security cameras at school captured him carrying the dead girl out, and that he is being hailed as a hero. Later, Sean learns that fourteen people, including Mr. Blackwell, April, and Ben, are dead. April's car is turned into a memorial, and a TV executive, Helen Mann, tries to help Jason cope with his dilemma by introducing him to Sam, believing she was the girl that Jason carried out, but Jason says that it wasn't her. The next night, as everyone learns Ben's motives for the shooting, Sean has a flashback about how when he was unable to tell April about his feelings for her. This flashback causes him to break a mirror, cutting his hand in the process. Sean's father later takes him home.

Meanwhile, Jason's situation spirals out of control, causing him to have a mental breakdown in the middle of a grocery store. He later reveals to Sean that he doesn't believe himself to be a hero because he feels that he is responsible for the death of Matt, a student who bullied him. Later, Nick is released from police custody after falsely being suspected of helping Ben plan the shooting. He says goodbye to Sean and he and his family move away. Meanwhile, Jason commits suicide, unable to take any more of his "fame."

At April's funeral, Jessica gives Sean April's diary. After Sally, Jessica, and Sean perform eulogies for their fallen friend, Sean goes to April's grave and starts crying.

==Production notes==
During the credits, the list of several school shootings from the past (including Columbine and Virginia Tech) are shown, along with the victims of the massacres. A message is then displayed about how officers are now trained to set up a perimeter and move toward gunfire in a school shooting situation since Columbine.

L. |authorlink= Ernest Boyer |year= 1990 |title= Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate. |publisher= Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |url= https://depts.washington.edu/gs630/Spring/Boyer.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boyer, traditional research, or the scholarship of discovery, had been the center of academic life and crucial to an institution's advancement but it needed to be broadened and made more flexible to include not only the new social and environmental challenges beyond the campus but also the reality of contemporary life. His vision was to change the research mission of universities by introducing the idea that scholarship needed to be redefined.

He proposed that scholarship include these four different categories:

* The scholarship of discovery that includes original research that advances knowledge (i.e., [[basic research]]);
* The scholarship of integration that involves synthesis of information across disciplines, across topics within a discipline, or across time (i.e., [[interprofessional education]], or [[science communication]]);
* The scholarship of application (also later called the [[engaged scholarship|scholarship of engagement]]) that goes beyond the service duties of a faculty member to those within or outside the University and involves the rigor and application of disciplinary expertise with results that can be shared with and/or evaluated by peers (i.e., [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]], or [[science diplomacy]]; and
* The [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] that the systematic study of teaching and learning processes. It differs from scholarly teaching in that it requires a format that will allow public sharing and the opportunity for application and evaluation by others.

Boyer's model has been embraced across academia{{cn|date=March 2016}} with occasional refinement, such as specific applications for different disciplines.

'''''Cake''''' (or Cake TV) is a [[situation comedy|sitcom]] and [[How-to]] television series that originally aired on the ''KOL's Secret Slumber Party'' and ''KEWLopolis'' lineup on [[CBS]]. The show was broadcast from September 16, 2006, to December 9, 2006, in its first run and was broadcast from December 16, 2006, to September 12, 2009, in reruns only. The show was produced by [[DIC Entertainment]] in association with [[Brookwell McNamara Entertainment]] ([[Sean McNamara (director)|Sean McNamara]] &amp; [[David Brookwell]]).

Only 13 episodes of this series were produced. On September 19, 2009, ''Cake'' was officially removed from the CBS lineup.

==Premise==
The show revolves around a teenage girl named Cake, who is very much into [[fashion]] and [[handicraft|arts and crafts]]. Cake wishes to follow in the footsteps of her Grandma Crystal, who used to design costumes for a famous rock star. In her spare time, Cake also enjoys [[Irish dance]] and playing the [[bagpipes]]. She wears a pink T-shirt during ''Cake TV'' filming sessions.

Like Cake, her best friend Miracle Ross also has an eye for fashion and art, except she believes in spending money in order to get the perfect gift rather than making it. In "Miracle on Ice", she wore a red T-shirt for the ''Cake TV'' filming session in that episode to match Cake's, but for the rest of the series, she wore a lavender T-shirt, then a purple one.

Amy Carson is a small child who lives in their neighborhood who enjoys cracking jokes and pulling pranks. She wears a green T-shirt during ''Cake TV'' filming sessions.

Together they are the hosts of "Cake TV", an arts-and-crafts show on [[public-access television]] that is taped in Cake's garage. Benjamin Turner, who has no intention of going on camera because of stage fright, is the show's cameraman and director. He wears a blue T-shirt when operating the camera during ''Cake TV'' filming sessions.

The garage where Cake TV is produced is filled with Grandma's endless supply of trinkets she used when designing costumes, such as beads, glitter, ribbon, and many other supplies. Cake always has items organized and ready to be grabbed at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tvguide.com/shows/cake-282916/ |title=Cake |work=TV Guide |accessdate= February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4733">The '''Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland''' or '''CELCIS''' is an organisation that supports the [[well-being]] of children.

==History==
CELCIS was established in 2011 with the intention being to provide a holistic approach, rather than serving a specialist part of the professionals who deal with looked after children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/protecting/lac/CELCIS |title=Centre for excellence for looked after children in Scotland |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to facilitate collaboration and therefore works with a range of organisations to improve outcomes relating to the lives of looked after children in Scotland. The centre was preceded by the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care (SIRCC), which was a centre of excellence that had been set up in 2000.

Types of work that CELCIS are involved with include supporting policy implementation, oversight of the looked after children strategic group and the provision of training, information resources and consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/12464/1/SB_11-79.pdf | page=12 |title=SPICe Briefing: Educational Attainment of Looked After Children |last=Kidner |first=Camilla |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since August 2012 they have a specific responsibility for identifying the development needs of professionals working with looked after children.&lt;ref name="workforce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpscotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LACSIG-Update-for-CCPS-Jan-2013.pdf |title=Looked After Children Strategic Implementation Group  |publisher=Coalition of Care and Support Providers |date=January 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre are funded by the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.celcis.org/about_us/governance/ |title=Governance: Direction, scrutiny, accountability |publisher= Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are hosted by the [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.strath.ac.uk/media/ps/rkes/generalweb/CELCIS.pdf |title=Knowledge Exchange.

The Independent Chair of the Centre is Professor [[Alexis Jay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/2013/headline_729982_en.html |title=2013 Archive: New Independent Chair for CELCIS |publisher=University of Strathclyde |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=31 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827114947/https://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/2013/headline_729982_en.html# |archive-date=2014-08-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Work==
In 2012 they were commissioned by the [[International Social Service]] to produce the “Moving Forward” report which aims to embed children’s rights in alternative care provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativecareguidelines.org/Portals/46/Moving-forward/Moving-forward-implementing-the-guidelines-ENG.pdf | title=Moving Forward: Implementing the ‘Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children’ |last1=Cantwell |first1=N. |last2=Davidson |first2=J. |last3=Elsley, S. |last4=Milligan |first4=I.|last5=Quinn |last6=N. |publisher=Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland |date=2012 |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 they were commissioned by [[SOS Children’s Villages]] to produce "Drumming Together
for Change: A Child’s Right to Quality Care in Sub-Saharan Africa" report based on a synthesis of eight assessments of the implementation of the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children in Benin, Gambia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Sommers' positions and writing have been characterized by the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' as "[[equity feminism]]", a [[classical liberalism|classical]]-[[liberal feminist|liberal]] or [[libertarian]] feminist perspective holding that the main political role of feminism is to ensure that the right against coercive interference is not infringed.&lt;ref name="stan1"/&gt; Sommers has contrasted equity feminism with "[[victim feminism]]" and "[[gender feminism]]",&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite web |author=Christina Hoff Sommers |access-date=November 16, 2014 |website=AEI.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117085529/http://aei.org/docLib/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2009 |url=http://aei.org/docLib/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf |title=What's Wrong and What's Right with Contemporary Feminism? |quote=The dominant philosophy of today’s women’s movement is not equity feminism--but "victim feminism."}} Hamilton College speech, 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RCMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA693 |page=693 |title=Handbook of Construtionist Research |chapter=35: Feminism and Constructionism (in Part VI: Continuing Challenges) |first=Barbara L. |last=Marshal |editor1-first=James A. |editor1-last=Holstein |editor2-first=Jaber F. |editor2-last=Gubrium |quote=Christina Hoff Sommers (1994) coined the term ''gender feminism'' in opposition to ''equity feminism''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that modern feminist thought often contains an "irrational hostility to men" and possesses an "inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different".&lt;ref name="speech"/&gt;

==Career==
===Ideas and views===

===Early work===
From 1978 to 1980, Sommers was an instructor at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston|University of Massachusetts at Boston]].  In 1980, she became an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Clark University]], and was promoted to associate professor in 1986.  Sommers remained at Clark until 1997, when she became the W.H Brady fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.&lt;ref name=Gale1/&gt;
During the mid-1980s, Sommers edited two philosophy textbooks on the subject of ethics: ''Vice &amp; Virtue in Everyday Life: Introductory Readings in Ethics'' (1984) and ''Right and Wrong: Basic Readings in Ethics'' (1986). Reviewing ''Vice and Virtue'' for ''Teaching Philosophy'' in 1990, Nicholas Dixon wrote that the book was "extremely well edited" and "particularly strong on the motivation for studying virtue and ethics in the first place, and on theoretical discussions of virtue and vice in general."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Dixon, Book Review, ''Teaching Philosophy'' 13 No. 1 (March 1990): 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s, Sommers published a series of articles in which she strongly criticized feminist philosophers and American feminism in general&lt;ref&gt;Tom Digby, "Political Correctness and the Fear of Feminism." ''The Humanist'' 52, no. 2 (March 1992), 7.
*Digby describes Sommers as "quite notorious among philosophers" as "the author of several articles... attacking feminism generally and certain feminist philosophers in particular."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Friedman "The Lived Happily Ever After: Sommers on Women and Marriage." ''Journal of Social Philosophy'' 21, Issue 2-3 (September 1990): 57–58. 
*"In a series of papers... Christina Sommers mounts a campaign against feminist philosopher and 'American feminism' in general."&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 ''[[Public Affairs Quarterly]]'' article titled "Should the Academy Support Academic Feminism?", Sommers wrote that "the intellectual and moral credentials of academic feminism badly want scrutiny," and asserted that "the tactics used by academic feminists have all been employed at one time or another to further other forms of academic imperialism."&lt;ref name=SommersAcademic&gt;Sommers, Christina. "Should the Academy Support Academic Feminism?". Public Affairs Quarterly2.3 (1988): 97–120.&lt;/ref&gt; In articles titled "The Feminist Revelation" and "Philosophers against the Family," which she published during the early 1990s, Sommers argued that many academic feminists were "radical philosophers" who sought dramatic social and cultural change - such as the abolition of the nuclear family - and thus revealed their contempt for the actual wishes of the "average woman."&lt;ref&gt;Christina Sommers, "The Feminist Revelation," Social Philosophy and Policy, 8, 1 (Autumn 1990): 141-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Sommers, "Philosophers against the Family," in ''Virtue and Vice in Everyday Life,'' edited by Christina Sommers and Fred Sommers, 3rd ed.

===''Who Stole Feminism''===
{{Main|Who Stole Feminism?}}
In ''Who Stole Feminism'', Sommers outlines her distinction between "gender feminism", which she regards as being the dominant contemporary approach to feminism, and "equity feminism", which she presents as more akin to [[first-wave feminism]]. She uses the work to argue that contemporary feminism is too radical and disconnected from the lives of typical American women, presenting her equity feminism alternative as a better match for their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Kinahan, Anne-Marie. (2001). "Women Who Run from the Wolves: Feminist Critique as Post-Feminism", ''Canadian Review of American Studies'' 32:2. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In criticizing contemporary feminism, Sommers writes that an often-mentioned [[March of Dimes]] study which says that "domestic violence is the leading cause of birth defects", does not exist, and that violence against women does not peak during the [[Super Bowl]], which she describes as an [[urban legend]], arguing that such statements about domestic violence helped shape the [[Violence Against Women Act]], which initially allocated $1.6 billion a year in federal funds for ending domestic violence against women. Similarly, she argues&lt;ref name="Sommers1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christina Hoff Sommers|title=Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&amp;pg=PA12|date=May 1, 1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-80156-8|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that feminists assert that approximately 150,000 women die each year from [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], an apparent distortion of the [[American Anorexia and Bulimia Association]]'s figure that 150,000 females have some degree of anorexia.&lt;ref name="Flanders"&gt;{{cite web|first=Laura |last=Flanders |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1246 |title=The 'Stolen Feminism' Hoax: Anti-Feminist Attack Based on Error-Filled Anecdotes |work=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|fair.org]] |archive-date=February 5, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205073450/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1246 |dead-url=yes |quote=September/October 1994 |date=Autumn 1994 |df=mdy }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|dead-url=no |title=The 'Stolen Feminism' Hoax |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221075013/http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-stolen-feminism-hoax |url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/the-stolen-feminism-hoax |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |date=September 1, 1994 |quote=Sep 01 1994 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Wendy McElroy |first=Wendy |last=McElroy |url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/articles/spin1199.html |title=Prostitution: Reconsidering Research}} originally printed in ''SpinTech'' magazine, reprinted at [http://wendymcelroy.com/ WendyMcElroy.com] on 12 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Kirkpatrick]], writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', praised the book for its "lack of a political agenda", and said "Sommers simply lines up her facts and shoots one bull's-eye after another".&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news |first=Melanie |last=Kirkpatrick |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=Bookshelf: Taking feminism back|date=July 14, 1994|p=A8 |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/398521549 |url-access=subscription |quote=One of the strengths of 'Who Stole Feminism' is its lack of a political agenda.

===''The War Against Boys''===
{{POV section|date=April 2017}}
In 2000, Sommers published ''The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men.''  In the book, Sommers challenged what she called the "myth of shortchanged girls" and the "new and equally corrosive fiction" that "boys as a group are disturbed."&lt;ref name=publishers1&gt;"The War Against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men." ''Publishers Weekly,'' 26 June 2000: 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticizing programs which had been set up in the 1980s to encourage girls and young women - largely in response to studies which had suggested that girls "suffering through neglect in the classroom and the indifference of male-dominated society"&lt;ref name=libj&gt;Bell-Russel, D. (2000). The war against boys: How misguided feminism is harming our young men. Library Journal, 125(11), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; - Sommers argued in ''The War Against Boys'' that such programs were based on flawed research, arguing that it was just the other way around: boys were a year and a half behind girls in reading and writing and less likely to go to college.

She blamed [[Carol Gilligan]] as well as organizations such as the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW)&lt;ref name=libj/&gt; for creating a situation in which "boys are resented, both as the unfairly privileged sex and as obstacles on the path to gender justice for girls." According to Sommers, "a review of the facts shows boys, not girls, on the weak side of an education gender gap."&lt;ref name=Gale1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200005/war-against-boys |title=The War Against Boys |author=Christina Hoff Sommers |website=TheAtlantic.Com |access-date=August 30, 2015 |date=May 2000 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819084307/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/ |archivedate=August 19, 2012 |quote=How did we come to believe in a picture of American boys and girls that is the opposite of the truth? .. The answer has much to do with one of the American academy's most celebrated women—Carol Gilligan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers wrote, "We are turning against boys and forgetting a simple truth: that the energy, competitiveness, and corporal daring of normal, decent males is responsible for much of what is right in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/christinah182318.html|title=Christina Hoff Sommers Quotes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian cultural studies professor [[Tara Brabazon]] wrote that with these words, "Sommers becomes the ventriloquist's dummy for male educational professors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdIjOrSa9ZUC&amp;pg=PA23 |page=23 |last=Brabazon |first=Tara |authorlink=Tara Brabazon |date=2002 |title=Ladies who Lunge: Celebrating Difficult Women |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=9780868404219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received mixed reviews. In conservative publications such as the ''[[National Review]]'' and ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', ''The War Against Boys'' was praised for its "stinging indictment of an anti-male movement that has had a pervasive influence on the nation's schools."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lowry, "The Male Eunuch," ''National Review,'' July 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and for identifying "a problem in urgent need of redress."&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Chester E.,, Jr. (2000, 09). Puppy-dogs' tails. Commentary, 110, 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', opinion columnist [[Richard Bernstein]] called it a "thoughtful, provocative book," and suggested that Sommers had made her arguments "persuasively and unflinchingly, and with plenty of data to support them."&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;Richard Bernstein, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EFD8123DF932A05754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 Books of the Times: Boys, Not Girls, as Society's Victims], nytimes.com, July 31, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Summers, in ''The Journal of School Choice'', said that 'Sommers’ book and her public voice are in themselves a small antidote to the junk science girding our typically commonsense-free, utterly ideological national debate on “women’s issues.' &lt;ref&gt;Pullman, ''Journal of School Choice'' 2004, 337-339.&lt;/ref&gt;''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' suggested that Sommers' conclusions were "compelling" and "deserve an unbiased hearing," while also noting that Sommers "descends into pettiness when she indulges in mudslinging at her opponents."&lt;ref name=publishers1/&gt; Similarly, a review in ''[[Booklist]]'' suggested that while Sommers "argues cogently that boys are having major problems in school," the book was unlikely to convince all readers "that these problems are caused by the [[American Association of University Women]], [[Carol Gilligan]], [[Mary Pipher]], and [[William S. Pollack]]," all of whom were strongly criticized in the book. Ultimately, the review suggested, "Sommers is as much of a crisismonger as those she critiques."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Mary. "The War against Boys: How Misguided Feminism Is Harming Our Young Men." Booklist 1 May 2000: 1587.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''The War Against Boys'' for ''The New York Times'', [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatrist]] [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]] wrote that Sommers "speaks of our children, yet hasn't sought them out; instead she attends those who have, in fact, worked with boys and girls--and in so doing is quick to look askance at Carol Gilligan's ideas about girls, [William] Pollack's about boys."  Much of the book, according to Coles, "comes across as Sommers's strongly felt war against those two prominent psychologists, who have spent years trying to learn how young men and women grow to adulthood in the United States."&lt;ref name=Gale1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Coles, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/25/reviews/000625.25colest.html?_r=1 Boys to Men, Two views of what it's like to be young and male in the United States today], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 25, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Nicholas Lemann]] wrote that Sommers "sets the research bar considerably higher for the people she is attacking than she does for herself," using an "odd, ambushing style of refutation, in which she demands that data be provided to her and questions answered, and then, when the flummoxed person on the other end of the line stammers helplessly, triumphantly reports that she got 'em." Lemann faulted Sommers for accusing Gilligan of using anecdotal argument when her own book "rests on an anecdotal base," and for making numerous assertions that were not supported by the footnotes in her book.&lt;ref name=Lemann&gt;Nicholas Lemann, "The Battle Over Boys," ''The New Yorker'' Vol 76 Issue 18 (July 10, 2000), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' E. Anthony Rotundo stated that "in the end, Sommers ... does not show that there is a 'war against boys.' All she can show is that feminists are attacking her 'boys-will-be-boys' concept of boyhood, just as she attacks their more flexible notion." Sommers's title, according to Rotundo, "is not just wrong but inexcusably misleading... a work of neither dispassionate [[social science]] nor reflective scholarship; it is a conservative [[polemic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=E.

'''''Crosscountry''''' is an educational simulation software series of programs for North American students ([[first grade|grade one]] through [[ninth grade|grade nine]]). Many schools use these games as a fun way to teach their students about the states, provinces, territories, and cities. The game is published by [[Ingenuity Works]], a Vancouver-based company originally known as Didatech Software.
In most of the games, the player will drive an 18-wheeler to pick up and deliver commodities to the cities assigned, while making decisions about the best route, when to eat, sleep, fill up gas, etc.

==''Crosscountry USA (1985)''==
This was the first game in the series, released in 1985 by Didatech Software (later renamed to Ingenuity Works). Educational Software Reviews deemed it "the type of game you can play for a full hour without getting tired."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.his.com/~pshapiro/xc.usa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Developed for the PC, the purpose of the game is to pick up commodities from one city and deliver them to another by driving across the country. Players interacted with the game through a command line using commands such as "turn on truck".

==''Crosscountry Canada (1986)''==
This was the second game in the series, released in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Crosscountry_Canada_1986_Didatech_Disk_1_of_2 |title=Crosscountry Canada (1986)(Didatech)(Disk 1 of 2) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=20 July 2016 |website=Archive.org |access-date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Apple II by Didatech Software, and later ported to DOS in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/msdos_Crosscountry_Canada_1991 |title=Crosscountry Canada 1991 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=23 December 2014 |website=Archive.org |access-date=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Home of the Underdogs]] deemed it "One of the best edutainment titles ever made".&lt;ref&gt;http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=4036&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This title has since been made available on several websites, free-to-play.

==''Crosscountry California (1987)''==
As titled, players of this game are restricted to the boundaries of California. The gameplay was similar to Crosscountry USA.

== ''Crosscountry Texas (1987)'' ==
The game was the first geography simulation to be designed specifically for Texas schools.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/14584473/|title=Del Rio News Herald from Del Rio, Texas on December 9, 1987 · Page 19|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game contained simulated travel from city to city throughout Texas.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED313011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The game sees players  travel to 135 cities and collect up to 55 commodities; the game requires 128K to run, and the school version includes a back-up disk and a teacher 's manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TwoSeriesSoftwareSpring1989CatalogAppleIISoftwarePeripherals/Two%20Series%20Software%20Spring%201989%20Catalog%20Apple%20II%20Software%20Peripherals_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Two Series Software Spring 1989 Catalog Apple II Software &amp; Peripherals"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was created without the state's involvement, similar to California, and in contrast to North Dakota.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/dougalder/docs/1992-10_tcp_bc-ocr|title=1992 10 The Computer Paper - BC Edition|last=|first=|date=|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul Melhus, president of Didatech, the simulation of Texas was designed to be as realistic as possible. The game was not used in Del Rio, as school officials noted the limited use of computers within education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The title was released onto DOS and the Apple II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The paper ''Technology: Window to the Future. Proceedings of the Annual State Conference of the Texas Computer Education Association'' noted that the game was more attractive to Texan teachers than Crosscountry USA due to the "proximity and familiarity with the content".&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED316193.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Crosscountry North Dakota (1992)'' ==
In October 1992, Didatech announced a deal with the North Dakota's Department of Public Instruction to create a state-specific version of the software for the state's schools.The state would provide statistical data to adapt Cross Country USA to a North Dakotan edition. Didatech estimated a production schedule of 100 hours, much quicker than the year taken for the USA version. This came off the heels of the targeted versions Canada, California, and Texas. The game was unique in that Didatech worked with the state's officials directly in production, while the Texas and Californian versions were created without the states' input. At the time of the announcement, Didatech was arranging deals similar to the North Dakotan one with Illinois, Virginia, Ontario, and British Colombia. the game was released onto the Apple II, while a DOS version was being worked on for release the following year. The Computer Paper felt the project "makes the most of what the small firm has".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/dougalder/docs/1992-10_tcp_bc-ocr|title=1992 10 The Computer Paper - BC Edition|last=|first=|date=|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That game had turned out to be cost-effective; the state invested $45,000 and supplied information for the software maker to use, while Didatech produced the game and manual. Didatech sold a school version of the software to the state, which then sold it directly to schools; meanwhile Didatech would sell a separate retail version through its traditional retail channels. The cost per school was only $65, verses $350 for the site license of a national title. Didatech president Paul Melhus asserted that this type of collaboration was better suited to smaller states due to them being less bureaucratic, more flexible, and more open to innovation.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=9H4OAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22where+in+north+dakota+is+carmen+sandiego%22|title=States Get Tailor-Made Geography Software|last=|first=|date=September 1, 1992|work=Education Computer News, Volume 9|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This formula was later followed with ''[[Where in North Dakota Is Carmen Sandiego?]]''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==''Crosscountry Canada Platinum (2000)''==
The game was added to incorporate the new territory of [[Nunavut]] and the [[Confederation Bridge]] in [[Prince Edward Island]].

==''Crosscountry USA 2 (2002)''==
The game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ingenuityworks.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=51&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Crosscountry Canada 2 (2002)''==
[[Image:Crosscountry Canada 2 cover.jpg|thumb|right|''Crosscountry Canada 2'' cover art]]
This game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works. Players drive an 18-wheeler truck picking up and delivering commodities across Canada while learning about provinces, cities, territories and more. Making wise decisions along the way will result in a successful trip. It features different large cities throughout Canada, and is an on-rails driving game.

==''Crosscountry USA Photo Safari (2002)''==
This game was released in 2002, by Ingenuity Works. The game is "much like Crosscountry USA 2 but with a focus on animals rather than commodities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoldschoolhouse.com/Homeschool_Reviews/5159.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407112901/http://www.theoldschoolhouse.com/Homeschool_Reviews/5159.php |archivedate=2016-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''English Education Act''' was a legislative Act of the [[Council of India]] in 1835 giving effect to a decision in 1835 by [[Lord William Bentinck]],then [[Governor-General]] of [[British East India Company|British India]], to reallocate funds the [[East India Company]] was required by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to spend on education and literature in [[India]].  Formerly, they had supported traditional Muslim and Hindu education and the publication of literature in the native learned tongues ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]); henceforward they were to support establishments teaching a Western curriculum with English as the language of instruction. Together with other measures promoting English as the language of administration and of the higher law courts (replacing [[Farsi|Persian]]), this led eventually to English becoming one of the languages of India, rather than simply the native tongue of its foreign rulers.

In discussions leading up to the Act [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] produced his famous Memorandum on (Indian) Education which was scathing on the inferiority (as he saw it) of native (particularly Hindu) culture and learning. He argued that Western learning was superior, and currently could only be taught through the medium of English.  There was therefore a need to  produce - by English-language higher education -" a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect" who could in their turn develop the tools to transmit Western learning in the vernacular languages of India. Among Macaulay's recommendations were the immediate stopping of the printing by the East India Company of Arabic and Sanskrit books and that the Company should not continue to support traditional education beyond  "the Sanscrit College at Benares and the Mahometan College at Delhi" (which he considered adequate to maintain traditional learning).

The Act itself, however, took a less negative attitude to traditional education and was soon succeeded by further measures based upon the provision of adequate funding for both approaches.  Vernacular language education, however, continued to receive little funding, although it had not been much supported before 1835 in any case.

When the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] had [[Charter Act of 1813|renewed the charter]] of the East India Company for 20 years in 1813, it had required the Company to apply 100,000 rupees per year&lt;ref&gt;The rupee was then worth about two shillings, so roughly £10,000 (equivalent current purchasing power clearly considerably more)&lt;/ref&gt; "for the revival and promotion of literature and the encouragement of the learned natives of India, and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British territories."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Macaulay's Minute&lt;/ref&gt; This had gone to support traditional forms (and content) of education, which (like their contemporary equivalents in England) were firmly non-utilitarian.
  
By the early 1820s some administrators within the East India Company were questioning if this was a sensible use of the money.  [[James Mill]] noted that the declared purpose of the [[Aliah University|Madrassa (Mohammedan College)]] and the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Hindu College]] in Calcutta set up by the company had been "to make a favourable impression, by our encouragement of their literature, upon the minds of the natives" but took the view that the aim of the company should have been to further not Oriental learning but "useful learning."  Indeed, [[Presidency University, Kolkata|private enterprise colleges]] had begun to spring up in Bengal teaching Western knowledge in English ("English education"), to serve a native clientele which felt it would be more important that their sons learnt to understand the English than that they were taught to appreciate classic poetry.
 
Broadly similar issues (‘classical education’ vs ‘liberal education’) had already arisen for education in England with existing [[grammar school]]s being unwilling (or legally unable) to give instruction in subjects other than Latin or Greek and were to end in an expansion of their curriculum to include modern subjects.  In the Indian situation a complicating factor was that the 'classical education' reflected the attitudes and beliefs of the various traditions in the sub-continent, 'English education' clearly did not, and there was felt to be a danger of an adverse reaction among the existing learned classes of India to any withdrawal of support for them.
 
This led to divided counsels within the Committee of Public Instruction. [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]],  who was Legal Member of the Council of India, and was to be President of the Committee, refused to take up the post until the matter was resolved, and sought a clear directive from the Governor-General on the strategy to be adopted.

It should have been clear what answer Macaulay was seeking, given his past comments. In 1833 in the House of Commons Macaulay (then MP for Leeds),&lt;ref&gt;subsequent financial difficulties had led him to go out to India to rebuild his fortunes&lt;/ref&gt; had spoken in favour of renewal of the Company's charter, in terms which make his own views on the culture and society of the sub-continent adequately clear:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I see a government&lt;ref&gt;that of the East India Company&lt;/ref&gt; anxiously bent on the public good. Even in its errors I recognize a paternal feeling towards the great people committed to its charge. I see toleration strictly maintained. Yet I see bloody and degrading superstitions gradually losing their power. I see the morality, the philosophy, the taste of Europe, beginning to produce a salutary effect on the hearts and understandings of our subjects. I see the public mind of India, that public mind which we found debased and contracted by the worst forms of political and religious tyranny, expanding itself to just and noble views of the ends of government and of the social duties of man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finishing with a [[peroration]] holding it a moral imperative to educate the Indians in English ways, not to keep them submissive but to give them the potential eventually to claim the same rights as the English:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is that power worth which is founded on vice, on ignorance, and on misery—which we can hold only by violating the most sacred duties which as governors we owe to the governed—which as a people blessed with far more than an ordinary measure of political liberty and of intellectual light—we owe to a race debased by three thousand years of despotism and priest craft? We are free, we are civilized, to little purpose, if we grudge to any portion of the human race an equal measure of freedom and civilization.

Are we to keep the people of India ignorant in order that we may keep them submissive? Or do we think that we can give them knowledge without awakening ambition? Or do we mean to awaken ambition and to provide it with no legitimate vent? Who will answer any of these questions in the affirmative? Yet one of them must be answered in the affirmative, by every person who maintains that we ought permanently to exclude the natives from high office. I have no fears. The path of duty is plain before us: and it is also the path of wisdom, of national prosperity, of national honour.

The destinies of our Indian empire are covered with thick darkness. It is difficult to form any conjecture as to the fate reserved for a state which resembles no other in history, and which forms by itself a separate class of political phenomena. The laws which regulate its growth and its decay are still unknown to us. It may be that the public mind of India may expand under our system till it has outgrown that system; that by good government we may educate our subjects into a capacity for better government, that, having become instructed in European knowledge, they may, in some future age, demand European institutions. Whether such a day will ever come I know not. But never will I attempt to avert or to retard it. Whenever it comes, it will be the proudest day in English history. To have found a great people sunk in the lowest depths of slavery and superstition, to have so ruled them as to have made them desirous and capable of all the privileges of citizens would indeed be a title to glory all our own.&lt;ref&gt;But in an essay of 1825, Macaulay had defended the politics of [[John Milton|Milton]] (objected to by [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson's]] ''Lives of the Poets'') on very different lines
:Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition, that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom.  The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story who resolved not to go into the water till he had learnt to swim.  If men are to wait for liberty till they become wise and good in slavery, they might indeed wait forever. "Milton", Edinburgh Review, August 1825 ; included in T. B. Macaulay ' Critical and Historical Essays, Vol 1' , J M Dent, London, 1910 [Everyman's Library, volume 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sceptre may pass away from us. Unforeseen accidents may derange our most profound schemes of policy Victory may be inconstant to our arms. But there are triumphs which are followed by no reverses. There is an empire exempt from all natural causes of decay. Those triumphs are the pacific triumphs of reason over barbarism; that empire is the imperishable empire of our arts and our morals, our literature and our laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1833/jul/10/east-india-companys-charter Hansard House of Commons Debates 10 July 1833 vol 19 cc479-550 (Second Reading Debate)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Macaulay's "Minute Upon Indian Education"==
To remove all doubt, however, Macaulay produced and circulated a Minute on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html  best read in its entirety to appreciate its full force; full text at]&lt;/ref&gt; Macaulay argued that support for the publication of books in Sanskrit and Arabic should be withdrawn, support for traditional education should be reduced to funding for the Madrassa at [[Delhi]] and the Hindu College at [[Varanasi|Benares]], but students should no longer be paid to study at these establishments.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay described it as unheard of that students should have to be paid to study, but later had to concede that scholarships were routinely awarded at English universities&lt;/ref&gt; The money released by these steps should instead go to fund education in Western subjects, with English as the language of instruction. He summarised his argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To sum up what I have said, I think it is clear that we are not fettered by the Act of Parliament of 1813; that we are not fettered by any pledge expressed or implied; that we are free to employ our funds as we choose; that we ought to employ them in teaching what is best worth knowing; that English is better worth knowing than Sanskrit or Arabic; that the natives are desirous to be taught English, and are not desirous to be taught Sanskrit or Arabic; that neither as the languages of law, nor as the languages of religion, have the Sanskrit and Arabic any peculiar claim to our engagement; that it is possible to make natives of this country thoroughly good English scholars, and that to this end our efforts ought to be directed.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;text to be found in Sharp, H. (ed.). 1920. Selections from Educational Records, Part I (1781–1839). Superintendent, Govt. Printing, Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Macaulay’s comparison of Arabic and Sanskrit literature to what was available in English is forceful, colourful, and nowadays often quoted against him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. .... I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, a response to the Minute circulated by [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]] (also to be found in Sharp, H. (ed.). 1920. Selections from Educational Records, Part I (1781–1839). Superintendent, Govt. Printing, Calcutta) whilst disagreeing strongly with the proposed course of action agreed with this verdict: "It is laid down that the vernacular dialects are not fit to be made the vehicle of instruction in science or literature, that the choice is therefore between English on one hand and Sanskrit and Arabic on the other – the latter are dismissed on the ground that their literature is worthless and the superiority of that of England is set forth in all animated description of the treasures of science and of intelligence it contains and of the stores of intellectual enjoyment it opens. There is no body acquainted with both literatures that will not subscribe to all that is said in the minute of the superiority of that of England.&lt;/ref&gt; Honours might be roughly even in works of the imagination, such as poetry, but when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded, and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable."&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He returned to the comparison later:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever knows [English] has ready access to all the vast intellectual wealth, which all the wisest nations of the earth have created and hoarded in the course of ninety generations. It may be safely said, that the literature now extant in that language is of far greater value than all the literature which three hundred years ago was extant in all the languages of the world together.

The question now before us is simply whether, when it is in our power to teach this language, we shall teach languages, by which, by universal confession, there are not books on any subject which deserve to be compared to our own; whether, when we can teach European science, we shall teach systems which, by universal confession, whenever they differ from those of Europe, differ for the worse; and whether, when we can patronise sound Philosophy and true History, we shall countenance, at the public expense, medical doctrines, which would disgrace an English farrier, --Astronomy, which would move laughter in girls at an English boarding school,--History, abounding with kings thirty feet high, and reigns thirty thousand years long,--and Geography, made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mass education would be (in the fullness of time) by the class of Anglicised Indians the new policy should produce, and by the means of vernacular dialects:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In one point I fully agree with the gentlemen to whose general views I am opposed. I feel with them, that it is impossible for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Act ==
Bentink writing that he was in full agreement with the sentiments expressed.&lt;ref&gt;most likely because he had held them before the Minute was written; the Minute should therefore be read as a rumbustious justification of a foregone conclusion, not as an exercise in persuasive analysis.  Perhaps the point was made to Macaulay at the time; in an essay published in the Edinburgh Review in July 1835 (and therefore roughly contemporaneous with the Minute), he wrote of [[Charles James Fox]]'s ''History of James the Second'': ..those more serious improprieties of manner into which a great orator who undertakes to write history is in danger of falling.  There is about the whole book a vehement, contentious, replying manner.  Almost every argument is put in the form of an interrogation, an ejaculation or a sarcasm.  THe writer seems to be addressing himself to some imaginary audience&lt;br /&gt;"Sir James Mackintosh", Edinburgh Review, August 1825 ; included in T. B. Macaulay ' Critical and Historical Essays, Vol 1' , J M Dent, London, 1910 [Everyman's Library, volume 225]&lt;/ref&gt; However, students at the Calcutta Madrassa raised a petition against its closure; this quickly got considerable support and the Madrassa and its Hindu equivalent were therefore retained.  Otherwise the Act endorsed and implemented the policy Macaulay had argued for.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Governor-General of India in Council has attentively considered the two letters from the Secretary to the Committee of Public Instruction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Thoby Prinsep]], who was given a hard time  on 2 different counts
* procedurally he should have waited to be asked before giving his views
* there was some suspicion that he had leaked news of the likely new policy to the Calcutta Madrassa students&lt;/ref&gt; dated the 21st and 22nd January last, and the papers referred to in them.

First, His Lordship in Council is of opinion that the great object of the British Government ought to be the promotion of European literature and science among the natives of India; and that all the funds appropriated for the purpose of education would be best employed on English education alone.

Second, But it is not the intention of His Lordship in Council to abolish any College or School of native learning, while the native population shall appear to be inclined to avail themselves of the advantages which it affords, and His Lordship in Council directs that all the existing professors and students at all the institutions under the superintendence of the Committee shall continue to receive their stipends. But his lordship in Council decidedly objects to the practice which has hitherto prevailed of supporting the students during the period of their education. He conceives that the only effect of such a system can be to give artificial encouragement to branches of learning which, in the natural course of things, would be superseded by more useful studies and he directs that no stipend shall be given to any student that may hereafter enter at any of these institutions; and that when any professor of Oriental learning shall vacate his situation, the Committee shall report to the Government the number and state of the class in order that the Government may be able to decide upon the expediency of appointing a successor.

Third, It has come to the knowledge of the Governor-General in Council that a large sum has been expended by the Committee on the printing of Oriental works; his Lordship in Council directs that no portion of the funds shall hereafter be so employed.

Fourth, His Lordship in Council directs that all the funds which these reforms will leave at the disposal of the Committee be henceforth employed in imparting to the native population a knowledge of English literature and science through the medium of the English language; and His lordship,,

==Opposition in London suppressed==
On the news of the Act reaching England, a despatch giving the official response of the Company's Court of Directors was drafted within India House (the company's London office). James Mill was a leading figure within the India House (as well as being a leading [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]]). Although he was known to favour education in the vernacular languages of India, otherwise he might have been expected to be broadly in favour of the Act. However, he was by then a dying man, and the task of drafting the response fell to his son [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was thought to hold similar views to his father, but his draft despatch turned out to be quite critical of the Act.

Mill argued that students seeking an 'English education' in order to prosper could simply acquire enough of the requisite practical accomplishments (facility in English etc.) to prosper without bothering to acquire the cultural attitudes; for example it did not follow that at the same time they would also free themselves from superstition.  Even if they did the current learned classes of India commanded widespread respect in Indian culture, and that one of the reasons they did so was the lack of practical uses for their learning; they were pursuing learning as an end in itself, rather than as a means to advancement.  The same could not reliably said of those seeking an 'English education', and therefore it was doubtful how they would be regarded by Indian society and therefore how far they would be able to influence it for the better.  It would have been a better policy to continue to conciliate the existing learned classes, and to attempt to introduce European knowledge and disciplines into their studies and thus make them the desired interpreter class.  This analysis was acceptable to East India Company's Court of Directors but unacceptable to their political masters (because it effectively endorsed the previous policy of 'engraftment') and [[John Cam Hobhouse]] insisted on the despatch being redrafted to be a mere holding statement noting the Act but venturing no opinion upon it.

== After the Act ==

===Reversion to favouring traditional colleges===
By 1839 [[Lord Auckland]] had succeeded Bentinck as Governor-General, and Macaulay had returned to England.  Auckland contrived to find sufficient funds to support the English Colleges set up by Bentinck's Act without continuing to run down the traditional Oriental colleges.  He wrote a Minute (of 24 November 1839) giving effect to this; both Oriental and English colleges were to be adequately funded.  The East India Company directors responded with a despatch in 1841 endorsing the twin-track approach and suggesting a third:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We forbear at present from expressing an opinion regarding the most efficient mode of communicating and disseminating European Knowledge. Experience does not yet warrant the adoption of any exclusive system.  We wish a fair trial to be given to the experiment of engrafting European Knowledge on the studies of the existing learned Classes, encouraged as it will be by giving to the Seminaries in which those studies are prosecuted,the aid of able and efficient European Superintendence. At the same time we authorise you to give all suitable encouragement to translators of European works into the vernacular languages and also to provide for the compilation of a proper series of Vernacular Class books according to the plan which Lord Auckland has proposed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The East India Company also resumed subsidising the publication of Sanscrit and Arabic works, but now by a grant to the [[Royal Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]] rather than by undertaking publication under their own auspices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.engl.polyu.edu.hk/department/academicstaff/documents/5_Evans%20(2002b).pdf Stephen Evans,"Macaulay’s Minute Revisited: Colonial Language Policy in Nineteenth-century India", Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development Vol. 23, No. 4, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mill's later views ===
In 1861, Mill in the last chapter ('On the Government of Dependencies') of his 'Considerations on Representative Government' restated the doctrine Macaulay had advanced a quarter of a century earlier – the moral imperative to improve subject peoples, which justified reforms by the rulers of which the ruled were as yet unaware of the need for,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are ... [conditions of society] in which, there being no spring of spontaneous improvement in the people themselves, their almost only hope of making any steps in advance [to 'a higher civilisation'] depends on the chances of a good despot. Under a native despotism, a good despot is a rare and transitory accident: but when the dominion they are under is that of a more civilised people, that people ought to be able to supply it constantly.  The ruling country ought to be able to do for its subjects all that could be done by a succession of absolute monarchs guaranteed by irresistible force against the precariousness of tenure attendant on barbarous despotisms, and qualified by their genius to anticipate all that experience has taught to the more advanced nation. Such is the ideal rule of a free people over a barbarous or semi-barbarous one.  We need not expect to see that ideal realised; but unless some approach to it is, the rulers are guilty of a dereliction of the highest moral trust which can devolve upon a nation: and if they do not even aim at it, they are selfish usurpers, on a par in criminality with any of those whose ambition and rapacity have sported from age to age with the destiny of masses of mankind"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

but Mill went on to warn of the difficulties this posed in practice; difficulties which whatever the merits of the Act of 1835 do not seem to have suggested themselves to Macaulay:&lt;ref&gt;of whom [[Lord Melbourne]] is said to have remarked "I wish I was as cocksure of anything as Tom Macaulay is of everything" – see Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is always under great difficulties, and very imperfectly, that a country can be governed by foreigners; even when there is no disparity, in habits and ideas, between the rulers and the ruled.  Foreigners do not feel with the people. They cannot judge, by the light in which a thing appears to their own minds, or the manner in which it affects their feelings, how it will affect the feelings or appear to the minds of the subject population.  What a native of the country, of average practical ability, knows as it were by instinct, they have to learn slowly, and after all imperfectly, by study and experience.  The laws, the customs, the social relations, for which they have to legislate, instead of being familiar to them from childhood, are all strange to them.  For most of their detailed knowledge they must depend on the information of natives; and it is difficult for them to know who to trust. They are feared, suspected, probably disliked by the population; seldom sought by them except for interested purposes; and they are prone to think the servilely submissive are the trustworthy.  Their danger is of despising the natives; that of the natives is of disbelieving that anything the strangers do can be intended for their good.&lt;ref&gt;‘Of the Government of Dependencies by a Free State’ Chapter XVIII of 'Considerations on Representative Government' pages 382–384 of “Utilitarianism, Liberty &amp; Representative Government”, J S Mill , J M Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London (1910) [no 482 of ‘Everyman's Library’]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''forest kindergarten''' is a type of [[preschool education]] for children between the ages of three and six that is held almost exclusively outdoors. Whatever the weather, children are encouraged to play, explore and learn in a forest or natural environment. The adult supervision is meant to assist rather than lead. It is also known as ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]'' (in German), ''outdoor nursery'', ''nature kindergarten'', or ''nature preschool''. &lt;ref&gt;Alice Gregory, "Running Free in Germany’s Outdoor Preschools". The New York Times Style Magazine, May 18, 2017 [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/t-magazine/germany-forest-kindergarten-outdoor-preschool-waldkitas.html?_r=0] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Activities==
A forest kindergarten can be described as a [[kindergarten]] "without a ceiling or walls". The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with toys that are fashioned out of objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.

Each forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded. But typical activities and goals may include:&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="secretgardencurriculum"&gt;{{citation|last=Bache|first=Cathy|title=Pre-school curriculum|publisher=Secret Garden Outdoor Nursery|year=2008|url=http://www.secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219101917/http://secretgardenoutdoor-nursery.co.uk/pre%20school%20curriculum.doc|archivedate=2009-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and organization==
Forest kindergartens operate mainly in woodland, although some other sites can be equally inspiring, for example beaches and meadows. There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Children are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There are some [[forest schools]] that take children of various ages to woodland less frequently, and with a stronger focus on environmental topics themselves. For example, the "Woods for Learning" strategy&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fcfc106.pdf/$FILE/fcfc106.pdf|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|publisher=Forestry Commission|year=2005|isbn=0-85538-684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the British Forestry Commission proposes "regular" access, for example once a week for eight weeks.

==History==
In rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and "[[nature deficit disorder]]", there have been many changes in stance on [[outdoor education]]. 

The first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in [[Denmark]] in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. 

In [[Sweden]] in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of "Skogsmulle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; "Skog" means wood in Swedish. "Mulle" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with "Laxe" representing water, "Fjällfina" representing mountains and "Nova" representing an unpolluted nature. [[Forest schools]] based on Frohm's model, called "I Ur och Skur" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 1|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084834/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skogsmulle2008-2"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 2|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084915/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest kindergartens have existed in [[Germany]] since 1968 but were first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten. Since then, the forest kindergartens have become increasingly popular. As of 2005 there were approximately 450 forest kindergartens in Germany, some of which offer a mix of forest kindergarten and traditional daycare, spending their mornings in the forest and afternoons inside. By late 2017, the number of forest kindergartens in Germany surpassed 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bvnw.de/uber-uns/|title=ÜBER UNS {{!}} Bundesverband der Natur- und Waldkindergärten in Deutschland e.V.|website=bvnw.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain in 2005, a Swedish early years educator, Helena Nilsson, started Wildflowers Kindergarten, where preschool-aged children spend each morning in nature, throughout the year.

[[Childminder]] Cathy Bache opened the [[Secret Garden (outdoor nursery)|Secret Garden]] in Scotland in 2008 with support from funding authorities and private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/Early-Education-Child-Care/17970/11874 Childcare regulations] of the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="taxfreevouchers"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/childcare/ Tax Free Childcare Regulations], UK government HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018 on all forest kindergartens are invited to celebrate the [[:de:Liste_von_Gedenk-_und_Aktionstagen#Mai|"International Day of Forest Kindergarten"]] every year on the 3rd of May.

==Effects==
The fact that most forest kindergartens do not provide commercial toys that have a predefined meaning or purpose supports the development of language skills, as children verbally create a common understanding of the objects used as toys in the context of their play. Forest kindergartens are also generally less noisy than closed rooms, and noise has been shown to be a factor in the [[stress (biological)|stress]] level of children and daycare professionals.

Playing outside for prolonged periods has been shown to have a positive impact on children's development, particularly in the areas of balance and agility, but also [[manual dexterity]], physical [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[Touch|tactile]] sensitivity, and [[depth perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |title=Benefits of Nature for Children’s Health |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[Children Youth and Environments Center]] for Research and Design, University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731075831/http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/Colleges/ArchitecturePlanning/discover/centers/CYE/Publications/Documents/Benefitsofnature-FactSheet1-April2007.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Grahn|first=P |last2=Martensson|first2=F | last3=Lindblad|first3=B | last4=Nilsson|first4=P | last5=Ekman|first5=A |year=1997 | chapter=Ute på dagis|title=Stad and Land| volume=145| place=Håssleholm, Sweden| publisher=Nora Skåne Offset}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these studies, children who attend forest kindergartens experience fewer injuries due to accidents and are less likely to injure themselves in a fall.

Playing outdoors is said to strengthen the [[immune systems]] of children and daycare professionals.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

When children from German ''[[:de:Waldkindergarten|Waldkindergarten]]s'' go to primary school, teachers observe a significant improvement in reading, writing, mathematics, social interactions and many other areas.&lt;ref name="gorges"&gt;Gorges R. [http://bvnw.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Prof_Gorges_Schulfhigkeit.pdf] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Boys may be less intellectually able than girls at typical school tasks such as reading and mathematics, so forest kindergartens have been recommended in the early years.&lt;ref&gt;Sax L.

Roland Gorges found&lt;ref name="gorges"/&gt; that children who had been to a forest kindergarten were above average, compared by teachers to those who had not, in all areas of skill tested. In order of advantage, these were:

'''Glogster''' is a cloud-based (SaaS) platform for creating presentations and interactive learning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.glogster.com/support/solutions/articles/5000598859-what-is-glogster-with-official-video-|title=What is Glogster? (With Official Video). : Glogster Help Center|website=support.glogster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A platform that allows users, mostly students and educators to combine text, images, video, and audio to create an interactive, Web-based poster called '''''glogs''''' on a virtual canvas. Glogster facilitates the conveyance of social information in many different fields such as art, music, photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Awada|first=Ghada M.|last2=Abdallah|first2=Abir M.|date=2015-10-05|title=Effect of Using the Glogster Technological Model on Enhancing the Perceptions and Speaking Proficiency of Communication Skills Students|url=http://www.ijtase.net/ojs/index.php/ijge/article/view/412|journal=International Journal of Global Education|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|issn=2146-9296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users also have access to a library of engaging educational content posters created by other students and educators worldwide. Glogster enables interactive, collaborative education and digital literacy.

==History==

Glogster a. s., Inc, was founded in 2007 by Martin Santorcl, Patrik Prepsl, Roman Smola, Stanislav Šrámek and Tomáš Plojhar, with offices in Prague and Boston. They launched the first platform, Glogster.com also in 2007. This platform was initially promoted as a visual network, allowing users to express themselves via “graphic blogs” or “glogs”. However, in response to needs of educators incorporating Glogster into lessons and assignments, Glogster EDU (or edu.glogster.com) was set up alongside Glogster.com in 2009, offering a more secure and educational specific platform. Glogster EDU, has an annual subscription cost but gives educators a dashboard to provide instructions, templates and a private area for their class (es).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csusm.edu/ids/course-design-and-instruction/teaching-methods-and-techniques/active_learning/student_presentation_tools.pdf|title=Tools and Apps for Student Projects and Presentations|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular Glogster.com, the social network platform, was closed for new registrations and account access ceased in Feb 2015. After this the company focused solely on the Glogster EDU platform. There is, however, a personal type license available for single users. The platform has grown into a worldwide community in over 200 countries, with over 1.9 million teacher accounts with over 17 million student accounts who have created more than 25 million educational glogs, out of 45 million total glogs on the service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Features==

===Online editor===
Glogster's online editor allows users to arrange images, graphics, audio, video, and texts on a single page to create multimedia posters. It also provides access to 10,000 original graphic elements such as backgrounds, text boxes, frames and more. Media can be imported from around the web via URL or uploaded from users’ own files.

===Content library===
The Glogpedia library is a constantly-growing collection of over 40, 000 glogs, selected based on accuracy and presentation, and categorized into 80 subjects under 9 disciplines according to the K-12 curriculum. Glogster users can nominate glogs to be considered for inclusion in the library by clicking a button at the top of any public glog.

Glogpedia content is intended for use in place of, or alongside, conventional curriculum texts, for example as interactive research material or to engage learners with a new topic. Users can also save editable copies of glogs to their own dashboards, and adapt them to their own needs.

==Mobile apps==

===iOS===
Glogster released an iOS application for iPad in September 2014, bringing an updated version of the editor and the content library to iPad. The Glog interface incorporates a built-in browser known as the Web Picker, allowing users to search for media directly from the app, and drag it onto their glog canvas. The app is also synced with the iPad's built-in camera and mic, allowing users to record video, audio and photos directly onto their glogs.

The iPad application expands learning beyond the traditional classroom, allowing users to create glogs based on events as they happen, and giving them freedom to learn and create in their own time.

===Android===
In early 2015, Glogster released a Glogpedia library browser application for Android, with the announcement that full editing functionality for Android would be made available within the year. In October 2015 Glogster released an Android app for tablet devices with full editing functionality.

== Glogster in the classroom ==
Glogster EDU is used as a learning and teaching tool to foster higher order thinking skills. Creating posters or glogs allows learners to engage closely with a subject, exercising critical thinking and research skills in selecting appropriate media and creative skills in structuring and arranging the finished piece. Glogster is being used in place of traditional poster assignments and demonstrates how versatile such a poster-creation tool can be when partnered with solid teaching pedagogy and teacher creativity. The use of Glogster, motives and excites students to do their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharon|first=Martinez-Alba, Gilda{{!}}Cruzado-Guerrero, Judith{{!}}Pitcher,|date=2014|title=Glogsters and Other Motivating Technology: A Multiple Case Study of English Learners.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1046934|journal=Reading Matrix: An International Online Journal|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=|issn=1533-242X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study showed that the usage of the Glogster EDU educational platform develops necessary competences, such as, communication skills, creativity and intellectual curiosity, critical and systematized thinking, information and media skills, collaborative and interpersonal skills, problem identification, formulation, and solving and social responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bedrule-Grigoruţă|first=Maria Viorica|last2=Rusu|first2=Mihaela-Loredana|title=Considerations about E-learning Tools for Adult Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.610|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=142|pages=749–754|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.07.610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and certification ==
In 2015, Glogster launched the GATE (Global Ambassadors for Technology in Education) program, focused on offering Glogster educators training materials and certifications, as well as recruiting a small group of representatives to assist in promoting Glogster online and in their local areas.

The '''HighScope''' [[early childhood education]] approach, used in [[preschool]], [[kindergarten]], [[childcare]], or [[elementary school]] settings, was developed in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]] in 1970. It is now common there and in some other countries.

The philosophy behind HighScope is based on child development theory and research, originally drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[John Dewey]]. Since then, the HighScope Curriculum has evolved to include the findings of ongoing cognitive-developmental and brain research. In its teaching practices, the HighScope Curriculum draws upon the work of developmental psychologist and educator [[Lev Vygotsky]], especially the strategy of adult scaffolding — supporting children at their current developmental level and helping them build upon it — in a social setting where children have opportunities to choose materials, ideas, and people to interact within the projects they initiate.&lt;ref name="Epstein, A. S."&gt;Epstein, A. S. ''Essentials of active learning in preschool.'' HighScope Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}} The adults working with the children see themselves more as facilitators or partners than as managers or supervisors.

== Origin ==
As director of special services in the [[Ypsilanti]], ([[Michigan]]) public school district, [[David Weikart]] became increasingly interested in the academic performance of a number of at-risk children from poor neighborhoods. He found that these students tend to do poorly on district-wide, standardized tests and also receive low scores in IQ assessments.

Weikart brought together, and collaborated with, a committee of elementary education leaders that included Perry School's [[Charles Eugene Beatty]], Michigan's first African-American principal. Known as the Perry Preschool Project (1962), members discussed possible changes to teaching methods and curriculum choices. Even though they did not expect to radically change Ypsilanti's teaching core (which mostly worked), they explored why it seemingly failed a certain population of students.

While searching for better teaching methods and programs, Weikart (now also part of a special services committee tackling the same issue), zeroed in on programs for three- and four-year-olds. Outside the normal organization of the school district, Weikart hired four teachers and began operation of a preschool at Perry Elementary School.&lt;ref name="Hohmann, M., Weikart, D. P., &amp; Epstein, A. S."&gt;Hohmann, M., Weikart, D. P., &amp; Epstein, A. S. ''Educating young children'' (3rd. ed.), HighScope Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}    

Weikart and Perry School's teachers and staff chose to differ from traditional nursery school settings by designing a program that focused on a child's intellectual maturation rather than a child's social and emotional advances. They wanted a program that: 

#Possessed a firm, legitimate bed of theory for teaching/learning
#Supported the child's talents through an active process of learning; and
#Relied on teachers, administrators, and families to support the success of the program.

=== Effectiveness of the program ===
The HighScope Perry Preschool Project was evaluated in a [[randomized controlled trial]] of 123 children (58 were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the program and a control group of 65 children that did not). Prior to the program, the preschool and control groups were equivalent in measures of intellectual performance and demographic characteristics. After the program the educational and life outcomes for the children receiving the program were much superior to outcomes for the children not receiving the program. Many of the program outcomes were significant or approaching significance.&lt;ref&gt;Significant Benefits, The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study Through Age 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy: Social Programs That Work: Perry Preschool Project&lt;/ref&gt;

''Educational outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):''

At age 27 follow-up

* Completed an average of almost 1 full year more of schooling (11.9 years vs. 11 years)
* Spent an average of 1.3 fewer years in special education services — e.g., for mental, emotional, speech, or learning impairment (3.9 years vs. 5.2 years)
* 44 percent higher high school graduation rate (66% vs. 45%)

''Pregnancy outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):''

At age 27 follow-up

* Much lower proportion of out-of-wedlock births (57% vs. 83%)
* Fewer teen pregnancies on average (0.6 pregnancies/woman vs. 1.2 pregnancies/woman) (not significant &lt;.05)&lt;ref&gt;Significant Benefits, The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study Through Age 27&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lifetime criminal activity for preschool group (versus control group):''

At age 40 follow-up

* 46 percent less likely to have served time in jail or prison (28% vs. 52%)
* 33 percent lower arrest rate for violent crimes (32% vs. 48%)

''Economic outcomes for preschool group (versus control group):''

At age 40 follow-up

* 42 percent higher median monthly income ($1,856 vs. $1,308)
* 26 percent less likely to have received government assistance (e.g. welfare, food stamps) in the past ten years (59% vs. 80%)

== Central concepts ==
*Active learning
: The HighScope Curriculum emphasizes ''active participatory learning.'' Active learning means students have direct, hands-on experiences with people, objects, events, and ideas. Children's interests and choices are at the heart of the HighScope programs. They construct their own knowledge through interactions with the world and the people around them. In active learning settings, adults expand children's thinking with diverse materials and nurturing interactions.&lt;ref name="Hohmann, M., Weikart, D. P., &amp; Epstein, A. S."/&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}
*Learning environment
: A HighScope school classroom is divided into well-defined interest areas that typically include a house area, art area, block area, toy area, and other areas that reflect the children's interests. Children are able to access all facilities independently as well as take some responsibility for use of these areas.
*Daily routine
: HighScope classrooms follow a predictable sequence of events called the ''daily routine.'' The daily routine in a HighScope classroom includes plan-do-review, small and large-group times, outside time, transition times, and eating and resting times.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://highscope.org/faq|website=highscope.org|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}} 
*Plan-do-review
: A key component of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan what materials they want to work with, what they want to do, and whom they want to do it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once they have made a plan, however vague, of what they want to do, they can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss what they did and whether it was the same as, or different from, what they had planned.
*Adult-child interaction
: Shared control between adults and children is central to the HighScope Curriculum. In addition to sharing control, adults in a HighScope classroom participate in children's play, converse as partners with them, focus on children's strengths and offer them support, and encourage children's problem solving.&lt;ref name="Hohmann, M., Weikart, D. P., &amp; Epstein, A. S."/&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}
*Key developmental indicators
: The HighScope Curriculum is organized into eight content areas: (1) approaches to learning; (2) language, literacy, and communication; (3) social and emotional development; (4) physical development and health; (5) mathematics; (6) science and technology; (7) social studies; and (8) creative arts. Within these content areas are 58 key developmental indicators (KDIs). The KDIs are statements of observable behaviors that define the important learning areas for young children. HighScope teachers keep these indicators in mind when they set up the learning environment and plan activities.&lt;ref name="Hohmann, M., Weikart, D. P., &amp; Epstein, A. S."/&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}
*Assessment
: HighScope assesses children's development with comprehensive observations. HighScope teachers record daily anecdotes describing what children do and say. Several times a year, teachers review these anecdotes and rate each child using an assessment tool that is organized into six areas of development. These scores help the teachers design developmentally appropriate learning opportunities and can be used to explain children's progress during conferences. &lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;{{primary source-inline|date=November 2011}}
*Conflict Resolution

: HighScope has a six-step process that can be used to help children resolve conflicts that may arise during their day.  

: Step 1. Approach the situation calmly.
: Observe the situation, approach the children with a calm voice, and sit with them on the floor.  Stop any hurtful behavior if necessary.

: Step 2. Acknowledge children’s feelings.
: Describe the feeling you observe and the details of what you see.

: Step 3. Gather information.
: Ask open-ended questions, directing your questions to one child, then another.

: Step 4. Restate the problem.
: Based on what the children say, clarify the problem and check your statement with the children.

: Step 5. Ask for ideas for solutions and choose one together.
: Encourage children to talk to each other.  Be prepared to give suggestions.  When children arrive at a solution, restate it and check with them to make sure they are in agreement.

: Step 6. Be prepared to give follow-up support.
: Sometimes solutions need clarifying as the children begin to play again.

The '''history of the University of Bristol''' can be said to have begun in 1909 when the university gained a [[royal charter]] which allowed it to award degrees. Like most English universities, Bristol evolved from earlier institutions, most notably [[University College, Bristol]] (founded 1876),&lt;ref name="BristolUniversityHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/history/|title=Bristol University History |work=History of the University|accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol Medical School]] (1833) and the [[Merchant Venturers' Technical College]] (founded as a school 1595 and which became the university engineering faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merchantventurers.com/charitable-activities/education.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829092557/http://merchantventurers.com/charitable-activities/education.html |archivedate=29 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
[[File:HOWills3.jpg|right|thumb|As chief benefactor of what was then University College, Bristol, [[Henry Overton Wills III|Henry Overton Wills]] was influential in allowing Bristol to gain a royal charter]]
As early as 1906 [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] had stated his intention to give up the principalship of University College, Bristol. [[Sir Isambard Owen]], nephew of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], became the first vice-chancellor of the university and worked upon the detail of the university's charter. Owen is also credited with the design of the university gowns, with the colour said to have been based upon the colour of the rocks of the [[Avon Gorge]] after rain.&lt;ref&gt;Cartleton 1984 p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; One area of early controversy was the re-advertising of some chair positions and the decision not to give one, Cowl, a reappointment. This caused the resignation of the Chair of Physics, [[Arthur Prince Chattock|Arthur P. Chattock]].

Henry Overton Wills became the first chancellor of the university. On Wills' death, Haladane was invited to succeed him. The installation of Haladane was used to honour all those who had been involved in the creation of the university and 70 honorary degrees were awarded by the university. This act, coming from a university not yet three years old caused some controversy and led to public criticism of the university in ''The Observer''.

After the death of their father, Henry Wills and George Wills donated money for the building of a university building in memory of their father. He met with [[George Oatley]] (later Sir George Oatley) to plan the building of what was to become the Wills Memorial Building which the brothers requested would be built to last for 400 years.&lt;ref name="Cartleton 1984 p34"&gt;Cartleton 1984 p34&lt;/ref&gt; When the Wills family acquired Royal Fort gardens as a site they were given to the university and were to be the site of a castle like building which became the physics department.

==Expansion==
In 1911 [[George Alfred Wills|George Wills]] acquired the athletic ground at [[Coombe Dingle]] and in 1920 he bought the [[Victoria Rooms (Bristol)|Victoria Rooms]] which became the Student’s Union building. [[World War I]] caused a financial crisis with the university losing around 20% of its fee income but the government agreed to make up this loss because of important contributions which Bristol made to the study of poison gas and explosives. Economic problems continued after the war when it was announced that government funding of universities was to be cut.&lt;ref name="Cartleton 1984 p34"/&gt; On 9 June 1925 the [[Wills Memorial Building]] was officially opened by King George V and Mary.
[[File:Dirac 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paul Dirac]] was the first academic from the [[University of Bristol]] to be awarded a Nobel Prize]]
It was during the interwar years that Bristol’s reputation as a university began to increase. In 1920 [[Helen Wodehouse]] was appointed as Chair of Education, the first woman to be appointed in such a role, and in 1928 Winifred Lucy Shepland was appointed as the first woman registrar of any British university. The growing strength was exemplified by the "poaching" of academics from other universities and the award of a Nobel Prize to Bristol graduate [[Paul Dirac]] for his work on [[quantum mechanics]].

From the early years of its formation the university brought higher education to working people, with H. G. Leonard, a lecturer in history, becoming president of the Bristol branch of the Workers' Educational Association. After the war, government grants allowed the setting up of departments of extramural adult education. Bristol University also began to have an effect on the city of Bristol, when the university laboratories and the city laboratories combined to train health visitors at [[Canynge Hall]]. This had a pronounced effect on the City of Bristol’s health, with death rates halving to 11 per 1,000 and the [[infant mortality rate]] falling from 165 per 1000 to 57 per 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Cartleton 1984, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state of the medical school was described by the Ministry of Health described it as being at "sixes and sevens". The problem was the continuing rivalry between the General Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary, Sir George Wills had offered to build a new university hospital if the two could resolve their differences but this failed to create an agreement between them.

==Scientific discovery==
The 1920s and 1930s saw great scientific breakthroughs in the chemistry and physics departments. [[Sir Nevil Mott]] arrived from [[the University of Cambridge]] . His work on "solid state physics" led to the development of the transistor and the growth of industry around solid state electronics. The physics department became home to the [[Sutton Group]], which worked on klystron and magnetron valves (the latter important in the development of radar). A "future physics" professor, Peter Fowler, used his scientific knowledge to destroy German radar jamming devices during the war.

After the war Tomas Lovejoy succeeded Isambard Owen as vice-chancellor after a short interim period. Lovejoy was responsible for the creation of a system whereby the appointment of professors was made by joint senate and council committees after the two organisations disagreed over his replacement as Chair of Physics.

Damage occurred to the Wills Memorial Building during the war caused then chancellor to give a defiant speech. Loveday remained as vice-chancellor despite being past retirement age until the end of the war when he was replaced by Phillip Morris.

==Post-War era==
During the 1950s new buildings for the medicine and engineering departments were provided on St Michael’s Hill. The geography department were able take over the old. A new chemistry building was also planned on the slopes of St Michael’s Hill but the project ran into difficulty when Bristol City Council’s compulsory purchase orders displaced some local residents. New buildings to be built in Berkeley Square caused similar complaints. These would become home of the Department of Education as it was clear that Royal Fort house would prove too small.

==Further expansion==
In the 1950s the government indicated that it would give support to the idea that students could pick any university to study at within the national system. This loss of local students caused some to see the university as a kind of alien "intellectual colony" disconnected to the university.&lt;ref&gt;Cartleton, 1984, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; This move made it important for the university to invest in student accommodation. Clifton Hill House had already been opened soon after the gaining of the charter and it operated as a girls' hall of residence and [[Wills Hall]] was opened in 1929. To cope with increasing student numbers Churchill Hall, Hiatt Baker Hall and Badock Hall were built.

The 1960s saw a large increase in the number of British universities built after Harold Wilson was elected prime minister. Many of these new institutions received criticism but Bristol was now seen as an older more established institution and was able to embark on a period of academic expansion. There was a new Department of Inorganic Chemistry and a Department of Biochemistry. However the greatest expansions occurred in the arts with the creation of the drama, theology, sociology, politics, and social and economic history departments.

Sir Phillip Morris retired in 1966 but during his time as vice-chancellor the university tripled in size and witnessed the building of many departments such as the School of Veterinary Science and the School of Architecture.

==Student protest==
In 1968 the first large scale student protest occurred when students staged a sit in over allegations that they were unable to control their own union. The protest lasted over the weekend. At this time the vice-chancellorship had passed to John Harris who was said to be nonplussed by the protest. However, he died one week later after collapsing in his office. Further disagreement between the university and the union occurred over the issue of "reciprocal membership" of the union meaning that any students from Bristol would be able to use the union. This escalated into an 11-day sit-in at Senate House which gained Bristol national headlines, although it has been argued that the protest enjoyed little student support.&lt;ref&gt;Cartleton, 1984, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several protests occurred in Bristol in 2010 in response to government spending cuts in education, including the increasing of tuition fees, and the scrapping of [[Education Maintenance Allowance]] in England. On 24 November, approximately 2000 students from the university and nearby schools gathered outside of the university and marched through the streets of Bristol.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-11829989&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an occupation of the Students Union building by students who criticised the union for failing to represent them on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://bristoloccupation.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/statement-from-bristol-university.html&lt;/ref&gt; (Main article: [[University of Bristol Union#2010 Occupation]]) On 7 December a second occupation occurred, this time in the central university building of Senate House. The students occupying the building made a list of demands, including "greater student representation in Senate meetings" and "That the Vice-Chancellor, Eric Thomas, write and send an open letter to the Government condemning cuts in the education budget and appealing to them not to implement these policies, and to publicly call for Vice-Chancellors across the country to unite against these cuts, any rise in tuition fees and the removal of Educational Maintenance Allowance and Aimhigher."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101209035928/http://bristoluniresistance.org.uk/2010/12/statement-of-bristol-university-occupation/&lt;/ref&gt; The occupiers received a considerable amount of support from members of staff.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101213015725/http://bristoluniresistance.org.uk/category/all/solidarity/&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation ended on 17 December 2010, with students leaving voluntarily and stating: "Although the occupiers’ main demand [...] was not met, the occupation has, in many ways, yielded much more meaningful outcomes than being granted particular requests by senior management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/702557 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927213627/http://www.bristol.indymedia.org.uk/article/702557 |archive-date=27 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coalitionofresistance.org.uk/2010/12/dis-occupation-of-senate-house-bristol/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305121744/http://www.coalitionofresistance.org.uk/2010/12/dis-occupation-of-senate-house-bristol/ |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservative cuts==
Under the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], funding for universities was cut and Bristol's income was reduced by some 15%. This resulted in the selective closure of some departments, including Russian, education and architecture. A compromise agreement was eventually found but this episode damaged the research strength of the university.

==Recent history==
In May 2009, Bristol celebrated its centenary. As part of the celebrations degrees were bestowed upon individuals who had given extraordinary service to the Bristol community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Bristol-University-s-search-People-s-Degrees/article-633105-detail/article.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912063521/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Bristol-University-s-search-People-s-Degrees/article-633105-detail/article.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book expands on an similarly themed article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1998/03/the-set-up-to-fail-syndrome|title=The Set-Up-To-Fail Syndrome|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''The Harvard Business Review'' in which the authors explored how managers’ behavior might contribute to employees poor performance. In an interview with [[BBC News|BBC]], Manzoni explained how employees also contribute to their own unsatisfactory relationships with their superiors. Manzoni cautioned that attaching labels like demanding or overbearing can ultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy. "The moment you label someone as difficult you’ve just made them more difficult to work with because you’re not going to give this person the benefit of the doubt anymore and you’re not going to relate with them on a productive level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170817-how-to-identify-and-handle-a-demanding-boss|title=How to identify, and handle, a demanding boss|last=Johanson|first=Mark|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8448">'''John L. Harrington''' (born c. late 1930s) is an American business manager. He was the CEO of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

==Early life and career==
He graduated from [[Boston College]] in 1957, and received his MBA from Boston College in 1966.&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guilfoil|first=John M.|title=GE chief tells BC graduates ethics, innovation, collaboration count|work=The Boston Globe|date=2010-05-25|url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/05/25/ge_chief_tells_bc_graduates_ethics_innovation_collaboration_count|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After college, he was an officer in the U.S. Navy, then worked for both the General Accounting Office and NASA. He eventually became an accounting professor at BC until 1970, where he was hired by [[Joe Cronin]], president of the [[American League]], to be the league's controller.

==Boston Red Sox==
After Cronin retired, Harrington was hired by Red Sox owner [[Tom Yawkey]] as treasurer of the Red Sox. Yawkey died in 1976 and was eventually replaced by his wife [[Jean R. Yawkey|Jean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Sox put up for sale by family trust|work=Reading Eagle|date=2000-10-07|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J6AvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K6MFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3458,4724780|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sold the team in 1977 to a syndicate headed by [[general partnership|general partners]] [[Buddy LeRoux]] and [[Haywood Sullivan]]. To gain approval of the sale by the [[American League]], Mrs. Yawkey joined the ownership group in 1978 as its third general partner and club president.  Harrington left the team to work for Governor [[Edward J. King|Edward King]] of [[Massachusetts]] and then for a [[Lloyd's of London]] Insurance affiliate. But he eventually returned to the Red Sox in the mid-1980s, during a period of strife between LeRoux and his partners, and became an important advisor to Mrs. Yawkey.

===As CEO of the Boston Red Sox===
After Jean Yawkey's death in 1992, as trustee of the [[JRY Trust]], Harrington arranged for the Trust to buy out the shares of Sullivan, the last remaining general partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ulman|first=Howard|title=Harrington now BoSox only owner|work=Sun Journal|agency=Associated Press|date=1993-11-24|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MGAgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pWUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1810,5154912|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completely overhauled the front office, bringing in general manager [[Dan Duquette]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. Under Harrington's leadership the team compiled one of the best records in baseball; The team won the [[1986 American League Championship Series|1986 ALCS]]; won the AL East in 1988, 1990 and 1995; and won the Wild Card in 1998 and 1999.

Harrington was instrumental in acquiring [[Pedro Martínez]], [[Manny Ramírez]], [[Jason Varitek]], [[Tim Wakefield]], [[Johnny Damon]], [[Derek Lowe]] and other stars. Harrington built a new spring training facility in Fort Myers and broadened the reach and popularity of Red Sox majority Owned NESN – [[New England Sports Network]]. He was responsible for bringing the [[1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] to [[Fenway Park]] in 1999. He also played key roles within Major League Baseball. He was the lead negotiator for baseball owners during the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike of 1994]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harrington: Need deal by March 5|work=Gainesville Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=1995-02-25|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zyQSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=neoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3492,6170443|accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the development of both [[interleague play]] and the creation of the Wild Card playoff format.

During Harrington's tenure, the Red Sox were also embroiled in several controversial episodes.  In 1997 legendary pitcher [[Roger Clemens]] acrimoniously left the team to sign as a free agent with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], where he won a fourth [[Cy Young Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/clemero02.shtml baseball-reference.com], Roger Clemens player page (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1997, after infielder [[Wil Cordero]] was arrested on domestic assault charges,&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;[http://www.boston.com/globe/packages/year_in_review/sports/cordero.htm "Wil Cordero charged with beating wife"], ''Boston Globe'' 12 June 1997 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; a half-dozen Red Sox front office members made a show of support on Cordero's behalf by appearing in court at his arraignment.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Howard. ''Shut Out: A Story of Race and Baseball in Boston'', Beacon Press (2003), page 234&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, Harrington initially refused to accept the terms of a negotiated settlement between the players' union and the owners' Player Relations Committee to allow Cordero to return to the team.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/03/sports/deal-reached-on-cordero.html "Deal Reached on Cordero"] ''New York Times'', 3 July 1997 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; However Harrington relented after the union threatened to file a grievance and owners' counsel advised him he was unlikely to prevail in court.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; Cordero's return drew criticism from women's rights advocates,&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"/&gt; and Cordero would ultimately plead guilty to the charges after the season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/04/sports/baseball-roundup-cordero-pleads-guilty.html , "Cordero Pleads Guilty"], ''New York Times'' 4 November 1997 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1997, Harrington and the club faced charges of racial bias and harassment after a black former employee of the team claimed a framed photo of himself and his fiancee was defaced with a racial epithet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156922462.html "Ex-Employee Accuses Sox of Racial Harassment"], ''Albany (NY) Times-Union'', 17 December 1997 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, a civil rights advocate who offered to mediate a settlement for the club abandoned those efforts, accusing Harrington of rebuffing him and failing to deal in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8467837.html "Settlement of Red Sox Dispute Fails; Advocate Blames Team For Snub In Bias Case"] ''Boston Globe'', 31 January 1998 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The case led to a hearing before the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and was ultimately settled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8461248.html "Red Sox, Ex-Worker Square Off Today; Bias Case Goes To MCAD Hearing"] ''Boston Globe'', 12 February 1998 (retrieved 5 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Harrington proposed the idea of moving the Red Sox into a new ballpark that was scheduled to be built adjacent to Fenway and even named "New Fenway Park", (similar to what happened to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in 2008). This idea was wildly controversial, as many Red Sox fans consider Fenway "a national treasure" of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/page2/s/ballparks/fenway.html&lt;/ref&gt; Harrington was quoted as saying that, "It would be easier to fix the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] than Fenway".&lt;ref&gt;http://boston.cbslocal.com/2012/04/12/fenway-hits-100-not-long-ago-fenway-park-was-close-to-being-torn-down/&lt;/ref&gt; The team set aside $415 million of $545 million allotted for the new ballpark, with the public financing the rest, estimated at $130 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/154497-fenway-park-should-it-stay-or-should-it-go&lt;/ref&gt; The baseball world had seen the closure of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] that same year, and many hoped Fenway would avoid the same fate. After much outcry from the public, Harrington sold the team to their current ownership group headed by [[John W. Henry|John Henry]], [[Tom Werner]] and [[Larry Lucchino]]. Under Henry's group, the Red Sox celebrated the 100th anniversary of Fenway on April 20, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13404">'''Lonnie Graham''' is a fine art [[photographer]], [[professor]], installation artist, and cultural activist investigating the methods by which the arts can be used to achieve tangible meaning in peoples lives. In January 2013, Graham spoke at the TEDxPSU symposium. His talk is  available for streaming through [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xAZ2lrel8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early studies==
Lonnnie Graham is a Professor of Visual Art at [[Pennsylvania State University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sova.psu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/lonnie_graham/lonnie_graham ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913160222/http://sova.psu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/lonnie_graham/lonnie_graham |date=September 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in University Park, near State College, Pennsylvania.  He studied [[graphic design]] and commercial photography at the Ivy School of Professional Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1976 he studied fine art photography and drawing at the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia where he attended private sessions with photographer [[Robert Frank]] and critiques by art critic [[Donald Kuspit]]. In 1977 he traveled to the San Francisco Art Institute, and studied with [[Linda Connor]], Jack Fulton, Regan Louie, and Henry Wessel. He was assistant to [[Larry Sultan]] and pioneering visual anthropologist John Collier Jr.  Graham was mentored in large format photography by [[Pirkle Jones]], close friend and colleague to [[Ansel Adams]] who made frequent visits to the Art Institute.

==Later career==
From 1990 to 1997 Graham was director of Photography at [[Manchester Craftsmen's Guild]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mercedwib.com/archive/110402_ix._WIB_Exec_Bill_Strickland.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], an urban arts organization founded by William Strickland, Jr. dedicated to arts and education for at risk youth. Graham developed innovative pilot projects including the Arts Collaborative, which merged an art and academic curriculum. This program attracted the attention of First Lady Hillary Clinton who visited the site, and honored it as a National Model for Arts Education. Professor Graham has served as a panel member and site visitor to the Commonwealth for the [[Pennsylvania Council on the Arts]]. He also served in a similar capacity at the national level for [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in [[Washington, DC]].

From 2001 until 2003 he held the post of visiting instructor of graduate studies at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. In 2002, Kimberley Camp, Executive Director of the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania invited Graham to conduct an oral history of the Barnes. He was later made instructor of special programs and continued to teach at the Barnes until 2007. From 2007 until 2009 Graham was the acting associate director of the Fabric Workshop and Museum.

==African and Asian trips==
Beginning in 2003 Graham began collaborative photographic expeditions to [[India]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Iceland]] with photographer Linda Connor. He traveled with Jack Fulton to India, [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]] in 2007.

Graham initiated a number of funded and self-funded trips to [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] that relate to artistic and cultural work he had undertaken in [[Philadelphia]] with the Fairmount Park Art Association&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpaa.org/about_nlm.html.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Pittsburgh]] with the support of the Three Rivers Arts Festival. These projects were meant to prove that substantive change could be achieved in people's lives by making the arts a viable solution to common problems.

Toward this end, Graham was awarded a number of major commissions. In 1997, from Jeanne Pearlman at the [[Three Rivers Arts Festival]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, commissioned the "African/American Garden Project." This was part of a larger series of an exhibition called "Points of Entry" which included installations from artists, Ann Carlson, Group Material, Michelle Illuminato, Daniel J. Martinez, and Fred Wilson.

The African/American Garden project provided a physical and cultural exchange of urban [[single mothers]] from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and farmers from a small farming village in [[Muguga]], [[Kenya]]. As a result of this project, Graham built a series of urban [[subsistence]] gardens as a component to other projects.

In 2001, [[Mary Jane Jacob]] invited Graham to participate in the Spoleto Arts Festival in Charleston, South Carolina. She and Tumelo Mosaka curated "Evoking History," which included Graham’s "Heritage Garden Project." Because Graham had visited traditional cultures in Africa and Asia he constructed larger projects including a number of artists and community members. The goal was to establish a method for modern artists to work in a traditional way, addressing the basic needs of a community.

From 2000 to 2010 Graham worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with artists John H. Stone and Art Sanctuary director Lorene Cary on a project commissioned by the Fairmount Park Art Association,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpaa.org/CommonGroundDedication_000.html.&lt;/ref&gt; for Project H.O.M.E. in north Philadelphia. In addition to installations, projects and neighborhood events, the result of the commission was a mediation park, which was dedicated and gifted to the community in 2010.

In 1997 Lonnie was honored with a major commission for travel to [[Papua New Guinea]] to document the harvest of the Woowoosi tree used by the Maisen tribe to produce ceremonial [[tapa cloth]]. He later collaborated with curator [[Lawrence Rinder]] on an exhibition of photographs and artifacts produced from that expedition.

==Awards and honors==
In the 1995 Colliers Encyclopedia yearbook, Graham was cited as an encyclopedic point of reference for his research and creative accomplishments in the field of installation art. He was also the recipient of a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] / [[Pew Charitable Trust]] travel grant for travel to [[Ghana]]. Graham is a four-time [[Pennsylvania Council on the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pennsylvania council on the arts]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fellowship winner. He has been nominated as a DuPont Fellow, and for the Cal Arts-Alpert Award, a Joan Mitchell Foundation Fellowship, and a USArtist Fellowship. He was awarded the Creative Achievement Award by the [[Pittsburgh Cultural Trust]]. Graham received a [[Pew Fellowships in the Arts]].&lt;ref name="pacouncilonthearts2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacouncilonthearts.org/pca.cfm?id=37&amp;level=Second#2005 |title=PCA - Governor's Arts Awards |publisher=Pacouncilonthearts.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612144112/http://www.pacouncilonthearts.org/pca.cfm?id=37&amp;level=Second |archivedate=2007-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew is one of the largest individual artist fellowships in the [[United States]]. In 2005, he was awarded the Hazlett Memorial Award, conferred the distinction of as Artist of the Year in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and was presented with the Governor’s Award&lt;ref name="pacouncilonthearts2005"/&gt; by Governor [[Edward Rendell]].

==Catalogue work==
Graham designed the catalogue entitled "Countdown to Eternity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fernandez, Benedict J. |url=http://www.edsbooks.com/shop/edsbooks/ESB11134.html |title=COUNTDOWN TO ETERNITY.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , Benedict J Fernandez - Eds Books - First Editions, Photography, Screenplays, Signed Books, Appraisals |publisher=Eds Books |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of photographs of Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] by [[Benedict Fernandez]], as well as a traveling exhibition of photographs. He also designed the catalogue for [[Carrie Mae Weems]]’ "Kitchen Table Series," exhibited at [[Hollins University]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] and is known to have worked with Weems collaboratively on other projects at the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, including the Adam and Eve folding screen entitled the "Apple of Adam’s Eye," produced in 1992. He collaborated with David Lewis to produce a book about sculptor [[Thaddeus Mosley]], "Thaddeus Mosley, African American Sculptor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=David L. |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8320473-thaddeus-mosley |title=Thaddeus Mosley: African American Sculptor by David L. Lewis — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyramid Atlantic, in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] published his own "Friendship, Strength and Vitality" as a limited edition [[photogravure]] edition which resides in the [[Corcoran Gallery]] in Washington, DC and the collection of the Schomberg Center in [[New York City]].

The catalogue accompanying the exhibition "A Conversation with the World" has been widely disseminated by [[Light Work]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/3616953 |title=Contact Sheet 128: A Conversation with the World by Light Work |publisher=LibraryThing |date=2007-10-06 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Syracuse, New York]]. This project was conceived by Graham and photographer Kevin Martin in 1986, and  combines elements of social anthropology and fine art as it utilizes an interview component to engage participants who sit for a large format 4"x5" portrait made using polaroid type 55 positive/negative film. Graham was documented using this process in Houston, Texas at Rick Lowe’s Project Row Houses in artist Round 19. "A Conversation with the World" has also been conducted and exhibited in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfartscommission.org/gallery/2010/lonnie-graham-a-conversation-with-the-world-san-francisco/ |title=Lonnie Graham: A Conversation with the World: San Francisco &amp;#124; SFAC Galleries |publisher=Sfartscommission.org |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2014-07-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727185324/http://www.sfartscommission.org/gallery/2010/lonnie-graham-a-conversation-with-the-world-san-francisco/# |archive-date=2014-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned by the San Francisco Art Commission for a  public art project that was installed at the [[San Francisco City Hall]] and exhibited in public spaces around the city. The project was commissioned and presented in Calgary, Alberta, Eatonville, Florida and Oulu, Finland. In 2005 he was awarded a [[Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation]] Artists in Communities Grant under the auspices of the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to produce "A Conversation at the Table."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabricworkshopandmuseum.org/exhibitions/graham.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809210249/http://www.fabricworkshopandmuseum.org/exhibitions/graham.php |date=August 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project invited over 50 artists and four arts organizations to collaborate on a project based on essential aspects of humanity. The project was completed and presented in 2006.

==Other work==
The Queens Museum in New York also commissioned him to produce an international garden project as part of their "Down the Garden Path" exhibition presented in 2005. Other exhibitions include an exhibition of photographs at [[Goethe Institute]], [[Accra]], Ghana. La Maison de Etat-Unis, [[Paris]], [[France]] produced a full-scale reproduction of one of the educational galleries he photographed for the [[Barnes Foundation]]. Graham has shown at the Toyota City Museum in [[Aichi]], [[Japan]]. He exhibited a room-sized installation at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, DC. Graham's work is included in the permanent collections of the Addison Gallery for American Art in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

In 2005 he collaborated with [[MacArthur Fellow]] [[Deborah Willis (artist)|Deborah Willis]] on "Framing the Diaspora", which resulted in an international conference of artists, photographers, and filmmakers held in Accra, Ghana.

The '''Molteno Institute for Language and Literacy (MILL)''', formerly known as the '''Molteno Project''', is a [[charity organisation]] that funds [[literacy|literacy programmes]] and research across [[Africa]], from its headquarters in [[Johannesburg]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molteno.co.za/ MILL]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was established in 1974, funded by the [[The Molteno Brothers|Molteno Brothers Trust]] from which it derives its name. It began as the Molteno Project, a large research project on problems with school pupils' acquisition of English literacy, based at Rhodes University. The research recommendations included incorporating mother-tongue material in literacy courses for children. When this conclusion was confirmed by positive results, the project was rolled out across the continent and adapted into 52 African languages.
&lt;ref&gt;http://access.educationdevelopment.org/?page=showcat&amp;id=14&amp;subid=N@11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 it had taught more than 10 million learners across the African continent to read and write, making it one of the largest literacy providers in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngopulse.org/blogs/molteno-institute-language-and-literacy NGO Pulse]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Multilingualism]] is a part of everyday life for the population of [[Luxembourg]]. Legally and socially, different sectors of Luxembourg use [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], which is a variety of [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] with a large number of loanwords from French. Additionally, most citizens learn [[English language|English]] and may study other languages as well. A substantial immigrant population has brought numerous [[immigrant language]]s to the small state, notably [[Portuguese Luxembourger|Portuguese, which is spoken by more than one-fifth of the population]]. However, the different languages are used in different social situations.

==Official languages==
The use of languages for legal and administrative purposes is regulated by a law promulgated in 1984, including the following provisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''Mémorial A'' no. 16 (27 February 1984), pp. 196–197: [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1984/0162702/index.html "Loi du 24 février 1984 sur le régime des langues".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 1: The national language of the Luxembourgers is [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]].&lt;br&gt;
Article 2: The laws are in [[French language|French]].&lt;br&gt;
Article 3: The language of the government: Luxembourgish, [[German language|German]] and French can be used.&lt;br&gt;
Article 4: Administrative questions: If a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.

In many other multilingual countries, such as [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]], the distribution of the languages is geographic, but in Luxembourg it is functional—that is, the choice of language depends on the situation.

==Education==
At school, all students are taught in all three official languages, although divided by age group and subject matter.  At [[primary school]], the courses are taught in German and explanations are often given in Luxembourgish.  In general, at [[secondary school]], up until the 9th grade, every subject is taught in German, except for mathematics and sciences (which are taught in French). From 10th to 13th grade, the language use depends on what level the students are in: In the more difficult level, as well as at the commerce and administrative division, the courses are mostly in French, but throughout the whole of secondary school, explanations are often given in Luxembourgish. The easier level on the other hand tends not to switch to French.

==Government==
Government websites are primarily written in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gouvernement.lu/|title=gouvernement.lu - Accueil|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gouvernement.lu|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; also there are parts are written for foreigners in other languages such as English &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/index.html|title=Luxembourg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/de/index.html|title=Luxemburg|access-date=2017-11-10|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Luxembourg's parliament the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], [[Bill (law)|bills]] are first written in German. Then the language of debate is in Luxembourgish, but sometimes also in French (e.g., when laws are cited). Laws are voted and codified in French. The country's head of state, the [[Monarchy of Luxembourg|Grand-Duke]]'s website is in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html|title=Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Accueil|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however his personal Christmas speech is done in Luxembourgish &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tele.rtl.lu/emissiounen/de-journal/3026611.html|title=RTL - de Journal - Chrëschtusprooch vum Grand-Duc|last=|first=|date=2014-12-24|website=RTL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(although a French translation is provided &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/actualites/discours/2014/12/discours-noel-fr/index.html|title=Discours de Noël prononcé par S.A.R. le Grand-Duc (version FR) - Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg - Décembre 2014|website=www.monarchie.lu|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).''

==Mass media==
In the written press, most newspapers such as ''[[Tageblatt]]'' and ''[[Lëtzebuerger Journal]]'' are in German, while there are a few such as [[Le Quotidien (newspaper)|''Le Quotidien'']] that are in French.  On the other hand, the newspaper of record [[Luxemburger Wort|''Luxemburger Wort'']] is trilingual with most articles written in German, but also sometimes written in French and Luxembourgish, often on the same page.

On TV and on the radio, Luxembourgish is mainly used, for example the main news programme [[RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg|RTL]]'s ''de Journal''. Spoken Luxembourgish used in news broadcasts tends to be strongly influenced by standard German in pronunciation and idiom.&lt;ref name="textual"&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "Textual varieties of Lëtzebuergesch", in Newton, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters are under pressure to translate news releases sourced from German press agencies in real time and have no special training in the prose style of Luxembourgish. As a result, news tends to be superficially translated into Luxembourgish. Syntax mostly follows standard German and many words and idioms from standard German appear unmodified.&lt;ref name="textual" /&gt; Phonology is also affected with the resulting use of intonation phrases alien to Luxembourgish.&lt;ref name="developments"&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "Lëtzebuergesch, spoken and written, developments and desirabilities", in Newton, pp. 114 - 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===
In terms of [[advertising]], which language is used depends on three factors; media, audience and origin. In written advertisements like [[billboard]]s, newspaper and magazine adverts, [[Mail order|catalogues]] and posters, the usual language of communication is French. On occasion to give a local flavour, it is written in part in Luxembourgish. [[Signage|Public signage]] is usually in French, with occasional markings in Luxembourgish, German and/or English.

For [[Advertisement film|television commercials]] broadcasting on RTL, if the advert is for an international product or service like a car or a television, it is entirely in French. However, if it is a domestic product or service like for example like [[:lb:Sources Rosport|Rosport]] mineral water or [[Luxair]], the spoken language is in Luxembourgish with the taglines in French, or less frequently in Luxembourgish or English. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sources Rosport|title=Rosport mat: Introducing Zitroun|date=2018-04-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgUmr8BBcUM|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Luxair Luxembourg Airlines|title=Luxair commercial from 1982|date=2015-10-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Y07TZHfyc|language=Luxembourgish and French|accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday life==
Generally, in everyday life, when talking to a foreigner, Luxembourgers will attempt to respond in the language they have been addressed in (mainly French, standard German or English). Due to the large number of foreigners in Luxembourg, locals now expect to use foreign languages in daily life, and as far as they are able, will use the foreigner's native language. For example, American students who have learned standard German are often spoken to in English.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;Jean-Paul Hoffman, "Lëtzebuergesch and its competitors: Language contact in Luxembourg Today" in Newton, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

By custom, French is used in restaurants and brasseries to the point that Luxembourgers assume that the service staff will be French speaking and make no attempt to use Luxembourgish. In rare cases when foreigners attempt to speak  Luxembourgish in these establishments staff will rebuff them in French with ''"{{lang|fr|Qu'est-ce que vous dites?}}"'' ("What do you say?"){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In less formal drinking establishments though, Luxembourgish remains normal.&lt;ref name=Hoffman /&gt;

==Written Luxembourgish==

Luxembourgish has a literary tradition that began in the 1820s with the development of serious forms of poetry, followed by drama and eventually narrative prose.&lt;ref name=developments/&gt; However, the average Luxembourger finds Luxembourgish texts difficult to read. Schoolchildren do not read Luxembourgish until the age of 11 or 12. Even then not all teachers adhere to the curriculum requirement to teach written Luxembourgish, some preferring to teach standard German instead, and consequently some students may not be taught written Luxembourgish. As a result, only a minority of literary-minded intellectuals find reading Luxembourgish easy or enjoyable. The majority of Luxembourgers regard their language as a spoken one only.&lt;ref name=developments/&gt;

For private correspondence, language choice tends to reflect social class. Members of the upper middle and upper classes tend to prefer French, although Luxembourgish may be used to convey a sense of close identification with one's nationality. German tends to be viewed negatively among the upper class, with the assumption that anyone writing in German has a poor mastery of French. Despite this, a minority of members of the upper class do prefer standard German when corresponding with close relatives. Use of German becomes more prominent the lower down the social scale one goes, followed by Luxembourgish, with French tending to be the least popular among the lower classes.&lt;ref name=domains&gt;Fernand Hoffman, "The domains of Lëtzebuergesch", in Newton, pp. 134 - 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, for correspondence between people who are related, standard German is preferred, followed by French and Luxembourgish equally, although social status has an influence. When people who are unrelated correspond, use of Luxembourgish drops off dramatically, and it tends not to be used at all between strangers. The choice of Luxembourgish therefore appears to reflect the closeness of the ties between the two people corresponding.&lt;ref name=domains/&gt;

'''National History Day''' is non-profit organization based in [[College Park, Maryland]] that operates an annual project-based contest for students in grades 6-12. It has affiliates in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], South Korea, China, South Asia, and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/affiliates|title=Affiliates {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started as a local program in Cleveland, Ohio, headed by Dr. David Van Tassell, a history professor at [[Case Western Reserve University]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorn, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 129 students in 1974 to over 500,000 students in 48 states in 1991, and 700,000 students and 40,000 teachers in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Page (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Today more than half a million students enter through local contests. They construct entries as an individual or a group in one of five categories: Documentary, Exhibit, Paper, Performance or Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhd.org/categories|title=Categories|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nhd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students then compete in a series of regional contests with top entries advancing to state/affiliate contests. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to compete at the National Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nhd.org/how-enter-contest|title=How to {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the National History Day Contest==
The contest started in Cleveland in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/about|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the History Department at [[Case Western Reserve University]] developed the initial idea for a history contest akin to Science Fair. Students gathered on campus to devote one day to history calling it "National History Day." Over the next few years, the contest expanded throughout Ohio and into surrounding Midwestern states. By 1980, with the help of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], National History Day had grown into a national non-profit organization and in 1992 National History Day moved its headquarters from Cleveland to the Washington, D.C., area. National History Day now runs multiple educational programs but the National Contest is still the largest of these. The national finals take place each June during a week-long event held at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Byers, David. "Four score and seven years ago... Costumed history buffs hit campus in national competition." The Diamondback Online 15 June 2006: 1-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National History Day Contest Annual Theme==
The annual theme is usually a phrase ending with "in history" and is often an alliteration, such as, "Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History." The theme frames students’ research within a historical theme. The theme is chosen for the broad application to world, national, or state history and its relevance to ancient history or to the more recent past. The 2018 theme was ''Conflict and Compromise in History,'' and the 2019 theme is ''Triumph and Tragedy in History''. "The intentional selection of the theme for the National History Day Contest is to provide an opportunity for students to push past the antiquated view of history as mere facts and dates and drill down into historical content to develop perspective and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nhd.org/node/542|title=Taking A Stand in History {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Themes are rotated each year and prior themes are often used after approximately seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/previous-annual-themes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

===Judging===
National History Day participants are judged on three deciding factors: Historical Quality, Relation to Theme, and Clarity of Presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/national-contest-judges%E2%80%99-information|title=National History Day &amp;#124; Classroom Connection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Nhd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research should include primary and secondary sources. Additionally, sources need to be clearly cited with the inclusion of an annotated bibliography. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a required process paper that needs to be included with the project, describing your process and struggles in creating an NHD project. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and Regional Competitions===
In some regions, students who reach enough points in their judging advance to states, and any number of students at regional competitions can advance to states. In other states, such as California, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, the top three projects at the regional competition advance to the state competition. Regions can be divided by geographic area, population, or by county.

At the state/affiliate level contests, students compete for a variety of prizes. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to the National Contest held each June at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

===National Competition===
====Preliminaries====
In the preliminary rounds, each entry presents their project before a panel of three judges. In the case of the paper and website categories, the projects have been reviewed by the judges prior to the presentations. Performances, documentaries, and exhibits are presented for the judges for the first time at the contest. The top entry in each judging group advances to the final round, called "Run Offs."

====Finals====
Those in the performance and documentary categories are notified they advanced to the final round and then present their work to a panel of three new judges. Those in the paper, website, and exhibit categories are not informed if they have made it into the final round. Their projects are judged by a panel of three new judges, but the students are not interviewed in this round. Their project then has to stand alone for the final judging.

[[File:Scans0012.jpg|thumb|National History Day Medal: 2005-2006|200px|right|Example of a National History Day Medal]] The awards for first, second, and third place at the national level are $1000, $500, and $250, respectively. "Outstanding Entry" awards are also given to two projects from each state: one junior entry and one senior entry. There are also more than a dozen special prizes awarded worth between $250 and $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/special-prizes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impact on students ====
An independent study conducted in 2011 demonstrated that students who participate in the National History Day Contest outperform their non-participating peers and score higher on standardized tests, although this might be a reflection on the type of students who choose to participate in National History Day - those who seek to challenge themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.navyhistory.org/2012/07/alaska-students-awarded-nhf-national-history-day-prize/ Three Alaska Students Awarded NHF National History Day Prize]." ''Naval Historical Foundation,'' 17 July 2012. Accessed 10 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on historians===
Arnita Jones, executive director of the [[American Historical Association]], wrote in 2001:
:Perhaps the greatest impact of National History Day...was on the historical profession itself. I truly believe that never have so many historians enjoyed engaging in the pursuit of history outside their offices, their regular classrooms, and their academic research as have the thousands who have participated in National History Day as teachers, mentors, consultants and judges over more than two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gorn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher level technical [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|education in Ireland]] was seen to be an area that was poorly served until the advent of these institutions.

The plan was to see [[academic degree|degree]] level education mainly. The first institution was set up in Limerick, where there had been long-standing demand for a university, in fact a "University of Limerick" was proposed ''inter alia'' in the late 1960s by the ''Lichfield Report''. The institution at  Dublin was to be the unified campus of what later became [[Dublin Institute of Technology]], but instead a new institution was developed similar to Limerick.

In the 1970s it was expected that the institutions would be ''recognised colleges'' of the [[National University of Ireland]], in time this status been raised to ''constituent college'' status. Initially this did occur for a short time (1976&amp;ndash;1977), however the institutions had all degrees conferred by the [[Higher Education and Training Awards Council|National Council for Educational Awards]] after 1977, this continued until university status was achieved.

==International Study Group on Technological Education==

In November 1986 the International Study Group on Technological Education was established by the [[Minister for Education (Ireland)|Minister for Education]].

The chair was T.P. Hardiman, chairman of the [[Investment Bank of Ireland]], whilst the deputy chair was [[Emeritus Professor]] of Business Administration at [[University College, Dublin]]. The other three members were:
*Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University and Vice President of the Royal Society
*President of the University of Waterloo
*Vice-President of the German Research Foundation at Hamburg University of Technology

The institutions were de facto universities from the start, and were elevated to the level of university in 1989 after the ''International Study Group on Technological Education'' presented its recommendations to the [[Irish Government]] on their status. The original brief of this report was to investigate the creation of a single ''National Technological University'':&lt;ref&gt;Report of the International Study Group on Technological Education (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''...to examine third-level technological education outside the universities and to consider the case of a new Technological University...''

However the study group found that this title would not be appropriate considering that non-technical disciplines were offered and that one university might limit the innovation which had become the trademark of the two separate institutions:&lt;ref&gt;Report of the International Study Group on Technological Education (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''...the NIHE Limerick having the title University of Limerick and the NIHE Dublin having the title Dublin City University or the University of Leinster.''

:''The title 'technological university" should not be used.''

The university was founded in 1918 as Turkestan People's University, with 1,200 students; in 1920 it was reorganized as Turkestan State University ({{lang-ru|Туркестанский государственный университет}}), and in July 1923 it was renamed the First '''Central Asian State University''' ({{lang-ru|Первый Среднеазиатский Государственный Университет}}), a name it retained through the end of the 1950s. In 1960 the name was changed to the V.I. Lenin '''Tashkent State University''' ({{lang-ru|Ташкентский государственный университет им. В. И. Ленина}}). With the independence of Uzbekistan it became the National University of Uzbekistan.

During [[World War II]] many academics were removed from cities in the western USSR to [[Central Asia]], and [[Tashkent]], along with [[Alma-Ata]], was favored for its European-style infrastructure and the presence of a significant number of Russian-speakers; a group of professors from Moscow protested being transferred from Tashkent .&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stronski, ''Tashkent: Forging a Soviet City, 1930-1966'' (University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010: {{ISBN|0-8229-6113-X}}), pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;
The university consists of 11 faculties: 
Faculty of Economics;

Faculty of Foreign Philology;
Faculty of Geography;
Faculty of Geology;
Faculty of Mathematics;
Faculty of Physics;

The "Practising High School, Yangon Institute of Education", now, "'''Practising High School, Yangon University of Education'''" ({{lang-my|ပညာရေးတက္ကသိုလ် လေ့ကျင့်ရေးကျောင်း}}; abbreviated '''TTC''' Yangon) is a high school in [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]]. Although it is a high school in the technical sense, TTC's student body comprises students from Grade One (formerly Kindergarten) to Grade Eleven (formerly Tenth Standard) or Matriculation, the highest standard in the Myanmar education system. The origin of the name of the school comes from the fact that TTC is part of the Institute of Education (former Teachers' Training College), whose trainee teachers are attached to the school as part of their course.

==History==
The school was established in 1931. Its main campus is situated on Pyay Road in [[Kamayut Township]]. It was established as an experimental school by the colonial education authority as a new means to deliver scientific education to the student body. Thus, the school did not fall under either the colonial government's school syllabus (consisting mostly of mission-schools run by the religious order), nor the newly founded Nationalist Vernacular school network. Consequently, after Myanmar (Burma)'s independence, the school remained somewhat independent of the Basic Education High School network, although they shared the same government implemented syllabus.

Until the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the school had boarding facilities, mainly for students from out of town. The school was served by the [[Rangoon Electric Tramway]]'s University Line along [[Pyay Road|Prome Road]] (now Pyay Road).

==Administration and campus==
[[File:Kamayut Campus.jpg|thumb|Kamayut Campus]]
The Yangon University of Education (Lower Myanmar) independently runs the TTC High School with the joint administration of Higher Education Department, unlike the rest of the schools in the country which are administered by the Basic Education Department. TTC Yangon is therefore the only significant school of considerable size outside the Basic Education School network.

TTC has two campuses: Pyay Road (in [[Kamayut Township]]) campus and Hlaing campus (in [[Hlaing Township]]. Kamayut campus is {{convert|25.7|acre|m2}} wide, and is the main site of the school, housing much of the school's original pre-war buildings. Hlaing campus was acquired around 2000. It is {{convert|23.96|acre|m2}} wide, and comprises the unused buildings of the failed Regional College system of the 1970s. Both campuses are different to other schools'campuses for their university-like locations. Hlaing campus contains some lecture theatres, the only ones owned by a high school in Myanmar, although they are seldom used.

Kamayut campus is bordered by three universities: the [[University of Medicine-1, Yangon]], the University of Education, and the University of Distant Education, sharing the same main street, [[Thaton]] Street.

The Hlaing campus was once used as a regional college (Regional College 2). However, due to reforms in the education systems, the whole regional college system and campuses were abandoned. TTC rented the Regional College 2 campus, beginning in late 2000. There are about 130 classrooms across 18 buildings shared between the two campuses. A total of 9000 students from kindergarten (Grade 1) to 10th Standard (Grade 11) are studying at TTC and around 167 teachers and support staff.

==Student body==
TTC Yangon has a large student body in Yangon and in Myanmar, numbering near 9000.  The students are spread across eleven standards or grades, from Grade-1 (formerly Kindergarten of KG) to Grade-11 (formerly Tenth Standard, colloquially ''sei-dan'')

For many years, TTC students have a tradition of putting the right finger at the lip and say "Kyan Mar Shwin Lan Par Sae" *_ကျန်းမာရွင်လန်းပါစေ ဆရာ/ဆရာမ_* - (good health to you) to the teachers. This is a tradition to show respect to the teachers.

==Uniform==
{{details|High Schools in Myanmar}}
Students wear uniform. There are two sets of uniform, one for wear from Kindergarten to 4th Standard (Grades 1 to 5), and another, more traditional one for wear from the 5th Standard to 10th Standard (Grades 6 to 11). All uniforms are of the same colour - a white shirt or blouse, with a green garment for the torso.

===School badge===
The distinguishing feature of the TTC student's uniform is the lack of the sewn-in school badge - all other schools require that the school name and badge be sewn into either the shoulder sleeve or above the single left side pocket.

In TTC, a small brooch like badge, bearing an oil lamp (in both Buddhist and Burmese terminology, the oil lamp represents wisdom and education), with school's name. TTC Yangon is the only school which has such a badge system.

===Boys uniform===
* From Kindergarten to the 4th Standard, boys wear a white shirt (with or without the collar), tucked into a green pants - either short or long. Shoes and the traditional slipper, [[Hnyat-phanat]] are footwear.
* From the 5th Standard onwards, the students wear a white shirt (with or without the collar), and a green [[longyi|paso]]. Only the Hnyat-phanat is permitted. For formal wear, a long sleeved shirt without the collar is worn, over which a [[taikpone]], a Burmese-style [[changshan]], of either pin-ni (brownish vermilion) or white, is put on. Traditional Mandalay slippers, usually of velvet or other materials, are worn.
* Current uniform rules began in late 1977. Boys from Kindergarten through the 7th or 8th Standard wear either green shorts or green longyis until 1977. Before nationwide white and green uniforms were introduced in the mid sixties, the TTC uniform consisted of a white shirt and light green longyi with vertical white stripes.

===Girls uniform===
* From Kindergarten to the 4th Standard, girls can wear either skirts or pants, with a white shirt. Girls usually wear slippers.
* For 5th Standard onwards, the uniform also becomes more traditional like its male counterpart. The girls wear either a front opening (yin-zee) or side opening (yin-phone) traditional Burmese blouse, with the [[Htamein]] as the lower garment.
* Current uniform rules began in late 1977. Girls from Kindergarten through the 7th or 8th Standard wear either green skirts or green [[Htamein]] until 1977. Before nationwide white and green uniforms were introduced in mid sixties, TTC uniform was a white shirt and light green [[Htamein]] with vertical white stripes.

==Accomplishments==
It ranks the highest overall in [[High Schools in Myanmar|Burmese High School]] in the Myanmar University Entrance exam, conducted by the Myanma Examination Board. TTC's student body produces many high scoring students both in terms of collective subjects and individual subjects, making into the very competitive "nationwide outstanding top-ten students' list", colloquially known as the whole-Burma or top ten list quite often.

TTC has won medals in national  and international competitions, such as [[South East Asian Games]].

Students have won medals in "Myanmar Traditional and Cultural Performing Arts Competition" (''So-Ka-Yay-Tee'') and won painting
competitions.

==Renovations==
TTC relied on already existing buildings for much of its existence. Much of these buildings were on loan from the Yangon University of Education. However, by 2000, the grants expired and were not renewed. In order to cope with the loss of nearly three-quarters of its classroom capacity, a building and renovation programme was implemented, resulting in the renting of the former [[University of Yangon]] (Hlaing Campus), which was also known as Regional College Number 2 (or RC-2), and the building of a new school wing. Five wings from RC-2 were rented from the Ministry of Education in 2000, and the completion of a three-storey wing.

With the rising use of the internet and government promotion of information technology, two IT labs have been added to the campus facilities, though they are not frequently used, due to the overwhelming student population. A new assembly hall, arts hall and a chemistry lab have also been added.

==Facilities==
''Pyay Campus''
*The library building was built with funds donated by Daw Mya Than.
*Football field - the field was the site of a small nationalist vernacular school, which rented the field from 1932-1934. The field also housed refugee huts during the [[Second World War]]. The Student Volunteer Army of the Union of Burma, called ''Thanmani-tut'' in Burmese (lit. Steel Forces), were trained in the field. Most of the Thanmani-tut were used in the reconquest of the country from rebels and KMT forces.
*One canteen - although Pyay Campus has around 3000 students, the canteen is small in comparison to the student body. The new one opened in  2009.
*Yadana Hall - former assembly hall, used for [[Kathina|Ka-htein]] and other religious ceremonies.
*Anu-pyin-nyar Hall - new assembly hall built in the new school wing, now used for school reunions and functions.
*Biology-Chemistry Lab - when the old lab was handed back to the Institute of Education, a new one was built to replace it, in the new school wing. However, equipment and chemicals are extremely hard to replace (high student population, funding issues, lack of teachers) and thus is seldom used.
*PT (Physical Training) Hall - an older occupant of the campus, it was renovated in 2004. It also serves as a back-up assembly hall and badminton court.
*IT Lab - built in the new school wing under the government's policy to embrace information technology, the IT lab shares the site with the Biology-Chemistry Lab, though it is more frequently used.
[[File:Typical match.jpg|thumb|right|Typical football match]]

''Hlaing Campus''

Due to insufficient space in the Pyay Campus, much of the modernisation and equipment are channelled to the Hlaing Campus
*A new IT lab, better equipped than the one at Pyay Campus. Some lessons are held in the lab.
*Canteen - a very large canteen compared to the one at Pyay Campus
*8 lecture theatres - for exams and certain classes
*Football field
*PT Lodges - used for ping-pong and other games requiring only small spaces.

'''Robert Lacy''' is an American writer, of short stories.  He was born and raised in East Texas, and served in the [[United States Marines]].  He graduated from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]], where he was a student of [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]].&lt;ref name="Blake Bailey 12"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nighttrainmagazine.com/pdfs/bailey2.pdf|title=A Tragic Honesty|author=Blake Bailey|page=12|publisher=Picador |date=May 1, 2004|isbn= 978-0-312-42375-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lives in [[Medicine Lake, Minnesota]].

==Reviews==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Robert Lacy's stories are direct, honest, grace-filled, and useful. ''The Natural Father'' is that good thing, a book that both sweetens and illuminates our lives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Father-Stories-Robert-Lacy/dp/0898231760] [[William Kittredge]], author of Hole in the Sky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotes about Yates==
&lt;blockquote&gt;“I think we all wanted to be Richard Yates,” his student Robert Lacy remembered. “I know for a fact that I did. He was tall, lanky, and movie-star handsome back then, and he moved in an aura of sad, doom-haunted, F. Scott Fitzgeraldian grace. He was Gatsby and Nick Carraway and Dick Diver all rolled into one.&lt;ref name="Blake Bailey 12"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Though I realize I’m crippled that is true, sir,
:Please don’t judge my courage by my twisted leg,
:Let me show my Uncle Sam what I can do, sir,
:Let me take the Axis down a peg.
God, how we loved that song!  And, God, how Yates used to love to lead us in it! No doubt there were happier moments in his life. But those were the happiest I ever saw. We’d be gathered in someone’s kitchen, our heads, including Yates’s, all leaned in close together in a drunken bouquet, and the look on his face as he put us through our musical paces would be positively beatific. Occasionally a spouse or girlfriend might stick a head in the door to see what was going on, see what all the racket was. But after one look they’d shake their heads and go away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nighttrainmagazine.com/pdfs/bailey2.pdf|title=A Tragic Honesty|author=Blake Bailey|page=23|publisher=Picador |date=May 1, 2004|isbn= 978-0-312-42375-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academics==
Roseway Waldorf School follows the Waldorf Steiner Curriculum.  

The Steiner Waldorf curriculum is holistic and spans the age range from 3–18 years. It places emphasis on integrating nature, art, crafts, drama and music into all academic learning including science &amp; mathematics. It addresses all the multiple intelligences, including emotional literacy and kinesthetic learning.

In addition to developing analytical, logical and reasoning skills as education has always done, it focuses on the development of imagination, creativity, memory and flexible thinking skills.

The Steiner curriculum is based on understanding the development of a child and how children learn at different ages. It encourages the development of each child’s sense of truth, beauty, and goodness, and inspires in each child a lifelong love of learning. The Waldorf curriculum runs from preschool till the class 12 year (18 year old)

===Beginnings===
{{further|Tabor Park Vocational School}}
The ''Re-entry Program'' in Scarborough began in November 1977 at [[Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute]] with one teacher and fifteen students. Envisioned was a program which would meet the needs of dropouts or disadvantaged learners wishing to return to school; the program had grown and transformed into an adult program. By 1985, the program featured 9.33 teachers and 200 students.

In 1980, the ''Co-Op Re-entry Program'' was established. The program featured an in-school component with a job experience placement and grew from the original two teachers and 35 students to 5 teachers and 170 students in 1986.

Formerly known as [[Tabor Park Vocational School]], the Re-entry Programs were united and expanded as Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies originally opened on September 2, 1986 at 959 Midland Avenue operated by the [[Scarborough Board of Education]] with 360 adults. At Tabor Park, agencies operating at SCAS included a rooms registry service called Scarborough Housing Assistance: Placement and Education for Singles (SHAPES), the counseling service Metro Youth Services, a day care facility operated by NYAD (Not Your Average Day Care), and the board's Community Liaison Office.&lt;ref&gt;Astorga-Garcia, Mila.

The original SCAS campus was reopened and became known as [[Jean Vanier Catholic Secondary School]] in September 1989. The need for a new adult school led to a 'unique partnership' between the SBE and [[Centennial College]], in 1992, to establish the new campus for SCAS, (originally the Scarborough Career Planning Centre) on 939 Progress Avenue that opened in September 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Theresa.

==Overview==
Like all TDSB adult learning centres, it has two distinctive programs, EdVance and Adult.

===Campus===
{{see also|Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute#Overview}}
Since the school is located in the [[Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute]] facility in 2010, SCAS currently occupies some parts of the first floor, most parts of the second floor, and the entire third floor space. The school carries many [[modernist]] design features consisting of five stairwells, a circular cafeteria, a two floor library with two seminar rooms, wide guidance area, larger atrium, a theatre with more than 900 seats, 33 academic classrooms, two home economics rooms, one large lecture hall, four performing art rooms for music/dance/drama, two visual art rooms, five science labs, three gymnasia with the larger one that can be partitioned into two smaller gyms with SCAS occupying the larger gym, and large athletic field as well the track and football/soccer fields with an attached hill. The swimming pool remains partly leased.

Historically, the school was attached by a day care centre, Not Your Average Daycare, and continues to do so today.

As the Progress Campus built in the lands of Centennial College, the school was built in a triangular configuration and students would get lunches from the college's cafeteria.  Previously, SCAS had lunch service at the Tabor Park campus.

The '''Scribbler''' is a small, low-cost fully programmable intelligent robot with multiple sensor systems. It is capable of auto navigation and interaction with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parallax.com/tabid/455/Default.aspx |title=Scribbler 2 (S2) Robot - USB &amp;#124; 28136 &amp;#124; Parallax Inc |website=Parallax.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scribbler is a combined effort of three companies: [[Parallax, Inc. (company)|Parallax Inc.]], Element Products Inc., and Bueno Systems Inc.&lt;ref name="robots1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robots.net/article/1729.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207091123/http://robots.net/article/1729.html |archivedate=7 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the Scribbler was selling for a retail price of around $100 USD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&amp;q=scribbler+robot&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=YY3fS__nNY-M8wSp3OiZBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCMQrQQwAg ]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer version of the Scribbler, Scribbler 2, came out in the fourth quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parallax.com/tabid/826/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516163611/http://www.parallax.com/tabid/826/Default.aspx |archivedate=16 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scribbler has a built in [[BASIC Stamp]] 2 microcontroller brain. For inputting sensory information, the Scribbler has three photoresistor light sensors, infrared emitter, and infrared detector. Additional add-ons can be bought to give the robot more capabilities through the serial port. For example, a bluetooth emitter/receiver or a wireless card can be bought to interface with the robot.&lt;ref name="robots1"/&gt;

The Scribbler can be programmed through any BASIC Stamp Editor program, or through a GUI-style interface, provided on Parallax's website. This uses different "command tiles" to control the motors and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parallax.com/ProductInfo/Robotics/ScribblerRobotInformation/ProgramtheScribblerRobot/tabid/457/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817103155/http://www.parallax.com/ProductInfo/Robotics/ScribblerRobotInformation/ProgramtheScribblerRobot/tabid/457/Default.aspx |archivedate=17 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a Myro library, you can also program the Scribbler in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. 

The Scribbler is used by many teachers for educational purposes. For example, [[Institute for Personal Robots in Education]] (IPRE) has developed extensive educational materials using the Scribbler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roboteducation.org |title=Institute for Personal Robots in Education |website=Roboteducation.org |date=2008-02-27 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11642">'''Secondary education''' in New Zealand takes up to five years, covering the ages 13 to 18, corresponding to the school years 9 to 13.

== History ==
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}
In 1940, there were 156 schools in New Zealand offering secondary education: 39 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 21 technical high schools.&lt;ref name="TeAra-PS-7"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/primary-and-secondary-education/page-7 |accessdate= 15 February 2013 |first= Nancy |last= Swarbrick |title= Primary and secondary education - Numbers and types of schools |publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date= 13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the [[school leaving age]] was raised from 14 to 15. At the same time, a gradual move started away from separate secondary schools and technical high schools toward comprehensive secondary schools serving both, and district high schools started falling out of favour to separate secondary schools. Combined with the [[post-World War II baby boom]], the number of secondary students swelled and a large number of new secondary schools had to be built. By 1960, the number of secondary students had tripled from 39,000 to 140,000,&lt;ref name="TeAra-PS-7"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/primary-and-secondary-education/page-3 |accessdate= 15 February 2013 |first= Nancy |last= Swarbrick |title= Primary and secondary education - Education from the 1920s to 2000s |publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date= 13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of secondary schools had increased to 239, comprising 102 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 41 technical high schools.&lt;ref name="TeAra-PS-7" /&gt;

With the large number of new schools being built, most state secondary schools in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were built to common designs. The first common design was the Naenae type (after its first use at [[Naenae College]]) in 1953, with schools built with long two-story classroom wings of mixed concrete and timber construction. This was followed by the Henderson type (after [[Henderson High School (Auckland)|Henderson High School]]), which was a single-story all-timber version of the Naenae type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/architecture-school-buildings/page-3 |title=  Post-primary Schools -- 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate= 22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1957, secondary schools moved to consisting of blocks of classrooms. The Nelson plan (named for [[Nelson, New Zealand|the city]] in which it was designed) first started with single-storey timber buildings with 6 classrooms, before evolving into two-storey H-shaped timber buildings containing 12 classrooms in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/architecture-school-buildings/page-4 |title=  Modern Planning -- 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |publisher= Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate= 22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/~/media/MinEdu/Files/EducationSectors/PrimarySecondary/PropertyToolbox/StateSchools/Design/StructuralMitigation/StrengtheningNelsonBlocks1.pdf |title= Ministry of Education Structural Mitigation Programme -- Strengthening of Nelson Blocks |publisher= Connell Wagner Limited |date= September 2001 |accessdate= 15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design lasted over a decade, with the Nelson classroom block going on to become the most numerous type of classroom block found in New Zealand secondary schools. In 1971, the Nelson plan was replaced with the S68 plan (after the 1968 prototype at [[Porirua College]]), which featured single-storey classroom blocks of concrete block construction, with low pitched roofs, and internal open courtyards. In 1980, two new common design plans were introduced: the Whanau plan used at [[Macleans College]], and the Leeston plan used at [[Ellesmere College]]. However at the same time, student numbers plateaued and secondary school construction dwindled, resulting in common design plans being dropped in 1982 in favour of schools being individually designed.

By 1980, there were 265 secondary schools and 35 district high schools, with technical high schools having been completely phased out.&lt;ref name="TeAra-PS-7" /&gt;

In 1989, the school leaving age was raised to the present age of 16. Also in 1989, the ''Tomorrow's Schools'' reform was implemented, moving the governance of secondary schools from district education boards to individual school communities through elected boards of trustees.

== Types of school ==

There are three types of school: state, private (or registered or independent) and [[state-integrated school|state integrated]] schools. State and state integrated schools are government funded. Private schools receive about 25% of their funding from the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isnz.org.nz/documents/other/isnz_nz_schools.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614113639/http://www.isnz.org.nz/documents/other/isnz_nz_schools.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and rely on tuition fees for the rest. State integrated schools are former private schools which are now "integrated" into the state system under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3690096234&amp;hitsperheading=on&amp;infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&amp;record=%7b3AAAD062%7d&amp;softpage=DOC Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; "on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them". According to Ministry of Education statistics, of the 284,052 secondary students (Years 9–15) enrolled in New Zealand schools at 1 July 2012, 81.6 percent (231,817) attend state schools, 12.6 percent (35,924) attend state integrated schools, and 5.7 percent (16,230) attend private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0010/71776/Roll-by-Authority-and-FYL.xls |title= Roll by Authority &amp; Funding Year Level - 1 July 2012 |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 8 September 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104060414/http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/__data/assets/excel_doc/0010/71776/Roll-by-Authority-and-FYL.xls |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many private schools, state area schools and state integrated schools take students from Years 0 to 13, or Years 7 to 13.

== State school enrollment schemes ==
For state schools, the Education Amendment Act 2000 puts in place a new "system for determining enrollment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding." Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined "home zone". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house, if it has one, gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of board employees; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected.

Critics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lowers socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905164438/http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |archivedate=2005-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School qualifications ==
The Government-run student qualification system is the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] ("NCEA"). At some schools students can opt for [[IGCSE]]/[[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] (popularly known as "Cambridge exams") or the [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate Diploma]].

NCEA has three levels, one for each of the last three years of secondary school. It contains a mix of internal and external assessments. NCEA replaced the old [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]], [[Sixth Form Certificate]] and [[New Zealand University Bursary|Bursary]] systems.

The IGCSE and A-level exams of the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS-level]] in year 12 and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the [[NZQA National Qualifications Framework]].

University Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities. [[New Zealand Scholarship]] is a qualification pitched at students within the top stanine level.

== Fees and donations ==
{{main|School Fees in New Zealand}}
Strictly speaking, no fees need to be paid for education at a state school provided the student is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident, or an Australian citizen. However, most schools also ask for a "voluntary donation" from parents, informally known as "school fees" or a "parental contribution".

== Trades unions ==

'''Commencement controversy at [[Smith College]]''' in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] has sometimes been the result of the selection of the commencement speaker. Most recently, this occurred between February and May 2014, when protests over Christine Lagarde’s invitation allegedly forced her to rescind her acceptance to give the commencement speech for the class of 2014 at their [[graduation]]. While it is said that “such reversals have become more common in recent years” given that, “what has changed is not so much the protests themselves, but the willingness of colleges and speakers to give in”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/us/after-protests-imf-chief-withdraws-as-smith-colleges-commencement-speaker.html?_r=0|title=After Protests, I.M.F. Chief Withdraws as Smith College’s Commencement Speaker|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is actually a longer history of controversy over the chosen commencement speaker that spans back to the 1960s if not before. What Smith’s history shows is that the struggle over representation, as demonstrated by the controversy over commencement speakers in many colleges, is not a new occurrence, but rather an old stage for a struggle over an institution’s values and those that the institution represents.

==1967, Nicholas Katzenbach==

In 1967, the then-President [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] invited [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] to be the commencement speaker for the graduating class. At the time, he was the 24th [[Undersecretary of State]] under [[Lyndon Johnson]]. When it was announced that he was to give the commencement speech, he was roundly criticized for his stance on the [[Vietnam War]]. The senior class petitioned, stating: “We are honored by the presence of Nicholas B. Katzenbach as our commencement speaker. We respect and admire his past work in the fields of civil rights and crime prevention. However, in his post as Under Secretary of State, he is clearly a representative of America’s present foreign policy. Therefore, we the undersigned graduating seniors of Smith College take this opportunity to express our opposition to our government’s responsibility for widening the conflict in Vietnam.”&lt;ref name="Sixty-seven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/smitharchives/manosca259_main.html|title=Class of 1967 Records, RG 80, Box 2238, Commencement Folder|publisher=Smith College Archives|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At their own commencement, members of the graduating class wore white armbands to express their disagreement with the [[foreign policy of the United States]].

Many faculty members also made their opposition to the Vietnam War clear by providing every commencement pamphlet with a petition. The petition quotes: “Our hopes are that the U.S. Government, by means of an extraordinary conciliatory gesture, will seek a way of bringing peace to our country and to the world.”&lt;ref name="Sixty-seven"/&gt; Nicholas Katzenbach delivered the speech on the 4th of June, 1967, titled, “How Can You Be So Sure?”&lt;ref name="How"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://saq.smith.edu/i/514662-august-1967 | title=How Can You Be So Sure? | publisher=Smith College Alumnae Association | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; amidst all parents, faculty, staff and students. After his speech, President Mendenhall held a conference where Katzenbach expressed the policies of the U.S. in regards to the Vietnam War more specifically. The ''Alumnae Quarterly'' of the Summer of 1967 reflected on both methods of protest as “dignified” and hailed the president for handling the situation so well.&lt;ref name="How"/&gt;

==1970, Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher==

While there was not as much controversy in 1970 over the choice of [[Alan Frank Guttmacher]], the president of [[Planned Parenthood]], the backlash from parents and Alumnae represent their powerful force in an institution that no longer represents them directly. 1970 was also the year that President [[Richard Nixon]]'s daughter graduated from Smith College. He could not attend the event because his policies were not widely accepted and to avoid the possibility of protests at what was a considered a non-political event. Many parents and Alumnae wrote to the president, Thomas Mendenhall, declaring their dissatisfaction with the commencement speaker choice and lamenting how the President of The United States, nor his daughter, could be present at her own graduation. In a letter to the editor of the [[Daily Hampshire Gazette]], the author stated: “If the present Administration and Trustees feel [they] cannot handle the troublemakers on Campus, then quietly resign and I’m sure you will have some others who will be quite capable of handling the situations as they arise and will not cop-out.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite title=Smith College Taken to Task, 28th May 1970|publisher=Daily Hampshire Gazette|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were upset that the president of Planned Parenthood, an organization that they say promoted pre-marital sex, could speak in front of the Smith Community while the President of The United States “could not” attend.

Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher delivered his address on graduation day, which was titled, “Fertility Control: A Gift and Challenge.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://saq.smith.edu/i/515301-august-1970 | title=Fertility Control:A Gift and Challenge | publisher=Smith College Alumnae Association | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1983, Jeane Kirkpatrick==
[[File:Od jeane-kirkpatrick-official-portrait 1-255x301.jpg|thumbnail|Official portrait of Jeane Kirkpatrick]]

One of the most notable controversies of Smith College’s history of commencement was the President’s, [[Jill Ker Conway]], and the trustees’ decision to host [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]] as the class of 1983′s speaker. After she served as a foreign policy adviser to [[Ronald Reagan]], she was the first female U.S. ambassador to the [[United Nations]] and was known for her doctrine, The [[Kirkpatrick Doctrine]] which justified U.S. support of military dictatorships in Central and South America. Almost immediately after the announcement of their choice, students organized against it, claiming that a human rights abuser should not receive an honorary degree. A letter to the ''Alumnae Quarterly'' by Helen Haddad ’63 said: “Students began writing letters and ‘perspectives’ pieces to ''The Sophian'', both in support of, and in opposition to, Mrs. Kirkpatrick–among them was a piece written by a senior whose aunt was one of the four [[Maura Clarke|Maryknoll nuns]] killed in [[El Salvador]]. They discussed their interpretations of Mrs. Kirkpatrick’s published books and articles. They discussed American foreign policy in Latin America, South Africa, and elsewhere. Some students who in October knew very little about Mrs. Kirkpatrick, except perhaps that she was an ambassador to the United Nations, were now arguing over her views and votes, whether or not she was an appropriate commencement speaker and whether or not they approved of the award of an honorary degree”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saq.smith.edu/i/509475-spring-1983|title=Smith Alumnae Quarterly, Spring 1983|publisher=Smith College Alumnae Association|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the tone which assumes Smith Students did not know of these issues before Kirkpatrick was chosen, it is clear that there was much sentiment against what made her a powerful woman within the U.S. government. This incited a discussion on the kind of feminism that Smith represents, being an all women’s liberal arts college. When Kirkpatrick canceled her commencement speech and eventually declined the honorary degree, alumnae, students, parents, and the media took hold of the story and framed it as a [[freedom of speech]] issue that was plaguing College Campuses.

==2014, Christine Lagarde==
[[File:Lagarde, Christine (official portrait 2011).jpg|thumb|250px|Portrait of Christine Lagarde]]

The frame that many media outlets used to situate the Kirkpatrick controversy at Smith was used again in 2014 in regards to Christine Lagarde’s decision to withdraw her acceptance to speak at graduation. [[Christine Lagarde]], the first female Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]], sparked numerous protests, petitions, and discussions. Parallel’s were drawn with Smith’s current campaign, that states its mission as educating powerful woman for the benefit of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smith.edu/giving/campaign.php | title=Women of the World: The Campaign for Smith | publisher=Smith College | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not Christine Lagarde benefited the world with her high-status position was the contested question.

In the wake of the protests, she rescinded her acceptance to speak at Smith College’s commencement ceremony. The response to her withdrawal was immense. Numerous articles appeared in major media outlets. Many alumnae wrote to the President, [[Kathleen McCartney (college president)|Kathleen McCartney]], and faculty petitioned against those who had petitioned in support of McCartney and the Trustees. Students who had organized against the choice of having her speak wrote an open letter to McCartney after she emailed the entire College, stating: “I want to underscore this fact: An invitation to speak at a commencement is not an endorsement of all views or policies of an individual or the institution she or he leads. Such a test would preclude virtually anyone in public office or position of influence. Moreover, such a test would seem anathema to our core values of free thought and diversity of opinion. I remain committed to leading a college where differing views can be heard and debated with respect.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Announcement Regarding the 2014 Commencement Speaker|publisher=McCartney, Kathleen. Message to Author. 12 May 2014.|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Good Schools Guide''''' is a guide to British schools, both [[State school|state]] and independent.

== Overview ==
The guide is compiled by a team of editors, which according to the official website "''comprises some 50 editors, writers, researchers and contributors; mostly parents but some former headteachers.''"&lt;ref name="gsg"&gt;[http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk Good Schools Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The website states that it is "written by parents for parents", and that the schools are not charged for entry in the Guide, nor can they pay to be included, though featured schools may advertise on the website or in the print versions. Since the first edition in 1986, the ''Guide'' has been republished 20 times. The chief editor is [[Ralph Palmer, 12th Baron Lucas|Ralph Lucas]].

Other publications produced by The Guide include ''The Good Schools Guide – Special Education Needs'', ''The Good Schools Guide International'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/international |title=A Guide to the best international schools around the world |publisher=The Good Schools Guide |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Good Schools Guide London North'', ''The Good Schools Guide London South'' and ''[[Uni in the USA]]''.  An offshoot is the Good Schools Guide Education Consultants (formerly Advice Service) – a service for finding schools and offering educational or other advice to parents on a consultancy basis. The consultants are The Guide writers and other experts.

==Style==
The Guide itself has a brisk, conversational and often irreverent style of review: the website states that because writers do not accept payment from the schools being reviewed, the guide is "in a position to be outspoken, to write and to advise [readers] impartially, without fear of being biased or having a conflict of loyalties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/help-and-advice Good Schools Guide - Help and Advice]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' stated that the ''Guide'' is "...untroubled by the sensibilities of schools and ... cavalier in the face of squawks from those it has offended".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/shop |title=The Good Schools Guide - Shop |date=2 January 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reviewed the guide in the following terms: "Unique among the many guides available, it sets out to give frank answers to the questions every parent asks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Webcomfort mark@webcomfort.co.uk |url=http://www.britishgermanassociation.org/special.php?pageno=260 |title=Moving to the UK – Choose a School |publisher=British German Association |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' called the ''Guide'' "One of the best aids for parents...informative and witty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tbp Web |url=http://tbpweb.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/Home.aspx?collection=10019282 |title=TBP.Web |publisher=Tbpweb.tbpcontrol.co.uk |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Financial Times|''FT'']] has also described the ''Guide'' as "one of Britain's leading guides to schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner |first=David |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3efc3f34-7bab-11dd-b839-000077b07658,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F3efc3f34-7bab-11dd-b839-000077b07658.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.ft.com%2Fsearch%3FqueryText%3Dgood%2Bschools%2Bguide%26aje%3Dtrue%26dse%3D%26dsz%3D%26x%3D12%26y%3D6 |title=Mixed outlook for boys-only learning |work=Financial Times |date=6 September 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian repeatedly describes the ''Guide'' as "the bible for middle-class school choice"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/third-britain-medallists-rio-olympics-private-schools-sutton-trust|title=Third of Britain's Rio medallists went to private schools|last=correspondent|first=Sally Weale Education|date=22 August 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/05/massively-improved-state-schools-threaten-private-sector|title='Massively' improved state schools threaten private sector|last=editor|first=Richard Adams Education|date=5 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''International''==
''The Good Schools Guide International'' (GSGI) is an online resource also edited by the guide with details of international schools in over 35 countries. The ''GSGI'' is aimed at British parents who are living abroad. The ''GSGI'' is also mostly written and edited by expatriates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/international |title=A Guide to the best international schools around the world |publisher=The Good Schools Guide |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tsunami Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Center''' is a nonprofit institution located in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], committed to the study, treatment and education of [[PTSD]] and related [[mental health]] issues, many of which are specific to [[Asia]].

The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|tsunami of December 26, 2004]] devastated lives in many ways. In addition to the loss of lives and homes, many people in damaged areas continue to experience the effects of the disaster in the form of widespread [[psychological trauma]]. 

The Tsunami PTSD Center proposes specifically to address the mental health needs of tsunami-affected areas through [[clinical research]], treatment programs and educational initiatives. These initiatives will be created for health professionals and policy makers, researchers, and the general public. 

The objectives of the Tsunami PTSD Center are threefold: 

#	'''Conduct clinical research''' to determine the best treatment paths and options for patients with PTSD in tsunami-affected areas, and in other areas of Asia affected with mental health issues. A DNA database will continue to be compiled as a mission-critical tool in this effort.
#	'''Create programs and processes''' that systematically look at mental health issues such as PTSD from a [[public health]] perspective, and that incorporate research results into public health systems in a horizontal and coordinated manner.
#	'''Educate the general public and healthcare professionals about PTSD''' and stress-related mental health issues. This initiative involves educating medical professionals and policy makers, educating the public through awareness campaigns and targeted messaging, as well as coordinating information for clinical studies among research professionals.

The Tsunami PTSD Center proposes to accomplish this by working collaboratively with international health organizations, public health ministries, private businesses and academia within Asia and around the world. 

The initial partnership platform of the Office of the Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], Thailand Ministry of Public Health, Thailand Department of Mental Health, [[Chulalongkorn University]] and the [[TCELS|Thailand Center for Excellence in Life Sciences]] (TCELS) has provided a foundation and seed funding for this project. The Tsunami PTSD Center will actively raise funds from the public and private sectors in order to execute its mission.

Tumo is the creation of Inet Technologies co-founder Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva. The Simonian Foundation fully funds the center, its programs, and the adjacent [[Tumanyan Park]]. The Simonians are also directly involved in Tumo’s operations, with Sam lending his knowledge on technology and its economic impact and Sylva contributing to the center’s engagement with the environment and the program’s overall curriculum.
 
Marie Lou Papazian is CEO of the Simonian Educational Foundation and Managing Director of Tumo. In addition to her responsibilities in managing the center, she led the design and construction management of the center’s interior architecture and outdoor plaza. Prior to Tumo, Marie Lou co-founded the Education for Development Foundation in 2001, where she led the Three Pomegranates project linking Armenian students to their global peers through web-based educational activities. She has a graduate degree in Education from the Columbia Teachers College and serves as a member of the Information Technology Council of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
 
Tumo’s Board of Advisors is made up of professionals from North America and Armenia with industry experience across the center’s core focus areas. Members include [[Twitter|Twitter's]] Vice President of Platform Engineering [[Raffi Krikorian]], [[Pixar|Pixar’s]] [[Katherine Sarafian]], [[System of a down|System of a Down’s]] lead vocalist [[Serj Tankian]], and [[Industrial Toys|Industrial Toys’]] [[Alex Seropian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tumo.org/en/tumo/101-tumo-board-of-advisers/113-tumo-board-of-advisers|title=Tumo Board of Advisors|publisher=Tumo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning System==
[[File:Tumo Center for Creative Technologies (learning environment).jpg|(600)px|thumbnail|Full house season at Tumo]]
Students at Tumo advance through the center’s learning program based on their individual preferences and at their own pace. Within that flexible framework, they work towards very specific learning targets organized around four focus areas: animation, game development, web development, and digital media.

Tumo members are initially encouraged to get exposure to all four of Tumo’s focus areas. As they progress through the curriculum, completing a succession of increasingly challenging projects, members begin to concentrate on one of the four areas and work towards completion of a final project at the end of a two-year cycle.&lt;ref name="careerpath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2013/10/04/students-create-own-career-path-in-armenia/|title=Students Create Own Career Path in Armenia|last=Barsoumian|first=Nanore|publisher=The Armenian Weekly|date=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to instruction in its main focus areas, the Tumo curriculum covers a set of supporting technical, artistic and professional skills. These include computer programming, 3D modeling, 2D graphics, drawing, music, writing, online literacy and communication.

==Facilities==
[[File:Tumo Center for Creative Technologies (standard zoom).jpg|thumb|The Tumo Center is situated along the [[Hrazdan River]] gorge, adjacent to [[Tumanyan Park]]]]
Tumo’s flagship location in Yerevan occupies over 6,000 square meters on the first two floors of a modern building. This space is especially designed to fit the flexibility and transparency of the Tumo learning system. The building’s other four floors provide office space to technology and media companies that have the potential of becoming partners in Tumo’s educational mission. The rental income from these commercial tenants ensures the sustainability of the Tumo program.&lt;ref name="careerpath"/&gt;

Tumo is located in one of Yerevan’s largest green areas, Tumanyan Park, which is maintained and managed by Tumo. The park is equipped with a range of sports and recreational facilities, including a basketball court and a football field. The Tumo Plaza, acting as a link between the technology of the Tumo building and the natural setting of Tumanyan Park, is an innovative outdoor space made up of large, triangulated surfaces and packed with water features: a reflective pool, a large historic fountain equipped with hundreds of LED lights, and a playful pop-up fountain.

==Expansion==
In January 2013, with the support of the Central Bank of Armenia, Tumo launched its free of charge program in Dilijan, a resort town in northern Armenia. The center operates in the Knowledge for Development Center, the local library building reconstructed by the Central Bank.

Similar to the original Tumo, students in [[Dilijan]] are split across four focus areas (animation, digital media, video game development, and web development) and hands-on workshops taught by professional mentors. It is equipped with 29 workstations and currently serves more than 200 teenagers enrolled in the program who come from Dilijan and other adjacent rural areas.&lt;ref name="careerpath"/&gt;

Tumo partnered with the Armenian General Benevolent Union to open a branch in [[Gyumri]], the second largest city in Armenia. Following a fundraising initiative by Shant TV, Tumo opened its doors in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/128765/gyumri-tumo-center-to-open-spring-2015/.html|title=Gyumri Tumo Center to Open in Spring 2015|date=2014-11-14|publisher=Asbarez}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result of continued cooperation with the Armenian General Benevolent Union and support from Karabakh Telecom, the newest Tumo branch opened in [[Stepanakert]] in the [[Republic of Artsakh]] in September 2015.&lt;ref name=asbarez&gt;{{cite news|title=Tumo Center Opens in Stepanakert|url=http://asbarez.com/139378/tumo-center-opens-in-stepanakert/|agency=Asbarez|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenpress.am/eng/news/815236/stepanakert-tumo-center-is-planned-to-be-launched-in-september.html|title=Stepanakert "Tumo" Center is planned to be launched in September|date=2015-08-13|publisher=Armenpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British [[higher education]] system a ''Tutor'' is an officer of a college responsible for the pastoral care of a number of students in cognate disciplines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tcd.ie/Senior_Tutor/your-tutor/ |title=What is a Tutor? |accessdate=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as against a [[Director of Studies]] in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] who is responsible for the academic progress of a group of students in their own discipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/college-life/welfare/tutors |title=Tutors |accessdate=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with both Tutors and Directors of Studies answering to a Senior Tutor. 

==Senior Tutor==
In the [[University of Oxford]], the Senior Tutor is responsible, on a day-to-day basis, for all academic matters; welfare and pastoral issues; and for coordinating strategic planning of all aspects of the College’s academic activities and consulting with the Academic Committee about planned academic developments or substantive changes to current practice and policy. The Senior Tutor acts with the University President and other colleagues on fellowship appointments, applications and enquiries. The Senior Tutor also acts as Tutor for Admissions, and is responsible for deciding whether applicants should be admitted to membership of the College. Additionally, the Senior Tutor oversees the College’s Communications Department, Library, Archives and the administration of the Common Room.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/content/senior-tutor&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Tutorship scheme at the [[National University of Singapore]] is a talent development program for outstanding Singaporeans seeking an academic career. Majority of the Senior Tutors are expected to proceed onto the [[Tenure-Track]] appointment scheme after going through one or more of the development programmes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nus.edu.sg/careers/senior-tutorship-and-development-path.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Dschang''' is located in the town of [[Dschang]], [[West Region (Cameroon)|West]] [[Cameroon]], about 425 kilometers northwest of [[Yaoundé]]. It has its roots in three agricultural training schools, and evolved from an agricultural institution to a university in 1993.

In 1977, the [[Government of Cameroon]] authorized the creation of university centers at locations in Cameroon. The University Center at Dschang (UCD), was created by Presidential Decree No. 77/108 of April 28, 1977. In May 1978, ENSA (Ecole Nationale Supérieure Agronomique) in Yaounde and the Institute for Agricultural Technologies in Dschang were incorporated into the UCD. ENSA was to be transferred to Dschang as soon as possible. These two institutions were later merged into a single academic entity "The National Institute of Rural Development".&lt;ref name="Threshold Evaluation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corty|first1=Floyd|title=Threshold Evaluation|date=November 1986|publisher=USAID Cameroon|location=Yaounde, Cameroon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979-80, the US government, in exchanges with the Cameroon government, decided to provide assistance to UCD. In 1981, the [[University of Florida]] was selected on a competitive basis to design that assistance, through what was named the Agricultural Education Project.

In 1993, the UCD was transformed into the University of Dschang.

==History==
In 1979, the governments of Cameroon and the United States agreed to build a new academic institution in Cameroon. It was a time when the government of Cameroon had decided to place academic institutions in key corners of the country. Since there were already academic institutions in the commercial capital (Douala), the political capital (Yaoundé), in the north in Ngaundere, the new institutions were to be placed in the west (at Dschang) and in the south west (at Buea).

The US government committed $44 million USD (a mix of a grant and a loan) to fund the Dschang project, and the Cameroon government made a contribution of about $74 million USD that covered the salaries of Cameroonian staff and infrastructure. Belgium contributed about $8 million USD. The US contribution was split between two independent programs, one on infrastructure and the other on academic programs and training. The contract for the former was subcontracted to a construction company from Senegal. The latter was awarded to the [[University of Florida]] (UF) in 1982, with a small sub-contract to the [[Florida A&amp;M University]]. The UF team was led by Joe Busby who, in 1987, was succeeded by Charlie Eno who led the team until 1989, when he was succeeded by Peter Hartmann who ran the project until 1992.

The institute’s Director General was Rene Owona. (Later when the institute became a university center, the Director General title was upgraded to that of Rector). By 1990, Owona was pulled out of the UCD and appointed Minister of Commerce. Upon his departure, Owona was replaced by Professor Jean Mfoulu who was transferred from the Ministry, where he was Director for Higher Education. His primary base was the [[University of Yaoundé]], where he was a professor of sociology. Mfoulu held a PhD from [[Boston University]].

===Building the university in collaboration===
There was a four-year delay on building construction, imposing serious strains on all program components – student housing, library, administrative facilities, and research facilities.

Another source of strain was the way the training of faculty was programmed. During the duration of the project, over fifty Cameroonian professionals received graduate training.  Sending so many (almost half of UCD staff) for long-term studies put a huge burden on the remaining faculty and students. Only the strong collaborative spirit of the remaining faculty – American, Belgium, Cameroonian, and French - and the use to teaching assistants from external institutions saw UCD through the difficult time. Their overseas training completed, the returnees took up positions as faculty members.

===Upgrade===
By 1993, the UCD was upgraded to a full-fledged university and given the name, Dschang University.  It has over 800 academic staff and 14000 students.&lt;ref name="Dschang University"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Dschang|url=http://www.univ-dschang.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The University of Dschang is organized in five faculties and two institutes.

===Faculties===

* Faculté des Lettres et Sciences Humaines
* Faculté des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion
* Faculté des Sciences Juridiques et Politiques
* Faculté des Sciences
* Faculté d'agronomie et des sciences agricoles

==Regional role==
It soon became obvious that the institution was playing a regional role, particularly in training, but also in its research collaborations. Neighboring countries, like [[Chad]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], were sending students to Dschang. It was increasingly involved in regional training and collaborative research with international agencies like [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture|IITA]], [[ILRI]] (formerly ILCA), and [[ICIPE]]. Dschang’s bilingual capacity is a major asset.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7427">'''Wanda Brister''' (born August 12, 1957) is an American [[opera]]tic [[mezzo-soprano]] and voice teacher.

==Biography==
Born in [[Houma, Louisiana]], she has appeared throughout the Americas, Europe, and South America. She [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Loyola University of the South]], studying with Patricia Brooks Etienne (Havranek).

Two years later, she sang the Zia Principessa in ''[[Suor Angelica]]'' at Loyola. She holds degrees from the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] and the [[University of Louisiana, Lafayette]] where she worked with Patrick Shelby, a student of Andrew White and Sidney Dietch.

She served as an apprentice at the [[New Orleans Opera]] Association (where she made her professional debut in 1981 as Mistress Benson in ''[[Lakmé]]'') before attending the [[Academy of Vocal Arts]], Philadelphia, where she then was an apprentice with the [[Opera Company of Philadelphia]].

She has appeared as soloist at [[Carnegie Hall]] on seven occasions, and has sung under the batons of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], [[John Rutter]], [[John Nelson (conductor)]], [[Philippe Entremont]], Arthur Fagen, Chris Nance, [[Leopold Hager]], Gianfranco Masini, and [[Eve Queler]]. She has performed over 200 times with orchestra, including over 100 operatic performances.

From 1986 to 1988, she was a member of the quartet New York Vocal Arts Ensemble and continued to work with that ensemble on occasion through 1996. Together with this group she traveled throughout the United States, and appeared in concerts for the Government's Concert Agency (GOSConcert) in the former Soviet Union in 1992.

She continued to appear in recitals and concerts until it became difficult as the result of a lung disease [[sarcoidosis]]..
