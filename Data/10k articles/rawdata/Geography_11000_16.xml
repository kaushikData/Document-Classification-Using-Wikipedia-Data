      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2012">'''Alfred Hettner''' (August 6, 1859 in [[Dresden]] &amp;ndash; August 31, 1941 in [[Heidelberg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[geographer]].

He is known for his concept of [[chorology]], the study of places and regions, a concept that influenced both [[Carl O. Sauer]] and [[Richard Hartshorne]]. Apart from [[Europe]], his field work concentrated mainly on [[Colombia]], [[Chile]] and [[Russia]].

Alfred Hettner, who obtained his [[PhD]] from the [[University of Strasbourg]], was also a pupil of [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] and [[Friedrich Ratzel]] in [[Leipzig]]—where he obtained his [[habilitation]]. His book ''Europe'' was published in 1907. According to him, geography is a chorological science or it is a study of regions. Hettner rejected the view that geography could be either general or regional. Geography like other fields of learning, must deal in both the unique things (regional geography) and with universal (general geography), but the study of regions — especially in the form of his ''Länderkunde'' approach — is the main field of geography. Hettner supervised, among others, the PhDs of [[Oskar Schmieder]], [[Friedrich Metz]] and  [[Heinrich Schmitthenner]].

[[Image:1544 Battista Agnese Worldmap.jpg|thumb|Worldmap from the Portolan Atlas by Battista Agnese (1544)]] 
'''Battista Agnese''' (c. 1500 &amp;ndash; 1564) was a [[cartographer]] from the [[Republic of Genoa]], who worked in the [[Venetian Republic]].

In 1525 he prepared an early map of [[Muscovy]] that was based on the geographical data, narrated to [[Paolo Giovio]] by the Russian ambassador [[Dmitry Gerasimov]].

His workshop produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts between 1534 and 1564, more cheaply than [[Dieppe maps]] but still considered of fine craftsmanship. The charts normally included [[latitude]] but not [[longitude]], along with various decorative features.

One of Agnese's best-known works is an [[atlas]] of the world commissioned by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] for his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. Apparently produced around 1542, it  depicts [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]] correctly as a [[peninsula]] (60 years later cartographers started to show California as an island).

Agnese liked to incorporate the new geographical discoveries in his maps. For example, he included in his world map the route of the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]], and the route to [[Peru]] via the [[Isthmus of Panama]], where a lot of the Spanish gold was found.

[[File:Monarch on Latania.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Lantana]] used to attract [[monarch butterflies]]]]
'''Butterfly gardening''' is designed to create an environment that attracts [[butterflies]], as well as certain [[moths]]. Butterfly gardening is often  aimed at inviting those butterflies and moths to lay eggs as well. Because some plants are not fed upon by adult butterflies, the [[caterpillar]] [[host (biology)|host]] should also be planted for a bigger population of butterflies. Butterflies typically feed on the nectar of flowers, and there are hundreds of such [[plant]]s that may be planted to attract them, depending on the location, time of year, and other factors.  In addition to the planting of flowers that feed butterflies, other means of attracting them include constructing "butterfly houses", providing sand for puddling, water, and other resources or food items, including rotten fruit.

== Reasons for butterfly gardening ==

Some people only like to look at the butterflies, while others like to take pictures as well. Others try to help the butterfly population by planting native plants which rare or [[threatened]] butterflies feed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/03/20/f-monarch-butterfly.html |title=Why the monarch butterfly migration may be endangered |first=Daniel |last=Schwartz |date=2013-03-20 |publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Done correctly, butterfly gardening can increase the populations of butterflies.&lt;ref&gt;Glassberg, J. (1995). Enjoying butterflies more: attract butterflies to your backyard. Marietta, OH: Bird Watcher's Digest Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many butterflies are becoming less abundant as a result of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] destruction and fragmentation, and they do not feed on the plants regularly found in gardens. Others may also help in tagging [[monarch butterflies]], which helps scientists monitor the monarch population and their migratory routes. Butterflies also serve as flower pollinators and attracting the butterflies can also assist in the pollination of nearby plants. Typically, flowers of plants that attract butterflies also attract other insect pollinators. Butterfly gardening can also serve as an educational opportunity for children and can be a relatively safe way to introduce them to the natural world.

Butterflies have many [[predator]]s, including [[Mantidae|mantids]], [[wasp]]s, [[spider]]s, [[bird]]s, [[ant]]s, [[Hemiptera|true bugs]], and [[Fly|flies]] in the family [[Tachinidae]]. If these predators are becoming a problem, they can be controlled with traps rather than pesticides, which may also kill butterflies and their [[larva]]e. There are also diseases that afflict butterflies, such as bacteria in the genus ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', the [[nuclear polyhedrosis virus]], and ''[[Ophryocystis elektroscirrha]]'', which only infects [[queen (butterfly)|queen butterflies]] and [[monarch butterflies]].

In the absence of pesticides, [[aphid]]s and true bugs may infest plants. Some gardeners may wish to release [[Coccinellidae|ladybug]]s (ladybirds) and other [[biological pest control]] agents that do not harm butterflies in order to control aphids. However, the release of ladybugs is not a good idea in places such as the United States where the species that is released is generally the invasive [[Harmonia axyridis|Chinese ladybug]]. An alternative to this is to wait for local predatory insects to find the aphids. One technique some use to quicken this process if the infestation is particularly high is to spray the bushes with a mix of sugar and water, simulating aphid honeydew. This is known to attract [[lacewing]]s whose larva eat aphids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkzXCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;ots=7G2hWKH72d&amp;dq=sugar+water+spray+lacewing&amp;pg=PA322#v=onepage&amp;q=sugar+water+spray+lacewing&amp;f=false|title=Ecofriendly Pest Management for Food Security|first=|last=Omkar|date=3 February 2016|publisher=Academic Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another method of control is by spraying the plants with water, or rinsing plants with a mild dish detergent/water solution (although caterpillars should be relocated before suds are applied). Scented detergents are fine; those containing [[OxiClean]] should be avoided. The aphids will turn black within a day, and eventually fall off. One last technique is to plant a variety of different flowers, including ones that attract [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]] and parasitic [[Braconidae|Braconid wasps]], whose larvae kill pest species. Still, it is not advisable to kill all aphids, just to control them so that they are not detrimental to plants. Aphids still play a role in the environment by providing food for predators. There are even some caterpillars such as the [[Feniseca|harvester]] which only eat certain aphid species instead of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/bfly/harvester_butterfly.htm|title=harvester butterfly  – Feniseca tarquinius (Fabricius)|website=entnemdept.ufl.edu|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With small home butterfly gardens, it is common for the larvae to exhaust the food source before [[metamorphosis]] occurs. Gardeners of monarch butterflies can replace the expended milkweed with a slice of [[pumpkin]] or [[cucumber]], which can serve as a substitute source of food for monarch caterpillars in their final (fifth)  [[instar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Monika|last=Maeckle|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407192327/http://texasbutterflyranch.com/2014/04/11/milkweed-shortage-sparks-alternative-fuels-for-hungry-monarch-caterpillars/|archivedate=2015-04-07|url=http://texasbutterflyranch.com/2014/04/11/milkweed-shortage-sparks-alternative-fuels-for-hungry-monarch-caterpillars/|title=Milkweed Shortage Sparks "Alternative Fuels" for Hungry Monarch Caterpillars|date=2014-04-11|publisher=[Texas Butterfly Ranch]|accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting multiple plants in clumps can help lower the chances of running out of leaves.

Efforts to increase butterfly populations by establishing butterfly gardens require particular attention to the target species' food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate their food plants.  For example, in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarch butterflies prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (''[[Asclepias syriaca]]''), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh.  As monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when most ''Asclepias syriaca'' leaves are old and tough, the plant needs to be cut back in June – August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. In addition, ''Asclepias syriaca'' seed needs a period of cold treatment known as [[Stratification (seeds)|stratification]] before it will germinate.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite news|first=Adrian |last=Higgins |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YtLMg9eN?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/creating-a-rest-stop-for-the-monarch/2015/05/26/cd81a75c-ffcb-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html |archivedate=2015-05-29 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/creating-a-rest-stop-for-the-monarch/2015/05/26/cd81a75c-ffcb-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html |title=A gardener’s guide to saving the monarch |work=Home &amp; Garden |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2015-05-27 |accessdate=2015-05-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;(2) {{cite news|first=Adrian |last=Higgins |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YtXA7Qet?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/a-world-of-milkweeds/2015/05/26/43fba7d6-fe6c-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html |archivedate=2015-05-29 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/a-world-of-milkweeds/2015/05/26/43fba7d6-fe6c-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.htmll |title=7 milkweed varieties and where to find them |work=Home &amp; Garden |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2015-05-27 |accessdate=2015-05-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;(3) {{cite web|first=Tony |last=Gomez |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316044421/http://monarchbutterflygarden.net/milkweed-plant-seed-resources/asclepias-syriaca/ |archivedate=2015-03-16 |url=https://monarchbutterflygarden.net/milkweed-plant-seed-resources/asclepias-syriaca/ |title=Asclepias Syriaca: Common Milkweed for Monarch Caterpillars |publisher=[MonarchButterflyGarden.net] |accessdate=2015-05-29 }}&lt;br/&gt;(4) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327021750/http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_assy.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-27 |url=http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_assy.pdf |title=Common Milkweed: Asclepias syriaca L. |work=Plant Guide |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]: [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] |accessdate=2015-05-29 }}&lt;br/&gt;(5) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707205734/https://sites.google.com/site/gardeningforbutterflies/asclepias-syriaca |archivedate=2015-07-07 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/gardeningforbutterflies/asclepias-syriaca |title=Asclepias syriaca |work=butterfly gardening &amp; all things milkweed |publisher=Google |accessdate=2015-07-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;(6) {{cite web|title=Plant Milkweed for Monarchs |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zqrt6Jww?url=http://monarchjointventure.org/images/uploads/documents/MilkweedFactSheetFINAL.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-07 |url=http://monarchjointventure.org/images/uploads/documents/MilkweedFactSheetFINAL.pdf |work=MONARCH JOINT VENTURE Partnering across the U.S. to conserve the monarch migration |publisher=MONARCH JOINT VENTURE|accessdate=2015-07-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;br&gt;(6) {{cite web|last=Abugattas|first=Alonzo|url=http://capitalnaturalist.blogspot.com/2017/01/monarch-way-stations.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605221624/http://capitalnaturalist.blogspot.com/2017/01/monarch-way-stations.html|archivedate=2017-06-05|accessdate=2017-06-05|title=Monarch Way Stations|work=Capital Naturalist|date=2017-01-03|via=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Butterfly-attracting plants ==

Research should be conducted as to what species are prevalent in your area, and what plants they prefer to nectar on.  Depending on your [[Hardiness zone|zone]], some butterfly attracting plants include: [[purple cone flower]]s (''Echinacea purpurea''), [[yellow cone flower]]s, [[sunflower]]s, [[marigold (common)|marigold]]s, [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]], [[Cosmos (plant)|cosmos]], [[salvia]]s, some [[lily|lilies]], [[Aster (genus)|aster]]s, [[coreopsis]], [[Bellis|daisies]], [[verbena]]s, [[lantana]]s, [[Liatris|liastris]], [[milkweed]] (especially for the monarch butterfly, whose caterpillars feed solely on this plant), the [[Buddleia|butterfly bush]] (also called [[buddleia]]), [[zinnia]]s, [[pentas]], [[Stachytarpheta|porterweed]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoid cultivars of plants that have "double flowers" (more petals which block the center) as these can be difficult for butterflies to access. Care should also be taken to research a species, to make sure it is not invasive in your region.

In addition to expanding the number of species seen in your yard, provide host plants that feed the caterpillars. This is just as important as planting flower beds with nectar-rich blooms.&lt;ref&gt;Dole, C.H. (Ed.).(2007). The butterfly gardener's guide. Brooklyn: Brooklyn Botanic Garden.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cirque''' (French, from the Latin word ''circus'') is an [[amphitheatre]]-like [[valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] [[erosion]]. Alternative names for this landform are '''corrie''' (from [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|coire}}, meaning a pot  or [[cauldron]]) and '''cwm''' ({{langnf||Welsh|"valley"}}, {{IPA-cy|kʊm|pron}}). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.

The concave shape of a glacial cirque is open on the downhill side, while the cupped section is generally steep. Cliff-like slopes, down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge, form the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl-shaped as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens: hence it experiences somewhat greater erosion forces, and is most often [[Overdeepening|overdeepened]] below the level of the cirque's low-side outlet (stage) and its down slope (backstage) valley. If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting, the floor of the cirque most often forms a [[Tarn (lake)|tarn]] (small lake) behind a dam which marks the downstream limit of the glacial overdeepening: the dam itself can be composed of [[moraine]], [[glacial till]], or a lip of the underlying [[bedrock]].&lt;ref name=Knight2009 /&gt;

The fluvial cirque or [[makhtesh]], found in [[karst]] landscapes, is formed by intermittent river flow cutting through layers of limestone and chalk leaving sheer cliffs. A common feature for all [[fluvial]]-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.

==Formation==

===Glacial-erosion cirque formation===
Glacial cirques are found amongst mountain ranges throughout the world; 'classic' cirques are typically about one kilometer long and one kilometer wide. Situated high on a mountainside near the [[firn line]], they are typically partially surrounded on three sides by steep [[cliff]]s. The highest cliff often is called a [[headwall]]. The fourth side forms the ''lip'', ''threshold'' or ''sill'',&lt;ref name="Chorley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=I.S.|title=Introduction to fluvial processes|editor=Chorley R.J. &amp;  Carson M.A.|publisher=Routledge|year=1971|series=University paperbacks|volume=407|page=218|chapter=8.11(i) The geomorphology and Morphometry of Glacial and Nival Areas|isbn=978-0-416-68820-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_ENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=cirque+geomorphology&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=cirque%20geomorphology&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the side at which the glacier flowed away from the cirque. Many glacial cirques contain [[tarn (lake)|tarns]] dammed by either till (debris) or a bedrock threshold.  When enough snow accumulates it can flow out the opening of the bowl and form valley glaciers which may be several kilometers long.

Cirques form in conditions which are favorable; in the northern hemisphere the conditions include the north-east slope where they are protected from the majority of the sun’s energy and from the prevailing winds. These areas are sheltered from heat, encouraging the accumulation of snow; if the accumulation of snow increases, the snow turns into glacial ice. The process of [[nivation]] follows, whereby a hollow in a slope may be enlarged by [[ice segregation]] weathering and glacial erosion. Ice segregation erodes the rock vertical rock face and causes it to disintegrate, which may result in an avalanche bringing down more snow and rock to add to the growing glacier.&lt;ref name=Sanders2012 /&gt; Eventually, this hollow may become large enough that glacial erosion intensifies. The enlarging of this open ended concavity creates a larger leeward deposition zone, furthering the process of glaciation. Debris (or till) in the ice also may abrade (glacial [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]) the bed surface; should ice move down a slope it would have a ‘sandpaper effect’ on the [[bedrock]] beneath, on which it scrapes.

[[Image:Lowercurtis.jpg|thumb|The Lower Curtis Glacier in [[North Cascades National Park]] is a well-developed [[cirque glacier]]; if the glacier continues to retreat and melt away, a lake may form in the basin]]

Eventually, the hollow may become a large [[Bowl (vessel)|bowl]] shape in the side of the mountain, with the headwall being weathered by ice segregation, and as well as being eroded by [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]]. The basin will become deeper as it continues to be eroded by ice segregation and abrasion.&lt;ref name=Sanders2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rempel2001 /&gt; Should ice segregation, plucking and abrasion continue, the dimensions of the cirque will increase, but the proportion of the landform would remain roughly the same. A [[bergschrund]] forms when the movement of the glacier separates the moving ice from the stationary ice forming a crevasse. The method of erosion of the headwall lying between the surface of the glacier and the cirque’s floor has been attributed to freeze-thaw mechanisms. The temperature within the bergschrund changes very little, however, studies have shown that ice segregation (frost shattering) may happen with only small changes in temperature. Water that flows into the bergschrund can be cooled to freezing temperatures by the surrounding ice allowing freeze-thaw mechanisms to occur.

[[File:Lake Seal Mt Field NP edit.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Seal, [[Mt. Field National Park]], [[Tasmania]] – a cirque formed from a glacier is visible in the walls around Lake Seal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/file.aspx?id=6757|title=Mt Field National Park: Landforms, Flora and Fauna|publisher=Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

If two adjacent cirques erode toward one another, an [[arête]], or steep sided ridge, forms. When three or more cirques erode toward one another, a [[pyramidal peak]] is created. In some cases, this peak will be made accessible by one or more arêtes. The [[Matterhorn]] in the European [[Alps]] is an example of such a peak.

Where cirques form one behind the other, a [[cirque stairway]] results as at the [[Zastler Loch]] in the [[Black Forest]].

As glaciers can only originate above the snowline, studying the location of present-day cirques provides information on past glaciation patterns and on climate change.&lt;ref name=Barr2015 /&gt;

Although a less common usage,{{refn|This concern is not new, see Evans, I.S. &amp; N. Cox, 1974: ''Geomorphometry and the operational definition of cirques,'' Area. Institute of British Geographers, 6: 150–53 regarding term usage.|group="nb"}} the term cirque is also used for amphitheatre-shaped, fluvial-erosion features. For example, an approximately {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} anticlinal erosion cirque is at {{coord|30|35|N|34|45|E|name=Negev anticlinal erosion cirque}} on the southern boundary of the [[Negev|Negev highlands]]. This erosional cirque or ''[[makhtesh]]'' was formed by intermittent river flow in the [[Makhtesh Ramon]] cutting through layers of limestone and chalk, resulting in cirque walls with a sheer {{convert|200|m|ft}} drop.&lt;ref name=Ward2000 /&gt; The [[Cirque du Bout du Monde (Côte d'Or)|Cirque du Bout du Monde]] is another such a feature, created in [[karst]] terraine in the [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy region]] of the department of [[Côte-d'Or]] in [[France]].

Yet another type of fluvial erosion formed cirque is found on [[Réunion|Réunion island]], which includes the tallest volcanic structure in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The island consists of an active shield-volcano ([[Piton de la Fournaise]]) and an extinct, deeply eroded volcano ([[Piton des Neiges]]). Three cirques have eroded there in a sequence of agglomerated, fragmented rock and volcanic breccia associated with pillow-lavas overlain by more coherent, solid lavas.&lt;ref name=Upton1969 /&gt;

A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.

Haiti is divided administratively into ten departments, which are further subdivided into 42 [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissements]], 145 [[List of communes of Haiti|communes]], and 571 [[communal section]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/148647/Creation-de-cinq-nouvelles-communes-par-decret-presidentiel |title=Création de cinq nouvelles communes par décret présidentiel |editor=Olivier, Louis-Joseph |date=14 August 2015 |publisher=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-14858-haiti-politic-5-new-communes-in-haiti.html |title=Haïti - Politique : 5 nouvelles communes en Haïti |editor=Press |date=16 August 2015 |publisher=Haiti Libre |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haiti-reference.com/pages/plan/geographie-et-tourisme/divisions-territoriales/ |title=7300.- Divisions territoriales |date=17 August 2015 |publisher=Haiti-Référence |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, there was a proposal by the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]] to increase the number of departments from 10 to 14 —perhaps as high as 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duval|first1=Frantz|authorlink1=Frantz Duval|title=Le nouvel ordre géographique et administratif d’Haïti|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/136410/Le-nouvel-ordre-geographique-et-administratif-dHaiti.html|publisher=[[Le Nouvelliste (Haiti)|Le Nouvelliste]]|accessdate=30 September 2014|language=French|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
Each [[departement]] has a [[departmental council]] (''conseil départemental'') compound of three members elected by the departmental assembly for a 4-year [[Term of office|term]]. The departmental council is led by a [[president]] (''président''). The council is the executive organ of the department.
 	
Each department has a [[departmental assembly]] who assists the council in its work. The departmental assembly is the deliberative organ of the department. The members of the departmental assembly are also elected for 4 years. The departmental assembly is led by a president.

==History==
Three Departments have roots in the former French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], namely: the [[Nord (Haitian department)|Nord]], [[Sud (department)|Sud]], and [[Ouest (department)|Ouest]]. In 1801, under Governor-General [[Toussaint Louverture]], the "provinces," became known as ''departments''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGMQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q |title=Estadística, Volume 8, Issues 26-29 |editor=Press |page=207 |year=1950 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NrP8_QfmbtQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Literary and Sociopolitical Writings of the Black Diaspora in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries |editor= Kersuze, Simeon-Jones |page=16 |year=2010 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]] was created and in 1844, [[Nord-Ouest (department)|Nord-Ouest]], both derived out of the Nord and Ouest departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haiticci.undg.org/uploads/08_Organisation%20Territoriale%20des%20Collectivites.pdf |title=Organisation Territoriale des Collectivités |date=March 2002 |editor=Press |publisher=Commission nationale a la reforme administrative (CNRA) |accessdate=6 June 2017}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RbzX4PjxtgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Haiti |editor=Hall, Michael R. |page=78 |year=2012 |isbn=9780810878105 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 during the reign of [[François Duvalier|Duvalier]], four new departments were created out of a territorial redistribution. These departments were: [[Centre (department)|Centre]], [[Grand'Anse (department)|Grand'Anse]], [[Nord-Ouest (department)|Nord-Ouest]] and [[Sud-Est (department)|Sud-Est]]. In 2003, a tenth department was created out of Grand'Anse, called [[Nippes]].&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

In the 1990s, before the creation of Nippes, the "10th Department" was a phrase commonly used in regards to the [[Haitian diaspora]]. As of the 21st century, it became known as the "11th."&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33014">The '''Environmental Vulnerability Index''' ('''EVI''') is a [[measurement]] devised by the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC), the [[United Nations Environment Program]] and others&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sopac.org/index.php/environmental-vulnerability-index Environmental Vulnerability Index] ''Secretariat of the Pacific Community''. Retrieved 4 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; to characterize the relative severity of various types of [[environmental issue]]s suffered by 243 enumerated individual [[nation]]s and other geographies (such as Antarctica). The results of the EVI are used to focus on planned solutions to negative pressures on the environment, whilst promoting sustainability.

== Development == 
The beginning stages of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) were developed to be appropriate for [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDs), this theoretical idea at the time was presented by the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) on February 4, 1999.  The ideas and plans for The Environmental Vulnerability Index were worked on further with the creation of a (EVI) Think Tank that took place from September 7 – September 10, 1999 in Pacific Harbour, Fiji. Expanding the (EVI) to other SIDS was aided by a meeting of experts convened in Malta on November 29 – December 3, 1999 by (SOPAC) and the Foundation for International Studies (of the University of Malta’s Islands and Small States Institute) with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP).

During the second phase of the development, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) was tested in five different countries. A workshop was made to expand the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index to a demonstrative set of countries from around the world. The workshop was hosted by UNEP in Geneva, Switzerland on August 27-August 29, 2001.  Continuation of work and development on The Environmental Vulnerability Index, lead to a presentation of the first functional results with the Demonstration EVI.

== Calculation ==
To be able to calculate an Environmental Vulnerability Index it requires the compilation of relevant environmental vulnerability data for the 50 indicators. Once compiled then this data must be used to calculate each indicator. As the indicators are heterogeneous, include variables for which responses are numerical, qualitative and on different scales (linear, non-linear, or with different ranges) they are mapped onto a 1–7 vulnerability scale. Where data is not available, no value is given for the indicator and the denominator of the average adjusted down by one value. Where an indicator is considered 'non-applicable' in a country (such as volcanic eruptions in Tuvalu which has no volcanoes), the lowest vulnerability score of 1 is attributed to that indicator. The vulnerability scores for each indicator are then accumulated either into categories or sub-indices and the average calculated. An overall average of all indicators is calculated to generate the country EVI. The EVI is accumulated into three sub-indices: Hazards, Resistance, Damage

The 50 EVI indicators are also divided up in the issue categories for use as required: Climate change, Biodiversity, Water, Agriculture and fisheries, Human health aspects, Desertification, and Exposure to Natural Disasters.

'''Esanland''' ([[Esan language|Esan:]] ''Otọesan''), or the '''Edo Central Senatorial District''' is a [[cultural region]] and [[Government of Nigeria|senatorial district]] located in south-south Nigeria. It is composed of five [[Local Government Areas]] in [[Edo State]]. Esanland lies west of the banks of the [[Niger River]]. It is bordered by [[Kogi State]], [[Delta State]], Edo South Senatorial District, and Edo North Senatorial District. Esanland covers about 2,800 square kilometers and is home to over half a million people. The  [[Esan people]] and culture of Esanland are generally homogenous.

Esanland has been inhabited since the late [[Iron Age]], by hunter-gatherers from the [[Nok culture]]. The hunter gatherers formed a society in northern Esanland until the 12th century. In the 15th century, indigenes from the Great Benin Empire moved to Esanland and renewed Edo-Esan cultural bonds as the Benin were the Royal blood and Emperor controlling the Southern Hemisphere. Esan nations often worked either in tandem or subordination towards the Benin Empire, sending soldiers to the Benin army and treating their rulers as dukes to the Oba of Benin.

Trade  with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] brought modern innovations such as [[Dane gun]]s and [[spoons]], and new crops.

Independent rule in Esanland continued into the 1800s, until [[United Kingdom|the British]] claimed the entire region for the [[Royal Niger Company]] as part of the colony [[Nigeria]]. Local opposition to the conquest was vocal, and ''enijie'' such as King [[Ogbidi Okojie]] of Uromi banded together their soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt to fight British rule. After the British takeover, independence movements sprung up. Leaders in Esanland such as [[Anthony Enahoro]] successfully campaigned for independence, which was granted to the whole of Nigeria. Since independence, Esanland has suffered from poor infrastructure and an attempted takeover in the [[Nigerian Civil War]] by [[Biafra]].

==Etymology==
Esanland originates from the term ''E san fia'' or ''they have fled'' in Edo language, referring to the flight of refugees from the [[Benin Empire]] to the surrounding forest that make up the original Esans.

==History==
According to archaeological and linguistic evidence, humans have resided in the savannah-forest ecotone in Esanland for at least 3000 years.&lt;ref name=HAIN&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Archaeology in Nigeria |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Historical_Archaeology_in_Nigeria.html?id=yYGmzjnR3vsC |editor=Wesler, Kit W. |date=1998 |location=Asmara, Trenton |publisher=Africa World Press |pages=178–180 |isbn=978-0-865-43610-7 |access-date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people were likely associated with the [[Nok culture|Nok people]] and came from the savannahs in the north to the southern forests. To this day, northern Esan dialects have more in common with Northern Edo languages such as [[Etsako language|Etsako]] and [[Emai language|Owan]] than southern Esan dialects do, which happen to be closely related with [[Edo language|Edo]]. These "proto-Edoid" peoples grew yam, oil palm and vegetables, but also hunted and gathered.

Starting from 500 AD to 750 AD, these hunter-gatherers started to colonize the savannah-forest ecosystem of Esanland and the forest ecosystem of the Benin Empire.&lt;ref name=HAIN /&gt; They created a pre-Esan, pre-Edo society that built advanced structures such as moats and walls around family properties. These enclosures were, at maximum, three to five kilometers in diameter, and demarcated residential and agricultural property. Those properties enlarged to become villages, and by 800 AD, these village coalesced to form kingdoms with hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Lane|first1=Paul |last2=Mitchell |first2=Peter |date=2013 |title=The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fY0eAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Handbook+of+African+Archaeology#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Oxford%20Handbook%20of%20African%20Archaeology&amp;f=false|location=Oxford, UK. |publisher=Oxford University|pages=861–863|isbn=978-0-199-56988-5|access-date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern-day digs in the region have found that these walls were situated  in the eastern Benin Empire and northern Esanland. Settlements were close to permanent springs on the northern plateau, but never next to intermittent springs.

Esanland's culture, language and growth were majorly influenced by the mass exoduses to Esan territory from all adjacent polities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Rolle |first=Nicholas |title=Linguistic evidence for heterogeneous origins of modern Esan language and identity |url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~nicholasrolle/Rolle%20-%202013.04.19%20-%20CAS%20Research%20Forum%20-%20Esan%20History%20-%20Audience.pdf |date=19 April 2013|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|access-date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities on Esanland's southern and eastern fringes (Ewohimi, Ewatto, Ekpon, Amahor) were heavily populated by [[Igbo people|Igbos]] and [[Igala people|Igalas]] (into Uroh);{{sfn|Rolle|2013}} from the north came the [[Emai people|Emai]] into Ukhun, Idoa, and Amahor and the [[Etsako people|Etsako]] into Irrua);{{sfn|Rolle|2013}} and from the south came the [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] (into Ekpon) and [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] (into Ujiogba).{{sfn|Rolle|2013}}

The biggest influence on Esanland came from the Benin Empire. In 1460, [[Oba Ewuare]] passed laws of mourning that prohibited sexual intercourse, bathing, drumming, dancing, and cooking. These laws proved too restrictive for many citizens, and these citizens fled the kingdom to Esanland. This exodus shaped Esanland's modern cultural identity and gave rise to the term "Esan," or "refugee." Oral tradition has heavily supported this theory. Prominent Esan  and Edo historians have collected stories about this migration.&lt;ref name=EWC /&gt;{{sfn|Rolle|2013}}

=== Pre-colonization ===

Esan kingdoms had a varying degree of autonomy, but were ultimately controlled by the Benin Empire.  The Oba approved the enijie of Esanland, and Esan kingdoms paid tribute to Benin. Yet, several wars between Esan kingdoms and Benin were recorded. This was due to the Oba, at ascension on the throne, sending white chalk to the Esans as a term of friendship. If the chalk was rejected, then the Oba would try to invade Esanland. The varying political stabilities of Benin and the Esan kingdoms also led to warfare. Such warfare was so common that there is no recorded history of peace between all of the Esan kingdoms and Benin.

Esanland was extensively involved in world trade. Benin's sovereignty over Esanland enabled it to send long-distant traders, or ''ekhen.'' ''Ekhen'' procured cloth, ivory, peppers and resources. Portugal primarily received blue cloth, or ''ukpon ododo'' from Esanland in exchange for tobacco, brandy, mirror, beads, and firearms, primarily through ''ekhen''.

During the 16th century, the Uzea War occurred. This war was between the Uromi Kingdom and the Benin Kingdom.  The war lasted from 1502 to 1503, and resulted from a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba of Uromi. The war ended at the town of Uzea, when both leaders were killed. However, in peaceful times Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and the sacking of Akure in 1823.

During the nineteenth century, northern Esanland was continually attacked and sacked by the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Nupe people]] in the hunt for slaves and converts to Islam, having previously taken over the [[Kukuruku people]]s’ lands. Many Esan kingdoms from the south helped in the battle to fend off the Nupes. The battles came into the Esans’ favor; several Nupe and [[Etsako people|Etsako]] warriors were brought into Esan cities where their posterity reside today. The nineteenth century brought increasing influence of Europe on Esanland, as the English demanded palm-products.

=== Esan warfare and colonization  ===
[[File:KingOgbidiOkojie.JPG|thumb|[[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]] and his entourage.]]
In 1897, the British sacked the Benin Empire, effectively leaving the Esans free from British rule. In 1899, the British led an invasion into the Esan kingdoms that lasted for seven years. Esanland chose to keep fighting the British even if its neighbors fell. Fallen Benin chiefs like Ologbosere and Ebohon were still resistant to British rule inadvertently guarded Esan soil from the west, by establishing military camps and blocking roads. This lasted from 1897 to April 22. 1899, where Ologbosere surrendered at the border village of Okemue.

The first kingdom to be attacked by the British was the Kingdom of Ekpon. Ekpon launched a fierce resistance against the British invasion on April 22, which nearly destroyed the kingdom. After the near genocide of Esans at Ekpon, the kingdom of Ekpon led an ambush of the British camp at Okueme, on April 29. This led British forces to retreat, consolidate their power, and kill Ologbosere in May. Subsequent attempts by the British failed as well: conquests into Irrua, for example, led to an adoption of a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategy followed by a retreat; this method was so successful that other Esan kingdoms adopted it and the British did not invade Esanland until 1901.

On March 16, 1901, the Kingdom of Uromi, headed by the old, yet intelligent Onojie Okolo, was attacked by the British. The Uromi resistance, led by [[Ogbidi Okojie|Prince Okojie]], was swift and employed guerrilla warfare. After a short time, British forces overtook the village Amedeokhian, where Okolo was stationed, and murdered him. This angered Prince Okojie so much that he killed the Captain of the British troops before reinforcements were brought in. The British then realized that Uromi was nigh impenetrable without native help, and contact local sympathizers such as Onokpogua, the Ezomo of Uromi. This succeeded in napping Prince Okojie out of the forest and deported to the British offices at Calabar.

This process was duplicated in most of the kingdoms that fought with Britain: guerilla warfare was excessively used by the Esans, resulting in prolonged battle time in spite of inferior weapons, and reinforcements from Benin City for the British. Even when villages were conquered, internal resistance was fierce: continued geurilla warfare in Uromi forced the British to release Prince Okojie. However, excessive cruelty on Britain's part razed many villages and displaced many people. Finally, in 1906, Esanland submitted to British rule, and the thirty-four kingdoms became the Ishan Division.

==Politics and government==

Esan kingdoms were structured in a way that ''eguares'', or cities, were headed by ''enijies'', singular ''onojie''. ''Eguares'' were subdivided into villages, which were subdivided into ''idumu'' or quarters. Villages and ''idumu'' are headed by the oldest man in said village/''idumu'', the ''edionwele'' (plural ''odionwere'').

==Geography==
Esanland has an area of {{convert|2814.347|km2}}. It is dominated by the Ishan-Asaba Plateau in Midwestern Nigeria. This plateau is the source of many streams in the region.

[[India]] has an extensive network of '''inland waterways''' in the form of [[rivers]], [[canals]], [[backwater (river)|backwater]]s and [[stream|creeks]]. The total navigable length is {{convert|14,500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, out of which about {{convert|5200|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the river and {{convert|4000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of canals can be used by mechanised crafts. Freight transport by waterways is highly under-utilised in India compared to other large countries and geographic areas like the [[United States]], [[China]] and the [[European Union]]. The total cargo moved (in tonne kilometres) by inland waterways was 0.1 percent of the total inland traffic in India, compared to the 21 percent figure for the United States. Cargo transport in an organised manner is confined to a few waterways in [[Goa]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] and [[Kerala]].

The cost of [[Water-transport|water transport]] in India is roughly {{INRConvert|0.5|lk=on}} a kilometre, as compared to {{INRConvert|1}} by [[Indian Railways|railways]] and {{INRConvert|1.5}} by roads.&lt;ref name="inlandWaterwaysET"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/maruti-suzuki-planning-to-transport-vehicles-via-inland-waterways/articleshow/53382077.cms |title=Maruti Suzuki planning to transport vehicles via inland waterways |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=25 July 2016 |work=news |publisher=Economic Times |author= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water transport is receiving significant attention in recent times{{Clarify timeframe|date=February 2018}} as logistics costs in India are some of the highest among major countries{{Definition needed|date=February 2018}}—it is 18 percent in India versus 8-10 percent in China and 10-12 percent in the European Union.&lt;ref name="etNW-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/government-to-spend-rs-50000-crore-on-river-front-development-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/53668578.cms |title=Government to spend Rs 50,000 crore on river front development: Nitin Gadkari |date=12 August 2016 |accessdate=12 August 2016 |work=news |publisher=The Economic Times |author=PTI |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the share of waterways in inland transport, [[Modi government]] got the [[National Waterways Act, 2016]] passed which proposed 106 additional National Waterways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazette Notification|url=http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/169056.pdf|publisher=Gazette of India|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inland waterways in India consist of the [[Ganges]]-[[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi-Hooghly]] rivers, the [[Brahmaputra]], the Barak river, the rivers in Goa, the backwaters in Kerala, inland waters in [[Mumbai]] and the deltaic regions of the [[Godavari]]-[[Krishna]] rivers.

An '''interfluve''' is a narrow, elongated and plateau-like or [[ridge]]-like landform between two [[valley]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Neef]] (ed.): ''Riedel''. In: Ders.: ''Das Gesicht der Erde'' (Taschenbuch der physischen Geographie). [[Verlag Harri Deutsch]], Frankfurt/M, 1970, p. 774.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leser&gt;Leser, Hartmut, ed. (2005). ''Wörterbuch Allgemeine Geographie'', 13th ed., dtv, Munich, p. 766, {{ISBN|978-3-423-03422-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whittow, more generally, defines an interfluve as an area of higher ground between two rivers in the same drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 275. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
These landforms are created by [[earth flow]] ("[[solifluction]]"). They can also be former [[river terrace]]s that are subsequently bisected by [[fluvial erosion]]. In cases where there is a deposit of younger sedimentary beds ([[loess]], [[colluvium]]) the interfluves have a rounder and less rugged appearance. A consequence of interfluve formation is the so-called "interfluvial landscape."&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt;

'''International Rivers''' is a [[non-profit]], [[non-governmental]], [[Environmentalism|environmental]] and [[human rights]] organization. Founded in 1985 by social and environmental activists, International Rivers works with policy and financial analysts, scientists, journalists, [[Sustainable development|development]] specialists, local citizens, and volunteers to combat destructive [[dams]] and their legacies in over 60 countries.

International Rivers has staff in [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], and the United States. The staff has expertise in a range of issues and uses research, education, and [[Interest group|advocacy]] to achieve the organization's mission.{{CN|date=April 2018}}

==About==
International Rivers' stated aims are to protect [[rivers]] and defend the rights of communities that depend on them. It is active against the development model with which dams are associated, which International Rivers holds to be unsustainable. It promotes alternative solutions for meeting water, [[Energy (society)|energy]] and [[Flood#Flood defences, planning and management|flood-management]] needs. The organization is dedicated to giving dam-affected people the tools to participate in the development of local lands in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]].

By facilitating international [[grassroots]] organizing and informed participation, International Rivers seeks to change the terms of the debate over river development. The group works with its numerous partners to advocate for social reparations, [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and decommissioning of existing dams. International Rivers states that it works to clarify the traditionally top-down decision-making of large infrastructure projects. It also argues against industry's presentation of [[hydropower]] regards [[climate change]], making clear that [[reservoirs]] often produce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that further impact on the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lima|first1=Ivan B T|last2=Ramos|first2=Fernando M|last3=Bambace|first3=Luis A W|last4=Rosa|first4=Reinaldo R|title=Methane Emissions from Large Dams as Renewable Energy Resources: A Developing Nation Perspective|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|date=February 2008|volume=13|issue=2|pages=193–206|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11027-007-9086-5|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
International Rivers has undertaken a two-pronged approach to analyzing and promoting viable water and energy solutions. Combining its efforts to change global policy with campaigning on specific key projects, International Rivers simultaneously addresses the root causes and localized consequences of destructive dam development. Their campaigns throughout Africa, China, [[Latin America]], [[South Asia]]  and [[Southeast Asia]] focus on the intersection of dams and climate change, reforming the policies and practices of international financial institutions, and promoting water and energy solutions that recognize human rights and environmental sustainability.

==Contributions==
Among its accomplishments, International Rivers counts its integral involvement with the formation of the [[World Commission on Dams]] as one of its most important contributions.  The commission was a global, multi-stakeholder body initiated in 1997 by the [[World Bank]] and the [[World Conservation Union]], formed in response to growing opposition to dams. During its two-year lifetime, the WCD conducted the most exhaustive study of dams done to date, ultimately evaluating over 1,000 dams in 79 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Commission on Dams Framework - A Brief Introduction|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-world-commission-on-dams-framework-a-brief-introduction-2654|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its published final report, the WCD concluded that although "dams have made an important and significant contribution to human development, and benefits derived from them have been considerable... in too many cases an unacceptable and often unnecessary price has been paid to secure those benefits, especially in social and environmental terms, by people displaced, by communities downstream, by taxpayers and by the [[natural environment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ADams_and_development.pdf&amp;page=1 WCD final report]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the organization's inception, worldwide construction of dams has decreased by half, and universal recognition of the consequences of hydropower continues to increase.&lt;!--Is IR claiming credit for this? If so, give a convincing cite.--&gt;

International Rivers publishes a journal, ''World Rivers Review'', focused on addressing the state of various dam projects, ecosystems, and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Rivers Review – December 2014: Focus on the Mekong|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/node/8456|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also publishes an annual report on a variety of dam-related subjects.&lt;ref name=AR-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2016|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/ir_annual_report_2016_fa.pdf|website=International Rivers|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Itinerarium Burdigalense''''' ("Bordeaux Itinerary") — also known as the ''Itinerarium Hierosolymitanum'' ("Jerusalem Itinerary") — is the oldest known Christian ''[[itinerarium]]''. It was written by the "Pilgrim of Bordeaux", an anonymous pilgrim from Burdigala (present-day [[Bordeaux]], France).&lt;ref&gt;The basic edition is that edited by P. Geyer and O. Kuntz, Brepols, 1965; general context of early [[Christian pilgrimage]] is provided by E.D. Hunt, ''Holy Land Pilgrimage in the Late Roman Empire AD 312-460'' 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  It recounts the writer's journey to the [[Holy Land]] in the years 333 and 334&lt;ref&gt;"We travelled in the Consulate of Dalmatius and Zenophilus, leaving Chalcedonia on 30 May and returned to Constantinople on 26 December in the same Consulate." Quoted in Jaś Elsner, "The Itinerarium Burdigalense: Politics and Salvation in the Geography of Constantine's Empire", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''90''' (2000:181-195) p. 183. On the return journey the pilgrim took another route in order to see Rome. The return trip from Milan to Bordeaux is not repeated.&lt;/ref&gt; as he traveled by land through northern [[Italy]] and the [[Danube]] valley to [[Constantinople]], then through [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] to [[Jerusalem]], and then back by way of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Otranto]], [[Rome]], and [[Milan]].  

==Interpretation and analysis==
According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'': {{quote|text=The report of his journey outside [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] is little more than a dry enumeration of the cities through which he passed, and of the places where he stopped or changed horses, with their respective distances. For the Holy Land he also briefly notes the important events which he believes to be connected with the various places. In this he falls into some strange blunders, as when, for instance, he places the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] on [[Mount of Olives|Mount Olivet]]. Such errors, however, are also found in subsequent writers. His description of Jerusalem, though short, contains information of great value for the topography of the city.}}

Another reader, [[Jaś Elsner]], notes that, a brief twenty-one years after [[Constantine I|Constantine]] institutionalized Christianity, "the [[Holy Land]] to which the pilgrim went had to be entirely reinvented in those years, since its main site—ancient Jerusalem—had been sacked under the [[Emperor Hadrian]] and refounded as [[Aelia Capitolina]]." Elsner found to his surprise "how swiftly a Christian author was willing implicitly to re-arrange and redefine deeply entrenched institutional norms, while none the less writing on an entirely traditional model [i.e., the established Greco-Roman genre of [[travel writing]]]."&lt;ref&gt;Elsner 2000:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The compiler of the itinerary was aware at each boundary of crossing from one [[Roman province]] to the next, and distinguished carefully between each change of horses (''mutatio'') and a stopover place (''[[mansio]]''), and the differences between the simplest cluster of habitations (''[[vicus]]'') and the fortress (''[[castellum]]'') or city (''[[civitas]]''). The segments of the journey are summarised; they are delineated by major cities, with major summaries at Rome and Milan, long-established centers of culture and administration, and Constantinople, refounded by Constantine only three years previously, and the "non-city"&lt;ref&gt;"...the non-city of Jerusalem, which until Constantine's accession was nothing but a provincial backwater, its Jewish and Christian sites utterly destroyed in its Hadrianic refounding." (Elsner 2000:189).&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem.  

Glenn Bowman engaged in a close textual analysis of the ''Itinerarium''; he argues that in fact it is a carefully structured work relating profoundly to Old and New Biblical dispensations via the medium of water and baptism imagery.&lt;ref&gt; Bowman, "Mapping History's Redemption: Eschatology and Topography in the Itinerarium Burdigalense' in ''Jerusalem: its Sanctity and Centrality to Judaism, Christianity and Islam''. (ed. Lee. I. Levine). New York &amp; Jerusalem: Continuum Press and Magness Press. 1998. pp. 163-187 ([http://www.kent.ac.uk/anthropology/department/staff/bowman/mapping.pdf on-line text in pdf format] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924090508/http://www.kent.ac.uk/anthropology/department/staff/bowman/mapping.pdf |date=2006-09-24 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The ''Itinerarium'' survives in four manuscripts, all written between the 8th and 10th centuries. Two give only the Judean portion of the trip, which is fullest in topographical glosses on the sites, in a range of landscape detail missing from the other sections, and Christian legend.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner 2000:190.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Bernard, marquis de [[Chabert]]''' (28 February 1724, [[Toulon]] – 1 December 1805) was a French sailor, geographer and astronomer.

He marked himself out as a [[chef d'escadre]] during French involvement in the [[American War of Independence]] and was promoted to [[vice admiral]] in 1792.  He was known above all for his scientific endeavours, notably in the rectification of naval charts of America's western coast and the coasts of the Mediterranean. He entered the [[Académie des sciences]] in 1758 and the [[Bureau des longitudes]] in 1803. In 1785, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

'''Kevo Strict Nature Reserve''' ({{lang-fi|Kevon luonnonpuisto}}) is a [[strict nature reserves of Finland|strict nature reserve]] located in [[Utsjoki]], northern [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], [[Finland]]. It was established in 1956 and covers {{convert|712|km2|mi2}}.

The reserve is a popular backpacking destination due to its [[canyon]]-like gorge valley. A central part of the reserve is the {{convert|40|km|mi}} long and, at places, {{convert|80|m|ft}} deep Kevojoki canyon, on the bottom of which flows the [[Kevojoki]] river. It is surrounded by more level [[fell]] upland.

Walking in the reserve is only permitted along two marked routes. The Kevo backpacking route is {{convert|64|km|mi}} long and follows the gorge valley. The Kuivi route is {{convert|78|km|mi}} and goes along the fell area. Both routes are difficult and include e.g. many paddle crossings.

'''''La Cartografía Mallorquina''''' ('' The Majorcan cartography '') is a book of essays on the [[Majorca]]n [[portolan]]s  written by Professor [[Julio Rey Pastor]] with the collaboration of Ernesto García Camarero. It is a scholarly essay, a key element in the study of portolans, especially those made by Majorcans as half of the book is devoted to the study of more than 400 Majorcan portolans existing worldwide.

==Style of the Majorcan School==

Rey Pastor before explaining how to identify the works of this school for its unmistakable traits, he says:
''".. In the monumental Periplus of the unsurpassed  [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]],&lt;ref name="Bataller2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramon J. Puchades i Bataller|title=Les cartes portolanes: la representació medieval d'una mar solcada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6F-NwAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya|isbn=978-84-9785-414-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; I saw with pleasant surprise that the most varicoloured parchments, ornamented with fabulous effigies of monarchs and naive legends, '' written in Catalan '' with lots of information, physical, biological and political, of each region, they originate in Majorca -in an unknown date-, being designated as  "catalan maps"...'''

Dr. Julio in his book, gives an explanation of why no Spanish scholar had touched the subject, referring to the unjust appropriation of some portolans by some Italian scholars: "Our geographers, insufficiently armed, they stayed timidly neutral; and the militant vindicator of Spanish science, Dr. Gumersindo Laverde -who had organized a phalanx defending the flag hoisted by the young scholar [[Menéndez y Pelayo]]-, they remained silent, for the great scholar had forgotten this chapter of the medieval science "..

Rey Pastor -a great mathematician and lover of the cartography- entered into this profile, in fact cartographers were apart from being artists they had to master mathematics -at least some of them- as the projection of the sphere on a plane it needs them.

Julio Rey Pastor, was able to make the point defending the catalan authorship of many Majorcan portolans against both, the Portuguese scholars, and some Italian "scholars", and in fact he could not be more impartial, for he was not catalan, he was from [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]].

* From the signature “Petrus Rosselli me fecit ab Majoricarum Insulae”. (.."de arte beccaria".. they misinterpreted it as a student of Beccaria)
* From Angelino Dulcert's signature some Italians claimed that Dulcert was "Dalorto" misspelled..

== Influence on Portuguese map makers==

Rey Pastor says.. "..That [[Jehuda Cresques]] (c. 1415) acted as  founder and director of the [[Escola de Sagres]], was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which "mestre Jacome" from Majorca corresponded to the "mestre Jacome" contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name).. But it's unforgivable that some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infant, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sense, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter the Ceremonious]] and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN.. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira|Pacheco Pereira]]...:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estudos de História, Volume III|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=dVc0MZsZj48C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=pacheco+pereira+mandou+%C3%A1+ilha+de+Malhorca+por+um+mestre+Jacome,+mestre+de+cartas+de+marear,&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMIhvKT7vHdyAIVh4ssCh3WGwdL#v=onepage&amp;q=pacheco%20pereira%20mandou%20%C3%A1%20ilha%20de%20Malhorca%20por%20um%20mestre%20Jacome%2C%20mestre%20de%20cartas%20de%20marear%2C&amp;f=false|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|pages=10–|id=GGKEY:7186FCQBHS5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |''..Muijos beneficios tem feytos o virtuoso Infante Dom Anrique a estes Reynos de Portugal, por que descubrió a ilha da Madeyra no anno de nosso senhor de mil CCCCXX, e ha mandau pouoar e mandou a Cicilia pellas canas de açuquar, ...; isso mesmo mandou á ilha de Malhorca por um mestre Jacome, mestre de cartas de marear, na qual ilha primeiramente se fezeram as ditas cartas, e com muitas dadiuas e mercés ho ouue nestes Reynos, ho qual as ensinou a fazer áquelles de que os que em nosso tempo viuem, aprendéram...''}}

And he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading [[João de Barros]], which clearly states: ''"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester.."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bibliografia Henriquina, Vol. I|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=AeqIevJ5kxMC&amp;pg=RA2-PA159&amp;dq=pacheco+pereira+mandou+%C3%A1+ilha+de+Malhorca+por+um+mestre+Jacome,+mestre+de+cartas+de+marear,&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMIhvKT7vHdyAIVh4ssCh3WGwdL#v=onepage&amp;q=pacheco%20pereira%20mandou%20%C3%A1%20ilha%20de%20Malhorca%20por%20um%20mestre%20Jacome%2C%20mestre%20de%20cartas%20de%20marear%2C&amp;f=false|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|pages=2–|id=GGKEY:PGJ4UJDUYAZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8812">'''Least squares adjustment''' is a model for the solution of an [[overdetermined system]] of equations based on the principle of [[least squares]] of [[observation residuals]]. It is used extensively in the disciplines of [[surveying]], [[geodesy]], and [[photogrammetry]]—the field of [[geomatics]], collectively.

==Formulation==
There are three forms of least squares adjustment: ''parametric'', ''conditional'', and ''combined''. In '''parametric adjustment''', one can find an observation equation ''h(X)=Y'' relating observations ''Y'' explicitly in terms of parameters ''X'' (leading to the A-model below). In '''conditional adjustment''', there exists a condition equation ''g(Y)=0'' involving only observations ''Y'' (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters ''X'' at all. Finally, in a '''combined adjustment''', both parameters ''X'' and observations ''Y'' are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation ''f(X,Y)=0''. Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when ''f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y'' and ''f(X,Y)=g(Y)'', respectively. Yet the special cases warrant simpler solutions, as detailed below. Often in the literature, ''Y'' may be denoted ''L''.

==Solution==
The equalities above only hold for the estimated parameters &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and observations &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;f\left(\hat{X},\hat{Y}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;. In contrast, measured observations &lt;math&gt;\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; and approximate parameters &lt;math&gt;\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; produce a nonzero ''misclosure'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} = f\left(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
One can proceed to [[Taylor series expansion]] of the equations, which results in the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobians]] or [[design matrix|design matrices]]: the first one,
:&lt;math&gt;A=\partial{f}/\partial{X};&lt;/math&gt;
and the second one,
:&lt;math&gt;B=\partial{f}/\partial{Y}.&lt;/math&gt;
The linearized model then reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{w} + A \hat{x} + B \hat{y} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{X}-\tilde{X}&lt;/math&gt; are estimated ''parameter corrections'' to the ''a priori'' values, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{Y}-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt; are post-fit ''observation [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]]''.

In the parametric adjustment, the second design matrix is an identity, ''B=-I'', and the misclosure vector can be interpreted as the pre-fit residuals, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}=\tilde{w}=h(\tilde{X})-\tilde{Y}&lt;/math&gt;, so the system simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;A \hat{x} = \hat{y} - \tilde{y},&lt;/math&gt;
which is in the form of [[ordinary least squares]]. 
In the conditional adjustment, the first design matrix is null, ''A=0''.
For the more general cases, [[Lagrange multipliers]] are introduced to relate the two Jacobian matrices and transform the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constrained]] least squares problem into an unconstrained one (albeit a larger one). In any case, their manipulation leads to the &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}&lt;/math&gt; vectors as well as the respective parameters and observations ''a posteriori'' covariance matrices.

===Computation===
Given the matrices and vectors above, their solution is found via standard least-squares methods; e.g., forming the [[normal matrix]] and applying [[Cholesky decomposition]], applying the [[QR factorization]] directly to the Jacobian matrix, [[iterative methods]] for very large systems, etc.

* [[Bundle adjustment]]
* [[Triangulation]], [[Trilateration]], [[wikt:Triangulateration|Triangulateration]]
* [[GPS]]/[[GNSS positioning]]
* [[Helmert transformation]]

*The use of ''a priori'' parameter covariance matrix is akin to [[Tikhonov regularization]]

==Extensions==
If [[rank deficiency]] is encountered, it can often be rectified by the inclusion of additional equations imposing constraints on the parameters and/or observations, leading to [[constrained least squares]].

 |Title= It's A Don-Derful Life
 |DirectedBy=Sam Leifer
 |WrittenBy=Dan Clark
 |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2011|12|22|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary= It's December in the Danbury household but there's nothing festive about Don's state of mind: the house is freezing because the boiler keeps breaking down; the toilet doesn't work; Mrs Treacher's losing the plot (and control of her bowels); Don's got a dead end job in a shoe shop and his friendship with Sam is no closer to becoming the romance he yearns for.
Things suddenly take a turn for the better when he receives news he has finally paid off his gran's debts and is free to sell the house. However, rather than winning Sam's heart it only drives them further apart as he impulsively sells to a property developer who plans to knock it down and Eddie has to put Treacher into an old people's home.
Just when Don thinks things couldn't get worse, his friend Jason back-stabs him by securing an invite to spend Christmas with Sam and her mum. Contemplating another lonely festive season by himself, without the woman he loves, Don manages to persuade Eddie and Treacher to help him film a music video for a song he has specially written for Sam and drop it off at her Mum's. Along the way he encounters a lusty dwarf; a violent Santa and an OAP orgy all rounded off with an epic musical finale.

Please make sure that changes to this page conform to changes in all pages in the series. --&gt;Following is a list of current and former [[courthouse]]s of the [[United States federal court]] system located in [[Puerto Rico]]. Each entry indicates the name of the building along with an image, if available, its location and the jurisdiction it covers,&lt;ref name="j"&gt;For the usage of court abbreviations, see [[List of United States district and territorial courts]].&lt;/ref&gt; the dates during which it was used for each such jurisdiction, and, if applicable the person for whom it was named, and the date of renaming. Dates of use will not necessarily correspond with the dates of construction or demolition of a building, as pre-existing structures may be adapted or court use, and former court buildings may later be put to other uses. Also, the official name of the building may be changed at some point after its use as a federal court building has been initiated.

|Libya had been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire since the middle of the sixteenth century. Following the [[Italo-Turkish war]] of 1912, Libya became an Italian colony. With their defeat in [[World War II]], the Italians lost control of Libya. The country came under UN administration. Control was split between France and Britain, with France administering the province [[Fezzan]] while the British administered the provinces of [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Tripolitania]]. In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] declared that Libya should become an independent country by 1 January 1952. On 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence from France and Britain becoming the United [[Kingdom of Libya]], a constitutional and hereditary monarchy under [[King Idris]].

| The 1916 [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]] and 1919 [[Irish Declaration of Independence]] were never recognised by the UK but given symbolic priority by post-1922 Irish leaders. From the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 Irish election]], [[Irish cabinets since 1919|successive governments]] unilaterally amended the state's status: the Constitution (Removal of Oath) Act on 3 May 1933 implicitly abrogated the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]; the [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|27th amendment]] and [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], both on 12 December 1936, attenuated [[Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949|the role of the monarchy]]; the [[Enactment of the Constitution of Ireland|enactment of the Constitution]] on 29 December 1937 established the [[President of Ireland|office of President]]; the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]] came into force on 18 April 1949 with Ireland formally leaving the [[British Commonwealth]]. Related UK statutes included the [[Éire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] and the [[Ireland Act 1949]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12087">The classification of a reservoir by volume is not as straightforward as it may seem. As the name implies, water is held in reserve by a reservoir so it can serve a purpose.  For example, in Thailand, reservoirs tend to store water from the wet season to prevent flooding, then releases it during the dry season for farmers to grow rice. For this type of reservoir, almost the entire volume of the reservoir functions for the purpose it was built.  Hydroelectric power generation, on the other hand, requires many dams to build up a large volume before operation can begin.  For this type of reservoir only a small portion of the water held behind the dam is useful. Therefore, knowing the purpose
a reservoir has been constructed, and knowing how much water can be used for that purpose helps determine how much water is in possible reserve.

==Terminology==
The following terms are used in connection with the volume of reservoirs:

''Nominal Volume'' or ''Capacity'' is the total volume of all water held behind a dam at the maximum level possible.

''Initial'' or ''Design Volume'' refers to the possible volume within the reservoir after it first opens.  Many rivers are high in silt that over time deposits behind a dam reducing capacity.

''Active'' or ''Live'' volume equals the total capacity minus the ''dead pool'' volume.  This is the volume that can serve some downstream purpose. For example, it is the volume available to make hydroelectric power or provide drinking water to a city.

''Dead pool'' or ''Minimum'' volume refers to the amount of water left in a reservoir that cannot be used for the general purpose the reservoir was constructed.  At this state, the reservoir is termed ''fully drawn down.'' For example, if built to supply water in the dry season, it is the water left behind when no more water can be extracted. Frequently, the effective minimum volume is greater if the water is needed for a purpose behind a dam.

''Available capacity'' may require knowing the reservoir's primary purpose.  If it is designed to prevent flooding, it may be the volume of water that can be retained before reaching maximum or ''top water''.

''Actual'' or ''Current'' when coupled with another term reflects the fact the level behind the dam is not constant.

==Expanded versus artificial lakes==
The list below largely ignores many natural lakes that have been augmented with the addition of a relatively minor dam.  For example, a small dam, two hydroelectric plants, and locks on the outlet of [[Lake Superior]] make it possible to artificially control the lake level.  Certainly, the great majority of the lake is natural.  However, the control of water that can be held in reserve means a portion of the vast lake functions as a reservoir.

Recognition of lakes like Lake Superior greatly changes the list below. For example, the Francis H. Clergue Generating Station and [[Saint Marys Falls Hydropower Plant]], which are both on the lake's outlet, operate with just 5.9 meters total head. This is short compared to other dams. However, when viewed against the 81,200 km2 area of the lake, even a small range in Lake Superior's means its ''active'' volume is greater than the largest ''nominal'' in the table below.

The Avenues are located in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of [[Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles|Lincoln Heights]], [[Cypress Park, Los Angeles|Cypress Park]], [[Montecito Heights, Los Angeles|Montecito Heights]], [[Glassell Park, Los Angeles|Glassell Park]], [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]],[[Mount Washington, Los Angeles|Mt. Washington]] and [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]].   They are not related to 2nd through 13th Avenues west of Arlington Street in [[Jefferson Park, Los Angeles|Jefferson Park]].

The [[The Avenues (gang)|Avenues street gang]] derives their name from these avenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/news/avenues-gang-has-a-long-violent-history-in-los-angeles#sthash.7Dq8OdkP.dpbs|title=Avenues gang has a long, violent history in Los Angeles {{!}} StreetGangs.Com|website=www.streetgangs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The avenue numbers generally reflect the Los Angeles street grid beginning with Avenue 16 at the 1600 block north of [[1st Street, Los Angeles|1st Street]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]] through Avenue 67 at the 6700 block in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://navigatela.lacity.org/NavigateLA/|title=NavigateLA|website=navigatela.lacity.org|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  North of the [[Los Angeles River]] Pasadena Avenue and [[Figueroa Street]] assume the role of [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]] and divide house numbers on streets running east and west.  House numbers originate at 100 and increase east or west from that dividing point.  For example, 1100 West Avenue 26 is  11 blocks west of Pasadena.

In many places the Avenues do not reflect the grid or the Los Angeles' numbering and naming convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://egis3.lacounty.gov/eGIS/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/House-Numbering-and-Street-Naming-Material-2013.pdf|title=City of Los Angeles Unified House Numbering System|last=|first=|date=October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:

* Pasadena Avenue is the east-west dividing street from Avenue 16 though Avenue 38 but Avenues 16 through 25 defy the naming convention and are prefixed "North" for west of Pasadena and "South" for east of Pasadena.
* At Avenue 39 Figueroa Street takes over as the divide and, through Avenue 45, Avenues are prefixed "East"-"West" according to convention but Avenues 49 through 61 revert to the non-conventional "North"-"South" prefixes again.
* Finally the dividing line turns 90 degrees to the right onto [[York Boulevard]] dividing Avenues 62 through 67 which run due north and south, perpendicular to the lower numbered Avenues to the south.                           
* Avenues 44 and 45 are actually labeled both North and West in different sections                        
* In [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] and [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]] Avenues 45 through 61 turn due North as they proceed west of the dividing line crossing [[York Boulevard]] which runs east and west.   They effectively turn the Los Angeles street grid 90 degrees to the east.  In many places the grid collides with itself with two intersecting streets bearing the same block number.

'''Marcian David (Matty) Bleahu''' (born 14 March 1924, in [[Brașov]]) is a [[Romania]]n geologist, speleologist, geographer, alpinist, explorer, writer and politician.
He is well known for his scientific contributions to the development of the theories of global tectonics (applied to the study of the geology of the Carpathian Mountains), for his pioneering in speleology and for the development of this science, but also for the popularization of science and of ecology in Romania.

Marcian Bleahu is the author of more than 41 books and 126 scientific papers, of more than 400 articles on different topics.  He has more than 500 public appearances as a speaker, including the radio and the television, he is a pioneer in using the multimedia in conferences, he is the author of the first geological map of Romania. As such, Marcian Bleahu is one of the most important Romanian scientific personalities of the second half of the last century.

His books and his conferences have inspired generations of youth fond of nature, mountains, the exploration of the caves in Romania, and he has been, at the same time, a mentor for many Romanian geologists after the second World War.

== Biography ==

Marcian David Bleahu was born on March 14, 1924, in [[Brașov]], in the family of a notary, but his maternal ancestry goes up to the prince [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Spovedania unui neînvins - Marcian Bleahu, Editura Paideia, 2006, București&lt;/ref&gt; He was enlisted during the [[World War II]].

He graduated from school and [[Ioan Meșotă National College|high-school]] in Brașov. In 1949, he graduated from the  Faculty of Sciences (Sections of Natural Sciences and Geography) of the [[University of Bucharest]]. In 1974 he obtains a PhD with a thesis about the Geology and the Morphology of the Karst and of the Caves, at the [[Babeș-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]].

He begins his teaching activity at the Geology Department of Bucharest University, where he was a teaching assistant, lecturer and associate professor between 1949 and 1961. He was eliminated from the teaching system for political reasons, and he started again his university career after 1989, when, together with prof. Dolphi Drimer, he founded the Ecological University, where he was appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences (afterwards transformed in Faculty of Ecology).

Between 1949 - 1994, Marcian Bleahu worked as a geologist, a researcher and as a manager (including General Manager) at the Geological Institute of Romania.

He was elected as a senator for the legislatures 1990-1992 and 1996-2000, on the lists of the Romanian Ecologist Movement, and of the Romanian Ecologist Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdep.ro/pls/parlam/structura.mp?idm=1015&amp;cam=1&amp;leg=1996&amp;pag=1&amp;prn=0&amp;par=&amp;idl=2 Marcian David Bleahu - Parliamentary activity in legislature 1996-2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 - 1992 he was the Minister of the Environment.

He has received several awards and decorations; in 2008 he was decorated with the Order "Steaua Româniai"  ("[[Order of the Star of Romania|The Star of Romania]]") as Knight, which is the highest Romanian civil order.

At present, he has retired from the public activity, but he continues to write articles and books in several fields, including music (he is known as a sophisticated melomaniac), or ecology.

== Professional career ==

After graduation, in 1949, Marcian Bleahu joins the Geology Department of the Bucharest University. He teaches the first classes of Structural Geology and of the Geology of the Quaternary. In 1961 he is eliminated from the Department by the communist administration, on political grounds.

On April 4, 1990, together with Dolphi Drimer, Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecological University, the first private university in Romania and the only university with an ecological profile. Dolphi Drimer becomes the rector of this university and Marcian Bleahu is appointed as dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences (later on named Faculty of Ecology), where he teaches Dynamic Geology, Physical Geography of Romania, Geology of Romania, Protection of nature and protected areas. He ends his teaching career in 2001.

Between 1949 - 1994, simultaneously with his teaching activity, Marcian Bleahu worked  as a geologist at the Geological Institute, where he implements most of his scientific activities.

Between 1952 - 1985, he does a long series of research in the Carpathian Mountains, mainly in the Apuseni. During all these 33 years of field research, he synthesized and made public the stratigraphy and the structure of the Apuseni Mountains. The papers he published in this field are the first scientific source about the geology of the Maramures, Bihor, Codru-Moma and [[Metaliferic Mountains]] -  he dedicated to each of them a monography. These researches had an important impact on synthesis of national interest, such as coal deposits, Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations, but also from the tectonic point of view, in the general works about the structure of the territory, as well as in the integration of these researches in the wider framework of the study of Triassic paleography in Eastern Europe.

Directly, or by coordinating teams of geologists, Marcian Bleahu also produced over 50 maps (pages) component of the Geological Map of Romania, on a scale of 1:200.000, for which he also made the state standards in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/3192921 Geology of Romania] - B.C. Burchfiel, Boulder, Colo. Geological Society of America, c1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special chapter of this field activity was the study of karstology, meaning the exploration, the mapping and the research of the caves in the Apuseni mountains,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sur les confluences souterraines]] - International Journal of Speology&lt;/ref&gt; almost unknown until then: Peștera de la Căput, Peștera Buciumul Sucit, [[Peştera Vântului|Peștera Vântului]], Peștera Vadu Crișului, Peștera Șura Mare, Peștera din Peretele Dârnini, Peștera Coliboaia, Avenul de sub Pietruța, Peștera Izvorul Tăușoarelor, Peștera-aven ghețarul de sub Zgurăști, Peștera Cetatea Rădesei, Peștera Pojarul Poliței, [[Scărișoara Cave|Peștera Scărișoara]], Peștera Huda lui Papară, Vânătările Ponorului, Izbucul de la Cotețul Dobreștilor, Avenul de sub Colții Grindului, Peștera Gaura cu Muscă, Peștera Bolii, Peștera Neagră, Peștera Ghețarul de la Vârtop, Avenul din Piatra Ceții, Peștera Calului, Peștera Bisericuța, Peștera din Dealul Cornului, Peștera Mică de la Vânătare, Peștera Dâlbina, Peștera Corobana lui Gârtău, Peștera V5, Peștera Poarta lui Ionele, Avenul din Șesuri etc.

In 1976 he publishes ''Caves from Romania'' "Peșteri din România", which becomes one of the first scientific best-sellers in Romania.

All these researches, as well as the world scientific trends of the '60s in the field of plate tectonics catalyses Marcian Bleahu's research activity and he becomes a pioneer in the field of global tectonics not only in Romania, but also with significant contributions in the international scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ro/books?id=Af68zOwcuHwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Marcian+Bleahu+tectonics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VvNBkxCWTd&amp;sig=x8HCm0PKF9sfNiXDnTDnMHqgzTc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TRIbU4f-A6TnywPyg4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcian%20Bleahu%20tectonics&amp;f=false Bibliography of Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics] - Tina Kasbeer, The Geological Society of America, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The results of his studies were synthesized in the book ''Global tectonics'' - Bucharest,  1983, Editura Științifică, (''Tectonica globală)'', in two volumes, with over 1000 pages.

Despite the opposition of the scientific world of that time, which got quickly past any debate over ideas and arrived at the political questioning of the research results (the communist authorities forbade him to leave the country for 6 years, 1978 - 1984), Marcian Bleahu managed to thrust his theories, and he was invited in 1974, 1976 and 1978 to teach at the University in Geneva the first course in Global Tectonics; he also gave conferences in Vienna, Zurich, Freiburg, Basel, Potsdam, etc.

Between 1949 - 1952 he was the manager of the geology service for the [[Danube - Black Sea Canal]].

In 1953, he coordinated the geological research for the project of [[Bucharest Metro]].

He was a member of the inter-ministerial commission of analysis for the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|Earthquake on March 4th 1977]].

Between 1985 - 1994 he was a member of the team that founded and coordinated [[Geology Museum (Romania)|The National Museum of Geology in Bucharest]].

== Political career ==

While a student, he sympathized with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], but he was not a member of any political party until 1965, when he joins the [[Romanian Communist Party]], in order to be appointed on a management position in the Geological Institute. If, politically, his activity until 1990 was almost non-existent, from the professional point of view he will be remembered as the founder of the National Museum of Geology, in 1985, where he also worked as a scientific coordinator, until 1994.

After the [[Romanian Revolution|Revolution in December 1989]], Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecologist Movement in Romania, thus putting into practice his professional belief regarding the protection of nature and of environment.

He is elected as a senator in May 1990, in the first free post-communist Parliament and he becomes the Minister of Environment in the [[Stolojan I Cabinet|Stolojan]] cabinet. In this position, he elaborated the legislation in the field (again, a pioneer work) and he tried to integrate Romania in the international conventions and programs regarding the environment.

In 1992 he is appointed vice-president of the [[United Nations|UN]] Conference for environment and development in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

In 1996 he is elected again as a senator, on the lists of the Democratic Convention, for the Ecologist Federation of Romania. He was a member of the Commission for Foreign Affairs and of the parliamentary group of the National Liberal Party.

In 2008 he is appointed as President of Honor of the Green Party, successor of the Ecologist Federation of Romania.

{{TOC right}}

== Administrative facilities ==
Military organizations of all types must support a wide range of administrative functions including personnel management, accounting, and procurement.  Some facilities are quite similar to civilian [[office|office buildings]] while others are converted from other military uses and can be quite idiosyncratic.

== Ammunition storage facilities ==
[[Ammunition]] is frequently stored in small quantities in reinforced structures which are widely separated.  Standard designs are sometimes called "igloos".

== Commissary facilities ==
Traditionally, military units provided most of the rations, [[uniforms]], and other supplies needed by most military personnel.  However, modern units often provide fewer items and many personnel must buy some items with their own funds.  Personnel with families also must buy food, clothing, and other necessities for the family.  This has created the need for modern commissary and “PX” (post exchange) buildings.  In some cases, these buildings are similar to modern [[supermarkets]].

== Correctional facilities ==
{{main|Military prison}}
Most military installations have small jails for temporary holding of suspects or short term punishment of minor offenses.  However, military organizations also have larger, centralized facilities for longer term incarceration of persons convicted of more serious offenses.  The main correctional facility of the US Army, Air Force, and Marines is the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]] located at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas.

== Fortifications ==
[[Fortifications]] vary widely in nature depending on the mission and type of unit engaged.

== Hospitals ==
Full-service [[military hospital]]s are a fairly recent innovation in military history.  Prior to the nineteenth century, military hospitals as we know them today did not exist.  Soldiers wounded in combat were treated in the field or in makeshift facilities commandeered near the field of battle.  Medical technology at the time was such that most serious wounds were fatal and, accordingly, there was little need for facilities that provided for long-term care and recuperation.  Battlefield [[amputations]] were one of the most common procedures and were only successful in saving the life of the victim in a limited number of cases.

However, beginning in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, advances in [[blood transfusion]], [[anesthesia]], [[antibiotics]], and [[Physical trauma|trauma]] treatment meant that many more soldiers could survive wounds although the treatment time was much longer.  Also, advances in the treatment of [[infectious diseases]] meant that many more personnel required treatment for non-combat conditions.

All of these conditions, plus an increasing number of personnel with families, have led to the construction of full service military hospitals.  These hospitals treat both members of the military and their families.

== Housing ==
Military housing includes [[barracks]], UOQs (unescorted or "bachelor" officer quarters), and family housing.  The age and condition of these facilities varies widely.  A few officer family housing units are very [[historic building|historical]] in nature and can be quite large and ornate.  Most family and UOQ housing is now similar in nature to civilian housing stock.  In most advanced countries, barracks housing has been modernized, but remnants of housing from [[World War II]] and older periods still remains in the inventory.

== Mess ==
“Mess” is the military term for any facility serving food to large groups.  Some mess halls in remote locations can be rudimentary, but others in established locations can be similar to modern cafeterias.

== Military intelligence facilities ==
These facilities are highly secured.  Modern facilities involve intensive use of electronics and computer technology.

== Museums ==
Because of the role military actions have played in determining world history, military [[museums]] are common.  They range widely from small facilities memorializing the actions of local units to large, sophisticated facilities devoted to an entire branch of service or entire wars.

== POL (Petroleum, Oils, &amp; Lubricants) storage and handling facilities ==
These facilities are engineered to provide safe storage and handling of [[petroleum]]-based materials.  Newer facilities include containments to prevent environmental pollution from due to spills.

== Recreation facilities ==
[[Recreation]] facilities for both military personnel and their families.  Athletic facilities are common as are officers' clubs and NCO/enlisted personnel clubs.

== Research facilities ==
Military organizations conduct extensive [[research]] operations and maintain extensive purpose-built research facilities to support those activities.

== Training facilities ==
Traditional military training facilities focused on physical conditioning and skills training.  Newer facilities make extensive use of computer simulations of various kinds to provide more hours or training in more realistic situations at lower cost and with lower risk to personnel.  [[Military academies]] are devoted entirely to training military officer cadets.  Facilities for advanced training of senior officers also exist.  Examples include the US [[Army Command and General Staff College]] at Ft. Leavenworth, KS.

== Utility structures ==
Many military installations are large enough to require their own [[utility]] systems.  [[Water treatment]] plants, [[sewage treatment]] plants, and [[electric power generation]] stations are found on many military installations.

== Vehicle repair, maintenance, &amp; storage facilities ==
Vehicle repair shops can be very large and built to accommodate large vehicles.  Aircraft [[hangar]]s are some of the largest and most specialized military buildings.

== Weapons &amp; ammunition production facilities ==
Production of ammunition is now largely outsourced to industry contractors.  However, facilities such as [[Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant]] produced small arms ammunition for the US Military for many years.  More exotic facilities such as [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]] (now decommissioned) was the main facility for production of chemical weapons.

'''Nikolai Spathari''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Гаврилович Спафарий|Nikolai Gavrilovich Spathari}}; 1636–1708), also known as '''Nicolae Milescu''' and '''Nicolae Milescu Spătaru''' ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e miˈlesku spəˈtaru}}, first name also ''Neculai'', signing in Latin as '''Nicolao Spadario Moldavo-Lacone''', {{lang-ru|Николае Гаврилович Милеску|Nikolaye Gavrilovich Milesku}}), or ''[[Spătar]]ul Milescu-Cârnu'' (trans.: "[[Chancellor]] Milescu the Snub-nosed"), was a [[Moldavia]]n writer, diplomat and traveler. He spoke nine languages: [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Latin]], both [[Attic Greek|Attic]] and [[Modern Greek]], French, German, [[Turkish Language|Turkish]], [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] and Russian. One of his grandsons was the [[Spătar]] (Chancellor) [[Yuri Stefanovich Spătarul|Yuri Stefanovich]], who came to Russia in 1711 with prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]].&lt;ref name=Metchnikoff&gt;Olga Metchnikoff, ''Vie d'Elie Metchnikoff'', Hachette, Paris, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
His prosonym Moldavo-Lacone&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld Antoine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=51pniAhOlD8C&amp;pg=PA1091 Sur la créance des Grecs] (Latin), pp. 1091–98 in ''La perpétuité de la Foi de l'Église Catholique touchant l' Eucharistie'', Paris, 1781. Accessed 21 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Laconian Moldavan-Laconian]) is thought to be an indication of a possible Greek origin.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Dumbravă, [http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete12/27.html The ''k’ou-t’ou'', a political and religious ceremonial at the court of the Ch’ing Dynasty: Brief note about the Milescu – K’ang-hsi case (June 1676)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617100141/http://www.phantasma.ro/caiete/caiete/caiete12/27.html |date=17 June 2013 }}, University of Florence. Accessed 21 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Milescu'' was adopted by his parents when they settled in Milesti.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarou Achilleas, ''[http://vlahofonoi.blogspot.gr/2011/04/blog-post_10.html Η ελληνικοτητα των βλαχων]'' ''(He hellenikoteta ton Vlachon'', "The Greekness of the Vlachs", in Greek.)&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. L. Turdeanu-Cartojan discovered at Oxford his autobiography, written in Greek (''Λαζάρου'', ''Lazarou'').

A [[boyar]] born in [[Vaslui]], Milescu studied at the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchate]] College of [[Istanbul]] and, after returning to [[Iași]], was appointed Chancellor for the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Gheorghe Ştefan]]. In 1660–1664, he acted as representative of his country with its [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] overlord, and then as envoy to [[Berlin]] and [[Stockholm]]. He followed Gheorghe Ştefan in his [[exile]] to Stockholm and [[Szczecin]] (1664–1667) and visited [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s France in an attempt to get the King to assist him in creating an anti-Ottoman alliance.

Numismatic issue – in 2011, the National Bank of Romania issued a silver coin dedicated to the 375th anniversary of Nicolae Milescu's birth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bnro.ro/page.aspx?prid=5897&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
Milescu had ambitions of his own, and conspired against Prince [[Ştefăniţă Lupu]]. As punishment, Ştefăniţă ordered Milescu's nose to be cut off (the reason for Milescu's [[moniker]]). According to the unlikely account of [[chronicle]]r [[Ion Neculce]]: "After [being mutilated], Nicolae the Snub-nosed fled to the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German Land]] and found himself a doctor there, who repeatedly drew blood out of his cheeks and sculptured his nose, and thus day by day the blood coagulated, leading to his healing".&lt;ref name=Neculce&gt;Ion Neculce, ''O samă de cuvinte'', XLI&lt;/ref&gt;

Milescu again left for [[Istanbul]], where he received a letter from the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[Tsar]] [[Alexis I of Russia|Aleksey I]], who appointed him chief translator and diplomat at the Foreign Ministry in 1671. Milescu arrived in Russia together with [[Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem]]. In 1674, he is shown as leading negotiations with both [[Wallachia]] and Moldavia, trying to rally them in the Russian-led anti-Ottoman projects. In 1695, Milescu took part in [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s [[Azov Campaigns]].

One of Milescu's tasks was to reinforce the legitimacy of the [[House of Romanov|Romanov Dynasty]]. To this end, he asserted that the Tsar was a successor to both the Roman and Byzantine emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Pesenson and Spock, p.294&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Vasiliologion'' ("Book of Rulers", 1674), he wrote that tsarist rule was derived from God, whose representative on earth was the Tsar.&lt;ref&gt;Pesenson and Spock, p.294-95&lt;/ref&gt; The work included short biographies of famous rulers, culminating with [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] and Aleksey, but also including [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Dmitry Donskoy]], [[Alexander Nevsky]], Byzantine emperors [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], and [[Augustus]] and [[Julius Caesar]] from Rome. Significantly, he included the feeble-minded [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor Ivanovich]], whose reign was considerably less illustrious, but who had to be mentioned in order to demonstrate dynastic continuity.&lt;ref name="p295"/&gt;

In ''Khrismologion'' ("Book of Prophecy", 1672) he analyzed commentary on the [[four kingdoms of Daniel]] prophecy, concluding that, due to its connection with Constantinople, Russia was the only true successor to the fourth kingdom, Rome. Going further, he asserted that the right of Roman succession belonged ''only'' to Russia, and not to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In setting forth his claim, he made reference to [[Anna Porphyrogenita]], the sister of Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]], who married [[Vladimir the Great]]. In his view, this union not only reinforced the strong connection between Byzantium and Russia, but also drew a dynastic line between Vladimir and Aleksey.&lt;ref name="p295"&gt;Pesenson and Spock, p.295&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Nicolae Milescu Spătarul (2475757164).jpg|thumb|A bust of Nicolae Milescu in the [[Alley of Classics, Chișinău|Alley of Classics]] of Chișinău]]

==In China==
In 1675, he was named ambassador of the Russian Empire to Beijing, the capital of [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], returning in 1678. At the head of a 150-strong expedition that had a military component (meant to fend off possible attacks by a hostile indigenous population), Milescu had as his main tasks the settlement of several border incidents between Russia and China, the establishment of permanent trade relations with China, and the survey of the newly incorporated Russian lands along the [[Amur River]]. The previous Muscovite embassy to China, led by [[Fyodor Baykov]] in 1656-56, had failed to achieve these objectives.

Unlike previous Russians who had gone through Mongolia, Milescu chose to travel through Siberia as far as [[Nerchinsk]], directly north of Peking. Upon reaching [[Yeniseysk]], Milescu sent one of his men, Ignatiy Milovanov, to the Chinese court in order to inform the [[Kangxi Emperor]] about the purpose of their embassy. Milovanov was the first European known to have crossed the Amur (Heilong) River, reaching Beijing by the shortest route possible. Milescu followed the same route to the Chinese border, and established his camp on the [[Nen River]] in [[Heilongjiang]], waiting for news from Milovanov. The latter returned to the camp on 18 February and, taking Milescu's report to the Tsar with him, proceeded to Moscow. Milescu, on the other hand, crossed into Beijing via [[Hebei]] in the middle of May, after being held up for two months at [[Kalgan]] (modern Zhangjiakou). Here he was able to communicate in Latin with the Jesuit [[Ferdinand Verbiest]]. His diplomacy proved unsuccessful, and he returned to Siberia by the same route in Spring 1677.

==Achievements==
[[File:Stamp of Moldova 133.gif|thumb|Nicolae Milescu Spătaru on a 1998 stamp of Moldova]]
Milescu is the author of one of the first Russian works on arithmetic, "Arithmologion", which was written in 1672, based on his own Greek original. The manuscript was preserved in the [[Chudov Monastery]], till it was discovered by church historian Nikolay Kedrov.&lt;ref name=Andonie&gt;Andonie George Ştefan, ''Istoria Matematicii în România'', 1965, vol. 1, pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[road journal]] – later published under the title ''Travels through Siberia to the Chinese borders'', Milescu correctly described the middle course of the [[Ob River|Ob]], [[Irtysh]], and [[Angara River|Angara]]. He assumed the Ob to have its source in [[Lake Teletskoye]] in the [[Altai Mountains]]. He was also the first person to describe [[Lake Baikal]] and all the rivers feeding the lake, and the first to point out Baikal's unfathomable depth.

On his way through Siberia, Milescu used the [[astrolabe]] to establish coordinates of some settlements. His materials were later used by the [[Jesuits]], who took considerable interest in China. Upon returning to Moscow, he submitted to the Foreign Ministry three volumes of notes: ''Travel notes'' and ''Description of China'', alongside the ''Travels''.

In his narratives, Milescu summed up the knowledge that Russian explorers had gathered about East Siberia. Although he believed that the Amur was the largest river in the world, he listed its main tributaries without mistake. His idea that there was a vast [[mountain range]] stretching from the Baikal to the [[Okhotsk Sea]], although fundamentally wrong, was widely believed by many geographers until the mid-20th century. He also heard rumours about [[Sakhalin]], which he supposed to be the same island as [[Hokkaidō]], thus considerably exaggerating its dimensions.

[[Bogdan Petriceicu-Hasdeu]] believed that Milescu was the author of the first translation of the Bible into Romanian, the [[Bucharest]] edition (printed in 1688, during the rule of Prince [[Şerban Cantacuzino]]). However, [[Nicolae Iorga]] and other historians have argued that there is no actual proof of this, and have proposed [[Constantin Cantacuzino (stolnic)|Constantin Cantacuzino]] as the main translator.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Nicolae Milescu-Spătaru on stamp.jpg|thumb|Nicolae Milescu Spătaru on a 2002 stamp of Moldova]]
Milescu's name was assigned to several streets in localities throughout Romania and [[Moldova]], including one in [[Bucharest]] named "Strada Spatărul Nicolae Milescu",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bucurestiul.info/strazi/strada-spatarul-nicolae-milescu/ Strada Spatarul Nicolae Milescu], bucurestiul.info&lt;/ref&gt; one in [[Chișinău]] named "Strada Nicolae Milescu Spătaru",&lt;ref&gt;[https://orasulmeuchisinau.wordpress.com/2010/08/25/strada-nicolae-milescu-spataru/ Strada Nicolae Milescu Spătaru (fosta Милеску)]. ''Blogul „Chișinău, orașul meu” al Bibliotecii Municipale „B.P. Hasdeu”''&lt;/ref&gt; one in [[Constanța]] named "Strada Nicolae Milescu",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulevarde.ro/constanta/strada-nicolae-milescu Strada Nicolae Milescu, Constanța], bulevarde.ro&lt;/ref&gt; etc. Also there are scientific and education institutions named in the Milescu's honor, among them a [[lyceum]] in Chișinău, ''Liceul Teoretic "Nicolae Milescu Spătarul"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://rson.justice.md/organization/view/11579 Liceul Teoretic "Nicolae Milescu Spătarul"], rson.justice.md&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Association of Scientists of Moldova "N. Spătaru Milescu"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rson.justice.md/organization/view/686 Asociația Oamenilor de Știință din Moldova "N. Spătaru Milescu"], rson.justice.md&lt;/ref&gt; Several busts to Milescu are across Romanian and Moldovan cities. Also in Moldova several stamps with Milescu on them were issued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3813">Starting in the mid-19th century, European anthropologists and later Kenyan historians have been interested in the origins of human migration from various parts of Africa into East Africa. One of the more notable broad based theories emanating from these studies being the [[Bantu expansion]]. The main tools of study have been linguistics, archaeology and oral traditions.

===Oral traditions===
The significance of tracing individual clan histories in order to get an idea of Kalenjin groups formation has been shown by scholars such as B.E. Kipkorir (1978). He argued that the Tugen first settled in small clan groups, fleeing from war, famine and disease, and that they arrived from western, eastern and northern sections. There is even a section among the Tugen that claims to have come from Mount Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Kim. Identity Strategies of the Argo-pastoral Pokot: Analyzing ethnicity and clanship within a spatial framework. Universiteit Van Amsterdam, 2007 p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nandi account on the [[Settlement of Nandi]] displays a similar manner of occupation of the Nandi territory. The Kalenjin clans that moved into and occupied the Nandi area, thus becoming the Nandi tribe, came from a wide array of Kalenjin speaking areas {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

It thus appears that there were spatial core areas to which people moved and concentrated over the centuries, and in the process evolved into the individual Kalenjin communities known today by adopting migrants and assimilating original inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Kim. Identity Strategies of the Argo-pastoral Pokot: Analyzing ethnicity and clanship within a spatial framework. Universiteit Van Amsterdam, 20007 p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-colonial traditions===

A number of historical narratives from the various Kalenjin sub-tribes point to Tulwetab/Tulwop Kony ([[Mount Elgon]]) as their original point of settlement in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;Kipkorir, B.E. The Marakwet of Kenya: A preliminary study. East Africa Educational Publishers Ltd, 1973, pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt; This point of origin appears as a central theme in most narratives recorded after the colonial period. One of the more famous accounts states that;

''..the Kalenjin originated from a country in the north known as Emet ab Burgei, which means, the hot country. The people are said to have traveled southwards passing through Mount Elgon or Tulwet ab Kony in Kalenjin. The [[Sabaot people|Sabaot]] settled around the slopes of the mountain while the others travelled on in search of better land. The [[Keiyo people|Keiyo]] and [[Marakwet people|Marakwet]] settled in [[Kerio Valley]] and [[Cherangani Hills]]. The [[Pokot people|Pokot]] settled on the northern side of Mount Elgon and later spread to areas north of Lake Baringo. At [[Lake Baringo]], the [[Tugen people|Tugen]] separated from the Nandi and the Kipsigis. This was during a famine known as Kemeutab Reresik, which means, famine of the bats. It is said that during this famine a bat brought blades of green grass which was taken as a sign of good omen signifying that famine could be averted through movement to greener pastures. The Tugen moved and settled around [[Tugen Hills]] while the Kipsigis and the Nandi moved to [[Rongai]] area. The [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] and [[Nandi people|Nandi]] are said to have lived as a united group for a long time but eventually were forced to separate due to antagonistic environmental factors. Some of these were droughts and invasion of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] from Uasin Gishu.''&lt;ref&gt;Chesaina, C. Oral Literature of the Kalenjin. Heinmann Kenya Ltd, 1991, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Dominican Republic:

[[Dominican Republic]] – sovereign state occupying the eastern five-eighths of the island of [[Hispaniola]], in the [[Greater Antilles]] archipelago in the [[Caribbean]] region. Its capital, [[Santo Domingo]], was Western Europe's first permanent settlement in, and the first seat of Spanish colonial rule in the [[New World]]. For most of its independent history, the nation experienced political turmoil and unrest, suffering through many non-representative and tyrannical governments. Since the death of military dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]] in 1961, the Dominican Republic has moved toward [[representative democracy]].

'''Pavle Merkù''' ({{IPA-sl|ˈpaːu̯lɛ mɛɾˈku|pron}}) (12 July 1927 – 20 October 2014) was an Italian-Slovene composer, ethnomusicologist, Slovene specialist, and etymologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delo.si/kultura/glasba/poslovil-se-je-pavle-merku.html "Poslovil se je Pavle Merkù." 2014. ''Delo'' (20 October).] {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Merkù was born in Trieste on 12 July 1927. He received a bachelor's degree in [[Slavic studies]] at the University of Ljubljana in 1950, and he obtained his doctorate in Rome in 1960. He studied composition in Trieste. As a composer, he primarily wrote chamber music and works for choral ensembles. He wrote the opera ''Kačji pastir'' (The Dragonfly). His professional work involved both music and Slovene studies. In the mid-1960s he started collecting folk songs among ethnic Slovenes living in Italy; this eventually grew into a collection of stories, customs, superstitions, and other folk material that he published in 1976 under the title ''Ljudsko izročilo Slovencev v Italiji'' (Slovene Folk Heritage in Italy). In 2004 he published the book ''1300 primorskih priimkov'' (1,300 Littoral Surnames), which complemented the etymological research of France Bezlaj. Merkù was a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. He died in Trieste at the age of 87.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 1972 Merkù received the Prešeren Award for his composition ''Koncert za violino in orkester'' (Concerto for Violin and Orchestra). In 2001 he received the Štrekelj Award for exceptional achievement in collection Slovene folk heritage, and the Silver Order of Freedom of the Republic of Slovenia for strengthening Slovene ethnic identity among cross-border Slovenes and for scholarly and artistic merit. In 2007 he was given the Kozina Award for his lifetime composition work.

Merkù was an honorary member of the Slavic Society of Slovenia, and in 2007 he received its recognition for his lifetime achievement in research on [[Slovene language|Slovene]] along the language's western border. In the decision conferring the award, Alenka Šivic Dular wrote that Merkù's linguistic studies especially emphasized "research on personal names and toponyms in the Trieste, Gorizia, and Venetian Slovenia areas and drew attention to traces of Slovene-Friulian language contact (''Slovenski priimki na zahodni meji'', Slovene Surnames on the Western Border, 1982; ''La toponomastica del Comune di Duino-Aurisina'', Toponyms in the Commune of Duino-Aurisina, 1989; ''La toponomastica dell'Alta val Torre'', Toponyms in the Upper Torre Valley, 1997; ''1300 primorskih priimkov'', 1,300 Littoral Surnames, 2004; ''Krajevno imenoslovje na slovenskem zahodu'', Regional Onomastics in Western Slovene Territory, 2006). Some of Merkù's books are seminal works, and his creativity and confident approach mark the Slovene physical and cultural presence in Trieste."&lt;ref&gt;Alenka Šivic Dular. 2007. "Pavle Merkù. Nagrajenca Slavističnega društva Slovenije za leto 2007." In: Miran Košuta (ed.): ''Živeti mejo: Slovenski slavistični kongres, Trst, 18.-20. 10. 2007'' (= ''Zbornik Slavističnega društva Slovenije'', 18). Ljubljana: Slavistično društvo Slovenije.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkù received the Prešeren Award for lifetime achievement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/kultura/drugo/presernova-nagrajenca-sta-pavle-merku-in-vladimir-kavcic/329345 "Prešernova nagrajenca sta Pavle Merku in Vladimir Kavčič." 2014. ''MMC RTV-SLO'' (7 February).] {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pine barrens''', '''pine plains''', '''sand plains''', or '''pinelands''' occur throughout the  U.S. from [[Florida]] to [[Maine]] (see [[Atlantic coastal pine barrens]]) as well as the [[Midwest]], [[Western United States|West]], and Canada and parts of [[Eurasia]]. Pine barrens are plant communities that occur on dry, acidic, infertile soils, dominated by [[grasses]], [[forb]]s, low [[shrub]]s, and small to medium-sized [[pine]]s. The most extensive barrens occur in large areas of sandy [[glacial deposit]]s (including [[outwash plain]]s), lakebeds, and outwash [[Fluvial terrace|terraces]] along rivers.

==Description==

===Botany===
The most common trees are the [[jack pine]], [[red pine]], [[pitch pine]], [[blackjack oak]], and [[Quercus ilicifolia|scrub oak]]; a scattering of larger [[oak]]s is not unusual. The [[understory]] includes grasses, [[Cyperaceae|sedge]]s, and forbs, many of them common in dry [[prairie]]s, and rare plants such as the sand-plain gerardia (''[[Agalinis acuta]]''). Plants of the [[Ericaceae|heath]] family, such as [[blueberries]] and [[bearberry]], and shrubs, such as prairie willow and [[hazel]], are common. These species have adaptations that permit them to survive or regenerate well after fire.

===Fauna===
Pine barrens support a number of rare species, including [[Lepidoptera]] such as the [[Karner blue]] butterfly (''Lycaeides melissa samuelis'') and the barrens [[buck moth]] (''Hemileuca maia'').

===Fire ecology===
Barrens are dependent on fire to prevent invasion by less fire-tolerant species. In the absence of fire, barrens will proceed through [[Ecological succession|successional stages]] from pine forest to a larger climax forest, such as [[oak-hickory forest]].

European settlers found extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, commonly called "barrens".  The American Indians used fire to maintain such areas as rangeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Hutch|date=Summer 2000|title=Wildland Burning by American Indians in Virginia|journal=Fire Management Today|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service|location=Washington, DC|volume=60|issue=3|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Open barrens are now rare and imperiled globally. Suppression of [[wildfire]]s has allowed larger climax forest vegetation to take over in most one-time barrens. In North America, the largest natural pine barrens exist primarily in parts of the American [[Midwest]] and in dry sandy areas along the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].

==In popular culture==
;Literature
[[John McPhee]]'s book, titled ''[[The Pine Barrens]]'' (1968), explores the history, ecology, and geography of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]]. His account is also infused with his personal memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McPhee |first=John |title=The Pine Barrens |isbn=978-0-374-51442-6 |year=1968 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux }}&lt;/ref&gt; His book contributed to a reappraisal of the ecological role of pine barrens; in New Jersey and on eastern Long Island, they contribute to preserving the amount and quality of vital groundwater supplies in underground aquifers.

The New Jersey Pine Barrens is the setting of Voltaire's horror novel ''[[Call of the Jersey Devil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voltaire |first1=Aurelio |title=Call of the Jersey Devil |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Spence City |pages=352 |edition= 1st|asin=B00CXWC7I6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Television
Season 3, episode 11 of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', titled [[Pine Barrens (The Sopranos)|"Pine Barrens"]] (airdate May 6, 2001), is purportedly set largely in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, although filming of the forest scenes actually took place in [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-sopranos-pine-barrens-50194 |title=''The Sopranos'': "Pine Barrens" |last=VanDerWerff |first=Todd |publisher=Onion Inc. |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=December 17, 2000|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/nyregion/sopranos-banned-from-county-property.html|title=The Sopranos banned from County Property}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BookPB"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter="This Thing of Ours": Creating ''The Sopranos'' Universe |page=178-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sopranos: The Complete Book |last1=Martin |first1=Brett |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-933821-18-4 |chapter=Welcome to New Jersey: A Sense of Place |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard John Chorley''' (4 September 1927 – 12 May 2002) was an English geographer, and Professor of Geography at [[Cambridge University]], known as leading figure in [[Quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] in the late 20th century, who played an instrumental role in bringing in the use of [[systems theory]] to geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson, Michael C.]] ''Systems approaches to management.'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
===Early education===
Chorley was born in [[Minehead]], [[Somerset]] in an area known as the [[West Country]], with roots in [[Exmoor]] and the Vale of [[Taunton Deane]]. He was a product of a local primary school and Minehead Grammar School. Later on, Chorley began studying [[Geomorphology]] as an undergraduate at the School of [[Geography]] at [[Oxford]]. He served with the [[Royal Engineers]] from 1946 to 1948 and made it Lieutenant. Afterwards he went up to [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], where he obtained his BA with Honours in 1951. Later in 1954 he also obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] at Oxford University, and in 1974 his [[Sc.D.]] at Cambridge University.

At Oxford he was greatly influenced by R.P. Beckinsale, who advised Chorley to go on to graduate study in the United States. He made a transatlantic move in 1951 as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] to [[Columbia University]] where he was a graduate student in the Geology Department and explored the quantitative approach to land form evolution. 

===Career development===
Chorley started his academic career as Instructor in Geography at Columbia University, New York in 1952. In 1954 he moved to [[Brown University]], Providence, USA, where he was appointed Instructor in Geology. In 1957, Chorley needed to return to Britain for family reasons. In 1958 he was appointed a Demonstrator at [[Cambridge University]] and proceeded to move rapidly up the university hierarchy with a readership in 1970 and ad hominem chair in 1974.

From 1963 to 1978 he also co-directed the Madingley Geography Conferences. In 1964 was appointed British representative to the Commission on Quantitative Techniques of the [[International Geographical Union]], where he was nominated chairman in 1968. In the same year he was also appointed Chairman of the Committee on the Role of Models and Quantitative techniques in Geographical Teaching of the [[Geographical Association]].

At Cambridge University from 1970 to 1975 Chorley served as Secretary of the Faculty Board of Geography and Geology. In 1972 he was appointed Deputy Head of the Department of Geography, Cambridge University, for the Lent and Michaelmas terms, and from 1984 to 1989 he was Head of the [[Department of Geography, Cambridge University]]. In 1990 he was elected Vice-Master, [[Sidney Sussex College]], Cambridge University.

===Awards and honours===
Chorley received a series of Awards and honours, such as:
*1967 Awarded the Gill Memorial of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for contributions to Physical Geography and quantitative studies.
*1974 Elected first honorary life member of the [[British Geomorphological Research Group]].
*1981 Honors Award, [[Association of American Geographers]]
*1987 Awarded the [[Gold_Medal_(RGS)|Patron's Medal]] of the Royal Geographical Society
*1988 Elected an Honorary Member of the Italian Geographical Society
*1988 Elected to the Council of the Royal Geographical Society

=== Death===
Chorley died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 May 2002 following a heart attack and was buried in Cambridge's Ascension Parish Burial Ground on the 21st; he was survived by his wife, Rosemary, and their two children.

He is buried at the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge. He married Rosemary More in 1965 and they had one son and one daughter. 

== Work ==
=== Physical geography at Cambridge ===
Cambridge had provided the launching pad for Chorley's revolutionary ideas. He rejected the prevailing [[paradigm]] of the Davisian [[cycle of erosion|cycles of erosion]] and sought to replace these with a quantitative model-based paradigm with an emphasis on [[General Systems Theory]] and numerical modelling.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Richard Chorley's negative assessment of Davis theories led [[Cliff Ollier]] to state that "'Davis bashing' was a theme" for Chorley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ollier |first=Cliff |author-link=Cliff Ollier |date=2014|chapter=Some Principles in the Study of Plantion Surfaces |title=Gondwana Landscapes in southern South America |editor-last=Rabassa|editor-first=Jorge|editor-link=Jorge Rabassa|editor-last2=Ollier|editor-first2=Cliff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcLEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=%22davis+bashing%22+ollier&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VUgVRGiCu6&amp;sig=1spfrtr9_jwCV0cTjDKsFiqdoGY&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOqvPo6KjQAhXLg5AKHTp_BjIQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22davis%20bashing%22%20ollier&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=47–48 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cambridge contained a strong group in [[physical geography]] with colleagues that encouraged Chorley's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-richard-chorley-36171.html Obituary in The Independent, Saturday May 18th, 2002
| title = Professor Richard John Chorley
| accessdate = 25 November 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided a good environment for him to conduct his experiments. Chorley produced volumes of scientific papers in physical geography that [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] his approach and allowed him to ask new questions about earth surface processes and ways they can be studied. Central to these was the concept of system dynamics, and his production of ''Physical Geography: A Systems Approach'' (1971) and ''Environmental Systems'' (1978) that influenced a generation of scholars. 

Chorley's studies ranged into [[climatology]] and [[hydrology]] where he cooperated with Colorado meteorologist Roger Barry on the text, ''Atmosphere, Weather and Climate'' (1968). Many of his writings were jointly authored or edited, including ''Water, Earth and Man'' (1969). In addition, Chorley launched in 1964 the first of a series of text on ''The History of the Study of Landforms''. Two further volumes were published in 1973 and 1991. At the time of Chorley's death, Volume 4 was nearing completion.

===''Progress in Geography''===
Instead of confining himself to physical geography, Chorley took a broad approach to change in geography as a whole. He did this first through a series of annual summer conferences held at [[Madingley Hall]] [[Madingley|near Cambridge]], where his lectures helped form a basis of a series of volumes (notably ''Models in Geography'', 1967) that influenced the discipline. 

The second was by founding an annual series, "Progress in Geography", later converted into two influential quarterly journals, in which changes over the whole discipline could be recorded and assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Société de Géographie''' ([[French language|French]], "Geographical Society"), is the world's oldest geographical society. It was founded in 1821 as the first Geographic Society.&lt;ref&gt;Other geographic societies were soon founded: Berlin (1828), London (1830), Frankfort (1836), [[Russian Geographical Society|St. Petersburg (1845)]], New York (1852), Vienna (1856), Geneva (1858), Mexico City (1859).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1878, its headquarters have been at 184 [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]], [[Paris]]. The entrance is marked by two gigantic [[caryatid]]s representing ''Land'' and ''Sea''. It was here, in 1879, that the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] was decided.

==History==
The Geographical Society was founded at a meeting on 15 December 1821 in the [[Paris Hôtel de Ville]]. Among its 217 founders were some of the greatest scientific names of the time, including [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (the Society's first president), [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Charles Pierre Chapsal]], [[Dominique Vivant|Vivant Denon]], [[Joseph Fourier]], [[Gay-Lussac]], [[Claude Louis Berthollet]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Champollion]], and [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]. Most of the men who had accompanied [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] in his Egyptian expedition were members: [[Edme-François Jomard]], [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]], [[Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert]], [[Hottinguer]], [[Didot family#Henri Didot|Henri Didot]], [[Bottin]] and others such as [[Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès]].

The Society was the location of the [[Arab Congress of 1913]], which took place from June 18 to June 23 of that year and marked the confluence of events surrounding the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the beginnings of [[Arab nationalism]], and early Arab reaction to [[Zionism|Zionist]] immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

==Publications==
The Society's revue has appeared monthly since 1822, as ''Bulletin de la Société de Géographie'' (1822–1899) &amp;mdash; offering in octavo format early news of all the discoveries of the nineteenth century &amp;mdash; or quarterly, as ''La Géographie'', with a break in 1940–46. Since 1947 the Society's magazine has appeared three times a year, as ''Acta Geographica''. 

The Society's library, map collection and photograph collection are among the world's deepest and most comprehensive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">'''Thermae Basilicae''' was a town in the [[Roman province]] of [[Cappadocia Prima]]. Accordingly, its [[bishopric]], which is included in the [[Catholic Church]]'s list of [[titular see]]s, was a [[Suffragan diocese|suffragan]] of [[Kayseri|Caesarea in Cappadocia]], the capital of the province.&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The town is mentioned as Therma by [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]] (Synecdemus, 699, 2) and is quite probably to be identified with Aquae Sarvenae, which the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] places on the road between Tavium and Caesarea, and with Sarvena, a city described on an inscription and by Ptolemy (V, 6, 12). This would be today Terzili Hammam, a village about 60 miles north of Caesarea, where there are hot mineral sulphur waters, still frequented. A part of the building containing the baths is of Roman construction; a Christian inscription has been found thereon.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Thermae Basilicae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Down to the 13th century, the [[Notitiae episcopatuum]] describe the see as the first suffragan of Caesarea. Perhaps there was a bishop from the time of St. Basil; in any case four others are mentioned: Firminus, present at the [[Council of Chalcedon]], 451; Photinus, at a Council of Constantinople in 459; Musonius, exiled by Justin I, about 518; Theodore, present at the [[Sixth Ecumenical Council]] of Constantinople, 681, and at the [[Council in Trullo]], 692,&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

'''Thomas Richard Owen''' (1918–1990), also known as 'Dick' or 'T.R.' Owen, was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[geologist]] with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the rocks of Wales, ranging from regional [[stratigraphy]] and [[tectonics]] to [[geomorphology]] and [[marine geology]]. His research was mainly on the [[Carboniferous]] rocks of [[South Wales]].&lt;ref name=ccgc&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Thomas Richard (Dick) Owen (1918-1990)|url=http://www.ccgc.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/geological-gems/geologists-who-changed-the-map/professor-thomas-richard-owen.aspx|publisher=ccgc.gov.uk|accessdate=30 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195130/http://www.ccgc.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/geological-gems/geologists-who-changed-the-map/professor-thomas-richard-owen.aspx|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite book|title=Geology Explained in South Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Geology_Explained_in_South_Wales.html?id=0C9_PQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=google.com.np|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Thomas Richard Owen|url=https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Richard-Owen/e/B0034OZ90A|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swga&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOLOGISTS’ ASSOCIATION, SOUTH WALES GROUP|url=http://www.swga.org.uk/pdf/thomas.pdf|publisher=swga.org.uk|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in Aberdare to a mining family, Dick Owen won a scholarship to [[Merthyr Tydfil]] Grammar School and graduated with first class honours in geology from [[Swansea University]] in 1939. He carried out his postgraduate studies there for the next two years, researching the structure of the [[Vale of Neath]], and was associated with teaching at the university for a further 35 years.

His association with [[Swansea]] was interrupted by the [[World War II|Second World War]], during which he served as a [[Meteorology|meteorological]] officer in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], rising to the rank of [[Flight lieutenant]].  While he was based in the [[Azores]], one of his most memorable experiences was deciding, on meteorological grounds, whether it was suitable for [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to hold their famous meeting in the mid-Atlantic.

His work on the Vale of Neath was published by the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]] in 1954 and was swiftly recognised as a classic. He also wrote and edited a series of papers and books that included ''[[Waterfall Country (Wales)|Geology Explained in South Wales]]'' and ''The Upper [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] and Post-Palaeozoic Rocks of Wales''. Owen’s almost cartoon-like geological sketches became his hallmark, and illustrated his profound desire for people of all backgrounds and abilities to appreciate the magnificent geology of his native land.

Owen chaired the [[South Wales Geologists' Association|South Wales Group of the Geologists’ Association]], and an annual T.R. Owen memorial lecture has been instituted in his memory.
