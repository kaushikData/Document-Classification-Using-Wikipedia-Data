The '''2003 Ringera Judiciary Report'''  was a [[Kenya]] Government report published by the ''Integrity and Anti-Corruption Committee of the Judiciary in Kenya'' in order to implement a policy known as ''radical surgery'' introduced by the new government of President [[Mwai Kibaki]]. The committee was led by Justice [[Aaron Ringera]]. 

==Impact and aftermath==
From the report 5 of 9 [[Court of Appeal of Kenya|Court of Appeal]] Justices, 18 of 36 [[High Court of Kenya|High Court]] Judges and 82 out of 254 Magistrates were implicated as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.icj-kenya.org/index.php/media-centre/press-releases/221-summary-of-issues-to-be-highlighted-in-icj-mission-report-for-release-to-the-press |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083836/http://www.icj-kenya.org/index.php/media-centre/press-releases/221-summary-of-issues-to-be-highlighted-in-icj-mission-report-for-release-to-the-press |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A two-week ultimatum to either resign or be dismissed was issued to these Justices and Magistrates. 
Several resigned or “retired”, while some mounted legal challenges against their dismissals. Tribunals to hear these cases then begun.
Justice [[Philip Waki]] was acquitted in late 2004.

In 2007, a series of '''anti-government protests''' took place across [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The demonstrations peaked on 2 November 2007, when 50,000–100,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/03/world/europe/03tbilisi.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Thousands Rally in Capital Against Georgia President], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; rallied in downtown [[Tbilisi]], the capital of Georgia.&lt;ref name="TearGas"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7082317.stm |title=Tear gas used on Georgia protest |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 November 2007 |date=7 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071107171137/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7082317.stm| archivedate= 7 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; People protested against the allegedly corrupt government of president [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]. Protests triggered by detention of Georgian politician [[Irakli Okruashvili]] on charges of [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], and abuse of office during his tenure as defense minister of the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/09/2D3437D8-DFF1-4E8B-8411-7B7738FA60E3.html Former Defense Minister Detained In Georgia]. [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]. 27 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were organized by the National Council, an ad-hoc coalition of ten opposition parties, and financed by the media tycoon [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16119 Patarkatsishvili Pledges to Finance Protest Rallies]. Civil Georgia. 28 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations occurred both in September and November 2007 and were initially largely peaceful. The protests went downhill by 6 November 2007, but turned violent the next day when the [[Law enforcement in Georgia (country)|police]], using heavy-handed tactics, including tear gas and water cannon, unblocked [[Rustaveli Avenue]], Tbilisi's main boulevard, dislodged the protesters from the territory adjoining to the [[Parliament of Georgia|House of Parliament]], and prevented the demonstrators from resuming the protests. The government accused the Russian secret services of being involved in an attempted coup d'état and declared a nationwide [[state of emergency]] later that day which lasted until late 16 November 2007.

On 8 November 2007, President Saakashvili announced a compromise solution to hold an [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|early presidential election]] for 5 January 2008. He also proposed to hold a [[Georgian legislative election date referendum, 2008|referendum in parallel]] to snap presidential elections about when to hold [[Georgian legislative election, 2008|parliamentary polls]] – in spring as pushed for by the opposition parties, or in late 2008.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=16262 Saakashvili Calls Snap Presidential Polls, Referendum]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Civil Georgia. 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said to have been the worst political crisis in Georgia since the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003 that brought Saakashvili's government to power in the first place.&lt;ref name="TearGas"/&gt;

==Background==
{{Georgia-Russia}}
Georgia in 2003 underwent a [[Rose Revolution|change of leadership]] that saw the coming to power of [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] in 2004. Saakashvili, a U.S. trained lawyer and staunch advocate for closer integration with the [[NATO]] and [[European Union]], instituted reforms that saw the nation's GDP triple and corruption drop since taking office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/69554 Protesting the CEO of Georgia] Newsweek 18 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[World Bank]] named Georgia as the top reformer in the world.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0235425420071107 FACTBOX: Georgia's Saakashvili divides country]. [[Reuters]]. 7 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the progress, a significant portion of Georgia's population still live below the poverty line and Georgia is one of the poorest countries in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. Growing incomes are offset by rising inflation; radical economic reforms and a crackdown on the black market left thousands unemployed; and since the reforms, many Georgians are having to pay tax and utility bills in full. Although the Saakashvili government has declared war on corruption, its critics alleges corruption in Saakashvili's own team, including his uncle – the entrepreneur Temur Alasania – and several ministers. The opponents say the authorities use selective application of the law to sideline political opponents, and accuse Saakashvili of authoritarian rule. The government has also come under the fire of criticism due to the use of heavy-handed police against the 2006 prison riot, as well as due to the underinvestigated [[Sandro Girgvliani Murder Case|high-profile murder case]] involving police officers.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

Saakashvili also inherited the issues of the Russian-backed [[diplomatic recognition|unrecognized]] breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which seceded from Georgia in the early 1990s. As of the time of the demonstrations, they were de facto [[Independence|independent]] but [[de jure]] part of Georgia. Saakashvili had made it part of his agenda to reincorporate them through peaceful means.{{Dubious|date=November 2008}} Others within Saakashvili's government, such as the defence minister [[Irakli Okruashvili]] had been pushing for a military solution for these de facto republics.

Saaskashvili reassigned the [[Portfolio (government)|portfolio]] of Okruashvili from defence to Minister of the Economy in November 2006. It was believed that the reassignment came due to Okruashvili’s aggressive stance on the secessionist conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/11/c3b48026-d616-4c76-8dbb-f4256c36577f.html Georgia: What Led To Defense Minister's Demotion?] RadioFreeEurope RadioLiberty 14 November 2006 By Liz Fuller&lt;/ref&gt; Okruashvili subsequently resigned his post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav111706a.shtml GEORGIA: FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER SUBMITS "SHOCK" RESIGNATION] EURASIA INSIGHT Molly Corso 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2007, he announced the formation of the new opposition Movement for United Georgia and unleashed criticism on President Saakashvili, accusing him of corruption, incompetency and human rights violations. He also raised new concerns around [[Zurab Zhvania]]'s death, challenging the official investigation point of view&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=6946 Okruashvili Ups Ante on Former Allies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018172701/http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&amp;newsid=6946 |date=18 October 2015 }} – ''The Georgian Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and personally accused the Georgian president of planning the murder of businessman [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/09/95075e67-2429-48bd-8731-1591a00cb7f7.html |title=Praise, Scorn For Accusations Against Georgia President |publisher=Rferl.org |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/09/26/ap4157991.html Georgia's Ex-Minister Assails President] – Forbes, Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===28 September 2007 protests===
Protests started on 28 September 2007. There was no major trouble reported at the rally, except for some minor scuffles between protesters and police when the protesters spilled out onto [[Rustaveli Avenue]], blocking Tbilisi's main thoroughfare in front of the parliament. Demonstrators were demanding early elections, more accountability and honesty in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3010190.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Huge protests in Tbilisi demand election after corruption claims | first=Shaun | last=Walker | date=29 September 2007 | accessdate=22 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014223051/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3010190.ece | archivedate=14 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rally was organized by an alliance of major opposition parties with the exception of the [[New Right (Georgia)|New Rights]] which distanced themselves from the manifestation stating that it was "not the way from one temple to another, it is substitute of one leader with another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.primenewsonline.com/news/121/ARTICLE/15774/2007-09-28.html "New Rights" Not To Participate In Rally In Front Of Parliament]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Prime News Online. 28 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Okruashvili's comments====

Previously, former Georgian Minister of Defense and long-time critic of Moscow's policy towards Georgia Irakly Okruashvili has lashed out at his former associate President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]]. Okruashvili had been sacked by the president, in November 2006, from his post of Defense Minister allegedly under pressure from the West in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2885338820070928 Thousands protest against Georgia president]. [[Reuters]]. 28 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the presentation of his party [[For United Georgia]], he accused Saakashvili of corruption, lobbying the interests of his own family,&lt;ref&gt;Okruashvili claimed he caught the president's uncle with a US$200,000 bribe three years ago.&lt;/ref&gt; weakness towards separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,&lt;ref name="HugeRally"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7018698.stm |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2007 |title=Huge rally against Georgia bleader |publisher=BBC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109073137/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7018698.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of morals.&lt;ref name="OkruashviliAccusations"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20070926/81123901.html |title=Why did Okruashvili "attack" Saakashvili? |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=8 November 2007 |publisher=en.rian.ru |last=Shesternina |first=Yelena| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071105032922/http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20070926/81123901.html| archivedate= 5 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okruashvili also claimed that the Georgian government had intentionally obscured the true reasons behind the death of former Prime Minister [[Zurab Zhvania]]. Zhvania had died while Prime Minister in February 2005. Okruashvili said that Zhvania's corpse had been taken to the apartment where he was found dead.&lt;ref name="OkruashviliAccusations"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zurab Zhvania officially died of accidental poisoning with [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Okruashvili retracted his statements and admitted to the charges raised against him on 8 October 2007 on television, but he later said he made the statements due to being "psychologically pressured".&lt;ref name="PhycPressure"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/1480_november_7_2007/1480_okruashvili.html |title=Okruashvili, a ‘political refugee’ in Germany, vows to unseat the president |publisher=messenger.com.ge |accessdate=8 November 2007 |date=7 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7033966.stm |work=BBC News | title=Georgian ex-minister 'confesses' | date=8 October 2007 | accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asatiani |first=Salome |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/10/3cc45581-d86d-4885-bcf3-45097e1c290d.html |title=Georgia: In Televised About-Face, Ex-Minister Retracts Murder Claims – RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |publisher=Rferl.org |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Okruashvili left Georgia around 1 November 2007. He subsequently said he was forced into exile; the government said he left to seek medical treatment.&lt;ref name="rfe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/129f6da9-b5b6-400d-9160-ea0e53baa35f.html |title=Georgia: Firebrand Okruashvili’s Televised Return Boosts Opposition – RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY |publisher=Rferl.org |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following April he was granted [[political asylum]] by the government of France. In September 2008, a French court rejected Georgia's extradition request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/Top_News/2008-09-10/France_wont_extradite_former_Georgian_defence_minister.html |title=France won't extradite former Georgian defence minister |publisher=Rt.com |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910201630/http://rt.com/Top_News/2008-09-10/France_wont_extradite_former_Georgian_defence_minister.html |archivedate=10 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Okruashvili has been described as "a likely candidate to replace Saakashvili, if and when Georgian public opinion turns against the president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/JH12Ag02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: Central Asian News and current affairs, Russia, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan |publisher=Atimes.com |date=12 August 2008 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government's response====
[[File:Mikhail Saakashvili 2005May10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mikhail Saakashvili]], Georgia's president]]
Okruashvili's political comeback and his arrest coincided with Saakashvili's visit to New York City where he addressed the [[U.N. General Assembly]] and heavily criticized Russia's involvement in Georgia's breakaway territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=15884 Saakashvili Attacks Russia in UN Speech]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Civil Georgia''. 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Giga Bokeria]], an influential member of the [[Parliament of Georgia]] from the ruling [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] party, said by voicing stunning, but groundless accusations Okruashvili wanted "to create some kind of immunity and untouchable status." On 29 September, President Saakashvili headed to [[Upper Abkhazia]] where he attended opening of a new road linking Georgian-controlled areas in breakaway Abkhazia with Georgia proper. He made his first remarks on Okruashvili's accusations:

===2 November 2007 protests===
[[File:Protest in Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|Opposition protests in Tbilisi on 2 November 2007. The inscription says "I am not afraid" (Georgian).]]
On 2 November 2007, tens of thousands of Georgians protested outside the parliament in the capital, Tbilisi, urging President Mikhail Saakashvili to step down. The crowd also called for early parliamentary elections. They accused Saakashvili of heading a corrupt, authoritarian government and wanted him to be ousted democratically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7074585.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mass protest in Georgian capital | date=3 November 2007 | accessdate=22 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420233228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7074585.stm| archivedate= 20 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests continued in the following days;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071106.wgeorgia1106/BNStory/International/home | location=Toronto |work=Globe and Mail | title=globeandmail.com: World| accessdate= 6 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a televised statement from Okruashvili was seen as a boost in support for the opposition.&lt;ref name="rfe1"/&gt;

Twenty-three law enforcement officers were injured and 21 people were arrested during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16252 21 People Arrested – Police]. Civil Georgia. 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two pro-opposition independent TV stations have gone off the air after [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]] declared that "Nobody should doubt that all my efforts, my financial resources including the last [[tetri]] will be applied for freeing Georgia from Fascist regime": [[Imedi TV]] (that is co-owned by the media tycoon [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]] who sponsored the National Council recently set up by the ten opposition parties and has pledged to finance the rallies until the government is removed) and Kavkasia, located in the same building as Imedi TV.&lt;ref&gt;CNN, [http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/07/georgia.crisis.ap/index.html Georgia: State of emergency called], 11 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers in masks and assault rifles were seen sealing off the Imedi office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16234 |title=Online Magazine – Civil Georgia |publisher=Civil.ge |date=1 July 2001 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Mikheil Saakashvili declared a [[state of emergency]] Georgia-wide to last for 15 days. As a result, news programs at all the private television stations will be shut down for 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7083911.stm Georgia declares emergency state], 11 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The publicly funded [[Georgian Public Broadcaster]] (GPB) remained the only station allowed to provide news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16239 Emergency Rule in Georgia, News Coverage Curtailed]. Civil Georgia. 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November, a "small group of students" gathered at [[Batumi]] State University to rally against what they saw as the "police violence" that had occurred the previous day. According to eyewitnesses interviewed by [[Human Rights Watch]], "police attacked the group without warning, chasing and beating protesters trying to flee." Holly Cartner, Executive Director [of] Europe and Central Asia Division at [[Human Rights Watch]] condemned what she described as "police attacks on peaceful protesters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/11/08/georgi17284.htm |title=Georgia: Police Beat Peaceful Protesters for Second Day (Human Rights Watch, 8 November 2007) |publisher=Hrw.org |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, Georgia's opposition announced the suspension of anti-government protests in Tbilisi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-11-08-voa21.cfm Saakashvili Proposes Georgian Presidential Elections in January] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109114059/http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-11-08-voa21.cfm |date=9 November 2007 }}. [[Voice of America|VOA News]]. 8 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the opposition parties hailed President Saakashvili’s decision as the first step to end the political standoff, and agreed to the negotiations with [[Nino Burjanadze]], the parliamentary chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070611065820/http://www.civil.ge/eng/detail.php?id=16267 Crisis Receding as Election Season Begins to Unfold]. Civil Georgia. 9 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 9 November 2007, riot police and troops had been withdrawn from the main sites of 7 November unrest. On the same day, [[Ilia II]], [[Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia|Catholicos-Patriarch]] of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] met separately with Nino Burjanadze and opposition leaders and said that he was ready to mediate between the opposition and the authorities.

Saakasvili commented the clashes by saying "We have been hearing for recent months that turmoil was expected in Georgia by autumn. We have been receiving this information from our intelligence" and that "alternative government has already been set up in Moscow".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16229 Saakashvili Makes a Statement] Civil Georgia, 7 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gigi Ugulava]], Tbilisi's mayor, defended the action by police, saying: "I was listening to one of the opposition leaders who was saying proudly they planned to pitch tents and set up a tent town in Tbilisi. "What we did is stop this because it is the will of the people not to have a tent town in Tbilisi."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/B38F9318-A9CB-42F9-9D61-EBCAA0654293.htm Georgia declares state of emergency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109105417/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/B38F9318-A9CB-42F9-9D61-EBCAA0654293.htm |date=9 November 2007 }} Al Jazeera, 7 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of government actions====
[[File:Demonstrations in Tbilisi, Georgia. 7 November 2007.jpg|thumb|Clashes in Tbilisi on 7 November 2007.]]
The opposition leaders, NGOs and the public defender of Georgia have harshly criticised the government actions. The police was accused of excessiveness, and it was alleged that groups of organized civilians{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} were also engaged in the crackdown on the protesters. Illegal arrests, beatings and intimidations were reported.&lt;ref name=civil071112&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16311 Ruling Party, Opposition End Second round of Talks] civil.ge 12 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been expressed about widespread practice of tapping private telephone conversations.&lt;ref name=civil071118&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16361] civil.ge 18 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The government has been accused of media control.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
In December 2008, [[Sozar Subari]], Public Defender ([[Ombudsman]]) of Georgia, claimed he had evidence that then Georgia's [[Interior Minister]] [[Vano Merabishvili]] had ordered police to beat protesters, "mainly in the kidneys and the stomach."&lt;ref name="ipn.ge"&gt;[http://www.ipn.ge/en/index.php?news=4741&amp;hd_line=1] Sozar Subari Spoke about ‘The Last Supper’ of Merabishvili-Kezerashvili-Akhalaia-Adeishvili&lt;/ref&gt; In his testimony before [[Parliament of Georgia|Georgian Parliament]], Subari claimed that he possessed evidence that [[Defense Minister]] [[Davit Kezerashvili]], [[Justice Minister]] [[Zurab Adeishvili]] and Davit Akhalaia (who had no official office then) had had a secret meeting at the office of Interior Ministry on 4 November 2007 where they had decided on the course of action for handling the demonstrations: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The interior minister ordered that the demonstrators be hit mainly in the kidneys and the stomach, or in the face only when necessary. The interior minister also said at the meeting that not a single participant in the action must escape unbeaten in order to teach them a lesson for the future."&lt;ref name="ipn.ge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com/3/459460/news.aspx] Georgia minister ordered beating of demonstrators – ombudsman&lt;/ref&gt;

===25 November 2007 protests===
On 25 November 2007, thousands of protesters staged a three-hour peaceful demonstration demanding the re-opening of Imedi TV and radio stations. The protest, organized by a nine party opposition coalition, gathered in an area called the Rike in Tblisi and then moved to the front of the [[Parliament of Georgia|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''{{Flagu|Sweden}}''' – Foreign minister [[Carl Bildt]] said that 7 November was a "very dark day for Georgia", but praised the decision to hold early presidential elections, adding that all parties now have to "return to the democratic path".

'''{{flag|United Nations}}''' – [[Louise Arbour]], the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], rebuked Georgia for its "disproportionate use of force" against protesters and said it must uphold fundamental rights even under a state of emergency. In a statement, she also expressed support for Georgia's public defender, or human rights ombudsman, and voiced concern at the silencing of independent television stations in the former Soviet republic.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL08332924 UN rights boss rebukes Georgia for use of force] reuters.com, Stephanie Nebehay, 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Crisis recedes===
On 8 November 2007, Saakashvili announced he was planning [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|snap presidential elections]] for 5 January 2008. He also proposed to hold a simultaneous [[Georgian legislative election date referendum, 2008|plebiscite]] about when to hold [[Georgian legislative election, 2008|parliamentary polls]] – in spring as pushed for by the opposition parties, or in late 2008. He also called for dialogue with the opposition parties which, he said, did not cooperate with the Russian intelligence, and promised to end the state of emergency within a few days.&lt;ref name="civil.ge"/&gt;

The Georgian authorities charged Patarkatsishvili, who had earlier left for London, with plotting a coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16273 Patarkatsishvili Suspected of "Coup Plotting"]. Civil Georgia. 9 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 12 February 2008, in London.

On 9 November 2007, the Parliament of Georgia, in a complete absence of opposition lawmakers, backed the presidential decree imposing state of emergency and restrictions on media on the entire territory of Georgia to be in force until late 22 November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=16275 Parliament Backs Emergency Rules].

===Economic impact===
Robert Christiansen, the head of the IMF's Georgia mission, indicated that the turmoil and pre-election uncertainty has dented Georgia's image with investors, adding that recovery was possible. He added that "recent political developments add considerable uncertainty to the projected volume of inflows for the remainder of this year and 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Aistyonok''' ({{lang-ru|Аистёнок}}, ''[[Stork]]''; [[GRAU]] designation '''1L271''') is a [[Counter-battery radar]] system developed and produced by [[Almaz-Antey]] for the [[Russian Armed Forces]]. It is a mobile [[radar]] for the purpose of detecting position of fire weapons such as [[field artillery]] and [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], calculating the [[trajectory]] of incoming [[Artillery shell|shells]], and the control of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]]. Aistyonok can detect moving ground targets at a distance of up to {{convert|20|km|sp=us}}, with capabilities to detect [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire positions at a distance of up to {{convert|5|km|sp=us}}, moving ground equipment at a distance of up to {{convert|20|km|sp=us}}, and the adjustment of artillery fire from {{convert|5|km|sp=us}} to {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} depending on the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.armyrecognition.com/weapons_defence_industry_military_technology_uk/artillery_units_of_the_russian_southern_military_district_to_operate_aistyonok_man-portable_radar_tass_12212161.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aistyonok system was debuted in 2008, and has since been introduced for limited use in the [[North Caucasus]] by the Russian Armed Forces.

'''Brenda Cherry''' (born March 19, 1958), is an American Civil Rights Activist from [[Paris, Texas]]. 

Cherry is the President and co-founder of Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, a non-profit [[civil rights organization]] located in Paris, Texas. Founded in 2003, CCFRE co-sponsored events with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], Lone Star Legal Aid, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Dept Intervene on Racial Tensions in Paris, TX (Public Meeting 1.29)|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/128805|publisher=PR.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal aid rally draws crowd|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_f4ce57b9-0e1a-5d4c-bc0d-85c9819316a6.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Cherry grew up in Blossom Texas. Her late father, Zeb Reynolds, was a farmer, and her mother, Irene Whitney, was a domestic worker.  She began school at T.G. Givens, which was then, a segregated school in Paris, Texas. She had to be bused 10 miles to the school even though there was a local school district in the town where she lived.  After the schools were forced to integrate, she attended the formerly "whites only" school in Blossom. Cherry graduated from [[Prairiland High School]] in [[Pattonville, Texas]]. She went on to attend [[Paris Junior College]] and [[East Texas State University]]. Cherry worked as a Licensed Vocational Nurse for 9 years before becoming a civil rights activist. Cherry has two daughters, Shauncia Cherry and Tiffany Cherry, and one son, Rico Lewis.

=== Schoolyard assault ===
On October 23, 2003, an 11-year-old black student was reportedly attacked by a principal at [[Crockett Middle School]] in Paris, Texas. The child was removed from the school and sent to a detention center. Cherry, along with a small group of people, including the child’s mother and grandfather, staged a protest in front of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest: Mother claims son beaten|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_aedc00d4-a144-5f26-8dac-3ec73fad0179.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest|url= http://theparisnews.com/article_9034f8b8-af93-51ad-991e-0be9af4bd6a7.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the protest, the child was released from the detention center. This event marked the beginning of several future protest demonstrations in the town.

=== Shaquanda Cotton ===

[[Shaquanda Cotton]] was an African-American student that attended Paris High School in Paris, Texas. On March 16, 2006, Cotton, aged 14, was arrested for allegedly shoving a school hall monitor. 
Having no prior criminal history, Cotton was tried and sentenced to up to 7 years in the [[Texas Youth Commission]]. During the same time frame, the judge in the case, Chuck Superville, sentenced a Caucasian 14-year-old girl who had a prior criminal history to probation after committing the confirmed crime of arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge keeps juvenile on probation|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_51118b41-045a-5e58-98e2-5fa7ffa0ca34.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Darwin Campbell with ''[[African-American News and Issues]]'' broke the story, which garnered attention to Cotton’s sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1-Willie Lynch and Jim Crow Join Forces in Lamar County to Destroy Black Youth |url=http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |publisher=African American News and Issues |accessdate=19 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105060808/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |archivedate=5 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving a year and one month in prison, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' story written by Howard Witt led the case to national exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To some in Paris, sinister past is back. |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703120170mar12,0,1435953.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large protest led by comedian [[Rickey Smiley]] was held at the Lamar County Courthouse in Paris, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiley: "It is time for a new movement." |url= http://theparisnews.com/news/article_0379c3d6-6538-5d24-a001-6427071e6af6.html|publisher= TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately two weeks after the ''Tribune'' article and protest, ShaQuanda was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl in prison for shove gets released early |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703310265mar31,0,4450616.story|publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry was interviewed by the [[BBC]] regarding Cotton, and the case was included in a BBC documentary by United Kingdom reporter Julian O'Halloran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fourteen, and at the heart of a race row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/7064473.stm|publisher= BBC News|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Julian|last=O'Halloran|date=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brandon McClelland ===
[[File:1parisrally.jpg|thumb|Rally for Brandon McClelland in Paris, Texas]]

[[Death of Brandon McClelland|Brandon McClelland]] was a 24-year-old African American male who lived in Paris, Texas. On September 16, 2008, his body was found partially dismembered and mutilated on a farm road approximately 17 miles from his home. The local newspaper, ''The Paris News'', reported the death as a hit-and-run by an unknown truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hit-run death still under investigation |url=  http://theparisnews.com/news/article_d11c225c-529d-5b19-ba81-3c9d45a5feee.html |publisher= The Paris News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activism of Cherry and the Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, the case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was his death a hate crime? |url=  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-05/news/0810040299_1_civil-rights-paris-unknown-driver |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Two charged with murder after black man dragged to death in troubled Paris, Texas |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-081212-paris-witt,0,3694385.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dispute about whether McClelland was dragged under the truck or behind it, and while awaiting autopsy reports, ''[[USA Today]]'' interviewed Cherry. "Authorities have not seriously considered the possibility that this was a hate crime. There's a problem in Paris, Texas. I don't see a difference in getting dragged behind a truck and getting dragged under a truck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Another dragging death in Texas raises tensions |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-10-24-164308463_x.htm |publisher= USA Today|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Jeff|last=Carlton|date=25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation revealed that McClelland was last seen alive with two Caucasian men, Shannon Finley and Charles Ryan Crostley, both of whom had extensive criminal history. ''[[Anderson Cooper 360°]]'' reported that the two men were charged with killing McClelland and both subsequently plead "not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The turbulent racial history of Paris, Texas |url=   http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/07/27/the-turbulent-racial-history-of-paris-texas/ |publisher= Anderson Cooper 360|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special prosecutor Toby Shook cited lack of evidence to the case, and the murder charges were dropped in June 2009. The two men were released. [[CBS News]] quoted Cherry, "His body was dragged and nobody gets charged? Even if a trucker came forward, that's all it takes? Even the trucker's not charged? If you hit someone, you don't get charged? Nobody gets charged with this? It's not surprising, but it's sad. It appears that a black man's life means nothing here in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Charges dropped in Texas Dragging Death |url=   http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5065180.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple protests have been led by Cherry, along with Jim Blackwell and the New Black Panther Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jasper-style lynching in Paris Texas? |url=   http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_5348.shtml |publisher= Final Call|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Protesters clash over Texas Dragging Death |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5176952.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains an open murder investigation.

=== Brandarian Thomas ===
Brandarian Thomas was a 14-year-old African American student at Travis Junior High School in Paris, Texas. In June 2008, Police handcuffed and arrested Thomas at his home for allegedly "touching a female student's butt and crotch" in class. Thomas denied the accusations. Thomas' mother contacted Cherry, who convinced her to take the case to trial rather than accept a plea deal. ''[[Texas Observer]]'' reporter Forrest Wilder documented the case. Cherry views the Cotton and Thomas prosecutions as extreme examples of a larger pattern of racial discrimination in Paris public schools. Cherry stated, "The black kids are punished more often, more harshly. I think they go to extremes; they punish them for little things. A lot of times, they see a black kid as more menacing." Though prosecutors offered a plea deal to Thomas (two years of probation in exchange for a guilty plea), Cherry helped convince Thomas' mother to take the matter to trial in front of the same judge who heard the Cotton case. "It's ridiculous," Cherry stated. "He was 14. You're going to ruin his life because you can't make him plead guilty?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Too black for school?

=== Cornelius Gill ===
Cornelius Gill was an 18-year-old African American high school student in Paris, Texas.  On November 11, 2009, Gill was picking up pecans when he was approached by a Paris police officer who questioned him about a stolen car that had been found a few blocks away. Gill refused to be questioned and said a curse word. The officer arrested Gill and placed him in handcuffs behind his back. When another police car pulled up, Gill was lifted and body slammed face down onto the vehicle. Cherry witnessed a portion of the incident and she, along with Gill's mother, filed a complaint with the Paris Police Department. Cherry obtained the video of the incident. Gill was sentenced to 100 days in jail by Judge Chuck Superville. Although the video footage shows no evidence of such, the officer claimed Gill assaulted him while placing him in the patrol car. Gill was charged with Assault of a Public Servant and Resisting Arrest. The complaint resulted in a suspension of the officer, but the suspension was lifted when the officer appealed. The case resulted in an outcry from civilians regarding police brutality and unnecessary force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Video of Black Teen's Arrest leads to more Paris Texas controversy |url= http://www.wiredprnews.com/2010/07/16/video-of-black-teens-arrest-leads-to-more-paris-texas-controversy_2010071612646.html|publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Small Texas Town Seized by Racial Controversy |url= http://www.blackradionetwork.com/small_texas_town_seized_by_racial_controversy |publisher= Minority News| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Released of Paris arrest incident |url= http://www.kxii.com/news/headlines/98466019.html |publisher= KXII.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', Cherry stated that the ruling sends a message to local police that they can do whatever they want. "What's going to stop the officer from doing that again and again? It makes me fearful," she said. The dash cam video was released after Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality filed an open records request. "We're already in a bad situation here in Paris, and this just makes it worse," Cherry stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Police Brutality VIDEO: SHOCKING Texas Incident Caught on Tape |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/cornelius-gill/1 |publisher= The Huffington Post| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bobby Yates ===
Bobby Yates was a 51-year-old African American man in Paris, Texas. Yates was paralyzed from the waist down due to a gunshot wound during a hunting accident approximately 20 years earlier. His lower body was removed from his hips down due to an infection. On a late night in 2008, Yates made a 911 call to the local police stating that he had been beaten by a 16-year-old white female and two adult males who were at his home that refused to leave. When the police came, the female claimed that Yates had sexually assaulted her. The two males were with her the entire time. The police sided with the female, and Yates was later arrested and charged with sexual assault. Cherry along with her organization held protests and filed complaints on Yates' behalf. After 3 years of legal action, the sexual assault charge was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lower Body Amputee Accused of Sexual Assault: Group Claims Racism is Factor |url=   http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/04/24/lower-body-amputee-accused-of-sexual-assault-group-claims-racism-is-factor_2011042418764.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Paris, Texas: ‘Mississippi 50 Years Ago’ |url= http://www.texasobserver.org/forrestforthetrees/paris-texas-mississippi-50-years-agol |publisher= Texas Observer |accessdate= 19 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aaron Hart ===
Aaron Hart was an 18-year-old mentally retarded youth with an IQ of 47 when he was arrested and charged with sexual assault. Hart had been playing with a 5-year-old child and they exposed and touched each other's private parts. At trial, Hart's court-appointed attorney called no witnesses on Hart's behalf and failed to obtain an independent doctor for a competency hearing. Judge Eric Clifford sentenced Hart to 100 years in prison on June 10, 2009, claiming that he had no other choice. Within the same time frame, Clifford had sentenced a defendant charged with the same offense, and without a disability, to four years in prison. Hart was allegedly sexually assaulted while awaiting trial in Lamar County Jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Aaron Hart allegedly sexually assaulted in jail |url= http://crimesandjustice.com/aaron-hart-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-jail |publisher= Crimes and Justice |accessdate= 19 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130121103611/http://crimesandjustice.com/aaron-hart-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-jail |archivedate= 21 January 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials look into alleged assault in jail |url= http://theparisnews.com/news/article_19602e8d-c803-520d-aac6-c25522d2b689.html|publisher= The Paris News| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry and her organization advocated on Hart's behalf. Numerous protest marches were held, led by CCFRE and Jim Blackwell of the Tarrant County Local Organizing Committee. The case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mentally Retarded Texas teen serving 100-year prison term for sex assault of boy |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_for_monapr06,0,5597484.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is just horrible," stated Cherry in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article after Judge Clifford made his ruling. "How could the judge not take his mental ability into consideration?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge won't reconsider 100-year prison term |url=  http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/08/nation/na-paris8|work= Los Angeles Times| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart was given a new trial on appeal. Hart ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 10 years in prison where he remains.

=== Turner Industries ===
[[File:Brenda Cherry and Turner men.jpg|thumb|left|Brenda Cherry with Turner Industries employees in Louisiana]]
Turner Industries is a privately owned industrial plant with facilities in several cities and states including Paris, Texas. In February 2009, Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality received complaints and photos regarding a noose, racist graffiti, Confederate flags, and salary and advancement discrimination against black workers in the Turner Industries Paris plant. Activism led to a federal investigation by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism bedevils Texas town |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_webfeb25,0,4203830.story |work= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Factory employees file federal racial discrimination, harassment complaint |url=  http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/41178052.html |publisher= KXII.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings led to a federal lawsuit which was settled out of court, as well as changes in Turner Industries employment practices. Cherry stated, "One of my biggest concerns regarding the racist graffiti, noose, and other things found at the plant is the mentality of those who put it there. Those same people serve on juries, and some go on to have supervisory positions or other positions of authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noose, Racist Graffiti Proves Efforts Must Continue to Expose 'Ghosts' and Truths About Paris Racism |url=http://www.lonestarpowerpages.com/feb-21-2009---special-report.html |publisher= LoneStarPowerPages.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turner Industries investigation was one of the largest civil rights investigations ever undertaken in the State of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nooses, Swastikas, Racist Graffiti Harass Employees of Texas Company – EEOC |url= http://www.bvblackspin.com/2010/04/15/nooses-swastikas-racist-graffitti-harass-black-employees-of-te/ |publisher= Black Spin| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roping and bullying of autistic student ===
On April 20, 2011, a 14-year-old African American autistic student was taken by an 18-year-old Caucasian student into the greenhouse at Paris High School. The 18-year-old threw a rope over a beam and placed the other end around the waist of the 14-year-old. He kicked his feet and beat his hand with a stick until bloody when the 14-year-old attempted to get free. The girlfriend of the 18-year-old student stood laughing and recorded the incident with her cell phone. When the group returned to class, a male teacher took the recording and erased it. After the school refused to discipline the 18-year-old and his girlfriend, or the teacher who erased the evidence, Cherry and CCFRE advocated on behalf of the mother, Tina Washington, and her son. The county attorney refused to charge the 18-year-old student even though it was a felony offense. Several protests were led by Cherry and Jim Blackwell regarding the incident. The case is currently under investigation by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Autistic Teen roped by another student, Recording erased by Teacher |url=     http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/07/24/autistic-teen-roped-by-another-student-recording-erased-by-teacher_2011072420998.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality co-sponsored a community reconciliation meeting with the U.S. Department of Justice which was featured in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. "I'm here to talk about racism. I don't see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn't exist," stated Cherry. "When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detention—it's racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that's not racism, what is it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hard truth, but little reconciliation in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-paris-web31,0,922958.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Organizations to hold community forum on school discipline in Paris, Texas |url=  http://www.aclutx.org/2010/11/30/organizations-to-hold-community-forum-on-school-discipline-in-paris-texas/ |publisher= American Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This town is being forced to look at things they never wanted to look at before," stated Cherry in an excerpt from ''[[Newsweek]]''. Cherry, along with Lone Star Legal Aid, a local nonprofit law firm, compiled statistics showing that the Paris Independent School District punished black kids eight times more often than white ones, even though blacks make up a minority of the population. The U.S. Department of Education ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to attribute the discrepancy to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Problems in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/01/30/problems-in-paris-texas.html |publisher= Newsweek Magazine| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Cherry, "I think we are probably stuck in 1930 right about now. If you complain about anything, you are going to be punished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Killing Stirs Racial Unease in Texas |url=     https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15paris.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2 |publisher= The New York Times| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=James C.|last=McKinley Jr|date=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherry has been an advocate for civil and human rights, and continues her work to address race and humanitarian issues.

'''Camp of Great Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Obóz Wielkiej Polski}}, OWP) was a [[far-right]],&lt;ref name=pwn&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3949407 Obóz Wielkiej Polski], [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|Encyklopedia PWN]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[nationalist]]&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt; political organization of [[National Democracy]] in [[interwar]] [[Poland]].

==History==
Camp of Great Poland was founded on 4 December 1926 in [[Poznań]] by [[Popular National Union]] (''Związek Ludowo-Narodowy'', ZLN) and other organizations of [[right-wing]] [[National Democracy]] political camp, led by [[Roman Dmowski]], to unite Polish right-wing organizations and oppose ''[[sanacja]]'' regime, which gained power following [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 264-265.&lt;/ref&gt; After merging with National Pupulist Union in 1928 OWP retained its autonomy within newly established [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] ({{lang-pl|Stronnictwo Narodowe}}).&lt;ref name="Lerski"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lerski|first= Jerzy Jan |title=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1996|pages=55–56|isbn=0-313-26007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 youth branch of the organization was established ({{lang-pl|Ruch Młodych Obozu Wielkiej Polski}}).,&lt;ref name="Michlic"&gt;{{Cite book| authorlink = Joanna Beata Michlic | last = Michlic | first = Joanna Beata | title = Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8032-3240-3 | url =  | pages = 112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which virtually dominated OWP by 1928.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; OWP positions in Polish universities among students were especially strong,&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crampton|first= R. J. |title=Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|pages=48|isbn= 0-415-05346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also gained popularity among workers and the [[lower middle class]].&lt;ref name="Michlic, p.316"&gt;Michlic, p.316&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1930 Camp of Great Poland had 35,000 members,&lt;ref name="Michlic, p.316"/&gt; in May 1932 its membership reached 120,000.&lt;ref name="Lerski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic, p.316"/&gt; By 1933 OWP claimed to have a quarter of a million followers.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|authorlink= Stanley G.

Outbreaks of the anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Galicia in 1927 led the organization to be banned in that region that year.&lt;ref name=dia&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/pl/site/slownik_terminow/antysemityzm Diapozytyw: Slownik terminow: Antysemityzm]&lt;/ref&gt; After a further wave of nationwide violence in 1933 OWP eventually banned in entire Poland.&lt;ref name=dia/&gt; Government, alarmed by rapid growth of OWP, banned the organization together with its youth movement&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; on 28 March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Wapiński 1980, 299.&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that these organizations threatened stability of the state.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; After dissolution of the organization, even more radical young members of OWP formed the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] ({{lang-pl|Obóz Narodowo Radykalny, ONR}}).&lt;ref name="Blinkhorn "&gt;{{Cite book|last= Blinkhorn |first=Martin|title=Fascism and the Right in Europe, 1919-1945|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2000 |pages=53|isbn=0-582-07021-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONR would be banned soon after its establishment, in 1934.&lt;ref name=dia/&gt;

==Organization==
Camp of Great Poland was led by the Great Council ({{lang-pl|Wielka Rada}}). The head of the Council, with the title of the Great Camp-maker ({{lang-pl|Wielki Oboźny}}) was [[Roman Dmowski]]; other notable members included [[Tadeusz Bielecki]], [[Marian Borzęcki]], [[Stanisław Haller]] and [[Roman Rybarski]].&lt;ref name=wiem&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/29639,,,,oboz_wielkiej_polski,haslo.html Obóz Wielkiej Polski] [[Encyklopedia WIEM]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Camp of Great Poland supported strongly religious [[corporative authoritarianism]],&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; borrowing some ideas from [[Italian fascism]].&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frucht|first=Richard C. |title=Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26|isbn= 1-57607-800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OWP did not pursue its goals on the political scene, increasingly controlled by [[Piłsudskiite]] [[Sanacja]]; instead it aimed to create a violent, revolutionary movement aimed at toppling the government.&lt;ref name=wiem/&gt; Camp of Great Poland even had its own fighting squads organized.&lt;ref name="Lerski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EE"/&gt;

OWP [[front organization]], the Green Ribbon League ({{lang-pl|Liga Zielonej Wstążki}}) actively propagated a boycott of the Jewish-owned businesses.&lt;ref name="Melzer"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Melzer |first=Emanuel|title=No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939|publisher= Hebrew Union College Press|year=1997|pages=6|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1930s OWP campaigned for [[numerus nullus]], a policy of complete exclusion of Jewish students and academics from Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution|editor=Richard S. Levy |publisher= ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=275|isbn=1-85109-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; OWP anti-Jewish activities weren't however limited to political means only. OWP openly incited [[pogrom|anti-Jewish riots]],&lt;ref name="Haumann"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Haumann|first=Heiko|title=A History of East European Jews|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2002|pages=224|isbn= 963-9241-26-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its youth movement advocated violence against Jewish students.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; OWP and related youth organizations were engaged in violent attacks against Jews.&lt;ref name="Lerski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; Those attacks eventually led the Polish government to ban the organization.&lt;ref name=dia/&gt;

== Today's Poland ==

Organization was many times re-established, the first time as political party in Lublin (1993) by prof. Jan Trochimiak. After founded in 2003 as an ordinary association in Wroclaw. Finally, in 2012 the OWP was registered in the National Registrar of Companies and Legal Entities (Krajowy Rejestr Sądowy; KRS) in Warsaw, gaining legal personality. Honorary chairman of the OWP is [[Jan Kobylański]].

'''The Companions of Jehu''' were formed in the [[Lyon]] region of [[France]] in April 1795 to hunt down [[Jacobins]] implicated in the [[Reign of Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste Monfalcon, ''Histoire de la ville de Lyon'', Guilbert et Dorier, 1847 vol.II, page 1051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Andress, ''The Terror'', Abacus 2005 p.361&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they were founded by The Marquis de Besignan,&lt;ref name="canalblog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahdavis.canalblog.com/archives/2013/02/23/26482023.html|title=NOTICE HISTORIQUE SUR LES VRAIS COMPAGNONS DE JÉHU ♣ PREMIERE PARTIE (1) - La Maraîchine Normande|date=23 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Ernest Daudet (1901) [http://www.nemausensis.com/Nimes/Revolution/ConspirateursDuMidi.pdf "Conspirateurs du Midi sous la Révolution Française] ''La Revue du Midi'' pp. 361-375&lt;/ref&gt; who also founded royalist underground groups in [[Forez]] and [[Dauphiné]] with the [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|Prince of Condé]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?lang=fr&amp;p=pierre%20joseph&amp;n=duclaux%20de%20besignan|title=Pierre Joseph DUCLAUX de BÉSIGNAN - "pierfit" - Geneanet|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their victims are  believed to have numbered at least in the hundreds. They were made famous by the 1857 novel ''The Companions of Jehu'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]] which presented a highly romanticised account of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7079|title=The Companions of Jehu|first=Alexandre|last=Dumas|date=1 December 2004|publisher=|accessdate=9 April 2017|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[Jehu]] was an Old Testament character,&lt;ref&gt;Emil G. Hirsch, M. Seligsohn (1906) [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8570-jehu "Jehu"] in ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; immortalised in [[Jean Racine|Racine's]] drama ''[[Athalie]]''. He was famous for having killed [[Jezebel]] by throwing her out of a window. According to the [[Books of Kings]] Jezebel was responsible for inciting her husband King [[Ahab]] to abandon the worship of the true God and follow the cult of [[Baal]] instead. She also brought false testimony against [[Naboth]] and had him killed, and was the cause of much violence and bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;Emil G. Hirsch, Ira Maurice Price (1906) [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8675-jezebel "Jezebel"] in ''The Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, Jezebel represented the Jacobins of France, responsible for turning France away from the Catholic religion, bringing false testimony against patriotic citizens and executing them, and spreading violence and bloodshed through the Reign of Terror. By the same analogy, Jehu was the force of righteous retribution, come to restore the true religion, and kill Jezebel, her children and all those who had turned away from the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Nodier, ''Souvenirs et portraits de la Révolution'', Charpentier 1841 vol. VIII, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The reference to Jehu was not universally understood however, and through misunderstanding, uncertain repetition and assimilation with the broader idea of religious restoration, many people referred to ''the Companions of Jesus'' instead of ''the Companions of Jehu'', despite this name being essentially meaningless, as was pointed out by Louis Blanc.&lt;ref&gt;André Castelot, ''Présence de l’histoire'', 1969, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference to their existence appears in the records of the [[National Convention]] in a report presented on 25 June 1795 from [[Marie-Joseph Chénier]] on the recent killings in Lyons.  His account says:

{{quote|An association of traitors has been organised at Lyon, banded together for the purpose of murder. This company, mixing together religious ideas with massacres, the call for royalism with words of justice and humanity, is known as the 'Companions of Jesus'. It is this company which is spreading a new terror in this commune, more vigorous and more widespread than [[Chalier]] and his bloody accomplices unleashed.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Joseph Chénier &amp; Antoine-Vincent Arnault, 'Oevres de M Chénier', Guillaume, 1826 p.256&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Activities==
On 4 May 1795, 99 Jacobin prisoners were massacred in the town prisons by members of the companions. Over the following days the violence became more widespread and more murders took place as Jacobins were drowned, beaten to death and had their throats cut in their own homes or in the streets. The newspapers encouraged the murder of ''Terrorists'' and ''Drinkers of Blood'', and a list of people to be targeted, ninety pages long, was published in Lausanne and openly circulated. This phase of the [[First White Terror|White Terror]] continued until the army re-established control and various ringleaders were arrested and brought before the criminal court of [[Isère]]. The number of victims of the Companions of Jehu is impossible to know, because there is no reliable way of distinguishing between organised murders and more chaotic lynchings.

An order of 23 May 1796 by [[Louis Antoine Choin de Montgay|General Mointchoisy]] directed that "to prevent the assassinations committed by the Companions of Jesus, it is forbidden to all citizens under any pretext whatsoever to carry swordsticks, throwing sticks, or batons weighted with lead or iron."&lt;ref name="canalblog.com"/&gt;

==Questions over their existence==
Some historians, including [[Jacques Godechot]], have argued that the Companions of Jehu never actually existed. According to Lenotre,&lt;ref&gt;G.Lenotre, La compagnie de Jéhu: les vengeurs fantômes, Perrin, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Directory|Directory]] sought to identify and punish royalists, emigres and refractory priests, and actively looked for people associated with the Companions of Jehu.  However although various criminals were arrested, none of them was a priest, emigre or royalist. All those arrested for murder and other serious crimes had been acting independently and there was no organised movement or any coordination between them. The tribunal, under Legris, concluded that there were no registers or membership lists for the Companions of Jehu.  Later, under [[Louis XVIII]], many royalists who had played very minor parts in resisting the revolution received pensions or decorations, but nobody ever came forward and claimed to have been a member of the Company of Jehu.

==Les Compagnies du Soleil==
While the Companions of Jehu were organised in and around Lyon, a similar group known as 'les Compagnies du Soleil' (The Companions of the Sun) formed and was active in [[Provence]] and [[Gard]]. The company's members considered it a sign of strength to carry the symbol of a splash of blood on their hands.&lt;ref&gt;John Paxton, ''Companion to the French Revolution'', Facts on File Books 1988 p.54&lt;/ref&gt; During the White Terror a group of Jacobins was able to take control of the city of [[Toulon]] from 17–23 May 1795,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of the French Revolution'', Longman 1989 p.479&lt;/ref&gt; and the Companions of the Sun were particularly associated with the repression and reprisals which took place after the army under General Pactod regained control of the city.

[[File:Posers.jpg|thumb|Crusties]]
The term ''''crusties'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' can refer to two distinct, but not entirely separate, subcultural groups. Particularly in North America, but to some extent worldwide, the term is used to refer to [[crust punk|crust punks]] or [[gutter punks]]. In the UK and Ireland especially, particularly in the 1990s, the term was used to refer to people who are members of a [[subculture]] related to the [[New Age travellers]] movement.

==Appearance==
Crusties are distinctive for their unkempt appearance. They are associated with [[anti-capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Liz, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1167510/LIZ-JONES-I-hate-crusties-droppy-dyed-skirts-boiled-wool-cardigans.html "I hate these Crusties"], The Daily Mail, 5 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|road protests]], [[squatting]], and [[begging]].&lt;ref name=hetherington &gt;Hetherington, K: ''New Age Travellers'', page 9. Cassell. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Typical dress styles involve [[dreadlocks]],&lt;ref name=cassell&gt;Hetherington, K. ''New Age Travellers'', page 9. Cassell. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; piercings, tattoos and dirty clothing, which are generally second-hand or army surplus.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" &gt;Cambridge Dictionary, [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/crusty_3 "Definition of Crusty, noun"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[anarcho-punk]], most clothing is black in colour. Earth colours are also common. Denim jackets, hooded sweatshirts with sewn-on patches, vests covered in studs, spikes, and band patches are characteristic elements of the crust punk style of dress.&lt;ref name=decibel&gt;Kevin Stewart-Panko, "I Saw Disfear Three Times in Three Days", ''Decibel'', no. 46, August 2008, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian "Leggo" Kilsby of [[Deviated Instinct]] describes crust as "a punk-y biker look, more akin to Mad Max. ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' is the crustiest film ever made!"&lt;ref&gt;Glasper 2009, 287&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crusties have also been described as being typically unemployed youth with no permanent home.&lt;ref name="Cambridge" /&gt; Some are an urban version of the [[New Age Travellers|New Age Traveller]]&lt;ref name=hetherington/&gt; and so may have relatively settled long-term homes.

'''Equiveillance''' is a state of equilibrium, or a desire to attain a state of equilibrium, between [[surveillance]] and [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;Manders, C. (2013, June).

(2010, June). Socializing Surveillance: An interdisciplinary educational model. In Control &amp; Automation (MED), 2010 18th Mediterranean Conference on (pp. 179-184). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes confused with [[The Transparent Society|transparency]].  This balance (equilibrium) allows the individual to construct their own case from evidence they gather themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/anonequiveillance.htm |title=Exporing Equiveillance |publisher=Wearcam.org |date=2003-07-17 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than merely having access to surveillance data that could possibly incriminate them.

Sousveillance, in addition to transparency, can be used to preserve the contextual integrity of surveillance data. For example, a lifelong capture of personal experience could provide "best evidence" over external surveillance data, to prevent the surveillance-only data from being taken out of context.

==Ubiquitous computing==
Equiveillance represents a situation where all parties of a society or economy are empowered to be able to use the tools of accountability to make beneficial decisions.  Humanity has always sought to establish authority relationships: the increasing trend to record information from our environment, and of ourselves creates the need to delineate the relationships between privacy, surveillance, and sousveillance.

The emphasis on [[ubiquitous computing]] is to be contrasted with [[wearable computing]]. As personal cell phones store more information and have the capacity to share it, wearable and mobile computing will make manifest the ability for an individual, or small group of individuals, to monitor larger institutional systems with the goal of developing systems of transparency and accountability. For just as large institutions, such as governments or corporations, store information about the buying habits of the public through an integrated surveillance highway that has a ubiquitous computing infrastructure, individuals can act as consumer activists though a system of inverse surveillance that is based upon a wearable computing infrastructure that assists in maximizing personal privacy and alerting one of information being recorded about the self. Such actions could lead to an equiveillant state, as power and respect are shared.

Panoptic surveillance was described by [[Michel Foucault]] in the context of a prison in which prisoners were isolated from each other but visible at all times by guards. Surveillance tends to isolate individuals from one another while setting forth a one-way visibility to authority figures. This isolation leads to social fragmentation.

Sousveillance has a community-based origin, such as a personal electronic diary (or we[[blog]]), made public on the World Wide Web. Sousveillance tends to bring together individuals, by influencing a large city to function more like a small town: with the pitfalls of gossip, but also the benefits of a sense of community participation. There is a greater degree of responsibility in a sousveillance environment.

Ubiquitous computing ("ubicomp"), also known as pervasive computing ("pervcomp"), is the integration of computers with the environment. Ubiquitous computing tends to rely on cooperation of the immediate infrastructure in the environment, but also has a tendency to centralize information, and hence, centralize authority structures. It also creates segregation, and has implications for social rights such as education and healthcare. Individuals are sorted and classified within a ubiquitous computing environment, leading to a new form of segregation. Ubiquitous computing also places emphasis on [[copyright law]] and undermines creative environments due to the controlling tendencies of authority.

Wearable computing ("wearcomp") refers to portable, wearable computing technologies. Wearcomp doesn't require any special infrastructure in the environment, as the computer is self-contained and self-reliant. With sousveillant computing, it is possible for the focus of control to be more distributed rather than centralized.

A free society is one which places emphasis on respect and the balance of power: in a democratic society, respect and power are shared and well distributed, whereas in a despotic community, respect and power are not shared and are restricted to the few. Increasingly, our society is confronted with the realization of a [[ubiquitous computing]] environment, with the infrastructure predicated upon sensor and surveillance systems to function despite efforts to stop such expansions. How we participate in sharing respect and power will converge with how our society conducts surveillance of its citizens, and how citizens conduct sousveillance. Equiveillance represents a harmonious balance that maximizes human freedom, individual rights as well as communal democracy. The field of personal [[cybernetics]] will converge with the fields of personal imaging and glogging ([[CyborgLog]]ging), as individuals store and archive information for personal use and as a form of self-defense.

To have a society within which personal freedoms and justice are equally distributed, transparency is needed. Transparency increasingly will require dealing with the issues of ubiquitous computing and wearable computing, and maintaining a balance between surveillance and inverse surveillance while maximizing personal privacy.

==Equiveillance table==
Equiveillance establishes a social balance between surveillance and sousveillance, as outlined in a general series of comparisons that is known in the published literature as the "equiveillance table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/papers/docs/acmmm2004sousveillance_p620-mann |title=Proceedings of the Association of Computing Machinery Multimedia (MM) 2004, page 620-627 |publisher=Eyetap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two kinds of situations that occur when this social balance does not exist: inequiveillance, in which there is a one-sided nature to surveillance (this is the most common situation), and disequiveillance, which is when the balance is not provably one-sided, but, rather, is unequal but not clearly in one or the other direction.

==Inequiveillance (disequiveillance)==
Equiveillance represents a balance of the power relationships that surveillance and sousveillance touch upon. When there is an imbalance, social consequences can range from loss of privacy, to social reactions that in the aggregate lead to unrest and political instability. The idea of disequiveillance is described by [[Paul Virilio]] in his treatise on Dromology and the possibility of freedom loss as an accident of our modern world and how it relates to terrorism and war. In this context, the lack of equiveillance (disequiveillance) refers to the anthropological consequences of a world filled with continuous recording devices that encourage a despotic form of government with a tendency to intrude upon the lives of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bronitt | first1 = Simon | last2 = Michael | first2 = Katina | year = 2012 | title = Human rights, regulation, and national security | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9875&amp;context=infopapers | journal = IEEE Technol. Soc. Mag. | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 15–16 | doi=10.1109/mts.2012.2188704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolving field of sousveillance, stems in part from recent research on the topic of surveillance and inverse-surveillance, shedding light on how media technology is changing our sense of privacy and human freedom. Privacy becomes increasingly a measure of freedom and its control central to personal autonomy.

Increasingly, remembering is influenced by both personal and public search engines, as computing is becoming increasingly dependent upon the [[human–computer interaction]]. The issue of being able to control the amount of personal information that escapes and is recorded in the many machines that make up evolving ubiquitous computing world stresses the importance of equiveillance. The impact of surveillance will be increasingly related to the impact of increasing [[computer storage]] space and data mining processing speed.

A 2005 article by Margaret Papandreou entitled "Is nothing Sacred" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317173758/http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |archivedate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also highlights the issue of disequiveillance and how the theft of personal communications with her son undermined her [[freedom of thought]]. Mrs Papandreou's [[personal computer]] was entered by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] with malicious intent, with multiple [[emails]], and personal information downloaded and eventually published in book form. The issue of [[freedom of the press]], vs [[theft]] of personal property and [[electronic trespassing]], developed into a subsequent legal action against the journalist and member of the Greek Parliament, [[Liana Kanelli]]. The issue of public vs. private space comes into the debate. The practice of spying as a [[political]] technique creates a flashback to how previous Greek politicians where undermined via covert [[eavesdropping]] and a subsequent outcome from the previous decades of the [[Greek Civil War]]. The complexity of this case becomes twofold when the person surveillanced is a concerned citizen, and not a politician. Furthermore, the issue of taking personal electronic communication out of context for political and financial gain creates the issue of disequiveillance. This can happen on a personal level, or on a larger social, or institutional level.

"The correspondence, which included e-mails, was published in late 2000 and early 2001, in the [[Nemesis magazine]], which was run by journalist and MP Liana Kanelli. It was unclear how Kanelli laid hands on the letters, in which the US-born Papandreou advised the FM on his political career, urging him to make use of non-governmental organizations such as the Andreas Papandreou Foundation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agp.gr/agp/content/Document.aspx?d=7&amp;rd=5499005&amp;f=1427&amp;rf=-2011937565&amp;m=4816&amp;rm=6427264&amp;l=1 |title=/ Andreas G.

The foundations of human [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] also are rooted in the idea of [[social contract]]. Biased comments from the conclusion of documents obtained without a [[search warrant]], and against the principles of legal procedure create an unfair forum for judging and condemnation and expose some of the problems of how electronic freedom can be misused towards a systemic persecution and misrepresentation. It also exposes how social instability can rapidly cause a society to evolve into a prison state. Order is maintained in systematic dissolvement of freedom towards a government that operates more like a prison rather than a body of persons made up of "free individuals" with an overemphasis of everyone watching everyone, with anyone becoming an informant for whatever side that may be competing for power.

Unbalanced surveillance, and disequiveillance can rapidly deevolve society towards the en-masse phenomena such as [[racism]], [[scapegoating]] and even mob reactions towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leymann.se/English/frame.html |title=The Mobbing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Leymann.se |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110132/http://leymann.se/English/frame.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also of importance to realize that [[justice]] is not rooted in [[Revenge|vengeance]], but rather, the [[law]].

The Margaret Papandreou case highlights the issue of victimization through use of the media as a form of [[propaganda]]. The social emphasis of a big brother society is rapidly transitioning [[Balkan]] nations via the prevalence of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1886998.stm |title=TV AND RADIO &amp;#124; Ban on Greek Big Brother overturned |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2001/01-03-03.ana.html#16 |title=Athens News Agency: Daily News Bulletin in English, 01-03-03 |publisher=Hri.org |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media support of such systems with an increasingly legal disregard for individual privacy.

The issue of privacy as part of freedom is in conflict with an absolutely [[The Transparent Society|transparent society]] where all things become recorded and available. The ability to mediate ones visibility increasingly intersects with the concept of [[wearable computing]], as a form of sheltering the individual from a world filled with recorders and sensors. The ability of controlling ones personal information is increasingly part of how one is to maintain ones personal and free space. Hence protecting ones privacy also intersects with the concept of [[sousveillance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">'''Forensic seismology''' is the [[forensic]] use of the techniques of [[seismology]] to detect and study distant phenomena, particularly [[explosion]]s, including those of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="RogersKoper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/Forensic%20Seismology-revised.pdf|title=Some Practical Applications of Forensic Seismology|author=J. David Rogers and Keith D. Koper|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the efficiency with which seismic waves propagate through the Earth and the technical difficulties of decoupling explosions to diminish their seismic radiation, forensic seismology is a critical technique in the enforcement of bans on [[underground nuclear testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/Zucca.html|title=Forensic Seismology Supports CTBT|first=|date=September 1998|website=|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|author=John J. Zucca|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to nuclear explosions, the signatures of many other kinds of explosions can also be detected and analyzed by forensic seismology,&lt;ref name="RogersKoper"/&gt; and even other phenomena such as ocean waves (the global [[microseism]]), the movement of icebergs across the sea floor or in collision with other icebergs, or explosions within submarines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/online/2604/forensic-seismology|title=Forensic seismology|date=5 March 2009|author=Richard A.

== Seismic Nuclear Detonation Detection ==

Forensic Seismology is one of several other methods used by the [[global community]] to determine compliance with the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT). A network of approximately 170 seismic stations, along with data generated from sources such as [[infrasound]], [[hydroacoustics]], and [[radionuclide]] detection, is used to identify and locate nuclear detonations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/str/Zucca.html|title=Forensic Seismology Supports CTBT|website=str.llnl.gov|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic seismology is specifically used to locate nuclear detonations that may have occurred underneath the ground.

Seismic stations record underground pressure waves and transmit this data for processing via secure communication links. There are many challenges involved with trying to differentiate a nuclear explosion from other natural and man-made phenomena, such as earthquakes, mining explosions, and construction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nuclear explosions exceeding 150 kilotons generate pressure waves that primarily travel through the Earth's core and mantle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of explosions are straightforward to identify because the mixture of rock the signals pass through is fairly [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] and the signals generated are free from [[Noise (electronics)|noise]]. Smaller nuclear explosions are more difficult to identify because pressure waves primarily travel through the Earth's upper mantle and crust, leading to signal distortion due to the heterogeneity of rocks at this depth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Nations may also conduct clandestine underground tests that are not easily identifiable. One method of hiding an underground nuclear detonation is called decoupling. This involves detonating a nuclear warhead in an underground cavity in order to significantly muffle the amplitude of the subsequent underground pressure waves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another proposed method of hiding nuclear detonations is called [[mine masking]]. This technique uses a larger explosion to mask a smaller nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/12849/chapter/13#173|title=APPENDIX E   Dealing with Evasive Underground Nuclear Testing {{!}} The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: Technical Issues for the United States {{!}} The National Academies Press|language=en|doi=10.17226/12849}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of mine masking has been called into question because seismic events large enough to mask a nuclear explosion are exceedingly rare and would draw suspicion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smaller nuclear detonation yields may also be hard to detect because they produce readings similar to small earthquakes or other natural events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When seismic data is gathered, it has to be processed to produce meaningful information. [[Algorithm]]s are used to isolate patterns, remove noise, and generate estimates. The development of efficient algorithms for nuclear detonation detection has led to many advancements in other fields such as [[kriging]], an advanced method of [[interpolation]] used primarily in [[geostatistics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Algorithms are used to identify key characteristics of wave forms, such as peak-to-peak distance, amplitude, phase, [[P-wave]] amplitude, and [[S-wave]] amplitude. P-waves, or primary waves, are compression waves that propagate quickly through rock, and are generally the first waves to reach seismic stations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; S-waves, or shear waves, arrive after P-waves. The ratio of P to S waves is one of several important values used to characterize seismic events. When a nuclear detonation has been identified, algorithms are used to estimate the detonation time, explosive yield and depth of burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic Seismology and Nuclear Test Bans|last=Douglas|first=Alan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107033948|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FirstJuntaChile.jpg|thumb|350px|Opening session of the First Junta]]
'''Government Assembly of the Kingdom of Chile''' (September 18, 1810 &amp;ndash; July 4, 1811), also known as the '''First Government Junta''', was the organization established to rule [[Chile]] following the deposition and imprisonment of King [[Ferdinand VII]] by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. It was the earliest step in the Chilean struggle for independence, and the anniversary of its establishment is celebrated as the national day of Chile.

==Background==
{{History of Chile}}
At the start of 1808, the [[Captaincy General of Chile]]&amp;mdash;one of the smallest and poorest colonies in the [[Spanish Empire]]&amp;mdash;was under the administration of [[Luis Muñoz de Guzmán]], an able, respected and well-liked [[Royal Governor of Chile|Royal Governor]]. In May 1808 the overthrow of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] and Ferdinand VII, their replacement by [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and the start of the [[Peninsular War]] plunged the empire into a state of agitation. In the meantime, Chile was facing its own internal political problems. Governor Guzmán had suddenly died on February of that year and the crown had not been able to appoint a new governor before the invasion. After a  brief interim regency by [[Juan Rodríguez Ballesteros]], and according to the succession law in place at the time, the position was laid claim to and assumed by the most senior military commander, who happened to be Brigadier [[Francisco Antonio García Carrasco|Francisco García Carrasco]]. 

[[Image:GarciaCarrasco.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Antonio García Carrasco|Francisco García Carrasco]]]]García Carrasco took over the post of [[Royal Governor of Chile|Governor of Chile]] in April and in August the news of the [[Napoleon]]ic invasion of [[Spain]] and of the conformation of a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]] to govern the Empire in the absence of a legitimate king reached the country. In the meantime, [[Charlotte of Spain|Charlotte Joaquina]], sister of Ferdinand and wife of the [[John VI of Portugal|King of Portugal]], who was living in [[Brazil]], also made attempts to obtain the administration of the Spanish dominions in [[Latin America]]. Since her father and brother were being held prisoners in France, she regarded herself as the heiress of her captured family. Allegedly among her plans was to send armies to occupy [[Buenos Aires]] and northern Argentina and to style herself as ''Queen of [[La Plata]]''.

Brigadier García Carrasco was a man of crude and authoritarian manners, who managed in a very short time to alienate the [[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollo]] elites under his command. Already in Chile, as in most of Latin America, there had been some independence agitation but very minimal and concentrated in the very ineffectual [[Conspiracy of the Tres Antonios]] back in 1781. The majority of the people were fervent [[royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] but were divided into two groups: those who favored the ''status quo'' and the divine right of Ferdinand VII (known as ''absolutists'') and those who wanted to proclaim Charlotte Joaquina as Queen (known as ''carlotistas''). A third group was composed of those who proposed the replacement of the Spanish authorities with a local ''[[wiktionary:junta|junta]]'' of notable citizens, which would conform a provisional government to rule in the absence of the king and an independent Spain (known as ''juntistas'').

In 1809 Governor García Carrasco himself was implicated in a flagrant case of corruption (the [[Scorpion scandal]]) that managed to destroy whatever remnants of [[moral authority]] he or his office had left. From that moment on the pressure for his removal began to build. In June 1810 news arrived from Buenos Aires that [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonaparte's]] forces had conquered [[Andalusia]] and laid [[Siege of Cádiz|siege to Cádiz]], the last redoubt against the French on Spanish soil. Moreover, the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]], which had governed the Empire for the past two years, had abolished itself in favor of a Regency Council. García Carrasco, who was a supporter of the ''carlotist'' group, managed to magnify the political problems by taking arbitrary and harsh measures, such as the arrest and deportation to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] without due process of well-known and socially prominent citizens under simple suspicions of having been sympathetic to the ''junta'' idea. Among those arrested were  [[José Antonio de Rojas]], [[Juan Antonio Ovalle]] and [[Bernardo de Vera|Bernardo de Vera y Pintado]]. 

[[Image:Mateo de Toro y Zambrano.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Mateo de Toro Zambrano, 1st Count of la Conquista|Mateo de Toro Zambrano]]]]The autonomy movement also had, inspired by the [[May Revolution]] in Argentina, thoroughly propagated through the criollo elite. They resented the illegal arrests and, together with the news that Cádiz was all that was left of a free Spain, finally solidified in their opposition to the  Governor. Brigadier García Carrasco was suspended from office and forced to resign on July 16, 1810, to be in turn replaced by the next most senior soldier, [[Mateo de Toro Zambrano, 1st Count of la Conquista|Mateo de Toro Zambrano]] [[Count of la Conquista]], even though a legitimate Governor, [[Francisco Javier de Elío]], had already been appointed by the [[Viceroy of Peru]].  

Count Toro Zambrano was, by all standards, a very unorthodox selection. He was a very old man already (82 years old at the time) and moreover a [[Spanish Criollo peoples|"criollo"]] (someone born in the colonies) as opposed to a "peninsular" (someone born in Spain).  Immediately after his appointment in July, the ''juntistas'' began to lobby him in order to obtain the formation of a junta. In August the Royal Appeals Court ({{lang-es|Real Audiencia}}) took a public loyalty oath to the Regency Council in front of a massive audience, which put added pressure on the Governor to define himself. After vacillating for some time over which party to follow, Toro Zambrano finally agreed to hold an open [[Cabildo (council)|''Cabildo'']] (city hall) meeting in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] to discuss the issue. The date was set for September 18, 1810 at 11 AM.

&lt;/center&gt;

==Establishment==
From the very beginning the ''juntistas'' took the political initiative. They were able to place their members in charge of sending the invitations, thus manipulating the assistance lists to their own advantage. At the September 18th session, they grabbed center stage with shouts of ''"¡Junta queremos! ¡junta queremos!"'' ("We want a junta! We want a junta"). Count Toro Zambrano, faced with this very public show of force, acceded to their demands by depositing his ceremonial baton on top of the main table and saying ''"Here is the baton, take it and rule"''.  The discussion ended with the establishment of the Government Junta of the Kingdom of Chile, also known as the ''First Junta'', which was organized with the same powers held by a [[Royal Governor of Chile|Royal Governor]]. In the discussion triumphed the idea of a local independent government as opposed to the monarchist idea of submitting themselves to the control of the Regency Council. Nonetheless, this idea of "independence" must not be taken in the modern sense. This junta never intended to sever the relationship with the monarchy, but was only taking advantage of the possibility to assert local rule.

===Administrative measures===
Their first measure was to take a formal loyalty oath to Ferdinand VII as legitimate King. Count Toro Zambrano was elected President, and the rest of the positions were distributed equally among all parties, but the real power was left in the hands of the secretary, [[Juan Martínez de Rozas]]. The Junta then proceeded to take some concrete measures that had been long-held aspirations of the colonials: it created a militia for the defense of the kingdom, decreed freedom of trade with all nations that were allied to Spain or neutrals, a unique tariff of 134% for all imports (with the exception of printing presses, books and guns which were liberated from all taxes) and in order to increase its representativity, ordered the convocatory of a National Congress. 

Immediately, political intrigue began amongst the ruling elite, with news of the [[Peninsular War|political turbulence and wars of Europe]] all the while coming in. It was eventually decided that elections for the National Congress, to be composed of 42 representatives, would be held in 1811. By March of that year 36 representatives had already been elected in all major cities with the exception of [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] and [[Valparaíso]].

===Political tendencies===
[[Image:Juan Martínez de Rozas.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Juan Martínez de Rozas]]]]After the natural death of the president, [[Mateo de Toro Zambrano, 1st Count of la Conquista|Mateo de Toro Zambrano]] on February 26, 1811, he was replaced by  [[Juan Martinez de Rozas|Juan Martínez de Rozas]], due to the illness of the Vice President, Bishop [[Jose Martinez de Aldunate|José Martínez de Aldunate]], (who was to die on April 8, 1811).

Three political tendencies were starting to appear: the ''extremists'', the ''moderates'' and the ''royalists''.  These groups were all decidedly against independence from [[Spain]] and differentiated themselves only in the degree of political autonomy that they sought. The ''moderates'' ({{lang-es|moderados}}), under the leadership of [[José Miguel Infante]], were a majority, and wanted a very slow pace of reforms since they were afraid that once the King was back in power he would think that they were seeking independence and would roll-back all changes. The ''exaulted'' ({{lang-es|exaltados}}) were the second most important group and they advocated a larger degree of freedom from the Crown and a faster pace of reforms stopping just short of full independence. His leader was Juan Martínez de Rozas. The ''royalists'' were against any reform at all and for the maintenance of the ''status quo''.

===Figueroa Mutiny===
The great political surprise up to that point had been the results from the other center of power, [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], in which royalists had defeated the supporters of [[Juan Martinez de Rozas|Juan Martínez de Rozas]]. In the rest of Chile, the results were more or less equally divided: twelve pro-Rozas delegates, fourteen anti-Rozas and three royalists. So, the Santiago elections were the key to Rozas' desire to remain in power. This election was supposed to take place on April 10, but before they could be called the [[Figueroa mutiny]] broke out.

On April 1, the royalist colonel [[Tomás de Figueroa]]&amp;mdash;considering the notion of elections to be too populist&amp;mdash;led a revolt in Santiago. The revolt sputtered, and Figueroa was arrested and summarily executed. The mutiny was successful in that temporarily sabotaged the elections, which had to be delayed. Eventually, however, a [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] was duly elected, and all 6 deputies from Santiago came from the ''moderate'' camp. Nonetheless, the mutiny also encouraged a radicalization of political postures: even though ''moderates'' advocating only greater autonomy of the elites from Spanish Imperial control&amp;mdash;without a complete rupture&amp;mdash;gained the majority of seats, a vocal minority was formed by ''excited'' revolutionaries who now wanted complete and instant independence from Spain. 

As a consequence of the mutiny, Martinez de Rozas was replaced on April 2, 1811, by [[Fernando Marquez de la Plata|Fernando Márquez de la Plata]]. The Royal Appeals Court, a long-standing pillar of support of the Spanish Crown, was dissolved for its alleged ''"complicity"'' and the idea of full independence gained momentum for the first time. The Junta lasted until July 4, 1811, when it was replaced by the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]], and later by the [[Government Junta of Chile (August 1811)|Second Junta]].

The '''Grawemeyer Awards''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɔː|m|aɪ|.|ər}}) are five awards given annually by the [[University of Louisville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grawemeyer.org/ | title = The Grawemeyer Awards | accessdate = 2011-08-28 | publisher = [[University of Louisville]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091105200710/http://www.grawemeyer.org/ | archivedate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes are presented to individuals in the fields of education, ideas improving world order, music composition, religion, and [[psychology]]. The religion award is presented jointly by the University of Louisville and the [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]]. Initially, the awards came with a bonus of [[United States dollar|US$]]150,000 each, making them among the most lucrative in their respective fields. This cash prize increased to $200,000 beginning in 2000. Beginning in 2011 the award amount dropped to $100,000 after the fund for the prize lost money due to a drop in the stock market.

The first award, for [[Grawemeyer Award (Music Composition)|Music Composition]], was presented in 1985. The award for Ideas Improving World Order was added in 1988 and Education in 1989. In 1990, a fourth award, Religion, was added as a joint prize between the university and the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Psychology was added in 2000; the first award was given in 2001.

Some of the most notable winners include former Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (world order); Academy Award-winning composer [[Tan Dun]] (music composition); German theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] (religion); [[Aaron Beck]], considered the founder of cognitive therapy (psychology); and former Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and Princeton University President [[William G. Bowen]] and former Harvard University President [[Derek Bok]] (education).

H. [[Charles Grawemeyer]] (1912–1993), industrialist, entrepreneur, astute investor and philanthropist, created the awards at the University of Louisville in 1984. An initial endowment of $9 million from the Grawemeyer Foundation funded the awards, which have drawn thousands of nominations from around the world.

Although the University of Louisville graduate was a chemical engineer by schooling, Grawemeyer cherished the liberal arts and chose to honor powerful ideas in five fields in performing arts, the humanities, and the social sciences.

Grawemeyer distinguished the awards by honoring ideas rather than lifelong or publicized personal achievement. He also insisted that the selection process for each of the five awards—though dominated by professionals-include one step involving a lay committee knowledgeable in each field. As Grawemeyer saw it, great ideas should be understandable to someone with general knowledge and not be the private treasure of academics.

'''Hassan Mohammed Ali bin Attash''' ({{lang-ar|حسن محمد علي بن عطاش}}, ''Ḥasan Muḥammad ʿAlī bin 'Aṭṭash'') is a citizen of [[Saudi Arabia]], held in the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]s, in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=DoDList2&gt;

[[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] [[counter-terrorism]] analysts estimate that bin Attash was born in 1985, in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia.

As of July 11, 2012, Hassan Mohammed Ali bin Attash has been held at Guantanamo for seven years ten months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/1456-hassan-mohammed-ali-bin-attash | work=The New York Times | title=Hassan Mohammed Ali Bin Attash - The Guantánamo Docket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attash was just sixteen or seventeen when he was captured.&lt;ref name=KidsGTMO&gt;[http://www.cageprisoners.com/articles.php?id=7880 Kids of Guantanamo] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cageprisoners.com%2Farticles.php%3Fid%3D7880&amp;date=2009-08-06 |date=2009-08-06 }}, ''[[cageprisoners.com]], June 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/11/wikileaks-and-the-22-children-of-guantanamo/&lt;/ref&gt;
Hassin is the brother of [[Walid bin Attash|Waleed Mohammed bin Attash]], who has also been described as an [[Detainees in CIA custody|inmate]] in the [[CIA]]'s network of secret prisons.&lt;ref name=Hrw051201&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/30/usdom12109.htm List of “Ghost Prisoners” Possibly in CIA Custody], ''[[Human Rights Watch]]'', December 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  
Hassin, too, claims he spent time in the other prisons, including "[[the dark prison]]", prior to being detained in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=Reuter051219&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HRW/05bee6d5f916310a6f68909e2e67ecf7.htm U.S. Operated Secret 'Dark Prison' in Kabul], ''[[Reuters]]'', December 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Rights Concern ==

The circumstances of Hassan bin Attash have triggered the attention of several human rights organizations, including [[Amnesty International]], [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Hrw051201" /&gt;&lt;ref name=AmnestyInternationalPainAndDistress&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to their accounts Hassan bin Attash was captured on September 10, 2002, spent time in [[the dark prison]], spent sixteen months in [[Jordan]], where he was hung upside down, and beaten on the soles of his feet, which were then immersed in salt water.  They assert that he underwent this kind of questioning until he was willing to sign anything.  They claim that he wasn't interrogated about anything he himself had done, but rather about the activity of his older brother.  They assert that his 70-year-old father underwent similar questioning.  Bin Attash was flown to Guantanamo in March 2003.

The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' quoted Guantanamo spokesmen [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Chito Peppler]], who insisted, ''"US policy requires all detainees to be treated humanely,"&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe060426"/&gt;''

Peppler repeated the assertion that none of the captive's assertions of abuse were credible because al Qaeda trained operatives to lie about abuse.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe060426"/&gt;

== Transportation to Guantanamo Bay ==

Human Rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] reports that flight records show two captives named
[[Al-Sharqawi]] and Hassan bin Attash were flown from Kabul in September 2002.
The two men were flown aboard [[N379P]], a plane suspected to be part of the CIA's ghost fleet.
Flight records showed that the plane originally departed from [[Diego Garcia]], stopped in [[Morocco]], [[Portugal]], then Kabul before landing in [[Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name=TheGuardian20080310&gt;

| quote=Flight plan records show that one of the aircraft, registered N379P, flew in September 2002 from Diego Garcia to Morocco. From there it flew to Portugal and then to Kabul. Passenger names have been blacked out. However, Reprieve, which represents prisoners faced with the death penalty and torture, said that in Kabul the aircraft picked up Al-Sharqawi and Hassan bin Attash, two suspects who were tortured in Jordan before being rendered to Afghanistan and flown to Guantánamo Bay. Those rendered through Diego Garcia remain unidentified. In a letter to Miliband, Clive Stafford Smith, Reprieve's legal director, said: 'It is certainly not going to rebuild public confidence if we say that two people were illegally taken through British territory but then refuse to reveal the fates of these men.'

==Official status reviews==

Originally the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]] asserted that captives apprehended in the ''"[[war on terror]]"'' were not covered by the [[Geneva Conventions]], and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.&lt;ref name=UsaToday20071011&gt;

 |quote       = Critics called it an overdue acknowledgment that the so-called Combatant Status Review Tribunals are unfairly geared toward labeling detainees the enemy, even when they pose little danger. Simply redoing the tribunals won't fix the problem, they said, because the system still allows coerced evidence and denies detainees legal representation.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled, in [[Rasul v. Bush]], that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

He put in place a new review system composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense.  When it reported back, a year later, the [[Joint Review Task Force]] classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.&lt;ref name=Unchargeable71&gt;

Hassan bin Attash was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.
Obama said those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a [[Periodic Review Board]].

==Periodic Review Board==

The first review wasn't convened until November 20, 2013.&lt;ref name=PrsReviewSecretariat/&gt;  {{Asof|2016|4|15}}, 29 individuals had reviews, but Hassan bin Attash wasn't one of them.

The network currently includes over 1500 cameras operated from 7 regional control centres across England.

==History and background==
The Highways Agency’s original CCTV system or Highways Agency Surveillance CCTV system was used primarily to assist the police with the management of traffic on motorway and trunk roads. It was typically formed out of a number of smaller networks working in isolation.   Each of these small networks consisted of between 10 and 100 cameras that provided images to a single control room and had little provision for third parties. These networks often required a specific manufacturer’s camera, restricting the Highways Agency’s control over technology and cost.

As the use of CCTV became more important third parties (e.g. fire service, motoring organisations, radio stations) began to require controlled access to road images and the business case for a more nationally controlled network became apparent.  Therefore, to maximise control over its own assets the Highways Agency decided to develop its own CCTV protocols and specifications called 2nd Generation CCTV.

Around the world countries that have mature Intelligent Transport Systems ([[Intelligent transportation system|ITS]]) for traffic monitoring have implemented similar protocols, such as in the United States with National Transportation Communication for ITS Protocol (NTCIP).&lt;ref name=NTCIP&gt;{{cite web|title=National Transportation Communication for ITS Protocol|url=http://www.ntcip.org|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries where traffic monitoring CCTV is in its infancy the use of individual manufacture CCTV protocols (e.g. Pelco D) is more wide spread.

==Second-generation CCTV==
The second-generation CCTV system uses a range of protocols and standards currently in general use in other CCTV and electrical communication systems. These include [[CORBA]]&lt;ref name=2GCCTVCORBA&gt;{{cite web|title=CORBA used in HA 2nd Generation CCTV system |url=http://www.ha-research.gov.uk/projects/index.php?id=947 |accessdate=10 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502081042/http://www.ha-research.gov.uk/projects/index.php?id=947 |archivedate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|title=CORBA used in HA 2nd Generation CCTV system |url=http://www.ha-research.gov.uk/projects/index.php?id=947 |accessdate=10 September 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810155601/http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge_compendium/CE037198BA7B49B898B612DAA503C8DE.aspx |archivedate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; middleware technology to interface between legacy analogue CCTV systems and CCTV components developed by different organisations, and [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Internet Protocol|IP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] for network communications.

These cameras have many capabilities:

# Night vision
# Wipers
# Peak white functions
# Iris sensitivity
# Focus sensitivity
# An excellent zoom range{{Clarify|date=August 2012}}

==Advantages==
The 2nd Generation CCTV system removed the short-comings of the original CCTV system and was designed to meet the Highways Agency’s future needs, by:
* Providing national coverage in a single network National Road Telecommunications system
* Improving functionality for control room operators including cross boundary coverage
* Allowing more than one manufacturer camera source
* Providing provision for third party access to the cameras

The '''Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''' is the highest [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] authority in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organisation and faith.

The synod is chaired by the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]] and the members are the church's [[metropolitan archbishop]]s, [[metropolitan bishop]]s, [[Bishop|diocesan bishops]], [[Exarch|patriarchal exarchs]], [[missionary Bishop]]s, [[auxiliary bishop]]s, [[suffragan bishop]]s, [[assistant bishop]]s, [[chorbishop]]s and the [[patriarch]]al [[vicar]]s of the Church of Alexandria.

==Seniority==

According to Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria traditions, the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]], being the Bishop of Alexandria and being the senior and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder bishop]] and the [[metropolitan archbishop]] of the province and [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of all Egypt, is the head of the Holy Synod as a [[first among equals]]. The most senior position after the Pope was that of the Metropolitan Archbishop of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]], but since it ceased to be a major archiepiscopal metropolis in the days of [[Pope John VI of Alexandria|Pope John VI]] it has been held as a [[titular see]] attached to another metropolis.

There is a special status of seniority of honor and precedence for the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy and Great City of Our Lord, [[Jerusalem]], Holy Zion, [[Archbishop]] of the Holy [[Archdiocese]] of [[Jerusalem]], All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and All the [[Near East]].

This great archdiocesan Metropolis is technically outside the Egyptian Province and is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the Pope of Alexandria, but is one of the possessions of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was created by [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Pope Cyril III]] (1235-1243) in the thirteenth Century, which, at that time, had caused a dispute between the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Coptic Church, [[Iris Habib Elmasry]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a very rare incident between the two sister churches as in general their relationship is one of the strongest between any two sister churches.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Coptic Orthodox Church, [[Abouna Menassa Elkomos Youhanna]] 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Alexandrine tradition, the  rank of [[metropolitan bishop]] is granted by the Pope to the [[diocesan bishop]]s under his jurisdiction on a personal status (In Personam) and not due to the size or importance of the bishop's eparchy; however, the rank of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to those whose Archdioceses have historical importance and had or have more than one [[Suffragan Diocese]] within their territorial jurisdictions.

The Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem is the only Coptic Orthodox Hierarch who is consecrated as a Metropolitan Archbishop without being consecrated first as a bishop and later elevated to Metropolitan Archbishop, as is the norm in all episcopal consecration according to the tradition of the [[Church of Alexandria]]; it is done concurrently on the same occasion. This has been the case since [[Pope Cyril III of Alexandria|Cyril III]] consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop Basilius as the first Coptic Orthodox Metropolitan Archbishop of Jerusalem and All the Near East.

Usually the chosen Hieromonk is consecrated first as a [[Diocesan Bishop]], then with time, he could be awarded the higher dignity of Metropolitan Bishop. Sometimes the nominated Diocesan Bishop is already an [[Assistant Bishop]], [[Auxiliary Bishop]] or General Bishop, in which case he is only enthroned as the bishop of that [[Diocese]].

Currently, and because the seniority of the members of the [[Holy Synod]] is decided according to the seniority of the consecretion/elevation date of the ecclesiastical ranks: First come the Metropolitan Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops, followed by the Diocesan Bishops then the Bishops Exarchs of the Throne, then the [[Suffragan Bishop]]s, then the [[Auxiliary Bishop]]s, then the General Bishops and finally the [[Chorbishop]]s but also according to the date of consecration within each rank.

Accordingly, the most senior position after the Pope is the oldest consecrated Metropolitan Archbishop, who was {{As of|2015|lc=y}} Metropolitan Pachomios, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Damanhur]] (Hermopolis Parva) and [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] (Consecrated in 1990).

In spite of the ancient Alexandrine tradition, the most senior Hierarch, after the Senior Hierarch of [[Pentapolis]], is the Hierarch of the Metropolis of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]), which is [[Asyut]]; but since the great and ancient [[Titular see|Titular]] Metropolis of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), that comprises the Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]), ([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]), ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), is currently a Titular title, incorporated within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of [[Al Buhayrah Governorate|Beheira]] ([[Damanhur|Hermopolis Parva]]), ([[Buto]]), ([[Naucratis]]), [[Lake Mariout|Mariout]] ([[Mareotis]]), [[Marsa Matruh]] ([[Paraetonium]]), ([[Apis (city)|Apis]]); who is also the [[Titular Archbishop]] and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient and Holy Titular Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the Titular Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]], [[Leptis Magna|Neapolis]]  and [[Tripolitania]]); of the Ancient and Holy ([[Exarchate of Africa]]) in [[Tunisia]], comprising the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Mauretania Tingitana]]) and ([[Mauretania Caesariensis]]) and of the Ancient and Holy Titular Metropolis of ([[Kingdom of Numidia|Numedia]]) in [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]] that includes the Titular and Holy Suffragan Dioceses of ([[Leptis Parva]]) and of ([[Hadramentum]]). Accordingly, that honor goes to the Hierarch of the [[Metropolis]] of ([[Lycopolis]]), ([[Hieracon]]) and ([[Apollonopolis Parva (Hypselis)|Apollonopolis Parva]]) apart from the fact of the current adoption of the seniority of the date of consecration of the later Hierarch.

The most senior bishop in consecration will become the [[Locum tenens]] in case of the death of the Pope and until the election of the new Pope, and he will be the one who enthrones the newly elected [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope]] along with all the Hierarchs, who are members of the Holy Synod.
 
This seniority ranking system does not diminish the importance and the greatness of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem and [[Near East|All the Near East]], since its inclusion under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic [[Church of Alexandria]] in early medieval times. It is to be noted that the archiepiscopal status of this great Metropolis is also granted due to the Holy Apostolic Throne that it represents, being the Apostolic and Patriarchal Throne of Jerusalem, although its Metropolitan Archbishop does not claim that title and is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Alexandria]].

==Definition of Hierarchical titles according to the Alexandrine Tradition==

===Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria===
[[Pontiff]] and Supreme [[Hierarch]] of the Holy Orthodox &amp; Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is considered [[First among equals]] (primus inter pares) on his [[Apostolic See|Apostolic Throne]].  He presides over the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and over all Patriarchal Institutions.  He is also the Head of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]].

He consecrates, crowns and enthrones Patriarchs and Catholicoi (within his Dominion/Jurisdiction in Africa).  He consecrates and crowns Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops, and delegates several Metropolitans and Bishops to enthrone them.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons, all minor Orders, all ranks of Monastics, elevates Bishops to the Metropolitan, the Archiepiscopal or the Patriarchal Dignity. He consecrates the Holy Myron. He also bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of asceticism in Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank.

He anoints, crowns and enthrones Orthodox Emperors and Empresses, Orthodox Kings and Queens. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments. He has the First and the Highest Rank of the Episcopal Dignity of the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. He is the Primate of the second highest Apostolic Throne, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Nicea (325 AD), after Imperial Rome.  The Throne of Alexandria later became third in rank, after the Imperial Cities of Rome and Constantinople, New Rome, in accordance with the Canon Laws of the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (381AD).

===Metropolitans Archbishops and Metropolitan Bishops===
Administrative Title of the Episcopal Rank for a large Diocese or Eparchy, bestowed upon a Diocesan Bishop by the Patriarch, in recognition for his long service in his Diocese/Eparchy. It can also be granted due to the extended size of a Diocese or an Eparchy (by becoming an Archdiocese or an Archeparchy,) thus forming or is considered as an Ecclesiastical province, which requires its Prelate to be elevated to the Metropolitan /Archiepiscopal Dignity.

The higher Title of Metropolitan Bishop/Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Bishop of the Metropolis. He may oversee several Suffragan Bishops (to each his own Diocese) within his province, Auxiliary Bishops (Assistant to the Hierarch) and/or Chori-Episcopoi, under his jurisdiction.

The title of Metropolitan Archbishop is granted to the Hierarch of the Metropolis that has a historical dignity within the Throne, and whose Bishop ought to have the honorary dignity of a Metropolitan Archbishop, like Metropolitan Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Jerusalem, All [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Amman|Philadelphia of Jordan]] and [[Exarch|Patriarchal Exarch]] of all the [[Near East]] and the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]] in ([[Cyrenaica]]), comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]), ([[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Appollonia]]),([[Ptolemais (Cyrenaica)|Ptolemais]]),  ([[Benghazi|Berenice]]) and ([[Taucheira|Arsinoe]]), who is also the Metropolitan Archbishop and Patriarchal Exarch of the Ancient Archdiocese of [[Libya]], comprising the [[Suffragan Diocese]]s of: ([[Libu|Livis]], [[Darnis|Marmarica]], [[Darnis]] and [[Tripolitania]]).

He is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City, the Metropolis and is called Archbishop in all the other [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, whose Suffragan Bishops are under his jurisdiction.  Whereas, the Metropolitan Bishop is called Metropolitan in his own Diocesan City with its jurisdictions, which as a whole is considered a Metropolis, according to the jurisdictional subdivision of the Church, and he may have Assistant Bishops or Auxiliary Bishops under his jurisdiction, but does not have [[Suffragan Diocese]]s, headed by Suffragan Bishops, under his jurisdiction.
 
He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes in his Diocese or Eparchy.  He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be ordained to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments in his Diocese or Eparchy.

He exercises the same authority in his Metropolis and its jurisdiction as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  In the case of the departure of the Patriarch, the Senior Metropolitan in ordination, acts as Locum Tenens of the Throne, until the election of the new Patriarch, whom he will enthrone, along with the entire body of the Hierarchy of the Throne.  During that time, no ordination of new Hierarchs, no consecration of the Holy Myron, no new Patriarchal decrees or alteration of previous Patriarchal or Holy Synod decrees can be made. He is Second in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.

===Diocesan or Eparchial Bishop===

Hierarch chosen to oversee a Diocese or an [[Eparchy]], whether this Diocese or [[Eparchy]] is a subdivision of the Patriarchate or a subdivision of a greater Province, ruled by a Metropolitan Archbishop (which, in this case these are called Suffragan Bishops.)  He is the Shepherd of his flock. He has the right to consecrate parishes, altars, baptisteries and all ecclesiastical foundations.  He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy.

He bestows the honor of the Great Schema upon the Monastics who have achieved the highest degree of Monastic life or upon those who are to be consecrated to the Episcopal Rank and ordain novices to the monastic rank for the monasteries under his jurisdiction. He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates, within his Diocese or Eparchy, all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments.

He exercises the same authority in his Diocese as the Patriarch on his Throne. He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.  He is Third in Rank in the Episcopal Dignity.

===General Bishop/Exarch of the Throne===

Hierarch who does not have a jurisdiction over a particular Diocese and who is given a temporary Patriarchal assignment to shepherd or supervise either a particular district/portion of the Patriarchal Diocese or on "at large"  designation as a delegate assistant to the Hierarch.  He can also be serving within the Patriarchal Diocese/Jurisdiction, shepherding multiple congregations.  He can also supervise an area or a region that has not yet been designated or established as a Diocese, thus acting as an Exarch of the Throne. In this case, he is considered as a [[Patriarchal Vicar]] if assigned within Egypt (the Mother Church) or as a Patriarchal Exarch of the Throne if assigned outside Egypt for certain duration.

He also can be the administrator of a [[Diocese|Bishopric]] (i.e. the Youth, Social &amp; Ecumenical Services, Scientific Research &amp; Higher Coptic Studies Bishoprics), which are patriarchal organizations headed by a General Bishop concerned with social, educational and spiritual care of the members of the patriarchate at large or of a Patriarchal Institution (the Patriarchal Print Shop, or the Patriarchal Secretariat). In this capacity, he is the Administrator of this particular Bishopric or Patriarchal Institution. He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes with Patriarchal permission within the province, which are directly under the Patriarchal jurisdiction, whether within Egypt or outside Egypt, when delegated .

He assists the Patriarch in consecrating the Holy Myron.  He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries and holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal delegation. He reports directly to the Patriarch.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.

He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch,  and in this case he is given the title of Bishop Abbot, and ceases to be a General Bishop or Exarch of the Throne. It is to be noted, however, that the Title of General Bishop is not in conformity with the Holy and Apostolic Canon Laws of the Orthodox Church. On the other hand, an Exarch was and still is a permissible form of Patriarchal delegation or representation.

===Auxiliary Bishop/Assistant Bishop/Suffragan Bishop===

A Suffragan Hierarch who has been delegated by the Patriarch or a Metropolitan Archbishop to serve a district or part of the Patriarchal or Metropolitan Archdiocese or jurisdiction, or a suffragan diocese to the Metropolitan Archdiocese; if suffragan diocese is in question based on a quasi-permanent, occasional or as a temporal helper, then it is within Patriarchal diocesan jurisdiction, although in this case, he would be called Assistant Bishop.  He shepherds the congregation of that particular diocese (if suffragan) or district (if within the patriarchal diocese), reporting directly to the Metropolitan Archbishop or the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church|Pope of Alexandria]] respectively.

He can also be assigned as an assistant by the Pope of Alexandria to help a Metropolitan Bishop in his Metropolitanate, which is not divided into smaller subdivisions of suffragan dioceses, and based upon the Metropolitan Bishop's or the Metropolitan Archbishop's request, if the latter requires an assistant. In this case, he is called an Assistant Bishop, he reports to the Diocesan [[Hierarch]], i.e. the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop.

He does not, however, inherit (takeover) the Metropolis after the departure of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop. In the case that this Bishop is chosen as a "[[Coadjutor Bishop]]" to a particular Metropolis/Archdiocese or a [[Suffragan Diocese]] of the Metropolis in the capacity of [[Coadjutor Bishop]], in assistance to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, thus being second in command; then he has the right of succession when the latter reposes in the Lord.  However, this form of governance is not favored and seldom applied nowadays in the Alexandrine tradition.

If the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of a large Metropolis or Archdiocese is in need of one or more general helper in all kinds of services and to delegate to serve or shepherd all over the jurisdiction of the aforementioned Hierarch, then the chosen Bishop/s is/are called [[Auxiliary Bishop]]/s to the Hierarch in these capacities.

The idea of having more than one Bishop shepherding a particular Diocese/Metropolitanate/Archdiocese is against the Canon Laws of the Church. This, however has been, recently, adapted and ratified by local Synodical Decrees, on the basis that the Auxiliary Bishop is assigned to a Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop within his Province, for a specific district or region (being too small to be considered as a suffragan diocese), as a means for better serving the congregation of a large Diocese. In this case, the large Diocese is considered as a Province. These Auxiliary Bishops are considered to the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province as the Bishops of the Patriarchate are to the Patriarch within his Patriarchate. If the Metropolis or the Archdiocese has one or more [[suffragan diocese]] within its jurisdiction, then the appointment of Suffragan Bishops is a canonically accepted measure to extend the proper episcopal shepherding to this/these suffragan diocese(s).

These appointments are reasoned in the following cases: 
*The Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, being the Hierarch of a large region or jurisdiction, which includes many cities and their suburbs, that could be divided into more than one diocese within the Metropolis and since he reserves the right to be the [[Diocesan Bishop]], meaning the (Shepherd) of the main city ([[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|the Metropolis]]) of his Archeparchial Province, he appoints Suffragan Bishops for these dioceses.
*Due to the age or physical health of the Metropolitan Bishop or the Metropolitan Archbishop, an Auxiliary Bishop is then appointed to serve a part of the Metropolis /Archdiocese or an Assistant Bishop is appointed as a general assistant to the ruling Hierarch.

The Auxiliary Bishop/Suffragan Bishop/Assistant Bishop assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops. He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his District, Diocese or Eparchy.  He assists the Patriarch, and all the Metropolitans and all the Bishops in consecrating the Holy Myron. He also consecrates all Church buildings, altars, baptisteries, holy vessels and vestments by Patriarchal, Archiepiscopal or Metropolitan delegation.  He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as a regular Bishop.

===Titular Bishop===

A Hierarch, who is given the title for a defunct Diocese, in commemoration of its historical status.  In the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, it has been the custom to give this title to a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop who already shepherds an active Archdiocese or [[Diocese]]. It would be considered a part of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; rather than having a Metropolitan Bishop or a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop overseeing a defunct Diocese, with no real congregation of its own (i.e.  Pentapolis and Nubia).

He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops.  He ordains Archpriests, Priests, Archdeacons, Deacons, Sub-deacons and all minor orders to serve the parishes of his Diocese or Eparchy. (Being already a Diocesan Metropolitan or Bishop as mentioned above).

He has the same Episcopal Authority and Dignity as any regular Bishop or Metropolitan (since in this case, he is in fact a Diocesan Bishop/Metropolitan).  He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch, and in this case, he can keep his title of Titular Bishop, side by side with his title of Bishop Abbot.

===Chorbishop (Chori-Episcopus)===

An episcopal rank given for a Hierarch of a small town or village, under the jurisdiction of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop. He has the same ecclesiastical authority as that of the other Hierarchs. The exception is that he is to ordain Priests or Deacons and all Minor Orders, to consecrate holy vessels, altars, baptisteries or Churches only in his village or town and only with the authorization of the Patriarch, if assigned within the Patriarchal Diocese, or that of a Metropolitan Bishop, a Metropolitan Archbishop or a Bishop of the Metropolis/Diocese, in which his town or village is.

This special Patriarchal, Metropolitan or Episcopal permission is essential for the above-mentioned ordinations and consecrations.  He cannot do the above-mentioned consecration outside his assigned jurisdiction, or even within the main Diocesan cities of the province he serves in.

He assists the Patriarch and other Hierarchs in consecrating, crowning and enthroning other Patriarchs, Catholicoi, Archbishops, Metropolitans and Bishops by Episcopal permission of the ruling hierarch of the Provincial Diocese or Eparchy, in which he is serving.

He also has no jurisdiction over the Priests or Archpriests of the Major or Capital Cities within the Province where his town or village is located.  He has the same Episcopal Authority &amp; Dignity as the Diocesan Bishop, including the above-mentioned authorities with permission.  He can also be the Abbot of a Monastery, if assigned by the Patriarch.

[[Image:Frédéric Nihous - Langon 2007 - p1 cropped.jpg|thumb|Nihous, 2007 presidential candidate]]
'''Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Traditions''' ({{lang-fr|Chasse, pêche, nature et traditions}}; {{IPA-fr|ʃas, pɛʃ, natyʁ e tʁadiˈsjɔ̃}}; abbreviated as CPNT {{IPA-fr|se.pe.ɛnˈte}}) is an [[Agrarianism|agrarianist]] [[France|French]] [[political party]] which aims to defend the traditional values of rural France. Its current leader is [[Eddie Puyjalon]]. The party states it is neither right nor left but represents rural people on the whole in their diversity.

The party was a member of the Presidential Majority of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Formed in 1985, it contested both the European elections of [[European Parliament election, 1989 (France)|1989]] and [[European Parliament election, 1994 (France)|1994]] without success. In [[European Parliament election, 1999 (France)|1999]], it obtained six seats, led by [[Jean Saint-Josse]] who was at the top of the list. It lost all representation at the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|following election to the European Parliament in 2004]], when it obtained less than the minimum 3% of votes that allow a party to be reimbursed for campaign expenses. Consequently, it faced a deficit of 300,000 euros. At one stage, it had 32 regional councillors, but lost all of them in that same year. After these problems, most members of the CPNT have joined the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) or the [[Movement for France]], but the party is still in existence, and nominated [[Frédéric Nihous]], a hunter from Northern France, as a candidate in the [[French presidential election, 2007|Presidential election of 2007]]. Nihous won 1.15% of votes only, much lower than [[Jean Saint-Josse]] in 2002.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party ran as the junior partner of the [[Movement for France]] under the etiquette of the [[Libertas Party|Libertas]] political movement led by Irish businessman [[Declan Ganley]]. They won 4.8% of the vote, but only one seat, that of MPF leader [[Philippe de Villiers]].

In August 2009, CPNT President Frédéric Nihous announced interest in joining the [[Liaison Committee for the Presidential Majority]], which co-ordinates the parties which support the policies of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.france-info.com/spip.php?article329770&amp;theme=9&amp;sous_theme=10.|title= Après le MPF, CPNT se raccroche à l’UMP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the standing down of Frédéric Nihous in march 2016, Eddie Puyjalon assumed the leadership of the party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/aquitaine/gironde/le-girondin-eddie-puyjalon-succede-frederic-nihous-la-presidence-de-cpnt-951601.html|title=Le girondin Eddie Puyjalon succède à Frédéric Nihous à la présidence de CPNT|work=France 3 Nouvelle-Aquitaine|access-date=2018-08-10|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Popular support and electoral record==

CPNT is strong, for obvious reasons, in certain rural areas of France with an important community of [[hunters]]. It is strong in the [[Somme River]] estuary to the west of [[Abbeville]], in the [[Manche]] department and the [[Gironde]] department. In the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (France)|1999 European election]], CPNT won 25% of the vote in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/eur1999/001/080/index.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615091949/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/eur1999/001/080/index.html|archivedate= 2011-06-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 15.4% in the Manche, 15.2% in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] department and 11.9% in Gironde. In stark contrast, the party barely won 1% of the vote that year in the Alsatian department of [[Bas-Rhin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/eur1999/003/067/index.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110615092007/http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/eur1999/003/067/index.html|archivedate= 2011-06-15|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and did poorly in the east of France, much more industrialized and much less agrarian.

CPNT has three general councillors: one in the Somme, one in Gironde and one in the Hérault department.

Originally founded in Vienna, Austria in 1956, the '''International Institute For Peace''' was established as a way to introduce concepts of world peace. The IIP works together with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and the United Nations Organization for Education, Science, Culture and Communication (UNESCO) implement practices of peace worldwide. The IIP was criticized and removed from Vienna for a while. In 1989, the new founder, Erwin Lanc re-founded it and has been up and running again ever since. The emphasis on ideas of peace within multiple environments, specifically within schools and the military is an example of what the IIP does. The ideals of peace that the IIP focus on does not only apply to certain countries, but they also apply worldwide.    

== History ==
The International Institute for Peace was founded in Vienna in 1956 and re-founded by [[Erwin Lanc]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=IIP&gt;
[https://www.iipvienna.com/about-us/ IIP Vienna]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
It describes itself as follows:&lt;ref name=IIP/&gt;

"The International Institute for Peace (IIP) is an international and non-governmental organisation (NGO and INGO), with consultative status at ECOSOC and UNESCO. The IIP pursues the objective of contributing to the maintenance and strengthening of peace through its research activities and as a platform to promote non-violent conflict resolution in different areas of the world and to a wide range of people."

== Founders ==

It has consultative status at the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and the United Nations Organization for Education, Science, Culture and Communication (UNESCO). Its current president is Dr. [[Hannes Swoboda]].&lt;ref name=IIP/&gt;

According to Dr [[Julian Lewis (politician)|Julian Lewis]], a campaigner against the peace movement, it was "set up by the Kremlin after the [[World Peace Council|WPC]] [World Peace Council] was thrown out of Austria for subversion."&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, J., [http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=12. ''Fellow-Travelling Generals Re-Emerge''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414222100/http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=12 |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another source it was set up on the initiative of the WPC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://leninist.biz/en/1984/PCS453/3.20.2-Peace.Education.and.International.Organisations.335 ''Problems of Common Security]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to J.G.Barlow of the [[Heritage Foundation]], the WPC operated under cover of the IIP after the WPC was expelled from Vienna.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/30774644/Moscow-and-the-Peace-Offensive Barlow, J.G.,''Moscow and the Peace Offensive'', 1982]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, Erwin Lanc re-founded the institute as a non-governmental organisation and introduced new statutes. The IIP since 1989 is an Austrian association according to Austrian Law and is independent from any state.

== About ==
The International Institute for Peace was classified as an institute that is closely associated with UNESCO in 2011. Both IIP and UNESCO work together to address any and all violence that takes place, mainly in a lot of cities and populated places. The cases are then analyzed and members of the IIP and UNESCO think of and attempt to find ways of distribute peaceful ways to take care of the situation(s) at hand. The work that the IIP does helps UNESCO gain a more developed practice of peace and is taught how it can benefit younger people. The collaboration of these two organizations will most likely increase the chance of eventually obtaining world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/bureau-of-strategic-planning/resources/category-2-institutes/bureau-of-strategic-planning/the-international-institute-for-peace/|title=The International Institute for Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The IIP does a lot of things and helps in many ways. A few of the things that they do include: incorporating peace-building practices into various aspects such as art, climate change and the environment, provide mediation efforts for those who are in very stressful/violent situations (such as war), and building a global platform that people can access in order to help create peaceful societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/bureau-of-strategic-planning/resources/category-2-institutes/bureau-of-strategic-planning/the-international-institute-for-peace/|title=The International Institute for Peace {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art, climate change and environmental aspects are different ways for people to see and understand the importance of peace in a creative way and or emphasize peace in a way that is understandable. Mediation efforts are a way for the institute to suggest and or provide ways for people to practice peace. The global platform would/will do essentially the same thing, but on a global, more accessible scale.

The people who work at the IIP come from various countries and backgrounds. These people are experts in areas such as politics, peace research, and conflict resolution. This international organization focuses on promoting peaceful solutions to people in a wide variety of places. Typically, these things are taught in schools and the military, but this is an exception. Research is something that the IIP focuses on all around the world, including Austria, which is where the IIP is founded and based out of. They do a lot of research on topics such as international organization, peace, etc. The institute also looks at some findings which are based on how the economy, society and effectiveness of conflict resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://osce-network.net/partner-institutions/list-of-institutions/international-institute-for-peace-iip/|title=International Institute for Peace (IIP): OSCE Network|last=IFSH|website=osce-network.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings look at all of these things combined, because they all play a significant role when it comes to peace.

The IIP also focuses on trying to get people to experience the world and different cultures. The purpose of this is to get people to travel, as well as to get them to understand how international relations work. In a way, this also gets people to practice peace with the people in different countries/of different cultures. The cultural differences and learning about them is an important concept that the IIP tries to emphasize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=How can tourism promote a culture of peace?|url=http://peacetourism.org/how-can-tourism-promote-a-culture-of-peace/|journal=|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace plays a role in traveling, because the relations with other countries determines how much peace there is and whether it needs to be enforced more and if so, what and or how can the IIP do to help.

== International Ideas and Relations ==

=== Policies/Proposals ===

===== Middle East =====
The [[Palestine–Israel Journal|Palestine-Israel Journal]] (PIJ) held a conference in Amman, [[Jordan]] in 2007. This conference was entitled, "Promoting Peace Through Dialogue". This conference contained peace workshops. These workshops taught people from Palestine, Israel, as well as surrounding countries how to brainstorm peaceful solutions to various scenarios. The conference was successful in its efforts. Authors say that this/these types of workshops would be beneficial towards additional efforts to obtain world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.nec.gmilcs.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=10&amp;sid=ba0cf67a-0a76-4c54-b9f0-6c0204806b51@sessionmgr4007|title=Login|website=web.a.ebscohost.com.nec.gmilcs.org|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Asia =====
The Institute for International Policy Studies (IIPS) was founded in 1988 by [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]], who is the former Prime Minister of [[Japan]]. The IIPS was established as a way to propose policies of peace in an effort to help create a more peaceful world. The IIPS is a research institute that uses global perspectives to help implement practices of peace. This institute focuses both on the peace and or lack there of not only in Japan, but around the world. Japan is one of, if not the most peaceful country in the world, since they focus on and practice methods of peace as part of their culture. The IIPS emphasizes these practices and proposes these ideas as ways to help create world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.nec.gmilcs.org/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=7&amp;sid=2c4b3a17-a412-40f7-9944-66fc0348383e@pdc-v-sessmgr05|title=Login|website=web.b.ebscohost.com.nec.gmilcs.org|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008 was the year that marked the 13th anniversary of a treaty that was signed between [[China]] and Japan. This treaty is called the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China|Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China.]] This treaty was created to keep peace between China and Japan. Over the past 20 years, the IIPS has been doing research on regional peace, both in Eastern Asia and on a global scale. They are studying these things to stabilize and continue to keep the developing peaceful relations between China and Japan. Both China and Japan want to set an example for the rest of Eastern Asia, as well as the world about how to keep peace between multiple countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Haikuan|date=2008|title=The China-Japan Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests and East Asian Peace and Stability|url=|journal=Asian-Pacific Review|volume=15|pages=17|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In 2012, the European Union (EU) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Winning the Nobel Peace Prize makes the EU a perfect example and framework for peace projects around the world. The type of peace project that is exemplified here is what is called Wilsonian Liberalism. This means that these peace projects would involve free trade and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birchfield|first=Vicki|last2=Krige|first2=John|date=2017|title=European Integration as a Peace Project|url=|journal=British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations|volume=19|pages=3–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
The Canadian Peace Research Institute is an organization that was established in Canada in 1962. This organization focuses on how science/the sciences can help develop world peace. The people who created this institute hope to encourage other countries to create their own versions of the Canadian Peace Research Institute. They also want to encourage more scientific research and solutions within other countries. These include things such as natural and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=Norman|date=1963|title=Canadian Peace Research Institute|url=|journal=International Social Sciences Journal|volume=15|pages=469|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
There is currently a lack of research on the topic of promoting peace. There is a little bit of research, but not a lot. A lot of what is talked about is violence and war, instead of solutions to those issues. Peace research is not only done around the world, but as well as in an individual country and starts within the country and or state(s) themselves. There has been a lot of history of war in violence in the world. Due to this fact, it has lead to the creation of the [[International Peace Research Association]] (IPRA). This group was established in August, 1963. The purpose of this group was/is to help promote the idea of and advocate for more peace research to be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Röling|first=Bert|date=1965|title=National and International Peace Research|url=|journal=International Social Science Journal|volume=17|pages=487–501|via=Ebscohost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish Resistance Movement''' ({{lang-he|תנועת המרי העברי}}, ''Tnu'at HaMeri HaIvri'', literally ''Hebrew Rebellion Movement''), also called '''United Resistance Movement''' (URM), was an alliance of the [[Zionist]] paramilitary organizations [[Haganah]], [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. It was established in October 1945 by the [[Jewish Agency]] and operated for some ten months, until August 1946.&lt;ref name='Jewish Agency'&gt;Jewish Agency for Israel, [http://jafi.org/JewishAgency/English/About/History/#t6The History of the Jewish Agency for Israel] Retrieved on 27 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance coordinated acts of sabotage and [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine|against]] the British authorities.

The [[Zionist Movement]] had high hopes for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] administration elected in Britain after the [[Second World War]]. The latter, however, continued to apply the policies laid down in the [[White Paper of 1939]] which included restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. 

Negotiations began for the formation of the movement in August 1945 at the behest of [[Haganah]] leaders [[Moshe Sneh]] and [[Israel Galili]]. At the end of October of the same year, an agreement was signed forming the "Jewish Resistance Movement".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Silver, "Begin, A Biography". 1984, {{ISBN|0-297-78399-8}}. pages 62-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of the new movement included four representatives: Two from the Haganah (Sneh and Galili), a representative of the [[Irgun]] ([[Menachem Begin]]) and a representative of [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] ([[Nathan Yellin Mor]]).

In order to coordinate the activities of the groups, a civilian committee known as "Committee X" was made up of six members, representatives of the various political stream, (including [[Levi Eshkol]]). The operations board, who approved operations plans, was made up of [[Yitzhak Sadeh]] (of the [[Palmach]]), [[Eitan Livni]] (of the Irgun) and [[Yaakov Eliav]] (1917–1985) (of the Lehi).

During the movement's existence, eleven major operations were carried out, eight of them by the Palmach and Haganah, and three by the Irgun and Lehi, as well as many smaller operations.  Notable among these were:
* The release of 200 members of [[Aliyah Bet]] from the detention camp in [[Atlit detainee camp|Atlit]]
* The bombing of railroads and train stations on the [[Night of the Trains]] 
* The bombing of dozens of bridges around the country in the [[Night of the Bridges]] 
* Attacks on [[Palestine police|British police]] stations
* [[King David Hotel bombing|Bombing of the King David Hotel]] in [[Jerusalem]], where 91 people were killed including 28 British citizens, 41 Palestinian Arabs, 17 Palestinians Jews, two Armenians, a Russian, an Egyptian and a Greek.

In August 1946, in the wake of the King David Hotel bombing, [[Chaim Weizmann]], president of the [[WZO]] appealed to the movement to cease all further military activity until a decision on the issue had been reached by the [[Jewish Agency]]. The Jewish Agency backed Weizmann's recommendation to cease activities, a decision reluctantly accepted by the [[Haganah]], but not by the [[Irgun]] and the [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].  The JRM was dismantled and each of the founding groups continued operating according to their own policy.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, Edward (1982).

But remained permanently uncooperative.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6307">[[File:Blargos1.jpg|375px|thumb|'''La Noche de los Bastones Largos'''; July 29, 1966]]

'''La Noche de los Bastones Largos''' ("The Night of the Long Batons") was the violent dislodging of students and teachers from five academic [[Faculty_(division)|faculties]] of the [[University of Buenos Aires]] (UBA), by the [[Policía Federal Argentina|Federal Argentine Police]], on July 29, 1966. The academic faculties had been occupied by the students, professors, and graduates (the autonomous government of the university) who opposed the political intervention by the military government of General  Juan Carlos Onganía to unilaterally revoke the [[academic freedom]] established in the [[University reform in Argentina|1918 university reform]].

==Background==
On June 28, 1966, a coup led by General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] had overthrown elected [[president of Argentina|president]] [[Arturo Illia]] and started the military government known as the [[Revolución Argentina]].

The Argentine public universities were by then organised as dictated by the [[University reform in Argentina|university reform]], which established the autonomy of the university, and a political power divided in a tripartite government of students, professors and graduates.

The repression was particularly violent in the faculties of [[Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (UBA)|Exact and Natural Sciences]] and [[Facultad de Filosofía y Letras (UBA)|Philosophy and Literature]] of the UBA.

The name given to the events refers to the long batons used by the police to hit students, professors and graduates while taking them out detained of the buildings. 400 people were detained, with laboratories and libraries completely destroyed.

==Consequences==
In the following months hundreds of professors were fired, resigned their positions or abandoned the country.

In total, 301 university professors emigrated, of whom 215 were scientists, and 166 found their place in other [[Latin America]]n universities, mainly in [[Chile]] and [[Venezuela]]. 94 went to universities of [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Puerto Rico]], and 41 moved to [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Slemenson, "Emigración de científicos argentinos", 1970:118&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, complete research teams were dismantled, such as the [[Instituto de Cálculo de Ciencias Exactas]], where the first computer in Latin America was functioning. All of its 70 members resigned and left the country. Similar cases were those of the [[Instituto de Psicología Evolutiva]] and the [[Instituto de Radiación Cósmica]].

Some of the better known affected professors were:

* [[Sergio Bagú]], historian and sociologist, one of the pioneers of the  [[Theory of dependence]]. Exiled
* [[Manuel Sadosky]], pioneer of [[Computer Science]] in the country. Exiled
* [[Gregorio Klimovsky]], epistemology; one of the most important figures in logical mathematics and philosophy of science in the country.
* [[Pablo Miguel Jacovkis]], mathematician, dean of the [[Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (UBA)|FCEyN]], president of the [[CONICET]] (1999~2000).
* [[Rolando García (Argentinian scientist and epistemologist)|Rolando García]], meteorology, worked with [[Jean Piaget]]. Exiled.
* [[Félix González Bonorino]], most important geology scientist of the country.
* [[Tulio Halperín Donghi]], among Latin America's most renowned historians.
* [[Risieri Frondizi]], philosopher and ex-dean of the UBA.
* [[Juan G. Roederer]], astronomer in charge of the [[Instituto de Radiación Cósmica]].
* [[Catherine Cesarsky]], world-wide known astronomer, since 2006 president of the [[International Astronomical Union]].
* [[Telma Reca]], psychologist, director of the [[Instituto de Psicología Evolutiva]], fired.
* [[Mariana Weissmann]], atomic physician, receiver of the L'Oréal-Unesco award 2003, and first woman incorporated to the '' Academia Argentina de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales''. Exiled

==Dismantling of the reformist university==
With the intervention of the military government to the universities, a strict censorship was applied to the contents of the programs, and the scientific project of tight relationship between education and investigation in the universities.

The act of the military government is considered a central reference of the cultural and academic decadence, and the ''[[brain drain]]'' in Argentina.

==Recognition and memory==
In 2004 film director [[Tristán Bauer]] presented his documentary film ''La noche de los bastones largos: el futuro intervenido'', based in the events of July 29, 1966.

In July 2005 the [[Federación Universitaria Argentina]] delivered recognition diplomas to the 70 professors that resigned in 1966 to their positions at the Faculty of Agronomy of the [[University of Buenos Aires]]

'''Linked timestamping''' is a type of [[trusted timestamping]] where issued time-stamps are related to each other.

==Description==
Linked timestamping creates time-stamp tokens which are dependent on each other, entangled in some [[authenticated]] [[data structure]]. Later modification of the issued time-stamps would invalidate this structure. The temporal order of issued time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating of the issued time-stamps impossible, even by the issuing server itself.

The top of the authenticated data structure is generally ''published'' in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed [[newspaper]] or public [[blockchain]]. There are no (long-term) [[Public-key cryptography|private keys]] in use, avoiding [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-related risks.

Suitable candidates for the authenticated data structure include:
* Linear [[hash chain]]
* [[Merkle tree]] (binary hash tree)
* [[Skip list]]

The simplest linear hash chain-based time-stamping scheme is illustrated in the following diagram:
[[File:Hashlink timestamping.svg|none|600px]]

The linking-based [[Timestamping authority|time-stamping authority]] (TSA) usually performs the following distinct functions:

;Aggregation
:For increased scalability the TSA might group time-stamping requests together which arrive within a short time-frame. These requests are ''aggregated'' together without retaining their temporal order and then assigned the same time value. Aggregation creates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] connection between all involved requests; the authenticating aggregate value will be used as input for the ''linking'' operation.

;Linking
:Linking creates a verifiable and ordered cryptographic link between the current and already issued time-stamp tokens.

[[File:Root of Merkle tree as published in Widely Witnessed Media.png|thumb|321px|right|Example newspaper publication of hash-linked time-stamping service]]

;Publishing
:The TSA periodically ''publishes'' some links, so that all previously issued time-stamp tokens depend on the published link and that it is practically impossible to forge the published values. By publishing widely witnessed links, the TSA creates unforgeable verification points for validating all previously issued time-stamps.

==Security==
Linked timestamping is inherently more secure than the usual, public-key signature based time-stamping. All consequential time-stamps "seal" previously issued ones - hash chain (or other authenticated dictionary in use) could be built only in one way; modifying issued time-stamps is nearly as hard as finding a preimage for the used [[cryptographic hash function]]. Continuity of operation is observable by users; periodic publications in widely witnessed media provide extra transparency.

Tampering with absolute time values could be detected by users, whose time-stamps are relatively comparable by system design.

Absence of secret keys increases system trustworthiness. There are no keys to leak and hash algorithms are considered more future-proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_3| isbn = 978-3-540-88701-0| title = Post-Quantum Cryptography| year = 2009| last1 = Buchmann | first1 = J.| chapter = Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes| last2 = Dahmen | first2 = E.| last3 = Szydlo | first3 = M.| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than modular arithmetic based algorithms, e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].

Linked timestamping scales well - hashing is much faster than public key cryptography. There is no need for specific cryptographic hardware with its limitations.

The common technology&lt;ref&gt;See ISO/IEC 18014-1:2002 Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; for guaranteeing long-term attestation value of the issued time-stamps (and digitally signed data&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[XAdES|XAdES-A]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is periodic over-time-stamping of the time-stamp token. Because of missing key-related risks and of the plausible safety margin of the reasonably chosen hash function this over-time-stamping period of hash-linked token could be an order of magnitude longer than of public-key signed token.

==Research==

===Foundations===

Haber and Stornetta proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00196791 | title = How to time-stamp a digital document | year = 1991 | last1 = Haber | first1 = S. | issue = 2 | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | journal = Journal of Cryptology | volume = 3| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/haber91how.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to link issued time-stamps together into linear hash-chain, using a collision-resistant hash function. The main rationale was to diminish [[Timestamping authority|TSA]] trust requirements.

Tree-like schemes and operating in rounds were proposed by Benaloh and de Mare in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Benaloh and de Mare constructed a one-way accumulator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/3-540-48285-7_24| isbn = 978-3-540-57600-6| title = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT '93| year = 1994| last1 = Benaloh| chapter = One-Way Accumulators: A Decentralized Alternative to Digital Signatures | first1 = J.| last2 = Mare | first2 = M.| volume = 765| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 274| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/benaloh94oneway.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and proposed its use in time-stamping. When used for aggregation, one-way accumulator requires only one constant-time computation for round membership verification.

Surety&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surety.com/&lt;/ref&gt; started the first commercial linked timestamping service in January 1995. Linking scheme is described and its security is analyzed in the following article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/266420.266430 | isbn = 0897919122 | title = Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '97 | year = 1997 | last1 = Haber | chapter = Secure names for bit-strings | first1 = S. | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W.

Skip-list based time-stamping system was implemented in 2005; related algorithms are quite efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/11751595_43| isbn = 978-3-540-34075-1| title = Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2006| year = 2006| last1 = Blibech| chapter = A New Timestamping Scheme Based on Skip Lists | first1 = K.| last2 = Gabillon | first2 = A.| volume = 3982| pages = 395| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Sciencef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provable security===

Security proof for hash-function based time-stamping schemes was presented by Buldas, Saarepera&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Buldas
| first = Ahto
| last2 = Saarepera
| first2 = Märt

| doi = 10.1007/b104116}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004. There is an explicit upper bound &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the number of time stamps issued during the aggregation period; it is suggested that it is probably impossible to prove the security without this explicit bound - the so-called black-box reductions will fail in this task. Considering that all known practically relevant and efficient security proofs are black-box, this negative result is quite strong.

Next, in 2005 it was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldas|first1=A.|last2=Laud|first2=P.|last3=Saarepera|first3=M. R.|last4=Willemson|first4=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Universally Composable Time-Stamping Schemes with Audit.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.2070|journal=LNCS|volume=3650|pages=359–373|doi=10.1007/11556992+26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bounded time-stamping schemes with a trusted audit party (who periodically reviews the list of all time-stamps issued during an aggregation period) can be made ''universally composable'' - they remain secure in arbitrary environments (compositions with other protocols and other instances of the time-stamping protocol itself).

Buldas, Laur showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-71677-8_11 | isbn = 978-3-540-71676-1 | title = Knowledge-Binding Commitments with Applications in Time-Stamping | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4450 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 150–165| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 that bounded time-stamping schemes are secure in a very strong sense - they satisfy the so-called "knowledge-binding" condition. The security guarantee offered by Buldas, Saarepera in 2004 is improved by diminishing the security loss coefficient from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The hash functions used in the secure time-stamping schemes do not necessarily have to be collision-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-75670-5_9 | isbn = 978-3-540-75669-9 | title = Does Secure Time-Stamping Imply Collision-Free Hash Functions? | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Jürgenson | first2 = A.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4784 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 138–150| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even one-way;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/11767480_4 | isbn = 978-3-540-34703-3 | title = Do Broken Hash Functions Affect the Security of Time-Stamping Schemes? | year = 2006 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 3989 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 50–65| url = http://www.cs.ut.ee/~swen/publications/articles/buldas-laur-2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure time-stamping schemes are probably possible even in the presence of a universal collision-finding algorithm (i.e. universal and attacking program that is able to find collisions for any hash function). This suggests that it is possible to find even stronger proofs based on some other properties of the hash functions.

[[File:Hashtree timestamping.svg|thumb|none|600px|Hash tree based linking scheme]]
At the illustration above hash tree based time-stamping system works in rounds (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+2&lt;/math&gt;, ...), with one aggregation tree per round. Capacity of the system (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the tree size (&lt;math&gt;N=2^l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denotes binary tree depth). Current security proofs work on the assumption that there is a hard limit of the aggregation tree size, possibly enforced by the subtree length restriction.

==Standards==
[[ISO 18014]] part 3 covers 'Mechanisms producing linked tokens'.

[[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] for Financial Services, "Trusted Timestamp Management and Security" ([[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]]) from June 2005 covers linking-based and hybrid time-stamping schemes.

There is no [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] or standard draft about linking based time-stamping. RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax) encompasses hash tree and time-stamp as an integrity guarantee for long-term archiving.

'''Loss exchange ratio''' is a [[figure of merit]] in [[attrition warfare]]. It is usually relevant to a condition or state of war where one side depletes the resources of another through attrition. Specifically and most often used as a comparator in aerial combat, where it is known as a '''kill-ratio'''. For example, during the [[Korean War]], American combat jets had a kill-ratio of 4-1.{{dubious|date=January 2013}} This means for every four aircraft shot down by an American aircraft, one American plane was shot down by an enemy fighter.

== Historical applications ==
Loss exchange ratio has played a significant role in past wars, especially those that have devolved into [[stalemate]] and become wars of [[attrition warfare|attrition]]. For example, the German objective at the [[Battle of Verdun]] (1916) during World War I was not the seizure of any strategic objective, but rather to inflict an LER of 2:1 on the French forces and thereby cripple the French army.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}

During the [[First Indochina War]], [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], the leader of the [[Việt Minh]], told his French opposite number that "you can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, and at that rate, I will still triumph." In fact, the LER was approximately 3:1 in favor of the French, and they did indeed withdraw in defeat. A total of 500,000+ Vietnamese were either killed, wounded or captured during the First Indochina War.&lt;ref&gt;Smedberg, M (2008), ''Vietnamkrigen: 1880–1980''. Historiska Media, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary employment==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{See also|Network-centric warfare}}
It is arguable that the concept of the Loss exchange ratio has become relatively less important in modern Western military doctrine, as some military theories{{who|date=January 2013}} posit that it is just as militarily effective to [[Interdiction|disrupt enemy forces]] and outmaneuver them, thereby reducing their combat effectiveness without necessarily inflicting massive casualties.

'''MAGEN''' (Masking Gateway for Enterprises) is [[information security]] technology designed by [[IBM R&amp;D Labs in Israel#Haifa Research Lab|IBM's Haifa Research Lab]].  MAGEN is designed to keep users from viewing discrete chunks of secret or sensitive data on their screens that they are not authorized to see.

MAGEN applies a sort of inverse [[highlighter|highlighting]] on the data in question in real time as it is rendered on the screen.  This allows "[[Classified information|eyes only]]" business logic to be implemented once, at the screen, rather than within each affected application.

MAGEN leverages a combination of [[optical character recognition]] and [[screen scraping]] techniques.

'''Malayisation''' is a process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and [[acculturation]], that involves acquisition ({{lang-ms|Masuk Melayu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|2002|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2009|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 200"&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kipp|1996|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andaya &amp; Andaya 55"&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "embracing [[Malayness]]") or imposition ({{lang-ms|Pemelayuan}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nik Hassan Shuhaimi Nik Abdul Rahman|1998|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Melayuisasi''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of elements of [[Ethnic Malays|Malay culture]], in particular, [[Islam]] and [[Malay language]], as experienced by non-Malay populations of territories controlled or substantially influenced by historical [[Malay sultanate]]s and modern [[:Category:Malay-speaking countries and territories|Malay-speaking countries]]. It is often described as a process of civilisational expansion, drawing a wide range of indigenous peoples into the Muslim, Malay-speaking polities of Maritime Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 84"&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early form of Malayisation occurred during the territorial and commercial expansion of [[Melaka Sultanate]] in the 15th century, which spread the [[Classical Malay]] language, culture, and the religion of Islam to the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Following the demise of Melaka in the early 16th century, instances of this assimilation of people from different ethnic origins into Malay culture, continued under numerous Malay-Muslim sultanates that emerged in [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]]. Malayisation could either be voluntary or forced and is most visible in the case of territories where the Malay language or culture were dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate manifestation of this cultural influence can be observed in the present [[linguistic imperialism|dominant]] position of Malay language and its variants in Maritime Southeast Asia, the establishment of [[Malay world|ethnic Malays realm]] within the region, the forming of new cultures such as the [[Peranakan]], and the development of many [[Malay trade and creole languages]].

In linguistics, the term Malayisation may refer to the adaptation of oral or written elements of any other language into a form that is more comprehensible to a speaker of Malay; or in general, of altering something so that it becomes Malay in form or character.

==Early history==
[[File:Aidilfitri.upnm.2010.JPG|thumb|320px|left|A typical Baju melayu assemble, worn together with the [[songket]]. [[Baju Melayu]] traces its origin to the 15th century [[Malacca Sultanate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Siti Zainon Ismail|2009|p=167&amp;293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today is one of the most important symbol of Malay culture.]]
There is significant genetic, linguistic, cultural, and social diversity among modern Malay subgroups, mainly attributed to centuries of migration and assimilation of various ethnic groups and tribes within [[Southeast Asia]]. Historically, the Malays are descended from the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-speaking [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]], various [[Austroasiatic]] tribes, [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] settlers of ancient polities in coastal areas of Malay peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo; [[History of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Kedah Kingdom|Old Kedah]], [[Langkasuka]], [[Gangga Negara]], [[Chi Tu|Old Kelantan]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Negara Sri Dharmaraja]], [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Srivijaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=24, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=7&amp;60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spread of Islam in Southeast Asia|The coming of Islam to Southeast Asia]] constituted a new era in Malay history. The new religion transformed many aspects of the old Hindu-Buddhist-Animistic cultural practices and beliefs of the people and imbued it with an Islamic worldview. Beginning 12th century, the old polities were soon gradually superseded by Islamic kingdoms across the region. The most important of these was [[Melaka Sultanate]], established around 1400 CE. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, Melaka exercised its special role not only as a trading centre, but also as the centre of Islamic learning, therefore promoting the development of Malay literary traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|pp=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blossoming of [[Malay literature]] in this era had transformed the [[Classical Malay]] dialect of Melaka, enabling it to attain the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]]. As a result, growth in trade between Melaka and the rest of the archipelago has made the dialect to spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world, and eventually became a ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Maritime Southeast Asia. It was then further evolved into ''Bahasa Melayu pasar'' ("[[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]]") or ''Bahasa Melayu rendah'' ("Low Malay"),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generally believed as a form of pidgin influenced by contact between Malay and Chinese traders. The most important development, has been that pidgin Malay creolised, creating several new languages such as the [[Ambonese Malay#Ambonese Malay|Ambonese Malay]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Betawi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Malays and Javanese.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], hand-coloured copper engraving from [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]'s, ''Itinerario'', 1596. The legend reads "''Inhabitants of [[Malay peninsular|Malacca]], the best speakers, the most polite and the most amorous of the [[East Indies]]. Inhabitants of [[Java]], who are hard-headed and obstinate.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyt|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The period of Melaka was also known as the era of Malay [[ethnogenesis]], signified by strong infusion of Islamic values into Malay identity, and the flourish of various important aspects of Malay culture. The term 'Melayu' ("Malay") to refer to a distinct group of people had been clearly defined, to describe the cultural preferences of the Melakans as against foreigners from the same region, notably the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Thai people|Thais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cara Melayu'' ('ways of Malay'), were the ''cara Melaka'' ('ways of Melaka'); in language, dress, manners, entertainments and so forth, might be referred to as 'Malay', and this Melaka-based culture or civilisation was acknowledged right across the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aboriginal communities from [[Orang Asli]] and [[Orang Laut]] who constituted a majority original population of Melaka were also Malayised and incorporated into the hierarchical structure of Melaka. Successfully did Melakan rulers equate the kingdom with "Melayu" that one Malay text describes how, after a defeat, the people of Melaka fled into the jungle where they became ''[[Jakun people|Jakun]]'', that is ''Orang Hulu'' ('upriver people'). It shows that, without the mantle of Melaka's prestige, the local inhabitants were undifferentiated from the other non-Malay elements in neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melakans were described by European travellers as "white", well-proportioned, and proud. The men normally wear cotton garments (''[[sarong]]s'') which cover them only from the waist down, but a few of the more distinguished wear short, silk coats, under which they carry [[kris]]ses. Their women, who are olive-coloured, comely, and brunette, usually wear fine silk garments and short shirts. Nobody but the Sultan may wear yellow colours without special permission under pain of death. The faces of the natives are broad with wide noses and round eyes. Both sexes are well-mannered and devotees of all forms of refined amusement, especially music, ballads, and poetry. The rich pass life pleasantly in their country homes at Bertam which are surrounded by bountiful orchards. Most of them maintain separate establishments in the city from which they conduct their business. They take offence easily and will not permit anyone to put his hand on their head or shoulders. Often malicious and untruthful, they take pride in their ability to wield the kris adroitly against their personal enemies. In larger engagements they fight in bands with bows and arrows, spears and krises. In their beliefs, they are devout Muslims. Their language "is reported to be the most courteous and seemelie speech of all the Orient." It is readily learned by foreigners, and is the lingua franca for the entire region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lach|1994|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Malay sultanates==
[[File:Undang-Undang Melaka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A copy of ''[[Undang-Undang Melaka]]'' ('Laws of Melaka'). The Melaka system of justice as enshrined in the text was the first digest of laws, compiled in the Malay world, and became a legal resource for other major regional sultanates like [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], [[Perak]], [[Brunei]], [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] and [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fauzia|2013|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abd. Jalil Borham|2002|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After Melaka was [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|conquered]] by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1511, and the ruling family had established a successor polity in [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], it would appear that the 'ways of Malay' continued to be fostered and began to have an influence in surrounding sultanates. Startling even to the Portuguese conquerors was the extent to which most of [[Sumatra]]'s east coast had been influenced by its neighbour across the straits; almost all urban elites spoke Melakan Malay, and they also acknowledged not only correct speech but also good manners and appropriate behaviour, as Malay custom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esposito|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Melaka as a model also becomes evident, when comparing its [[Undang-Undang Melaka|law codes]] with those of other succeeding Malay sultanates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|1993|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malay language was one aspect of the prestige of the sultanates and considered as a language of the learned in Southeast Asia in 17th and 18th century comments. An 18th-century European account even suggests that one is not considered a very broadly educated man in the east unless he understands Malay.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations on the influence of the Malay language and kingship concepts relate to the inter-monarchical context. At the local level, individual Malay sultanates all over the archipelago that usually based on rivers and often close to the coast, exercised sufficient attractiveness, or suasion, to foster a process of assimilation. They were operating on a range of frontiers - in Sumatra, Borneo and the Peninsula - where non-Muslim peoples, in many cases the tribal communities, were gradually being brought into Malay realm: learning to speak the Malay language, adopting Islam, changing their customs and style of dress and assuming roles of one type or another within the expanding sultanates.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 81"/&gt;

In an early example from eastern Sumatra, the 15th century Sultanate of Aru, believed to be the precussor of Malay [[Sultanate of Deli]], is described in the Melaka-Johor chronicle as being of [[Batak]] origin. European observations on the same region from the 19th century suggests that people further upstream on the rivers of Deli, people who had long had a trading relationships with the coast, and were later called [[Karo people|Karo Batak]], were being incorporated in the Deli Sultanate. The Batak and Malay distinction was not racial but cultural, and by converting to Islam and taking on Malay dress and culture, the Batak could become Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kipp|1996|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both European and Malay writings show them being tutored in the new culture, receiving Malay titles such as ''Orang Kaya Sri di Raja'' as part of the process of conversion. Similar developments were underway in [[Sultanate of Asahan|Asahan]], to the south, and on the [[Barus]] frontier in the northwest of Sumatra where entry to the new sphere entailed not only a change in manners an clothing styles, but also the adoption of the Islamic religion and the Malay language.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 82"&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the peninsula, the effects of the continued contacts between the non-Malays with Malay-dominated centre is suggested in a 19th-century account of [[Pahang]], which mentions that some of the natives who had strong trading ties with the Malays had begun to emulate their speech and dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]] also has been described as partly aboriginal in origin. In the case of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]], the aboriginal people who were reported in the 19th century to be speaking [[Aslian languages]], were called 'Malay' a century later. It has been suggested that these people would probably have joined the [[Jakun people|Jakun]] first before becoming Malay. The Jakun are described as being similar to Malays in their kinship arrangements, but resistant to aspects of social structure as well as the Islamic religion of the Malays.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 82"/&gt; In 17th century [[Cambodia]], a polity renowned for its [[Buddhism]], [[List of kings of Cambodia|king]] Ramathipadi I converted to Islam, took the name Muhammad Ibrahim, married a Malay Muslim of a princely Cham family,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buyers|2011|p=[http://www.royalark.net/Cambodia/camboa5.htm Cambodia - Genealogy of The Varman Dynasty]}}&lt;/ref&gt; had his courtiers wear [[kris]]ses and used Malay language in correspondence. During the same century in [[Champa]], a once powerful Indianized polity but by that time retreating before the advancing [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], the rulers held the title ''Paduka Seri Sultan'' which is so common in the Malay polities. These rulers were in close contact with the peninsula, in particular [[Kelantan]]. French missionaries reported the presence of scribes and religious scholars from Kelantan right into the 19th century. It was believed that Kelantanese who eventually helped to give the Cham struggle against the Vietnamese, the character of a [[jihad|religious crusade]].&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 81"/&gt;

In [[Brunei Sultanate]], many of the Muslim subjects of the Sultan were converts from local [[Dayak people|Dayak]] groups. Acculturation had also taken place in [[Sarawak]] and Northern Borneo (modern day [[Sabah]]), where Brunei Sultanate and by the 18th century the Sulu Sultanate were collecting products for China and other markets, and establishing a fairly loose, river based governmental presence. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Brunei hierarchy, being given [[Malay styles and titles|Malay titles]] such as ''[[Datuk]]'', ''[[Temenggong]]'' and ''Orang Kaya''. What had once been independent villages were gradually built into wider units, and their leaders co-opted into the hierarchy of the polity. A colonial writing about Sarawak, observed that many non-Malays would be amazed to learn the degree to which the present Malay population derives from the local native sources, and among the latter are Sea ([[Iban people|Iban]]) and Land Dayaks ([[Bidayuh]]). In [[Kalimantan Utara|northeastern Borneo]], the [[Bulungan Sultanate|Bulungan]] Malays appear to be of [[Kayan people (Borneo)|Kayan]] origin. Further down the [[East Kalimantan|east coast]], the [[Paser Regency|Paser]] polity had extended its influence into the [[Barito River|Barito]]-speaking Dayak, and some of these people became Muslim and were eventually referred to as 'Paser Malays'. In [[Kalimantan Selatan|southern Borneo]], the Malay-speaking [[Sultanate of Banjar]] had been pushing inland since the 17th century, bringing Dayaks into its Muslim culture. In the [[West Kalimantan|west]], the development of such sultanates of [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], [[Sukadana]] and [[Landak Regency|Landak]] tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|pp=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The following are kingdoms that are known as "Malay Sultanate". A few of them directly founded by descendants of Malaccan ruling house notably the sultanates of Perak, Johor and Pahang. These sultanates along with Siak, Indragiri, Kelantan and Terengganu were the former part of Malaccan realm. There are also Malay Kingdoms that were not under Malaccan realm, but had close ties with the sultanate and subsequently adopted the Malaccan model of administration and culture like the case of Kedah, Brunei and Pattani.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed Anwar Omar Din|2011|p=22–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of the spread of the Malay culture should not neglect the [[Philippines]], where things may have developed differently only because of the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish Conquest]] that had morphed the archipelago into an isolated-colony. The influence of the Brunei sultanate in the [[Luzon]] region before Spanish rule is well recorded. In 1521, the ruler of [[Kingdom of Maynila|Maynila]] known as [[Rajah Matanda]], was a grandson of [[Sultan Bolkiah]] of Brunei, and "Borneans" were described as introducing Islam to the natives of [[Balayan]], [[Manila]], [[Mindoro]] and Bonbon. A further account declared that the "Borneans" and the people of Luzon had become 'almost one people', and their clothing styles and ceremonies and customs were certainly similar. When [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] visited the Philippines Islands, the Malay language was used for communication, and linguistic research has revealed the extent to which Malay had become a 'prestige language'. This is partly evidenced by the fact that key terms from the Malay kingship system entered local languages. These include titles such as ''[[datu]]'' dan ''[[laksamana]]'', and the words for 'rank' (pangkat), 'sitting legs crossed' (bersila), 'treason' (derhaka), 'magical chanting' (mantera) and 'story' (hikayat).&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 84"/&gt;

Malayisation also occurred in the form of acculturation, in addition to complete assimilation into Malay identity. In this way, it shaped the ethnocultural development of [[creole peoples|creole]] ethnic group such as [[Betawi people|Betawi]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Peranakan]], [[Jawi Peranakan]], [[Kristang people|Kristang]], [[Chitty]] and so forth. Such acculturation process was also reflected by assimilation of immigrants from other part of Maritime Southeast Asia, commonly known as ''anak dagang'' ('traders'), into the established Malay communities, aided by similarity in lifestyle and common religion ([[Islam]]). Among these immigrant communities, some cultural elements of Malay origin were later combined in various forms and degrees with their own elements, which partly retained. Notable groups including the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and [[Bugis]] Malays.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joseph|Najmabadi|2006|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary events==

===Malaysia===
[[File:Siti Nurhaliza - KLIFF 08.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Siti Nurhaliza]], the most prominent Malay pop star of her era, performing in full traditional Malay costume. She is credited with having introduced and popularised the Malay traditional pop culture throughout the [[Malay world]].]]
The Malay peninsula, now an important part of Malaysia, has been the stronghold of Malay sultanates for centuries. As the entire peninsular was consolidated under Melaka's rule in the 15th century, it became the core of the [[Malay world]] since then, thus earning its name ''[[Tanah Melayu]]'' ("Malay land") in Malay language. The traditional institutions of [[Monarchies of Malaysia|sultanates]] in the peninsula survived the [[History of Southeast Asia#European colonization|colonisation]], and were incorporated into the blueprints of the modern state in 1948. Ultimately, [[Malay rulers]] remained at the highest hierarchical order of the society, in accordance with what commonly referred as ''[[Ketuanan Melayu]]'' ("Malay supremacy").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2000|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2005|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Malayness has been conceived as fundamental basis for state's ideology and it became the main driving force for [[Malay nationalism]] in a struggle against British colonisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrington|2006|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state itself is largely organised around the idea of maintaining the special status of Malays as the first among equals of the ''[[Bumiputra]]'' communities.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 55"&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical identification of the Malays with Islam was entrenched in the [[Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. The article defines specifically a "Malay" as a person who professes the religion of Islam, habitually speaks the Malay language and conforms to Malay custom. The Malaysian government also has taken the step of defining Malaysian Culture through the 1971 [[National Culture Policy]], which defined what was considered official culture, basing it around Malay culture and integrating Islamic influences. The government has historically made little distinction between "Malay culture" and "Malaysian culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crouch|1996|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been a subject of criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phang|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; even by the Malays themselves, the notion of becoming a Muslim means ''Masuk Melayu'' (entering Malayness) remains popular. This could have been caused by the centuries-old unclear distinction between "Islamisation" and "Malayisation", for there is a high tendency of the new revertees having eventually Malayised by the dominant Malay-Muslim culture.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peninsular Malaysia]] is home to a small indigenous tribal populations, collectively known as [[Orang Asli]]. The Malayic speakers among them, already share a common cultural-historical background with the Malays, who can therefore easily see them as "incomplete" Malays, requiring only Islam and an acceptance of social hierarchy to make them "complete". There are also those who speak languages unrelated to Malay, such as Aslian-speakers, are not quite so easily seen as incomplete Malays, but the gap can be closed to a considerable extent by conversion to Islam. Governmental agencies, both state and federal, including for many years the JHEOA (now known as [[Orang Asli Affairs Department|JAKOA]]) itself, have accordingly spent much effort in converting the Orang Asli to Islam. The motivation for this is sometimes authentically religious, but it is more usually seen primarily as the means of Malayisation. Governmental policy towards Orang Asli has long proposed their integration into the broader Malaysian community should be brought about by assimilating them specifically into the Malay community, which by local custom and national law is Sunni Muslim by religion. JHEOA officers have been heard to comment that the Orang Asli "problem" - usually defined as that of poverty - would disappear if they became Muslims, and hence Malays. In September 1996, for example, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Land and Co-operative Development, Nik Mohamed Zain Nik Yusof, gave the following justification for the Federal government's newly announced review of legislation relating to Orang Asli land rights: "If these amendments are made, Orang Asli can be more easily integrated into Malay society. It will help them to embrace Islam and follow Malay customs too".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The impact of this institutionalised assimilation efforts has been tremendous to the demographics in certain area of the peninsular. One instance was in the [[Sedili]] valley, where modern anthropologists discovered in the 1970s that villages formerly reported by travellers to be Jakun, are now Malay communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the multi-ethnic state of [[Sabah]], the period of [[Mustapha Harun]] leadership (1967–1976) saw the processes of Malayisation and Islamisation, which from the federal government's view appeared to be a check on Kadazandusun nationalism and was therefore perceived as an integration and unifying process with the other native Muslim society, namely the Bajaus, Bruneis, Sungei and Ida'an. The then-mostly pagan Kadazandusun traditionally formed minority of a third of the state population and inhabited the western shores of Sabah. The successor [[Sabah People's United Front|Berjaya]] government under [[Harris Salleh]] continued the same policies. The state government promoted Malay language in government-aided schools, sponsored the [[Quran]]-reading competitions and organised various [[dawah]] activities. All these the Berjaya government considered to be in line with the spirit of Article 12(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] that provide legitimacy for the state to promote and assist in the funding of Islamic institutions and instruction, the core of which was to be derived from Malay-Muslim elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheah|2002|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brunei===
The traditional Malay notion of fealty to a ruler, charged to protect Islam in his territory, is still central in both Malaysia and Brunei. In Brunei, this has been institutionalised under the state ideology of ''[[Melayu Islam Beraja]]'' ("Malay Islamic Monarchy"). As a still functioning Malay sultanate, Brunei places Islamic institutions at the centre of the state's interest. It retains an elaborated Malay social hierarchy central to the community. As a result, there are two kind of Malayness in Brunei: the general Malay cultural pattern to which most of the population have by now assimilated, and the higher ranking social position labelled as "Berunai" which distinguishes some of those cultural-Malays from others.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 55"/&gt; The other main community, the [[Kedayan]]s, still rank lower, despite being Muslims and living in a manner virtually identical to that of the ''Orang Berunai''. Thus, unlike what happens elsewhere, assimilation to Malay cultural pattern in Brunei does not necessarily eradicate difference.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 55"/&gt;

===Singapore===
Singapore was once the powerhouse of sophisticated Malay cultural production, until [[Kuala Lumpur]] took over in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although usually thought of as an essentially Chinese city, Singapore was nevertheless a Malay city.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 56"&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the stereotype, Malays were the most urbanised of the island's three main races, and there was no such concentration of urbanised Malays anywhere else in the Malay world.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 56"/&gt; Here were produced a high proportion of the modernist Malay writings, including novels and newspapers, that generated Malay nationalism. The emergence of Singapore-Malay community was added to by intermarriage with [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Indian Muslims]] and Peninsula Malays immigrants, as well as the adoption of Chinese babies. In other words, Singapore's Malayness was a creolised culture, closer in character to the ''Pesisir'' (coastal) Malay culture that had developed elsewhere in the archipelago than to the kind of Malayness that characterised the Malay world proper of Peninsula and Sumatra. In Singapore itself, assimilation to Malayness was and is purely cultural, with no guiding hand to police it.&lt;ref name="Benjamin 2002 56"/&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[File:IstanaMaimum WEB-1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Maimun Palace]] in [[Medan]], a reminder of 19th century opulence of Malay [[Deli Sultanate]]. Although today the sultanate still crowned their sultan, he holds no actual political power, absorbed into [[North Sumatra]]n provincial government.]]
Historically, Indonesia was home to a number of Malay sultanates that were involved in the process of Malayisation throughout the archipelago. Three main elements of Malayisation; Malay monarchy or fealty to Malay ruling sultan, the preeminence of Malay identity (which include superiority of ethnic Malay and Malay language), and supremacy of Islam as the official religion, has no official recognition in modern Indonesian statehood. This is mostly because the [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]] and [[Unity in diversity|diversity]] policy enshrined in [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] national ideology that avoid domination of certain group over another.

Contrary to Brunei and Malaysia, a major component of Malayness&amp;nbsp; — fealty to a ruling sultan — was removed from the modern Indonesian [[republic]]an ideology. The formation of the Java-centered Indonesia saw the effective destruction of the functioning of the Malay sultanates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|He|Galligan|Inoguchi|2007|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian republican outlook regard [[monarchy]] as a form of ancient [[feudalism]] and incompatible to modern [[democracy|democratic]] statehood envisioned by Indonesian founding fathers. The movement against ruling monarch mainly led by [[leftist]] and [[nationalist]] that seek to dismantle traditional royal institution. In March 1946, a [[East Sumatra revolution|major uprising]] breaks out against several Malay-Muslim Sultanates and rich Malay classes in East Sumatra, removing the traditional feudal social structure in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tirtosudarmo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, several regional kingdoms or sultanate survive, despite holding no actual political power and without real authority, being replaced by provincial governatorial administration. The exception is Javanese [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] that won special region status, mostly owed to the sultanate's bid and support for Indonesian Republic during [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. These sultanates and kingdoms are only recognised as the custody of local culture, arts and traditions, although they might still enjoyed prestiges and held in high esteem especially among local community.

Officially, Malayness has no special position in Indonesian state ideology, except as one of the constituent regional cultures&amp;nbsp;— which tend to be represented on a province-by-province basis. Loyalty for a certain ethnic group was overshadowed with the new inter-ethnic loyalty, advocating the importance of the national unity and national identity of ''Bangsa Indonesia'' ("Indonesian nation") instead. Despite having widespread influence in the archipelago, [[ethnic Malay]] is only recognised as one of myriad [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian ethnic groups]], which enjoy equal status with other Indonesians such as [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minang]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], [[Chinese Indonesian]], [[Ambonese]] and [[Papuan people|Papuan]].

Despite being the source of the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian national language]], Malay itself has been degraded as a mere local dialect in Sumatra, equal in status with [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] and [[Batak language|Batak]] languages. Compared to local Malay dialects in Sumatra, Indonesian language develop further which absorbs rich terminology and vocabulary from other Indonesian native languages, also rich variations of local dialects across Indonesia.

Despite enjoying the status as overwhelming majority, [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]] is recognized just as one among six official [[Religion in Indonesia|religions recognized in Indonesia]]; together with [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]]. There is also no legal law, apart from family and peer pressure, to restrict [[Malay Indonesian]]s to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benjamin|Chou|2002|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of nationalist sentiments, rapidly progressing democracy, the destruction of the sultanates, and rampant [[Javanisation]], ushered in a prolonged period of Malay political acquiescence, significantly reducing the momentum of Malayisation in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lian|2001|p=878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
[[File:Cham girls in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cham girls, wearing [[Baju Kurung]].]]
The strong influence of Malaysia in religious education has involved a degree of Malayisation among the [[Cham people|Cham]] community in [[Cambodia]], including the wearing of Malay dress and the study of the Malay language. The many thousands of Chams who were allowed into Malaysia as refugees from [[Indochina Wars|the war in Indochina]] tended to be referred to by Malays in Malaysia as ''Melayu Champa'' ("Champa Malays") or ''Melayu Kemboja'' ("Cambodian Malays").&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 200"/&gt; Another community in Cambodia, the Chvea who tend to live in villages in the southern region of [[Kampot (town)|Kampot]], are a separate community from the Chams, who have illustrious historic roots in [[Vietnam]]. The [[Khmer language|Khmer]]-speaking Chvea are distinct from the Cham, and preferred to be called as 'Khmer Islam', so as not to draw attention to their foreignness. Nevertheless, they use Malay language religious  materials, write in the Jawi script, and many also speak Malay. Both Chvea and Cham have in recent years been drawn into pan-Malay conferences and networks promoted primarily by Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 178"&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|2010|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri Lankan Malay Father and Son.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sri Lankan Malay Father and Son, 19th century]]
There is a sizeable [[Sri Lankan Malays|Malay community]] in Sri Lanka, descended from soldiers, convicts, and political exiles brought from Dutch and British colonies of [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The [[Sri Lankan Creole Malay]] varieties spoken by the community, are currently endangered as they are no longer spoken by the younger generation.&lt;ref name="Nordhoff 2012 129"&gt;{{harvnb|Nordhoff|2012|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, there are efforts in sharpening the sense of Malay identity by promoting the usage of 'standard Malay' language. This move was ideologically favoured by the urban segment of the community as it enables them to feel linked to the larger Malay groups in Southeast Asia. The community's effort to teach standard Malay to its members is largely aided by the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian government]] through its high commission in [[Colombo]]. The high commission conducted courses in standard Malay, exclusively for members of the Malay community, and those who fared best were trained as language teachers in Malaysia. They were then expected to teach 'standard' Malay to their respective communities in Sri Lanka. These initiatives were welcomed and appreciated by the community. The language programmes and trips to Malaysia were made possible through the offices of the ''Gabungan Persatuan Penulis Nasional'' (GAPENA - the Federation of National Writers' Association of Malaysia). The Malays of Sri Lanka are constantly wooed by the Malaysian government, which chose to conduct the second GAPENA conference in Colombo in 1985, arranges periodic visits by representatives of the Malaysian government to the Malay Club in Colombo where grants are given for various community projects, and finances occasional trips to Malaysia for members of the community to attend conferences and seminars at the expense of the Malaysian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nordhoff|2012|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian government, however, does not seem to have similar aggressive efforts through its embassy in Colombo.&lt;ref name="Nordhoff 2012 129"/&gt; As a result, although the Sri Lankan Malays are predominantly of Indonesian origins (especially [[Javanese people|Javanese]]), an attempt by a Sri Lanka 'Indonesian' Organization to reconstitute them as 'Indonesians', was declined.&lt;ref name="Milner 2010 178"/&gt;

The '''Mehrangate''', also known as the '''Mehran bank scandal''', was a major [[Parliamentary history of Pakistan|political scandal]] that took place in the [[Bainazir Bhuttoo Government|first administration]] of [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] in [[1990 in Pakistan|1990]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Today, Nizami, 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nizami |first1=Arif |authorlink1=Arif Nizami |title=From Memogate to Mehrangate |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/03/09/from-memogate-to-mehrangate/ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=www.pakistantoday.com.pk |agency=Pakistan Today |publisher=Pakistan Today |date=9 March 2012 |location=Islamabad |language=en |format=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active-duty [[Army ranks and insignia of Pakistan|army officers]] and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI agents]] engaged in conspiring against the election campaign of [[Benazir Bhutto]] by having it oversaw the [[Campaign finance|campaign funding]] of [[Taxation in Pakistan|taxpayers's money]] to the  [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Islamic Democratic Alliance]] (IDA) under [[Nawaz Sharif]] during the [[Elections in Pakistan|nationwide elections]] held in [[Pakistani general elections, 1990|1990]].{{rp|Contents}}&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Kiessling, 2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiessling |first1=Hein |title=Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9781849048637 |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_cgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT114&amp;dq=Mehran+bank&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn_c3MnufcAhXtRt8KHe6eA2kQuwUINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mehran%20bank&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune, correspondents, 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Our Correspondents |first1=staff writers |title=1990 elections scandal: Habib says then army chief used him {{!}} The Express Tribune |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/347218/asghar-khan-petition-former-mehran-bank-chief-admits-distributing-rs400m/ |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=The Express Tribune |agency=The Express Tribune |publisher=The Express Tribune |date=8 March 2012 |location=Islamabad |language=en |format=html}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the official [[Bank account|accounts]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD), the [[Taxation in Pakistan|taxpayers funding]] was directed and transfer to the conservative politicians to compete with the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], which was much organized at that time.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, report in 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Report |first1=Dawn |title=Former bank chief claims being forced in Mehrangate |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/701078 |accessdate=12 August 2018 |work=DAWN.COM |agency=Dawn Newspaper |publisher=Dawn Newspaper |date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The nature of the [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|Sharif-Beg collusion]] was discovered by [[Javed Ashraf Qazi|J. Ashraf Qazi]], then-[[Director General of the Inter-Services Intelligence|Director ISI]], who wanted to move the taxpayers' funds into another account but the banks failed to meet the requests, leading the new director of opening the investigation on missing funds.{{rp|119}}&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Kiessling, 2016"/&gt; With media investigation in this matter further grew, the scandal became public with [[Asghar Khan]] filing a lawsuit at the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] against the [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad|IDA]] and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] in 1994. The case hearings and investigations went on for several years until 2012 when the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court of Pakistan]] eventually found [[Nawaz Sharif]], [[Mirza Aslam Beg|Aslam Beg]], [[Asad Durrani]], bankers, and other conservative politicians from the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML(N)]] responsible and guilty of their acts.&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspaper, report in 2012" /&gt; 

==Background==

After the exposure of the [[Operation Midnight Jackal|first scandal]] by the [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) in 1989, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] eventually revoked his [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|constitutional reserve powers]] that dismissed the [[Bainazir Bhuttoo Government|first administration]] of [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]], charging the Benazir's administration of [[Nepotism|nepotism]], [[Corruption in Pakistan|political corruption]], poor economic growth, law and order, and foreign affairs, in 1990.{{rp|441}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Team |first1=Freedom House Survey |title=Freedom in the World: The Annual Survey of Political Rights and Civil Liberties, 1992-1993 |date=1994 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=9780932088819 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQ2seflb_5kC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;dq=Ghulam+ishaq+nepotism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpmf__u-3cAhVJwZ8KHf0kBacQuwUILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ghulam%20ishaq%20nepotism&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Election Commission of Pakistan|Election Commission]] (ECP) announced the timeline schedule of [[Pakistani general election, 2018|nationwide general elections]], the [[ISI (Pakistan)|ISI]] methodically and systematically released taxpayer's funds to the [[Islamic Democratic Alliance|IDA]]'s [[Conservatism in Pakistan|conservative politicians]]. The authorization for thethe taxpayer's funds was came from [[Lieutenant-General|Lt-Gen.]] [[Asad Durrani]], then-[[Director General of the Inter-Services Intelligence|Director ISI]], who enjoyed the support from [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and, allegedly [[General Mirza Aslam Beg|Gen. Beg]], the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|army chief]] at that time. During this time, the monetary [[Embezzlement|embezzlement]] took place was reported around of the sum of [[Pakistan Rupee|₨.]] 5.6[[Billion|Bn]] (approx. [[Euro|€]] 160 million at that time), and [[United States Dollar|US$]] 39 million was later additionally deposited in the intelligence funds.{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiessling |first1=Hein |title=Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9781849048637 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_cgDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117&amp;dq=Mehrangate+Ghulam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifpaGAve3cAhXHxFQKHZrJAo4QuwUILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mehrangate%20Ghulam&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiated by [[Pakistan Army]]'s [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] [[General Mirza Aslam Beg]] with the alleged support of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]], payments of up to PKR 140 million were made by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director-General Lieutenant-General [[Asad Durrani]] via the owner of Mehran Bank, Yunus Habib. Intelligence funds were deposited in Mehran bank in 1992 propping up what was an insolvent bank as a favor to its owner's for help in loaning money to the Inter-Services Intelligence in 1990 that was used in the creation of the right wing alliance [[Islami Jamhoori Ittehad]] (IJI) and bankrolling the campaigns of many opponents of the PPP.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

The scandal subsequently broke after the new ISI Director-General Lieutenant-General [[Javed Ashraf Qazi]] decided to transfer the intelligence fund back to state owned banks as per official rules. Mehran Bank was unable to return the money due to its poor financial state and collapsed. It was later discovered that large sums had been siphoned off to 39 fictitious parties.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In 1995, Mehran Bank was amalgamated with the [[National Bank of Pakistan|National Bank]] and in 1996 the NBP had to make full provision for Mehran's liabilities which resulted in a net loss that year to the bank of Rs 1.260 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghazali.net/book1/Chapter11a/body_page_4.html|title=ISLAMIC PAKISTAN: ILLUSIONS &amp; REALITY|first=Abdus Sattar|last=Ghazali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yunus Habib was arrested on 7 April 1994 for misappropriation in the sale proceeds of the Dollar Bearer Certificates. On Dec 14, 1995, Younus Habib was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and given a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment by the Special Court for Offences in Banks in Sindh. On April 20, 1994, giving details about the payments made by Habib to generals, politicians and political parties, the then Interior Minister, [[Naseerullah Babar]], told the National Assembly that the main beneficiary of his largess was former army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg who received Rs140 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sabir Shah|title=Many characters of Asghar Khan case already dead|publisher=The News|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/68219-many-characters-of-asghar-khan-case-already-dead|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
In March 2012, [[Pakistan's Supreme Court]] summoned Younis Habib, (Mirza Aslam Beg), and Asad Durrani to testify in response to a lawsuit filed by Air Marshall Asghar Khan in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Central character of Mehran Bank scandal resurfaces|publisher=Dawn|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/700867/central-character-of-mehran-bank-scandal-resurfaces|date=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October 2012, the Supreme Court tribunal found Beg and Durrani guilty of violating the Constitution for their roles in the bribery. Beg has evaded testifying before the court, arguing his constitutional rights were violated by the court's finding before he could testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen Beg keeps defying apex court orders|publisher=The News|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/15223-gen-beg-keeps-defying-apex-court-orders|date=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ministry of Agriculture Warsaw4.jpg|250px|thumb|One of the entrances to the Ministry's main building]]

The '''Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi}}) was formed on October 1999 from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy of Poland; the ministry can trace its history to 1944.

The Ministry's 1999 incarnation was brought about because development of rural regions was Poland's greatest political, economic, and social challenge that was uncontested by both coalition and opposition politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/99/11/best11_hermann.html Hermann, Rudolf "Ready for the Chop" Central Europe Review, Vol 1, No 11, 6 September 1999], retrieved on 17 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry is concerned with various aspects of Polish [[agriculture]] and improving its [[rural]] areas.

The current minister is [[Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski]].

The '''Ministry of Healthcare of Azerbaijan Republic''', also known as '''Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan Republic''' ({{lang-az|'''Azərbaycan Respublikasının Səhiyyə Nazirliyi'''}}) is a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan]] in charge of regulating the healthcare system in [[Azerbaijan Republic]]. The ministry is headed by [[Ogtay Shiraliyev]].&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/world-leaders-a/azerbaijan.html |title=CIA.

==History==
The Ministry of Healthcare was established on June 17, 1918 by the decree of Council of Ministers of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] led by [[Fatali Khan Khoyski]]. The first appointed minister was [[Khudadat Rafibeyli]], who had graduated from [[Kharkov University]] in 1903 and was the most experienced surgeon in the country at the time.
The ministry consisted of five departments, including city healthcare department, healthcare statistics, therapy, rural healthcare and veterinary offices. The medical care was provided to the population free of charge while the authorities built new hospitals, laboratories, medicine wearhouses and purchased medical equipment.
Throughout the 23-month-long existence of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, 33 hospitals operated in Azerbaijani provinces with each having 1 doctor, 2 paramedics, 1 gynecologist and one nurse conducting vaccinations. According to statistics, there was only one doctor per every 75,000 citizens. Due to the shortage, the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani parliament]] included building of 35 new hospitals and 56 paramedical office in 1920 fiscal budget committing [[Azerbaijani manat|AZN]] 43,321,950. During the Soviet rule of Azerbaijan, new hospitals and pharmacies were built. In 1960-70s, the medical sector was enhanced and new ambulance services opened for public.

The Mossawa Center was established in 1997 as a [[civil society]] organization to promote equality for [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizens in Israel.]]&lt;ref&gt;B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, Last Visited on October 15, 2013, http://www.btselem.org/about_btselem/human_rights_sites&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic]], "mossawa" means "equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#ar/en/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A9|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization works to promote the social, economic, cultural, and political rights of the Arab minority living in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Idealist Organization, Last Visited on October 16, 2013, http://www.idealist.org/view/nonprofit/PcB6GXSJ6SXd/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and Economic Justice==
Arab citizens have been left behind in the development of the Israeli state.&lt;ref&gt;Gad Lior, OECD: Haredi, Arab integration insufficient, "Ynet News," May 23, 2013, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4383139,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mossawa monitors the [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|State Budget]] and prepares reports demonstrating the [[discrimination]] against Arabs implicit in the distribution of services.&lt;ref&gt;The Mossawa Center will monitor the allocation of 1.8 billion shekels for the Arab community, "The Mossawa Center", last visited on October 16, 2013, {{cite web |url=http://www.mossawacenter.org/en/item.asp?aid=1090 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017225916/http://www.mossawacenter.org/en/item.asp?aid=1090 |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mossawa Center lobbies the [[Knesset]] to increase budget allocations to the Arab community in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mossawa.org/en/article/view/624|title=Mossawa hosts Knesset Finance Committee conference on... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Mossawa director Jafar Farah met with members of the Knesset and held a conference with the Knesset Finance Committee to increase budgets for education, welfare, public transportation, and health services in the Arab community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mossawa.org/en/article/view/624|title=Mossawa hosts Knesset Finance Committee conference on... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mossawa Center partners with and advocates for the needs of Arab localities in Israel. At the organization’s annual Conference on the Legal Status of Arab Citizens of Israel in 2016, the Mossawa Center recognized [[Al-Araqeeb]], an [[Unrecognized Bedouin villages in Israel|unrecognized Bedouin village]] in the Negev Desert, with an “Unsung Hero Award” presented by [[Martin Luther King III]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mossawa.org/en/article/view/613|title=MLK III will present awards to the unrecognized village... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}} &lt;/ref&gt; Mossawa also honored Jabir Asaqla, Head of Graduate Programs at the Mandel Center for Leadership in the North, and Nabila Espanioly, founder of Al-Tufula Pedagogic Center.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In September 2015, Mossawa helped to organize a student strike in advance of the start of the school year over government discrimination in terms of providing budgets to meet the needs of Arab citizens of Israel. Jafar Farah reportedly explained, “We want the government to take responsibility for the future of Arab citizens of Israel because we pay taxes like everyone else.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/arab_local_councils_set_to_strike_beginning_of_school_year|title=Arab local councils set to strike beginning of school year {{!}} Israel|newspaper=Jewish Journal|access-date=2016-12-22}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Advocacy==
Mossawa takes on legal cases supporting the Arab minority as in the case of the unrecognized neighborhood, Wadi Suya'h, in Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;The Central Court Rejects a Request to Issue a Precautionary Order to Freeze the Approval for the Plan in the Neighborhood of Wadi Suya'h, "Arab Center for Alternative Planning," July 19, 2013, {{cite web |url=http://www.ac-ap.org/The-Central-Court-Rejects-a-Request-to-Issue-a-Precautionary-Order-to-Freeze-the-Approval-for-the-Plan-in-the-Neighborhood-of-Wadi-Suya-h.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017193633/http://www.ac-ap.org/The-Central-Court-Rejects-a-Request-to-Issue-a-Precautionary-Order-to-Freeze-the-Approval-for-the-Plan-in-the-Neighborhood-of-Wadi-Suya-h.html |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossawa joined other organizations in those arrested for demonstrating against the [[Bill on the Arrangement of Bedouin Settlement in the Negev|Prawer-Begin Plan]] in representing the Arab town of [[Sakhneen]] on July 15, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;District Court Appeal against Extension of Detention of Anti-Prawer Protestors in Sakhneen, Hearing at 13:30, "Adalah," July 17, 2013, http://www.adalah.org/eng/Articles/2186/District-Court-Appeal-against-Extension-of-of-in-at&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy in the Knesset==
The Mossawa Center frequently advocates in the Knesset for greater budget allocations to the Arab community in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mossawa.org/en/article/view/575|title=Mossawa Calls for Anti-Poverty Measures, Condemns... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mossawa.org/en/article/view/464|title=The Mossawa Center hosted Knesset conference on the state... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossawa has been critical of Government Resolution 922, which was intended to close gaps between the Arab and Jewish sectors in Israel. The Mossawa Center argued that Government Resolution 922 was insufficient to close gaps in education, welfare, health, and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mossawa.org/en/article/view/624|title=Mossawa hosts Knesset Finance Committee conference on... - The Mossawa Center|access-date=2016-12-22}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Mossawa Center argued that the so-called “NGO law” was detrimental to Arab organizations’ advocacy efforts in Israel and would disproportionately affect organizations sympathetic to Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.org/2016-october/diplomatic-doings-palestinian-knesset-member-%C2%ADisrael-is-on-a-dangerous-path.html|title=Diplomatic Doings: Palestinian Knesset Member: Israel is on a Dangerous Path {{!}} WRMEA|website=www.wrmea.org|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossawa denounced legislation in 2010, which would require that immigrants recognize Israel as a Jewish state, noting that this legislation would disproportionately affect Arabs and would threaten Israel’s [[Democracy|democratic]] character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/1007/Israel-loyalty-oath-bill-stirs-Arab-Israeli-unease|title=Israel loyalty oath bill stirs Arab-Israeli unease|last=Mitnick|first=Joshua|date=2010-10-07|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|issn=0882-7729|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3869105,00.html|title=Mossawa Center urges boycott of Foreign Ministry cadet course|newspaper=Ynetnews|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Mossawa also works closely with youth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;International Volunteer Program in Palestinian Communities in Israel, "Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign," last visited Oct 16, 2013, http://www.ipsc.ie/event/palestineisrael-international-volunteer-program-in-palestinian-communities-in-israel-mossawa-center&lt;/ref&gt; The Mossawa Center has hosted camps for international youth come to visit andvolunteer in local communities, and learn about Palestinian culture, customs, and heritage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7247">{{Policy Debate}}

The '''National Debate Tournament''' is one of the national championships for collegiate [[policy debate]], [[public forum debate]], [[Lincoln-Douglas debate]], and other events in the [[United States]].  The tournament is sponsored by the [[American Forensic Association]] with the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Company Fund]].

==History of the NDT==
The National Debate Tournament (NDT) began in 1947 at the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The West Point National Tournament|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/Articles/ndtart2.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-nine schools competed at the first NDT debating: "Resolved: That labor should be given a direct share in the management of industry". It remained at West Point through 1966, at which time the Tournament Director met with the district chairs and advised them that at the tournament banquet of the Military Academy's decision to discontinue hosting the NDT in the ensuing years in part because of the increased demands on space and money that the United States' growing involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] was placing on the Academy.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziegelmueller|first=George|title=Selected Personal History of the NDT|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/Articles/ziegelmueller.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then the tournament has moved to different member schools each year and only three schools have hosted it twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to the National Debate Tournament|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/Articles/ndtintro.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first NDT, teams were nominated by committees from their district. This was soon replaced with district qualifying tournaments. Eight, post district tournament, "second round" at-large bids were awarded beginning in 1968 and continuing through 1970, enlarging the field to 44 teams, and two of these second round selections "cleared", or finished in the top sixteen in the preliminary rounds, in 1968, three cleared in 1969 and four of the eight post district tournament qualifiers cleared in 1970.

Prior to 1970, a school could only send one team to the NDT, but the tournament committee relented to pressure from some of the more successful programs and a total of eight schools sent two teams to the 1970 National Debate Tournament that year.  The winner of that tournament, designated Kansas "B", would not have been eligible to participate if the one team per school rule had remained in force.

In 1971, the format was amended to assign seventeen at large bids prior to district qualifying tournaments followed by the selection of an additional 27 teams by the district tournaments and another eight in a second at large selection round, enlarging the field to 52 teams.  Ten regular season tournaments were designated to be "qualifying tournaments", such that winning one earned that team an automatic NDT berth, and the remainder of the first at-large round teams were selected by vote of the selection committee. That format lasted for just two years.

Starting in 1973 and continuing to the present, sixteen at large bids are awarded to teams based on records prior to the district tournament selections, and additional at-large bids are awarded after the district qualifying tournaments.  The field was enlarged to 62 teams in 1973 and stayed that size until 1987, when it was enlarged to include 74 teams, and it then varied in size from 72 to 78 teams over the next decade.

Since 1992, a limited number of schools, currently six, have been allowed to send a third team.

[[judge (policy debate)|Mutual preference judging]] (MPJ) is a relatively recent addition to the NDT. Under MPJ, each debate team ranks the judging pool according to their preferences and judges are selected such that both teams prefer the chosen judge equally (if possible). Attempts are made to place as many mutual "1"s (the highest rating) in rounds, with preference given to the teams with the best record.

==Selection of Teams==
Currently, selection of the 78 teams participating at the NDT involves a three stage process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parson|first=Donn|title=W(h)ither the NDT?|url=http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/Articles/dwparson.html|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   First, the national committee selects 16 teams and awards them a First Round At-Large Bid.  These teams have been ranked by their seasonal performance to have been the top debate teams in the nation.  The national committee then apportions 46 bids to each of the nine NDT Districts.  Each district is free to decide how these bids will be awarded to teams within each district.  Most, although not all, districts decide to hold a district tournament, where the top teams will receive a bid.  The final and third step for qualification is the Second Round At-Large Bid.  Similar to a First Round Bid, the national committee selects the top 16 teams not already qualified to fill out the field for the NDT.  Although in some cases, these final 16 teams may not be the true best 16 teams not already qualified to the tournament.  The NDT has a standing rule stating a school cannot qualify more than two teams to the tournament, with the exception of at most six schools per year, who are allowed to qualify a third team, if the third team in question has shown merit for selection.

==Traditions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NDTannouncements.jpg|thumb|John Fritch announces "Round the First" at the 2007 [[NDT]]]] --&gt;
*'''"The Big Board"''': Started at the first NDT, complete results for each team are listed on the "Big Board" in the central area, horse-race style.
*'''Orally announcing pairings''': Started at the first NDT, the pairings for each round are read out loud to the contestants.  The announcements are known for the unusual manner in which they are conveyed.  For instance, the announcer might say, "The 51st National Debate Tournament, round the first."  This is then followed by the "pairings" of opposing teams, judges, room numbers, and the expected start time.  A poll conducted at the 2005 NDT showed strong support for continuing this tradition.
*'''Cadet escorts''': Cadets at the USMA escort debaters to their rounds and carry their tubs. Although this tradition was discontinued when the NDT moved from the [[United States Military Academy|USMA]], it has reemerged at the regular season tournament hosted by the USMA.

'''Online Justice  (OJ or Rechtwijzer or MyLawBC)''' is an [[online dispute resolution]] (ODR) platform. The OJ technology was the first ODR distributor to succeed in adapting ODR for relation disputes like divorce and landlord-tenant issues.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/blog/going-dutch-solution-legal-aid-crisis). Rogers. “Is going Dutch the solution to the legal aid crisis?”. Solicitors Journal. (September 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

OJ's first application was the Dutch Rechtwijzer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.rogersmith.info/ive-seen-the-future-it-works-maybe-and-its-in-dutch/ ). Smith. “Ive seen the future: it works maybe and its in Dutch”. Professor Roger Smith OBE.(March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The founding organisation of the OJ technology - HiiL - developed it in conjunction with the Dutch Legal Aid Board, Ministry of Security and Justice, and Modria. Earlier versions were developed at [[Tilburg University]] under the leadership of Corry van Zeeland. Later, OJ director Jin Ho Verdonschot,&lt;ref&gt;Mulgrew. “[http://www.vancouversun.com/Mulgrew+Getting+divorce+Just+click+here/10196119/story.html?__lsa=7649-c7f6 Getting a divorce? Just click here]”. ''Vancouver Sun''. (October 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; together with Maurits Barendrecht, who is the research director at HiiL, designed the current Rechtwijzer and OJ technology - through a co-creation process with a broad group of judges, lawyers, mediators, [[social psychologist]]s, business model experts, [[software developer]]s, [[UI designer]]s, and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/pioneering-online-dispute-resolution-service-launches-divorce-package). Bindman . “Pioneering online dispute resolution service launches divorce package”. legalfutures. (March 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==
OJ technology current powers platforms for divorce in the [[Netherlands]] (Rechtwijzer with the Dutch Legal Aid Board), [[British Columbia]] (MyLawBC with the Legal Services Society of BC) and the [[United Kingdom]] (with [[Relate]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21693582-justice-secretary-pleases-lawyers-overturning-his-predecessors-harshest-policiesbut-they “Law in a time of austerity”]. ''The Economist''. (February 27, 2016).
&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a landlord-tenant disputes and a debts restructuring version running in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Matlack. “[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-30/robots-are-taking-divorce-lawyers-jobs-too Robots Are Taking Divorce Lawyers’ Jobs, Too]”. ''Bloomberg Businessweek''. (June 30, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The process in all the OJ platforms has three stages with two main components.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.openlawlab.com/2014/01/16/rechtwijzer-justice-platform/). Margaret. “The Rechtwijzer Justice Platform”. Open Law Lab. (January 16, 2014).
&lt;/ref&gt; First, the optional diagnosis, which is a guided pathway to information and advice to those considering separation. Then there is the mandatory intake, where a series of questions are answered to establish the needs, interests and first thoughts, in terms of solutions, for both parties. This is followed by the mandatory dialogue, where both parties collaborate on model solutions step by step to complete their agreement. There is the optional help phase, where any of the two parties can request mediation or adjudication services. Last, is the mandatory review, which is done by a certified legal professional to establish the fairness of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeulen. “[http://www.volkskrant.nl/magazine/overheid-helpt-bij-snelle-scheiding-via-internet~a4252661/ Overheid helpt bij snelle scheiding via internet]”. ''de  Volkskrant''. (February 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pantsuit Nation''' is a private [[Facebook group]] and [[Twitter hashtag]] used to rally [[Hillary Clinton]] supporters during [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|her 2016 presidential campaign]] in the [[United States]]. The group is not affiliated with a political party, but its symbol, the [[pantsuit]], was used as a [[metonym]] for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign – similarly to how [[MAGA hat|red-colored hats]] were used for the campaign of her opponent, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="CNN: suits up"&gt;

Members of the group focus on immigration reform, racial justice, religious freedom, and women's reproductive rights. During the November 2016 U.S. presidential election, the group had 2.9 million members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/08/pantsuits-nation-clinton/93500206/|title=Pantsuits Nation on fire: Clinton thanks viral Facebook group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has raised up to $170,000 for the Clinton campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/07/inside-the-huge-secret-facebook-group-for-hillary-clintons-biggest-fans/|title=Inside the huge, ‘secret’ Facebook group for Hillary Clinton’s biggest fans|first=Abby|last=Ohlheiser|date=7 November 2016|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13546830/pantsuit-nation-hillary-clinton-election-secret-private-facebook-group|title=Pantsuit Nation, the giant, secret Hillary Facebook group, explained|first=Jenée|last=Desmond-Harris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the group has nearly 4 million active members.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/09/527422101/pantsuit-nation-serves-up-nostalgia-uplift-heartbreak-but-why|title='Pantsuit Nation' Serves Up Nostalgia, Uplift, Heartbreak.

== Background ==
On 20 October 2016, Libby Chamberlain, a private resident of [[Brooklyn]], [[Maine]], created Pantsuit Nation, an invite-only Facebook group to follow the third presidential debate. Chamberlain graduated from [[Yale University]] in 2006. A mother of two, she previously worked for an environmental non-profit; and as a college and career counselor at a high school in Maine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/us/politics/facebook-pantsuit-nation-clinton.html|title=Pantsuit Nation, a ‘Secret’ Facebook Hub, Celebrates Clinton|last=Correal|first=Annie|date=2016-11-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chamberlain started Pantsuit Nation in an effort to encourage a few of her Facebook friends to wear pantsuits to honor Clinton's trademark campaign garb and get to the voting polls in support of the nation's first female presidential candidate nominated by a major party. She considered Clinton and her pantsuits to be an emblem of the historic effort towards equal rights for women. Pantsuit Nation began with only 30 members, but gained traction quickly, growing to 24,000 members overnight and to 2.9 million by 8 November, 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

On 8 November, 2016, the Clinton campaign's digital manager personally thanked Pantsuit Nation for its support. When Clinton did not win the [[2016 Presidential Election]], she too thanked the group's army of supporters in her concession speech and encouraged them to voice their opinions proudly and publicly, outside the realm of a secret group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pantsuit-nation-this-is-the-secret-group-of-hillary-clinton-supporters-2016-11|title=This is the secret Facebook group that Hillary Clinton thanked during her concession speech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election, Pantsuit Nation inspired spinoffs across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pantsuit-nation-mobilizes-946423|title=In the Wake of Clinton Defeat, Pantsuit Nation Mobilizes for More Action|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Alabama Together]], a group in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]], Alabama, one of the communities that were rocked in 2017 by visits from [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]]-sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/richard-spencer-auburn|title=A Judge Ruled That White Nationalist Richard Spencer Can Speak At Auburn University Tonight|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hillary Clinton (30464713010).jpg|thumb|Hillary Clinton in her signature pantsuit]]Pantsuit Nation consisted of people of different age groups, ethnicities, and political alliances. The group started as a space for members to share stories and pictures for their support of Clinton but has since transformed to encompass a wider range of progressive, [[Anti-Trump movement|anti-Trump]] subject matter. Group members share in detail their experiences as women, members of the [[LBTQ|LGBTQ]] community, immigrants, racial minorities, and religious minorities.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepolitic.org/activism-and-slacktivism-pantsuit-nation-ten-months-after-trump/|title=Activism and Slacktivism: Pantsuit Nation Ten Months After Trump|last=Zhao|first=Helen|date=2017-10-13|website=thepolitic.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trump administration's actions against transgender individuals and immigrants, particularly his announcement to end the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA]] program, have sparked flurries of activity on the page.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Members have felt emboldened and empowered by the community Pantsuit Nation provides. Posts to the group contain fan art from the campaign, including its logos and slogans on clothes, signs, bodies, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/pantsuit-nation-trnd/index.html|title='Pantsuit Nation' suits up for Election Day|last=CNN|first=Emanuella Grinberg,|work=CNN|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizers ==
The leadership of Pantsuit Nation consists of five executive members and 80 volunteer moderators as well as chapter leaders.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pantsuitnation.org/mission.html|title=About Pantsuit Nation|website=Pantsuit Nation|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby Chamberlain is Director of Content, Cortney Tunis is Executive Director, Cat Plein is Chief Operating Officer, Grace Caldara is Director of Engagement, and Kimma Barry is Director of Community Relations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

== Chapters ==
After the success of the Facebook group, organizers expanded the Pantsuit Nation brand to include regional chapters, whose mission is to promote story-driven activism. The chapters give members the chance to meet like-minded activists in person, so they can share resources and work together to stimulate social change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pantsuitnation.org/chapters-543164.html|title=Pantsuit Nation Chapters|website=Pantsuit Nation|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are chapters in Alaska, California, Northern Colorado, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Central Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Boston, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Milwaukee, and Israel.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

== Criticism ==
After the election, Chamberlain received a book deal to publish content from the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14027860/pantsuit-nation-book-deal-libby-chamberlain|title=The organizer of a massive pro-Clinton Facebook group has landed a book deal|last=Tiffany|first=Kaitlyn|date=20 December 2016|website=The Verge|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Pantsuit Nation'' was published May 9, 2017, by Flatiron Books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pantsuit Nation|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Libby|date=May 9, 2017|publisher=Flatiron Books|isbn=978-1250153326|pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a compilation of stories and photos that document the experiences of Clinton supporters before, during, and after the election.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some believe that Chamberlain is turning Pantsuit Nation from a space of grieving and healing into a branding machine, used to further her own profit-seeking ambitions.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/panstuit-nation-is-a-sham_us_585991dce4b04d7df167cb4d|title=Pantsuit Nation Is A Sham|last=Lewis|first=Harry|date=2016-12-20|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Chamberlain announced on the Pantsuit Nation Facebook group that she had secured a book deal using the group's name, ''The New York Times'' released an article explaining the book's projected timeline.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Chamberlain did not disclose details about where the profits of the book will go, nor address the breach in privacy of the group members who shared their stories until pressured to do so. Many people subsequently accused Chamberlain of cashing in on the struggles of the group's members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Chamberlain subsequently said in a Facebook post that the book's proceeds will be donated to nonprofit organizations connected to Pantsuit Nation's mission. Examples of such organizations the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], and [[Planned Parenthood]]. She also stated that participation in the book is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/news/a41565/pantsuit-nation-facebook-group-book-deal/|title=Pantsuit Nation Is Getting Its Very Own Book Deal|date=2016-12-20|work=ELLE|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said the book is meant to illustrate the diversity that the group represents – diversity of experiences, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and ability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nonetheless, many members of the group felt as though their sanctuary and private community was intruded upon. Some also believe the book is a 2016 time capsule, preventing the Democratic Party and Clinton supporters from moving on from the tough loss and supporting a potential new presidential candidate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition, critics of Pantsuit Nation have argued that white women dominate the conversation in the group and members of racial minorities feel their voices are ignored, belittled, and overshadowed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thepolitic.org/activism-and-slacktivism-pantsuit-nation-ten-months-after-trump/|title=Activism and Slacktivism: Pantsuit Nation Ten Months After Trump|last=Zhao|first=Helen|date=2017-10-13|website=thepolitic.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that white women are using the group as a way to feel  "[[woke]]" without contributing to tangible social change. In response, Pantsuit Nation organizers released a statement in December 2016 reaffirming the group's commitment to ensuring that every voice is heard and respected and asking that white women be aware of their privilege by listening to the experiences of women of color.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The leadership of Pantsuit Nation also changed, becoming more diverse and representing a broader range of perspectives, experiences, and identities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Personation''' (rather than [[impersonator|''im''personation]]) is a primarily-[[law|legal]] term, meaning 'to assume the identity of another person with intent to deceive' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/personate|website=Collins English Dictionary|accessdate=7 June 2017|title=Personate definition and meaning &amp;#124; Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   It is often used for the kind of [[voter fraud]] where an individual votes in an [[election]], whilst pretending to be a different elector. It is also used when charging a person who portrays themselves as a police officer.

Personation appears as a crime in the Canadian Criminal Code with the meaning simply of impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Criminal Code sec. 403|url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec403%2Ehtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the New York State Penal Law defines the crime of false personation as simply the act of pretending to be another, a Class B misdemeanor; those who assume the identity of another in order to further another crime can be charged with second-degree criminal impersonation, a Class A misdemeanor. Posing as a police officer for any reason, or as a physician in order to forge a prescription or otherwise obtain substances so controlled, is first-degree criminal impersonation, a Class E felony.

Many jurisdictions allow electors to nominate an individual to vote on their behalf, often known as [[proxy voting]]. Whilst voting with an invalid proxy form could be considered personation, it is usual for an [[mens rea|intent to deceive]] to be required for such an act to be considered [[crime|criminal]].

Personation is an offence in law in England and Wales: see [[English criminal law#Forgery, personation and cheating]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17388">'''Pharmacy in the United Kingdom''' has been an integral part of the [[National Health Service]] since it was established in 1948.  Unlike the rest of the NHS pharmacies are largely privately provided apart from those in hospitals, and even these are now often privately run.

==History==

Commerce of drugs in [[United Kingdom]] was initially regulated by the [[Guild of Peppers]] since 1180, they were in charge of the assurance of the items that were. In 1345 some members of the Guilt of Peppers founded [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]] that operated until 1617, that was in charge of assurance of the quality of food and drugs, their role related drugs business was replaced by [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]] (one of the 110 [[Livery company|Livery companies]]) that operated since 1617 and its members were in charge of train as apprentice for 7 years the future new members until they became free man and get the "freedom" of being apothecary's apprentices.

[[Silvanus Bevan]] received 7 years of training and later he cofounded [[Allen &amp; Hanburys]] in 1715 (that developed [[salbutamol]] in 1966 and now is part of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]).

Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded in 1841. The [[Pharmacy Act 1868]] limited the sale of poisons and dangerous drugs to qualified pharmacists and druggists.

The advent of the NHS had an immediate beneficial effect on the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Drug, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/healthcare-generally/pharmacy/the-drug-chemical-and-pharmaceutical-industries/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=11 July 2015|date=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960 there were proposals that the private patients of general practitioners should be enabled to receive their drugs free on the health service, but they were not implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drugs and the Health Service|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/nhs-policies/drugs-and-the-health-service-1960/|website=Socialist Health Association|publisher=Today and Tomorrow Publications|accessdate=11 July 2015|date=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supply of drugs in the hospital service represented about one-tenth by value of the supply through the retail pharmaceutical service in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powell|first1=Enoch|title=March 11, 1966 A new look at Medicine and Politics|date=1966|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/healthcare-generally/history-of-healthcare/a-new-look-at-medicine-and-politics/a-new-look-at-medicine-and-politics-6/|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was replaced by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] and [[General Pharmaceutical Council]] in September 2010.

There was a reduction of more than a quarter in the number of pharmacies in the community between 1963 and 1979.  According to the [[Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee]] at that time over 4,000 pharmacies in England and Wales dispensing less than 24,000 prescriptions per annum were losing money on NHS services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 8|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=HMSO|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Health Survey for England]] 2016 showed that 48% of adults in the country had taken at least one prescribed medicine in the past week, and 24% had taken three or more. 10% were using antidepressants.  A total of 1.1 billion prescriptions were dispensed in England in 2016 - 47% more than 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS survey reports almost half of adults in England on prescription medicines|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204174.article|accessdate=13 February 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract==

NHS pharmacies are governed and paid for their NHS work under a standard contract, which was modified in 2005.  This modification enabled pharmacy contractors to be paid for Medicines Use Reviews conducted by pharmacists for people with multiple long term prescriptions.  There are also New Medicine Services, which are intended for patients who have started on long term medication, such as asthma treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing services closer to the patient|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/pharmacy-supplement-bringing-services-closer-to-the-patient/5086590.article#.VaFx4aS_UYA|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the government announced that the budget for pharmacy would be reduced by £170 million nationally from 2017 (£113 million in England) - its “share” of the £22 billion in savings required across the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lords debate: Funding cuts will reduce pharmacy competition|url=http://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news/lords-call-enhanced-commuity-pharmacy-role-debate|accessdate=19 December 2016|publisher=Chemist and Druggist|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the new contract there will be a payment of £1.33 per prescribed item dispensed, but the flat rate establishment payment (around £25,000 per pharmacy) set up in 2005 will be reduced by 40% and is to be abolished. There will be a Pharmacy Access Scheme with monthly payments for the 1427 pharmacies more than a mile away from the next pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Further 71 pharmacies deemed eligible for Pharmacy Access Scheme funding|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202982.article|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There will be additional quality incentives for:
* Using NHS mail
* Producing an annual written patient safety report
* Training staff in safeguarding vulnerable people
* Using the [[Summary Care Record]]
* Achieving Healthy Living Pharmacy Level 1
* Asthma referrals
* Dementia Friends trained teams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A decade of community pharmacy funding in England|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/infographics/a-decade-of-community-pharmacy-funding-in-england/20202082.article|accessdate=19 December 2016|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 the first payments to community pharmacies under the new quality payments scheme were made by [[NHS England]]. 90% of community pharmacies, 11,094 applied. 10,985 passed the qualifying criteria and received a payment. Future payments under the scheme are conditional on all pharmacy staff being able to send and receive email by the November review date.  Pharmacists who have accessed [[Summary Care Record]]s more than 100 times between two specific dates will also be eligible for a payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pharmacies receive £31m in first quality scheme payment|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20203670.article?|accessdate=23 December 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wales==
The NHS in Wales has a separate pharmacy contract. In April 2017 [[Vaughan Gething]] announced that there were "no proposals to reduce investment in community pharmacy here in Wales" as was happening in England.  By 2020 Welsh pharmacists will have access to patients’ summary care records in order to help deliver the Welsh common ailment service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gething confirms community pharmacy funding for Wales|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202627.article|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2018 all the Welsh pharmacies with access to the Choose Pharmacy IT system will be able to access the Welsh GP record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Community pharmacists in Wales to have access to GP records by March 2018|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204037.article|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
The [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] in Scotland called for the creation of a single electronic patient health record which pharmacists could access in October 2017. They said their members needed to have the same access to records as a GP or hospital consultant in order to provide safe treatment to people in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MSPs warned that lack of access to medical records by pharmacists poses 'urgent patient safety concern'|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15625067.Pharmacists__inability_to_access_patient_health_records_is__urgent_safety_concern_/|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacy First was launched in 2017. This scheme permits pharmacists to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and impetigo in children without a doctor's prescription.  It also increases access for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to medication-related advice and patient-centred medicine review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pharmacy First service rolled out across health boards in Scotland|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/pharmacy-first-service-rolled-out-across-health-boards-in-scotland/20203946.article|accessdate=2 January 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Northern Ireland==

In rural areas GPs  are permitted to dispense medication if there is not a pharmacy within a mile of the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Around 1,000 patients set to lose their surgery following green light to pharmacy plans|url=http://www.westbriton.co.uk/1-000-patients-set-lose-surgery-following-green/story-26870197-detail/story.html|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=West Briton|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 1,290 dispensing practices across the UK serving 8.8 million patients in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the DDA|url=http://www.dispensingdoctor.org/about-the-dda/|website=Dispensing Doctors Association|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many are members of the [[Dispensing Doctors' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispensing Doctors Association|url=https://www.dispensingdoctor.org|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==

[[NHS England]] is supporting initiatives to place pharmacists in GP practices in order to improve the management of medication for patients with long term conditions.  About 420 million repeat prescriptions are generated in the UK each year&amp;nbsp;— about 200 for each general practitioner each week.  In the practice pharmacists can do more [[Medicine use review]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pilot sees pharmacists play greater clinical role at GP practices in Norwich|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/health/pilot_sees_pharmacists_play_greater_clinical_role_at_gp_practices_in_norwich_1_4839236|accessdate=16 January 2017|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 2017 there were plans for 1350 practices in England to have access to clinical pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6m more patients to have access to clinical pharmacists in GP practices|url=http://www.gponline.com/6m-patients-access-clinical-pharmacists-gp-practices/article/1430376?bulletin=gp_commissioning_bulletin|accessdate=21 May 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is intended to have 1,500 pharmacists in general practice by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More than 160 clinical pharmacists’ posts approved|url=http://www.managementinpractice.com/editors-pick/more-160-clinical-pharmacists’-posts-approved|accessdate=15 February 2018|publisher=Management in Practice|date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NHS England’s announced funding for 180 pharmacists and 60 technicians to work in care homes in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decision to fund more pharmacists in care homes is "bang on target"|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20204595.article|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Retail pharmacies and pharmacists are regulated by the NHS, under the provisions of the Pharmacy Act 1954 and The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations, which prevent new pharmacies being opened without permission. This was done by the [[Family Health Services Authority]] and then by [[Primary Care Trust]]s. Now regulation is by [[NHS England]] and its Pharmaceutical Services Regulations Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/health-law/community-health-councils-the-old-rules/the-national-health-service-pharmaceutical-services-regulations-1992/|website=Socialist Health Association|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=11 July 2015|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Retail as well as hospital pharmacies in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council, In Northern Ireland by the PSNI.

==Local Pharmaceutical Committee==
Local Pharmaceutical Committees were established in every area in 1948. Each is a representative committee of persons providing pharmaceutical services as defined in Section 44 of the [[National Health Service Act 1977]]. Each committee has about 12 members.  There are now about 80 in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About LPCs|url=http://psnc.org.uk/lpcs/about-lpcs/|website=Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retail Pharmacies==
89% of the UK population live within a 20-minute walk of their local pharmacy. A majority of the population visit a pharmacy at least once every 28 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing services closer to the patient|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/pharmacy-supplement-bringing-services-closer-to-the-patient/5086590.article#.VaFx4aS_UYA|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 more than 1.1 billion prescription items were dispensed in England. This was 34.5 million more than in the previous 12 months and 378.4 million more than in 2004.  The total net ingredient cost of prescribed items was £8.9 billion.  89.9% of all items dispensed in England were free of charge.  In Scotland the total number of items dispensed in the community in 2014–2015 was 101.1 million with a net cost of £1.2bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prescription items dispensed in England rise by 3% in 2014|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/prescription-items-dispensed-in-england-rise-by-3-in-2014/20068925.article|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least 1979 there have been proposals that pharmacists should develop their role of giving advice to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 8|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=HMSO|date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; NHS England announced a pilot scheme in July 2015 for GP practices in England to employ around 300 pharmacists to provide clinical care and relieve pressure on GPs. They will monitor patients with long-term conditions, create medicine plans and provide advice and expertise on day-to-day medicines issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England launches £15m pilot to employ pharmacists in GP practices|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/nhs-england-launches-15m-pilot-to-employ-pharmacists-in-gp-practices/20068918.article|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London pharmacies are used to deliver [[Flu vaccination]].  In 2013/4 108,700 vaccinations were delivered by 1,089 pharmacies in the capital.  Medicines Use Reviews in patients homes are delivered by pharmacists in Croydon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing services closer to the patient|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/resource-centre/supplements/pharmacy-supplement-bringing-services-closer-to-the-patient/5086590.article#.VaFx4aS_UYA|accessdate=11 July 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015 it was announced that retail pharmacies would be given access to NHS patients [[Summary Care Record]]s after a pilot of 140 pharmacies in Somerset, Northampton, North Derbyshire, Sheffield and West Yorkshire, demonstrated “significant benefits.”   Pharmacists have to ask for a patient’s permission to view their record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tesco, Superdrug and Boots to be given access to NHS medical records|url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/health-and-beauty/tesco-superdrug-and-boots-to-be-given-access-to-nhs-medical-records/5077899.article|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Retail Week|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1897">A '''poundage quota''', also called a '''marketing quota''', is a quantitative limit on the amount of a commodity that can be marketed under the provisions of a permanent law. Once a common feature of price support programs, this supply control mechanism ended with the quota buyouts for peanuts in 2002 and tobacco in 2004.

'''Marketing quotas''' (or allotments) — Authorized by the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], these quotas (sometimes called poundage quotas) limit marketings of certain commodities.  The marketing quota, which must be approved by at least two-thirds of the eligible producers voting in a referendum, is intended to ensure an adequate and normal supply of the commodity, and also ensure that production and supplies are not excessive. Growers who market in excess of their quotas pay penalties on the excess and are ineligible for government price-support loans.  Quotas have been suspended for wheat, feed grains, and cotton since the 1960s.  Rice quotas were abolished in 1981.  Tobacco quotas ended after the 2004 crop (P.L. 108-357, Title VI).  Authority for standby marketing allotments for domestically-produced sugar and crystalline fructose was mandated by the [[1990 farm bill]] (P.L. 101-624), but eliminated by the [[1996 farm bill]] (P.L. 104-127).  The [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171) reintroduced marketing allotments for domestically-produced sugar under the [[modified sugar program]].  Marketing allotments are required to be in effect unless [[USDA]] projects sugar imports will be above 1.532 million short tons.

==Provisions by effective date==

===Effective at enactment, March 23, 2010===
* The [[Food and Drug Administration]] is now authorized to approve generic versions of [[biologic medical product|biologic]] drugs and grant biologics manufacturers 12&amp;nbsp;years of exclusive use before generics can be developed.&lt;ref name='ksr_list1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kff.org/interactive/implementation-timeline/|title=Health Reform Implementation Timeline|accessdate=2010-03-30|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Medicaid drug [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] for brand name drugs, paid by drug manufacturers to the states, is increased to 23.1% (except for the rebate for clotting factors and drugs approved exclusively for pediatric use, which increases to 17.1%), and the rebate is extended to Medicaid managed care plans; the Medicaid rebate for non-innovator, multiple source drugs is increased to 13% of average manufacturer price.&lt;ref name='ksr_list1' /&gt;
* A non-profit [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] is established, independent from government, to undertake [[comparative effectiveness research]].&lt;ref name='ksr_list1' /&gt; This is charged with examining the "relative health outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness" of different medical treatments by evaluating existing studies and conducting its own. Its 19-member board is to include patients, doctors, hospitals, drug makers, device manufacturers, insurers, payers, government officials and health experts. It will not have the power to mandate or even endorse coverage rules or reimbursement for any particular treatment. Medicare may take the Institute's research into account when deciding what procedures it will cover, so long as the new research is not the sole justification and the agency allows for public input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36135106/ns/health-health_care/ |title=True or false? Top 7 health care fears – TODAY Health – TODAY.com |publisher=msnbc.com |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill prohibits the Institute from developing or employing "a dollars per quality adjusted life year" (or any similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual's disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. This makes it different from the UK's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]], which determines cost-effectiveness directly based on [[quality-adjusted life year]] valuations.

* The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will begin the Readmissions Reduction Program, which requires CMS to reduce payments to IPPS hospitals with excess readmissions, effective for discharges beginning on October 1, 2012. The regulations that implement this provision are in subpart I of 42 CFR part 412 (§412.150 through §412.154).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html|title=Readmissions Reduction Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. Together, these 2,217 hospitals will forfeit more than $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year, i.e., until October 2013, as Medicare and Medicaid begin a wide-ranging push to start paying health care providers based on the quality of care they provide. The $280 million in penalties comprises about 0.3 percent of the total amount hospitals are paid by Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/August/13/medicare-hospitals-readmissions-penalties.aspx|title=Medicare To Penalize 2,217 Hospitals For Excess Readmissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary waivers during implementation, 2010-2011==
During the implementation of the law, there were interim regulations put in place for a specific type of employer-funded insurance, the so-called "mini-med" or limited-benefit plans, which are low-cost to employers who buy them for their employees, but cap coverage at a very low level. The waivers allowed employers to temporarily avoid the regulations ending annual and lifetime limits on coverage, and were put in place to encourage employers and insurers offering mini-med plans not to withdraw medical coverage before those regulations come into force, by which time small employers and individuals will be able to buy non-capped coverage through the exchanges. Employers were only granted a waiver if they could show that complying with the limit would mean a significant decrease in employees' benefits coverage or a significant increase in employees' premiums.&lt;ref name="ELYB" /&gt;

By January 26, 2011, HHS said it had granted a total of 733 waivers for 2011, covering 2.1&amp;nbsp;million people, or about 1% of the privately insured population.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/approved_applications_for_waiver.html Annual Limits Policy: Protecting Consumers, Maintaining Options, and Building a Bridge to 2014]", HHS-CMS-CCIIO, see section "Applications for Waiver of the Annual Limits Requirements"&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the Obama Administration announced that all applications for new waivers and renewals of existing ones had to be filed by September 22 of that year, and no new waivers would be approved after this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43445375/ns/politics/ |title=Obama administration to end health care waivers |agency=Associated Press |publisher=msnbc.com |date=June 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited-benefit plans were sometimes offered to low-paid and part-time workers, for example in fast food restaurants or purchased direct from an insurer. Most company-provided health insurance policies starting on or after September 23, 2010, and before September 23, 2011, may not set an annual coverage cap lower than $750,000,&lt;ref name="ELYB"&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/limits/limits.html The Affordable Care Act: Eliminating Limits on Your Benefits] HHS web site&lt;/ref&gt; a lower limit that is raised in stages until 2014, by which time no insurance caps are allowed at all. By 2014, no health insurance, whether sold in the individual or group market, will be allowed to place an annual cap on coverage.

Among those receiving waivers were employers, large insurers, such as [[Aetna]] and [[Cigna]], and union plans covering about one million employees. [[McDonald's]], one of the employers that received a waiver, has 30,000 hourly employees whose plans have annual caps of $10,000.

Second, it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees."&lt;ref name="treasurystatement"/&gt;

Constitutional scholar Simon Lazarus countered critics, saying that the delay was a lawful discretion of Executive power: "In effect, the Administration explains the delay as a sensible adjustment to phase-in enforcement, not a refusal to enforce… To be sure, the federal [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] authorizes federal courts to compel agencies to initiate statutorily required actions that have been 'unreasonably delayed.' But courts have found delays to be unreasonable only in rare cases where, unlike this one, inaction had lasted for several years, and the recalcitrant agency could offer neither a persuasive excuse nor a credible end to its dithering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Simon Lazarus|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/delaying-parts-of-obamacare-blatantly-illegal-or-routine-adjustment/277873/ |title=Is Delaying Parts of Obamacare 'Blatantly Illegal' or Routine Adjustment? |publisher= The Atlantic |date=July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Kliff |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/07/the-white-house-keeps-changing-obamacare-is-that-legal/ |title=The White House keeps changing Obamacare.

In August, another provision was delayed for a year: the premium caps on group plans. This was to give employers time to arrange new accounting systems for the premium caps, but the caps are still planned to take effect on schedule for insurance plans on [[#Insurance exchanges and the individual mandate|the exchanges]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newrepublic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wonkwire.rollcall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag" /&gt;

On 10 February 2014, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2016 for employers with 50 to 99 workers.&lt;ref name="ACA EMPLOYER SHARED RESPONSIBILITY DELAY INCLUDED IN FINAL REGS"/&gt; The Treasury Decision 9655 modifies Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12.&lt;ref name="ACA EMPLOYER SHARED RESPONSIBILITY DELAY INCLUDED IN FINAL REGS"/&gt;

'''Raspberry ketone''' is a [[natural phenol]]ic compound that is the primary [[aroma compound]] of [[red raspberry|red raspberries]].

==Occurrence==
Raspberry ketone occurs in a variety of fruits, including raspberries, [[cranberry|cranberries]], and [[blackberry|blackberries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/raspberry-ketone/rkh.htm Raspberry Ketone], Molecule of the Month, University of Bristol&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[coumaroyl-CoA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biocyc.org/META/new-image?type=PATHWAY&amp;object=PWY-5393 |title=MetaCyc Pathway: raspberry ketone biosynthesis |publisher=[[MetaCyc]] |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be extracted from the fruit, yielding about 1–4&amp;nbsp;mg per kg of raspberries.&lt;ref name=Beekwilder/&gt;

==Preparation==
Since the natural abundance of raspberry ketone is very low, it is prepared industrially by a variety of methods from chemical intermediates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/jo00099a017 |title=Cation-Exchanged Montmorillonite-Catalyzed Facile Friedel-Crafts Alkylation of Hydroxy and Methoxy Aromatics with 4-Hydroxybutan-2-one to Produce Raspberry Ketone and Some Pharmaceutically Active Compounds |year=1994 |last1=Tateiwa |first1=Jun-Ichi |last2=Horiuchi |first2=Hiroki |last3=Hashimoto |first3=Keiji |last4=Yamauchi |first4=Takayoshi |last5=Uemura |first5=Sakae |journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=59 |issue=20 |pages=5901–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the ways this can be done is through a crossed [[aldol condensation]] followed by [[catalytic hydrogenation]]. First, [[acetone]] is condensed with [[4-hydroxybenzaldehyde]] to form an [[enone|α,β-unsaturated ketone]]. Then the [[alkene]] portion is reduced to the [[alkane]]. This two-step method produces raspberry ketone in 99% yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00897960034a |title=Rheosmin ('Raspberry Ketone') and Zingerone, and Their Preparation by Crossed Aldol-Catalytic Hydrogenation Sequences |year=1996 |last1=Smith |first1=Leverett R. |journal=The Chemical Educator |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:Raspberry ketone synthesis.png|500px]]

==Uses==
Raspberry ketone is sometimes used in perfumery, in cosmetics, and as a food additive to impart a fruity odor. It is one of the most expensive natural flavor components used in the food industry. The natural compound can cost as much as $20,000 per kg.&lt;ref name=Beekwilder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/biot.200700076 |title=Microbial production of natural raspberry ketone |year=2007 |last1=Beekwilder |first1=Jules |last2=Van Der Meer |first2=Ingrid M. |last3=Sibbesen |first3=Ole |last4=Broekgaarden |first4=Mans |last5=Qvist |first5=Ingmar |last6=Mikkelsen |first6=Joern D. |last7=Hall |first7=Robert D. |journal=Biotechnology Journal |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=1270–9 |pmid=17722151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic raspberry ketone is cheaper, with estimates ranging from a couple of dollars per pound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordsonwellness.com/post/2012/06/13/With-All-Due-Respect-to-Dr-Oz-Raspberry-Ketone-is-not-a-Fat-Burning-Miracle.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317040556/http://wordsonwellness.com/post/2012/06/13/With-All-Due-Respect-to-Dr-Oz-Raspberry-Ketone-is-not-a-Fat-Burning-Miracle.aspx |archivedate=2013-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to one fifth of the cost of the natural product.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Marketing==
Although products containing this compound are marketed for weight loss, there is no clinical evidence for this effect in humans.&lt;ref name=webmd&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1262-RASPBERRY%20KETONE.aspx?activeIngredientId=1262 |title=Raspberry Ketone |publisher=[[WebMD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Little is known about the long-term safety of raspberry ketone supplements,&lt;ref name=Bredsdorff &gt;{{cite journal | journal = Regul Toxicol Pharmacol | date = 2015 | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 196–200 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2015.06.022 | title = Raspberry ketone in food supplements - High intake, few toxicity data - A cause for safety concern? |vauthors=Bredsdorff L, Wedebye EB, Nikolov NG, Hallas-Møller T, Pilegaard K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://altmedicine.about.com/od/weight_Loss/a/Raspberry-Ketones-Weight-Loss.htm | title = Raspberry Ketones for Weight Loss | author = Cathy Wong | publisher = About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially since little research has been done with humans.&lt;ref name=Canberra&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canberra|first1=Jules|title=What's All The Hype About Raspberry Ketone?|url=https://www.authorityhealth.com/raspberry-ketone-benefits|website=Authority Health|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is chemically related to the stimulant [[synephrine]], there are some concerns about its safety.&lt;ref name=webmd/&gt; Toxicological models indicate a potential for [[cardiotoxic]] effects, as well as effects on reproduction and development.&lt;ref name=Bredsdorff/&gt; Furthermore, in many [[dietary supplement]]s containing raspberry ketones, manufacturers add other ingredients such as [[caffeine]] which may have unsafe effects.&lt;ref name=Canberra/&gt;

In 1965, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] classified raspberry ketone as [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS) for the small quantities used to flavor foods.&lt;ref name="DoiS" /&gt; In the UK, raspberry ketone supplements are on the [[Food Standards Agency]]'s unauthorized list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.food.gov.uk/science/novel/unauthorised | title = Unauthorised novel foods | author = FSA | publisher = food.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Workers' and Peasants' Red Army''' ({{lang-ru|Рабоче-крестьянская Красная армия (РККА)}}, ''Raboče-krestjjanskaja Krasnaja armija ('''RKKA''')''), frequently shortened to '''Red Army''' ({{lang|rus|Красная армия (КА)}}, ''Krasnaja armija ('''KA''')''; also in critical literature and folklore of that epoch – Red Horde,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodna.pravda.com.ua/nation/4ea268609f30b/|title=Дмитро Донцов: Перед розвалом червоної орди – Народні блоги|work=pravda.com.ua|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army of Work) was the army and the air force of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], and, after 1922, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. The army was established immediately after the 1917 [[October Revolution]] (Red October or Bolshevik Revolution). The [[Bolsheviks]] raised an army to oppose the military confederations (especially the various groups collectively known as the [[White Army]]) of their adversaries during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Beginning in February 1946, the Red Army, along with the [[Soviet Navy]], embodied the main component of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]; taking the official name of "[[Soviet Army]]", until its dissolution in December 1991.

The Red Army is credited as being the decisive [[land warfare|land force]] in the Allied victory in the [[European theatre of World War II]], and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] contributed heavily to the ultimate unconditional surrender of Imperial Japan. During operations on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], it accounted for 75–80% of casualties the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] suffered during the war and ultimately captured the Nazi German capital, [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Norman | last = Davies | quote = Since 75%–80% of all German losses were inflicted on the eastern front it follows that the efforts of the western allies accounted for only 20%–25% | newspaper = Sunday Times | date = 5 November 2006 | url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article167017.ece | title=How we didn't win the war . . . but the Russians did }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In September 1917, [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote: "There is only one way to prevent the restoration of the police, and that is to create a people's militia and to fuse it with the army (the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the entire people)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lenin | first = Vladmir Ilich | url = http://www.marx2mao.com/Lenin/TPOR17.html | chapter = Tasks of the Proletariat in our Revolution | title = Collected Works | volume = 24 | publisher = Marx 2 Mao | pages = 55–91 | accessdate = 29 May 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] had started to collapse. Approximately 23% (about 19 million) of the male population of the [[Russian Empire]] were mobilized; however, most of them were not equipped with any weapons and had support roles such as maintaining the [[line of communication|lines of communication]] and the base areas. The Tsarist general [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] estimated that there had been 2 million deserters, 1.8 million dead, 5 million wounded and 2 million prisoners. He estimated the remaining troops as numbering 10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/ussr/government/red-army/1937/wollenberg-red-army/ch01.htm | title = The Red Army | first = Erich | last = Wollenberg | author-link = Erich Wollenberg | publisher = Marxists FR | accessdate = 28 May 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Imperial Russian Army was being taken apart, "it became apparent that the rag-tag Red Guard units and elements of the imperial army who had gone over the side of the Bolsheviks were quite inadequate to the task of defending the new government against external foes." Therefore, the [[Council of People's Commissars]] decided to form the Red Army on 28 January 1918.{{Efn | 15 January 1918 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]).}}  They envisioned a body "formed from the class-conscious and best elements of the working classes." All citizens of the Russian republic aged 18 or older were eligible. Its role being the defense "of the Soviet authority, the creation of a basis for the transformation of the standing army into a force deriving its strength from a nation in arms, and, furthermore, the creation of a basis for the support of the coming Socialist Revolution in Europe." Enlistment was conditional upon "guarantees being given by a military or civil committee functioning within the territory of the Soviet Power, or by party or trade union committees or, in extreme cases, by two persons belonging to one of the above organizations." In the event of an entire unit wanting to join the Red Army, a "collective guarantee and the affirmative vote of all its members would be necessary." &lt;ref name="marxistsfr.org"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/ussr/government/red-army/1937/wollenberg-red-army/append01.htm | title = The Red Army | chapter = Appendix 1 – The Scheme For A Socialist Army | type = decree | publisher = The Council of People's Commissars | date = 15 January 1918 | accessdate = 28 May 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seventeen&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1917army&amp;Year=1917 | title = Seventeen Moments | publisher = Soviet History | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227183235/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1917army&amp;Year=1917 | archivedate = 27 December 2013 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Red Army was composed mainly of peasants, the families of those who served were guaranteed rations and assistance with farm work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1917army&amp;Year=1917 |title = 1917: Red Guard into Army |last1 = Siegelbaum |first1        = Lewis |website = Seventeen Moments in Soviet History |accessdate = 2014-01-21 |quote = The Red Army's soldiers, overwhelmingly peasant in origin, received pay but more importantly, their families were guaranteed rations and assistance with farm work. |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227183235/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?page=subject&amp;SubjectID=1917army&amp;Year=1917 |archivedate = 27 December 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some peasants who remained at home yearned to join the Army; men, along with some women, flooded the recruitment centres.

Proshyan, Samoisky, Steinberg were also specified as people's commissars as well as [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]] from the Bureau of Commissars. At a joint meeting of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], held on 22 February 1918, Krylenko remarked: "We have no army. The demoralized soldiers are fleeing, panic-stricken, as soon as they see a [[Stahlhelm|German helmet]] appear on the horizon, abandoning their artillery, convoys and all war material to the [[Operation Faustschlag|triumphantly advancing]] enemy. The Red Guard units are brushed aside like flies. We have no power to stay the enemy; only an immediate signing of the peace treaty will save us from destruction."&lt;ref name="marxistsfr.org" /&gt;

==History==

===Russian Civil War===
{{details|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:RA rank insignia 1919-1924.svg|thumb|Military insignia of the Red Army, 1919–1924]]

The Russian Civil War (1917–1923) occurred in three periods:
# October 1917 – November 1918: From the Bolshevik Revolution to the [[World War I|First World War]] [[Armistice]], developed from the Bolshevik government's [[nationalization]] of traditional [[Cossack]] lands in November 1917.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This provoked the insurrection of General [[Alexey Kaledin|Alexey Maximovich Kaledin]]'s [[Volunteer Army]] in the [[Don River, Russia|River Don]] region. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (March 1918) aggravated Russian internal politics. The situation encouraged direct [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], in which twelve foreign countries supported anti-Bolshevik militias. A series of engagements resulted, involving, amongst others, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], the [[Polish 5th Rifle Division]], and the pro-Bolshevik Red [[Latvian Riflemen]].
# January 1919 – November 1919: Initially the White armies successfully advanced: from the south, under General [[Anton Denikin]]; from the east, under Admiral [[Aleksandr Vasilevich Kolchak]]; and from the northwest, under General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich]]. The Whites defeated the Red Army on each front. [[Leon Trotsky]] reformed and counterattacked: the Red Army repelled Admiral Kolchak's army in June, and the armies of General Denikin and General Yudenich in October.&lt;ref name = "autogenerated3"&gt;{{Harvnb | Erickson | 1962 | pp = 72–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-November the White armies were all almost completely exhausted. In January 1920, [[Semyon Budyonny|Budenny]]'s First Cavalry Army entered [[Rostov-on-Don]].

Free from international war, the Red Army confronted an internecine war against a loose alliance of anti-Communist forces, comprising the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], the "[[Black Guards|Black Army]]" led by [[Nestor Makhno]], the anti-White and anti-Red [[Green armies]], efforts to restore the defeated Provisional Government, monarchists, but mainly the [[White Movement]] of several different anti-socialist military confederations. "Red Army Day", 23 February 1918, has a two-fold historical significance: it was the first day of drafting recruits (in [[Petrograd]] and Moscow), and the first day of combat against the occupying [[German Empire|Imperial German]] Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = SS | last = Lototskiy | title = The Soviet Army | place = Moscow | publisher = Progress Publishers | year = 1971 | page = 25}} cited in {{Harvnb | Scott | Scott | 1979 | p = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | 8 February became "Soviet Army Day", a national holiday in the USSR.}}

The first Chairman was [[Leon Trotsky]], and the first commander-in-chief was [[Jukums Vācietis]] from the [[Latvian Riflemen]]; in July 1919 he was replaced by [[Sergey Kamenev]].

===Polish–Soviet War and prelude===
The [[Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19]] occurred at the same time as the general Soviet move into the areas abandoned by the Ober Ost garrisons.  This merged into the 1919–1921 [[Polish–Soviet War]], in which the Red Army reached central Poland in 1920, but then suffered a [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|defeat]] there, which put an end to the war. During the Polish Campaign the Red Army numbered some 6.5 million men, many of whom the Army had difficulty supporting, around 581,000 in the two operational fronts, western and southwestern. Around 2.5 million men and women were immobilized in the interior as part of reserve armies.{{Sfn | Erickson | 1962 | p = 101}}

===Reorganization===
The XI Congress of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] (RCP (b)) adopted a resolution on the strengthening of the Red Army. It decided to establish strictly organized military, educational and economic conditions in the army. However, it was recognized that an army of 1,600,000 would be burdensome. By the end of 1922, after the Congress, the Party Central Committee decided to reduce the Red Army to 800,000. This reduction necessitated the reorganization of the Red Army's structure. The supreme military unit became corps of two or three divisions. Divisions consisted of three regiments. Brigades as independent units were abolished. The formation of departments' [[Rifle corps (Soviet Union)|rifle corps]] began.

allowed the foundation of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in December 1922. Historian [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] sees 1 February 1924, when [[Mikhail Frunze]] became head of the Red Army staff, as marking the ascent of the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|general staff]], which came to dominate Soviet military planning and operations. By 1 October 1924 the Red Army's strength had diminished to 530,000.{{Sfn | Erickson | 1962 | p = 167}} The [[list of Soviet Union divisions 1917–1945]] details the formations of the Red Army in that time.

In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, Soviet military theoreticians - led by Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] - developed the  [[deep operations|deep-operations]] doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Mary R | last = Habeck | author-link = Mary R.

To achieve victory, deep operations envisage simultaneous [[corps]]- and army-size unit maneuvers of simultaneous parallel attacks throughout the depth of the enemy's ground forces, inducing catastrophic defensive failure. The deep-battle doctrine relies upon aviation and armor advances with the expectation that [[maneuver warfare]] offers quick, efficient, and decisive victory. Marshal Tukhachevsky said that [[aerial warfare]] must be "employed against targets beyond the range of [[infantry]], [[artillery]], and other arms. For maximum tactical effect aircraft should be employed [[wikt:en masse|en masse]], concentrated in time and space, against targets of the highest tactical importance."&lt;ref&gt;

Red Army deep operations found their first formal expression in the 1929 Field Regulations, and became codified in the 1936 Provisional Field Regulations (PU-36). The [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1939 and the [[Purge of the Red Army in 1941|Purge of 1940–1942]] removed many leading officers from the Red Army, including Tukhachevsky himself and many of his followers, and the doctrine was abandoned. Thus at the [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in 1938 and in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939 ([[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars|major border clashes]] with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]), the doctrine was not used. Only in the Second World War did deep operations come into play.

===Chinese–Soviet conflicts===
The Red army was involved in armed conflicts in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] during the [[Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)]], the [[Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang]] (1934), when it was assisted by White Russian forces, and the [[Xinjiang War (1937)|Xinjiang rebellion (1937)]].

The Soviet forces led by [[Semyon Timoshenko]] had three times as many soldiers as the Finns, thirty times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many [[tank]]s. The Red Army, however, had been crippled by Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937, reducing the army's morale and efficiency shortly before the outbreak of the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bullock1993|Bullock (1993)]]. p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; With over 30,000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned, most of whom were from the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior officers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Glanz1998|Glanz (1998)]]. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ries1988"&gt;[[#Ries1988|Ries (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} Because of these factors, and high commitment and morale in the Finnish forces, Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for much longer than the Soviets expected.

In accordance with the Soviet-Nazi [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 23 August 1939, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Red Army invaded Poland]] on 17 September 1939, after the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi invasion]] on 1 September 1939. On 30 November the Red Army also attacked Finland, in the [[Winter War]] of 1939–1940. By autumn 1940, after conquering its portion of Poland, the [[Third Reich]] shared an extensive border with USSR, with whom it remained neutrally bound by their [[non-aggression pact]] and [[trade agreement]]s. Another consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]], carried out by the [[Southern Front (Soviet Union)|Southern Front]] in June–July 1940 and [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)]]. These conquests also added to the border the Soviet Union shared with Nazi-controlled areas. For [[Adolf Hitler]], the circumstance was no dilemma, because&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Adolf | last = Hitler | author-link = Adolf Hitler | title = [[Mein Kampf]] | place = Boston | year = 1943 | page = 654}}, cited in {{Citation | first = William L | last = Shirer | title = The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich | publisher = The Reprint Society | place = London | year = 1962 | page = 796}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' ("Drive towards the East") policy secretly remained in force, culminating on 18 December 1940 with ''Directive No. 21, [[Operation Barbarossa]]'', approved on 3 February 1941, and scheduled for mid-May 1941.

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, in Operation Barbarossa, the Red Army's ground forces had 303 divisions and 22 separate brigades (6.8 million soldiers), including 166 divisions and 9 brigades (3.2 million soldiers) garrisoned in the western military districts. The Axis forces deployed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] consisted of 181 divisions and 18 brigades (3 million soldiers). Three Fronts, the [[Northwestern Front|Northwestern]], [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western]], and [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern]] conducted the defense of the western borders of the USSR. In the first weeks of the Great Patriotic War the Wehrmacht defeated many Red Army units. The Red Army lost millions of men as prisoners and lost much of its pre-war matériel. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] increased mobilization, and by 1 August 1941, despite 46 divisions lost in combat, the Red Army's strength was 401 divisions.{{Sfn | Glantz | 1998 | p = 15}}

The Soviet forces were apparently unprepared despite numerous warnings from a variety of sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13862135|title=Barbarossa Hitler Stalin: War warnings Stalin ignored|first=Patrick|last=Jackson|date=21 June 2011|publisher=|accessdate=27 January 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suffered much damage in the field because of mediocre officers, partial mobilization, and an incomplete reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hughes-Wilson|title=Military Intelligence Blunders and Cover-Ups  2nd ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZfABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31|year=2012|publisher=Little, Brown|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hasty pre-war forces expansion and the over-promotion of inexperienced officers (owing to the [[Great Purge|purging]] of experienced officers) favored the Wehrmacht in combat.{{Sfn | Glantz | 1998}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  The Axis's numeric superiority rendered the combatants' divisional strength approximately equal.{{Efn | The Axis forces possessed a 1:1.7 superiority in personnel, despite the Red Army's 174 divisions against the Axis's 164 divisions, a 1.1:1 ratio.{{Sfn | Glantz | 1998 | pp = 292–95}}}}  A generation of Soviet commanders (notably [[Georgy Zhukov]]) learned from the defeats,{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | pp = 61–62}}  and Soviet victories in the [[Battle of Moscow]], at [[Battle of stalingrad|Stalingrad]], [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]] and later in [[Operation Bagration]] proved decisive.

In 1941, the Soviet government raised the bloodied Red Army's ''esprit de corps'' with propaganda stressing the defense of Motherland and nation, employing historic exemplars of Russian courage and bravery against foreign aggressors. The anti-Nazi ''[[Great Patriotic War]]'' was conflated with the [[Patriotic War of 1812]] against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and historical Russian military heroes, such as [[Alexander Nevski]] and [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], appeared. Repression of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] temporarily ceased, and priests revived the tradition of blessing arms before battle.

To encourage the initiative of Red Army commanders, the CPSU temporarily abolished [[political commissar]]s, reintroduced formal military ranks and decorations, and introduced the [[Guards unit]] concept. Exceptionally heroic or high-performing units earned the Guards title (for example [[1st Guards Special Rifle Corps]], [[6th Guards Tank Army]]),{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 181}} an elite designation denoting superior training, materiel, and pay. Punishment also was used; slackers, malingerers, those avoiding combat with self-inflicted wounds{{Sfn | Merridale | 2006 | p = 157 | ps =: ‘Red Army soldiers who shot or injured themselves to avoid combat usually were summarily executed, to save the time and money of medical treatment and a court martial’.}} cowards, thieves, and deserters were disciplined with beatings, demotions, undesirable/dangerous duties, and summary execution by [[NKVD]] punitive detachments.

At the same time, the ''osobist'' (NKVD military counter-intelligence officers) became a key Red Army figure with the power to condemn to death and to spare the life of any soldier and (almost any) officer of the unit to which he was attached. In 1942, Stalin established the [[Penal military unit|penal battalions]] composed of ''[[gulag]]'' inmates, Soviet PoWs, disgraced soldiers, and deserters, for hazardous front-line duty as ''tramplers'' clearing Nazi minefields, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Toppe | first = Alfred | title = Night Combat | publisher = Diane | year = 1998 | ISBN = 978-0-7881-7080-5 | page = 28 | quote = The Wehrmacht and the Soviet Army documented penal battalions ''tramplers'' clearing minefields; on 28 December 1942, Wehrmacht forces on the [[Strait of Kerch|Kerch]] peninsula observed a Soviet penal battalion running through a minefield, detonating the mines and clearing a path for the Red Army.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Tolstoy | 1981 | ps =: ‘Stalin's Directive 227, about the Nazi use of the death penalty and penal units as punishment, ordered Soviet penal battalions established.’}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}}  Given the dangers, the maximum sentence was three months.

During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army [[conscription|conscripted]] 29,574,900 men in addition to the 4,826,907 in service at the beginning of the war. Of this total of 34,401,807 it lost 6,329,600 [[killed in action]] (KIA), 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 [[missing in action]] (MIA) (most captured). Of these 11,444,000, however, 939,700 rejoined the ranks in the subsequently liberated Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity.

The German losses on the Eastern Front consisted of an estimated 3,604,800 KIA/MIA within the 1937 borders plus 900,000 ethnic Germans and Austrians outside the 1937 border (included in these numbers are men listed as missing in action or unaccounted for after the war){{Sfn | Overmans | 2000 | ps =: ‘It seems entirely plausible, while not provable, that one half of the missing were killed in action, the other half however in fact died in Soviet custody.’}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date = September 2013}} and 3,576,300 men reported captured (total 8,081,100); the losses of the German satellites on the Eastern Front approximated 668,163 KIA/MIA and 799,982 captured (total 1,468,145).

====Shortcomings====
In 1941 the rapid progress of the initial German air and land attacks into the Soviet Union made Red Army logistical support difficult, because many depots, and most of the USSR's industrial manufacturing base, lay in the country's invaded western areas, obliging their re-establishment east of the Ural Mountains. Until then the Red Army was often required to improvise or go without weapons, vehicles, and other equipment. The 1941 decision to physically move their manufacturing capacity east of the Ural mountains kept the main Soviet support system out of German reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first =G.

==Administration==
Military administration after the [[October Revolution]] was taken over by the People's Commissariat of war and marine affairs headed by a collective committee of [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], [[Pavel Dybenko]], and [[Nikolai Krylenko]].  At the same time, [[Nikolay Dukhonin]] was acting as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief after [[Alexander Kerensky]] fled from Russia. On 12 November 1917 the Soviet government appointed Krylenko as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and because of an "accident" during the forceful displacement of the commander-in-chief, Dukhonin was killed on 20 November 1917.  [[Nikolai Podvoisky]] was appointed as the Narkom of War Affairs, leaving Dybenko in charge of the Narkom of Marine Affairs and Ovseyenko – the expeditionary forces to the Southern Russia on 28 November 1917. The Bolsheviks also sent out their own representatives to replace front commanders of the [[Russian Imperial Army]].

After the signing of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918, a major reshuffling took place in the Soviet military administration. On 13 March 1918 the Soviet government accepted the official resignation of Krylenko and the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was liquidated. On 14 March 1918 [[Leon Trotsky]] replaced Podvoisky as the Narkom of War Affairs. On 16 March 1918 Pavel Dybenko was relieved from the office of Narkom of Marine Affairs. On 8 May 1918 the All-Russian Chief Headquarters was created, headed by [[Nikolai Stogov]] and later [[Alexander Andreyevich Svechin|Alexander Svechin]].

On 2 September 1918 the [[Revolutionary Military Council]] (RMC) was established as the main military administration under Leon Trotsky, the Narkom of War Affairs. On 6 September 1918 alongside the chief headquarters the Field Headquarters of RMC was created, initially headed by [[Nikolai Rattel]]. On the same day the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces was created, and initially assigned to [[Jukums Vācietis]] (and from July 1919 to [[Sergey Kamenev]]). The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces existed until April 1924, the end of [[Russian Civil War]].

In November 1923, after the establishment of the Soviet Union, the Russian Narkom of War Affairs was transformed into the Soviet Narkom of War and Marine Affairs.

==Organization==
{{details|Formations of the Soviet Army}}
[[File:Red Army flag.svg|thumb|Unofficial Red Army flag, since the Soviet ground forces never had an official flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ru:флажные мистификации |trans-title= The flag Hoax|url= http://www.vexillographia.ru/russia/mistif.htm | place = [[Russia|RU]] | publisher= Vexillographia |language=Russian |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At the beginning of its existence, the Red Army functioned as a voluntary formation, without ranks or insignia. Democratic elections selected the officers. However, a decree of 29 May 1918 imposed obligatory military service for men of ages 18 to 40.{{Sfn | Scott | Scott | 1979 | p = 5}}  To service the massive draft, the Bolsheviks formed regional military commissariats (''voyennyy komissariat'', abbr. ''voyenkomat''), which as of 2006 still exist in Russia in this function and under this name. Military commissariats, however, should not be confused with the institution of military [[political commissar]]s.

In the mid-1920s the territorial principle of manning the Red Army was introduced. In each region able-bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in territorial units, which constituted about half the army's strength, each year, for five years.{{Sfn | Scott | Scott | 1979 | p = 12}}  The first call-up period was for three months, with one month a year thereafter. A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus. By 1925 this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions. The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two-year terms. The territorial system was finally abolished, with all remaining formations converted to the other cadre divisions, in 1937–1938.{{Sfn |  Glantz | 2005 | p = 717 note 5}}

===Mechanization===
The Soviet military received ample funding and was innovative in its technology. An American journalist wrote in 1941:&lt;ref name="knickerbocker1941"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock | last =Knickerbocker | first = HR | year=1941 | pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Even in American terms the Soviet defence budget was large. In 1940 it was the equivalent of $11,000,000,000, and represented one-third of the national expenditure. Measure this against the fact that the infinitely richer United States will approximate the expenditure of that much yearly only in 1942 after two years of our greatest defence effort.

Most of the money spent on the Red Army and Air Force went for machines of war. Twenty-three years ago when the Bolshevik revolution took place there were few machines in Russia. Marx said Communism must come in a highly industrialized society. The Bolsheviks identified their dreams of socialist happiness with machines which would multiply production and reduce hours of labour until everyone would have everything he needed and would work only as much as he wished. Somehow this has not come about, but the Russians still worship machines, and this helped make the Red Army the most highly mechanized in the world, except perhaps the German Army now.

Like Americans, the Russians admire size, bigness, large numbers. They took pride in building a vast army of tanks, some of them the largest in the world, armored cars, airplanes, motorized guns, and every variety of mechanical weapons.}}

[[File:Bt7 3.jpg|thumb|right|Red Army [[BT-7]] tanks on parade]]
Under Stalin's campaign for mechanization, the army formed its first mechanized unit in 1930. The 1st Mechanized Brigade consisted of a tank regiment, a motorized infantry regiment, as well as reconnaissance and artillery battalions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Charles | last = Sharp | title = Soviet Order of Battle World War II | volume = I: The Deadly Beginning | chapter = Soviet Tank, Mechanized, Motorized Divisions and Tank Brigades of 1940–1942 | publisher = [[George Nafziger]] | year = 1995 | pages = 2–3}}, cited at {{Citation | url = http://www.redarmystudies.net/0411030.htm | title = Red army studies | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041015092534/http://www.redarmystudies.net/0411030.htm | archivedate = 15 October 2004 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; From this humble beginning, the Soviets would go on to create the first operational-level armored formations in history, the [[11th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|11th]] and [[45th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|45th Mechanized Corps]], in 1932. These were tank-heavy formations with combat support forces included so they could survive while operating in enemy rear areas without support from a parent [[front (Soviet Army)|front]].

Impressed by the German campaign of 1940 against France, the Soviet [[People's Commissariat of Defence]] (Defence Ministry, Russian abbreviation NKO) ordered the creation of nine mechanized corps on 6 July 1940.  Between February and March 1941 the NKO ordered another twenty to be created. All of these formations were larger than those theorized by [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky|Tukhachevsky]]. Even though the Red Army's 29 mechanized corps had an authorized strength of no less than 29,899 tanks by 1941, they proved to be a paper tiger.{{Sfn | House | 1984 | p = 96}}  There were actually only 17,000 tanks available at the time, meaning several of the new mechanized corps were badly under strength. The pressure placed on factories and military planners to show production numbers also led to a situation where the majority of armored vehicles were obsolescent models, critically lacking in spare parts and support equipment, and nearly three quarters were overdue for major maintenance.{{Sfn | Zaloga | 1984 | p = 126}}  By 22 June 1941 there were only 1,475 of the modern T-34s and KV series tanks available to the Red Army, and these were too dispersed along the front to provide enough mass for even local success.{{Sfn | House | 1984 | p = 96}}  To illustrate this, the [[3rd Mechanised Corps (Soviet Union)|3rd Mechanized Corps]] in Lithuania was formed up of a total of 460 tanks; 109 of these were newer KV-1s and T-34s. This corps would prove to be one of the lucky few with a substantial number of newer tanks. However, the [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]] was composed of 520 tanks, all of which were the obsolete T-26, as opposed to the authorized strength of 1,031 newer medium tanks.{{Sfn | Glantz | p = 35}}  This problem was universal throughout the Red Army, and would play a crucial role in the initial defeats of the Red Army in 1941 at the hands of the German armed forces.{{Sfn | Glantz | 1998 | p = 117}}

===Wartime===
{{See also|Red Army's tactics in World War II}}
[[File:RIAN archive 44732 Soviet soldiers attack house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Battle of Stalingrad]] is considered by many historians as a decisive turning point of World War II]]
War experience prompted changes to the way frontline forces were organised. After six months of combat against the Germans, the [[Stavka]] abolished the rifle corps which was intermediate between the [[Army (Soviet Army)|army]] and [[Division (military)|division]] level because, while useful in theory, in the state of the Red Army in 1941, they proved ineffective in practice.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 179}}  Following the decisive victory in the [[Battle of Moscow]] in January 1942, the high command began to reintroduce rifle corps into its more experienced formations. The total number of rifle corps started at 62 on 22 June 1941, dropped to six by 1 January 1942, but then increased to 34 by February 1943, and 161 by New Year's Day 1944. Actual strengths of front-line rifle divisions, authorised to contain 11,000 men in July 1941, were mostly no more than 50% of establishment strengths during 1941,{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | page = 189}} and divisions were often worn down on continuous operations to hundreds of men or even less.

On the outbreak of war the Red Army deployed mechanised corps and tank divisions whose development has been described above. The initial German attack destroyed many, and in the course of 1941 virtually all of them,(barring two in the [[Transbaikal Military District]]). The remnants were disbanded.{{Sfn | Glantz | 2005 | p = 217–30}}  It was much easier to coordinate smaller forces, and separate tank brigades and battalions were substituted. It was late 1942 and early 1943 before larger [[Tank corps (Soviet)|tank formations of corps size]] were fielded to employ armour in mass again. By mid-1943 these corps were being grouped together into tank armies whose strength by the end of the war could be up to 700 tanks and 50,000 men.

The Bolshevik authorities assigned to every unit of the Red Army a [[political commissar]], or ''politruk'', who had the authority to override unit commanders' decisions if they ran counter to the principles of the Communist Party.  Although this sometimes resulted in inefficient command according to           most historians{{who|date=April 2014}}, the Party leadership considered political control over the military absolutely necessary, as the army relied more and more on officers from the pre-revolutionary Imperial period and understandably feared a military coup. This system was abolished in 1925, as there were by that time enough trained Communist officers to render the counter-signing unnecessary.{{Sfn | Scott | Scott | 1979 | p = 13}}

===Ranks and titles===
[[File:Příznivci ruského motorkářského klubu Noční vlci Olšanských hřbitovech.JPG|thumb|Memorial to the Red Army in [[Prague]], Czech Republic]]
{{Main article|Military ranks of the Soviet Union}}
The early Red Army abandoned the institution of a professional [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] as a "heritage of tsarism" in the course of the Revolution. In particular, the Bolsheviks condemned the use of the word ''officer'' and used the word ''commander'' instead. The Red Army abandoned [[epaulette]]s and [[Military rank|ranks]], using purely functional titles such as "Division Commander", "Corps Commander" and similar titles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; Insignia for these functional titles existed, consisting of triangles, squares and rhombuses (so-called "diamonds").

In 1924 (2 October) "personal" or "service" categories were introduced, from K1 (section leader, assistant squad leader, senior rifleman, etc.) to K14 (field commander, army commander, military district commander, army commissar and equivalent). Service category insignia again consisted of triangles, squares and rhombuses, but also rectangles (1 – 3, for categories from K7 to K9).

On 22 September 1935 the Red Army abandoned service categories{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} and introduced personal ranks. These ranks, however, used a unique mix of functional titles and traditional ranks. For example, the ranks included "Lieutenant" and "[[Comdiv]]" (Комдив, Division Commander). Further complications ensued from the functional and categorical ranks for political officers (e.g., "brigade commissar", "army commissar 2nd rank"), for technical corps (e.g., "engineer 3rd rank," "division engineer"), and for administrative, medical and other non-combatant branches.

The [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] (Маршал Советского Союза) rank was introduced on 22 September 1935.  On 7 May 1940 further modifications to rationalise the system of ranks were made on the proposal by Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]]: the ranks of "General" and "[[Admiral]]" replaced the senior functional ranks of [[Combrig]], [[Comdiv]], [[Comcor]], [[Comandarm]] in the RKKA and [[Flagman]] 1st rank etc. in the [[Red Navy]]; the other senior functional ranks ("division commissar," "division engineer," etc.) remained unaffected. The arm or service distinctions remained (e.g. [[general of cavalry]], marshal of armoured troops).{{Sfn | Erickson | 1962}}{{Page needed | date = October 2013}}  For the most part the new system restored that used by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] at the conclusion of its participation in World War I.

In early 1943 a unification of the system saw the abolition of all the remaining functional ranks. The word "officer" became officially endorsed, together with the use of [[epaulette]]s, which superseded the previous rank insignia. The ranks and insignia of 1943 did not change much until the last days of the USSR; the contemporary [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] uses largely the same system.

===Military education===
[[File:RedArmy kursants1933.jpg|thumb|''Kursants'' (cadets), Red Army Artillery School, [[Chuhuyiv]], Ukraine, 1933]]
{{Main article|Soviet military academies}}

During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] the commander cadres were trained at the [[Nicholas General Staff Academy]] of the Russian Empire, which became the [[Frunze Military Academy]] in the 1920s. Senior and supreme commanders were trained at the Higher Military Academic Courses, renamed the Advanced Courses for Supreme Command in 1925. The 1931 establishment of an Operations Faculty at the Frunze Military Academy supplemented these courses. The [[General Staff Academy (Soviet)|General Staff Academy]] was reinstated on 2 April 1936, and became the principal military school for the senior and supreme commanders of the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Schofield | 1991 | pp = 67–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purges===

[[File:Tukhachevsky-mikhail-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red Army marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], who was executed during the [[Great Purge]] in June 1937.]]

The late 1930s saw purges of the Red Army leadership which occurred concurrently with Stalin's [[Great Purge]] of Soviet society. In 1936 and 1937, at the orders of Stalin, thousands of Red Army senior officers were dismissed from their commands. The purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the "politically unreliable elements," mainly among higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for the settling of personal vendettas or to eliminate competition by officers seeking the same command. Many army, corps, and divisional commanders were sacked: most were imprisoned or sent to labor camps; others were executed. Among the victims was the Red Army's primary military theorist, Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], who was perceived by Stalin as a potential political rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lsKClpnX8qwC|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781576070840|language = en|first = Helen|last = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers who remained soon found all of their decisions being closely examined by political officers, even in mundane matters such as record-keeping and field training exercises.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} An atmosphere of fear and unwillingness to take the initiative soon pervaded the Red Army; suicide rates among junior officers rose to record levels.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} The purges significantly impaired the combat capabilities of the Red Army.

[[File:19290000-bljukher stalin wseobukh.jpg|thumb|right| Stalin with [[Vasily Blyukher|marshal Blyukher]] among Red Army military personnel]]
Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, at the height of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 were dismissed. In 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers, 56% more than in 1937, of whom a further 6,742 were dismissed. In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, all 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan | last = Bullock | title = Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives | place = New York | publisher = Vintage Books | year = 1993 | page = 489}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was that the Red Army officer corps in 1941 had many inexperienced senior officers. While 60% of regimental commanders had two years or more of command experience in June 1941, and almost 80% of rifle division commanders, only 20% of corps commanders, and 5% or fewer army and military district commanders, had the same level of experience.{{Sfn | Glantz | 1998 | p = 58}}

The significant growth of the Red Army during the high point of the purges may have worsened matters. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, increasing to almost three times that number by June 1941. The rapid growth of the army necessitated in turn the rapid promotion of officers regardless of experience or training.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} Junior officers were appointed to fill the ranks of the senior leadership, many of whom lacked broad experience.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} This action in turn resulted in many openings at the lower level of the officer corps, which were filled by new graduates from the service academies. In 1937, the entire junior class of one academy was graduated a year early to fill vacancies in the Red Army.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} Hamstrung by inexperience and fear of reprisals, many of these new officers failed to impress the large numbers of incoming draftees to the ranks; complaints of insubordination rose to the top of offenses punished in 1941,{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} and may have exacerbated instances of Red Army soldiers deserting their units during the initial phases of the German offensive of that year.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}}

By 1940, Stalin began to relent, restoring approximately one-third of previously dismissed officers to duty.{{Sfn | Merridale | 2007 | p = 70}} However, the effect of the purges would soon manifest itself in the [[Winter War]] of 1940, where Red Army forces generally performed poorly against the much smaller Finnish Army, and later during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of 1941, in which the German were able to rout the Soviet defenders partially due to inexperience amongst the Soviet officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middleton|first=Drew|date=1981-06-21|title=HITLER'S RUSSIAN BLUNDER|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/magazine/hitler-s-russian-blunder.html|dead-url=no|journal=New York Times Magazine|volume=|pages=6006031|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125213454/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/magazine/hitler-s-russian-blunder.html|archive-date=2018-01-25|via=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard K. Vedder''' (born November 5, 1940) is an American [[economist]], [[historian]], [[author]], and [[columnist]]. He is a professor emeritus of economics at [[Ohio University]] and senior fellow at [[The Independent Institute]].

==Biography==
Vedder was born on November 5, 1940. He earned his bachelor's in economics in 1962 from [[Northwestern University]] in 1962 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in economics from the [[University of Illinois]] in 1965. He has since studied [[Economic history of the United States|U.S. economic history]], particularly as it relates to [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio.edu/cas/economics/contact/profiles.cfm?profile=vedder|title=Richard Vedder|website=www.ohio.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his research has involved [[Immigration to the United States|American immigration]], economic issues in [[Education in the United States|American education]], and the interrelationship between [[Labour economics|labor]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] markets.&lt;ref name=broke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/book/780|title=AEI – Going Broke by Degree|accessdate=March 24, 2011|publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedder serves as an adjunct scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), a [[think tank]] known for mostly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] perspectives. He has served as an economist with [[United States Congress|Congress]]' [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]]. In his role with the AEI, he later testified before the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Committee]] on October 30, 2008.&lt;ref name=broke/&gt;&lt;ref name=testimony&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/speech/28953|title=AEI – Speeches – Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress|accessdate=March 25, 2011|publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also director of the ''Center for College Affordability and Productivity''&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/ Center for College Affordability and Productivity]&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="walmart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/book/867|title=AEI – The Wal-Mart Revolution|publisher=[[American Enterprise Institute]]|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedder is married to Karen Vedder.

==Public commentary==
===Higher education===
Vedder wrote in his June 2004 book ''Going Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much'' that American universities have become less productive and less efficient in recent years as well as more likely to shift funds away their core mission of teaching. He also criticized rising tuition costs. He proposed as a broad solution moving state universities toward [[free market]] competition and [[privatization]]. He specifically recommended as well that colleges expand [[distance learning]], cut out non-educational programs, modify [[tenure]], raise teaching loads, and reduce administrative staffs.&lt;ref name="broke" /&gt;

On May 27, 2011, Vedder appeared on the [[news]]/[[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] [[Television program|TV program]] ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' and stated that since "the cost of college is rising relative to the benefits of college," but "learning outcomes are stagnant or falling in this country," American society must "open up opportunities for people to consider a variety of different options after high school, one of which is college, but there are many others." Vedder also stated that "as many as one out of three college graduates today are in jobs that previously or historically have been filled by people with lesser educations, jobs that do not require higher-level learning skills, critical thinking skills, or writing skills or anything of that nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june11/college_05-27.html|title=Is a College Diploma Worth the Soaring Student Debt?|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=''[[PBS NewsHour]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government spending===
Vedder and writer [[Stephen Moore (writer)|Stephen Moore]] wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial page in March 2011 that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. Thus, they found evidence in favor of the "[[Starve the beast#"Feed the Beast"|Feed the Beast]]" theory: that increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget leads only to the government spending such inflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704648604575620502560925156|title=Higher Taxes Won't Reduce the Deficit|author1=[[Stephen Moore (writer)|Stephen Moore]]|date=November 21, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2011|publisher=''Wall Street Journal''|author2=Richard Vedder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. bailout===
In the aftermath of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], Vedder stated that he "somewhat reluctantly" supported the $700 billion bailout package included in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]. He attributed the crisis to governmental failure and "public policy miscues," saying the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007 and 2008]] "never would have happened" in "the absence of these governmental mistakes."

=== Walmart wages ===
Vedder wrote, along with Wendell Cox, the December 2006 book ''The Wal-Mart Revolution'' in which they asserted that criticisms of [[Criticism of Walmart#Wages|wage practices WalMart]] are "unfounded." He argued that Walmart workers are "paid fairly" given their skill and experience, and he stated that they also receive side benefits such as [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] that is fairly similar to competing firms. He further argued that communities with new Walmart stores have greater total employment and higher incomes.&lt;ref name="walmart" /&gt;

==Books and writings==
Vedder's scholarly writings have appeared in journals such as ''[[Explorations in Economic History]]'', ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'', and ''[[Agricultural History (journal)|Agricultural History]]''. He has written over two hundred such scholarly articles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Vedder's writings have also appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Investor's Business Daily]]'', and the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''.&lt;ref name="broke" /&gt;

He has published the books ''The American Economy in Historical Perspective, Unemployment and Government in Twentieth-Century America'' (with Lowell Gallaway), ''Can Teachers Own Their Own Schools?'', ''Going Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much'',&lt;ref name="broke" /&gt; and ''The Wal-Mart Revolution: How Big-Box Stores Benefit Consumers, Workers, and the Economy'' (with Wendell Cox).&lt;ref name="walmart" /&gt;

{{Advert|date=May 2010}}
Under direction of the [[Office of Naval Research]], the Naval Research Laboratory’s Code 5770 produced the '''SIMDIS''' 3-D Analysis and Display Toolset to the [[US Department of Defense]] community.  SIMDIS provides support for analysis and display of test and training mission data to more than 4000 users.  SIMDIS runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Sun Microsystems]] workstations with hardware accelerated [[3-D graphics]] and provides identical execution and "look and feel" for all supported platforms. Since SIMDIS requires no additional [[Commercial off-the-shelf|COTS]] products or license fees, the [[Range Commanders Council]] (RCC) currently lists SIMDIS as a cost savings/avoidance program for the US Department of Defense.

SIMDIS provides either a [[2D computer graphics|2-D]] or a 3-D display of the normally "seen" data such as platform position and orientation, as well as the "unseen" data such as the interactions of sensor systems with targets, countermeasures, and the environment.  It includes custom tools for interactively analyzing and displaying data for equipment modes, [[spatial grid]]s, ranges, angles, antenna patterns, line of sight and [[Radio frequency|RF]] propagation.  Capability for viewing time synchronized data from either a standalone workstation or [[multiple networked workstations]] is also provided.

To meet the needs of range operators, simulation users, analysts, and decision makers SIMDIS provides multiple modes of operation including live display, interactive playback, and scripted multimedia modes.  It also provides capability for manipulation of post-processed data and integration with charts, graphs, pictures, audio and video for use in the development and delivery of 3-D visual presentations.

At the Naval Research Laboratory and other sites, SIMDIS has been used for numerous simulation, test and training applications, analyzing disparate test data in a common frame of reference.  SIMDIS has been independently accredited and certified by [[Commander Operational Test and Evaluation Force]] (COMOPTEVFOR) and [[United States Joint Forces Command|Joint Forces Command]] (JFCOM).  SIMDIS binaries are released under U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) ''DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A'', meaning it is approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.&lt;ref name=NRLSlides group=NRL&gt;{{cite web|title=SIMDIS Visual Analysis &amp; Display|url=https://simdis.nrl.navy.mil/SimdisPresentation.aspx|work=SIMDIS Web site|publisher=Naval Research Laboratory|accessdate=29 October 2013|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been approved for use on the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet ([[NMCI]]).

SIMDIS is currently an operational display system for the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA), the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center]] (NUWC), the [[Pacific Missile Range Facility]] (PMRF), the [[Southern California Offshore Range]] (SCORE), and the [[Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program]]’s (CTEIP) Test and [[Test and Training Enabling Architecture]] (TENA).  In addition to the Defense community, SIMDIS has also gained acceptance in various other U.S. government organizations and in the foreign community.

SIMDIS has a companion [[Software development kit|SDK]] which provides developers a way to embed much of the functionality of SIMDIS into their own application. The SIMDISK SDK is available on [http://SoftwareForge.mil SoftwareForge.mil] under U.S. DoD Distribution Statement C, which means distribution is limited to U.S. Government agencies and their contractors.&lt;ref name=SDKLic group=NRL&gt;{{cite web|title=LICENSE.txt|url=https://software.forge.mil/integration/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/SIMDIS_SDK/LICENSE.txt?revision=2&amp;root=simdis_sdk&amp;system=exsy1002&amp;view=co|work=SIMDIS-SDK Project Web site|publisher=SoftwareForge.mil|accessdate=29 October 2013|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of South Africa}}
'''General elections''' were held in [[South Africa]] in August 1984 to elect [[Coloured]] and [[Asians in South Africa|Indian]] representatives to their respective houses of the [[Tricameral Parliament]]. The Coloured elections for the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] took place on 22 August, and resulted in a victory for the [[Labour Party (South Africa, 1969)|Labour Party]], headed by the [[Reverend]] [[Allan Hendrickse]], which won 76 of the 80 seats. The Indian elections for the [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] were held on 28 August and saw the [[National People's Party (South Africa, 1981)|National People's Party]] emerge as the largest party, winning 18 of the 40 seats.&lt;ref name=AED&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/za.html#1984_House_of_Delegates_Election Elections in South Africa] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian elections were opposed by the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] and were marked by boycotts and protests.&lt;ref name=AED/&gt;

==Background==
In addition to the whites-only [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]], a November 1983 referendum had approved the creation of two new houses an 80-member [[House of Representatives (South Africa)|House of Representatives]] for Coloureds and a 40-member [[House of Delegates (South Africa)|House of Delegates]] for Asians.

'''Squatting in England and Wales''' usually refers to a person who is not the owner, taking possession of land or an empty house. People [[squatting|squat]] for a variety of reasons which include needing a home,&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many squats are residential, some are also opened as [[social centres]].

There have been waves of squatting through British history. The BBC states that squatting was "a big issue in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 and again for the [[Diggers]] in the 17th Century [who] were peasants who cultivated waste and common land, claiming it as their rightful due" and that squatting was a necessity after the [[Second World War]] when so many were homeless.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14030336 ''Squatters: Who are they and why do they squat?''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent wave began in the late 1960s in the midst of a housing crisis.

Many squatters legalised their homes or projects in the 1980s, for example [[Bonnington Square]] and [[Frestonia]] in London. More recently, there are still isolated examples such as the [[The Invisible Circus (circus troupe)|Invisible Circus]] in Bristol.

Under Section 144 of the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]], squatting in residential property became a criminal offence on 1 September 2012.&lt;ref name=squattingillegal&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 Squatting set to become a criminal offence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bills-acts/circulars/squatting-circular.pdf Ministry of Justice Circular No. 2012/04 - Offence of Squatting In a Residential Building]&lt;/ref&gt; Squatting in non-residential property may be a civil or a criminal matter, depending upon the circumstances,&lt;ref name="crimlaw1977"&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1977]] section 6&lt;/ref&gt; and repossession by the owners, occupiers or intended occupiers may require legal process or police action.

==History==
===16th- and 17th-century===
In 16th- and 17th-century Wales, an expansion in population as well as [[taxation]] policy led to a move of people into the Welsh countryside, where they squatted on [[common land]]. These squatters built their own property under the assumption of a fictional piece of folklore, leading to the developments of small holdings around a [[Tŷ unnos]], or "house in a night".

In [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], there was a common belief, that if a house was erected by a squatter and their friends on waste ground overnight, then they had the right of undisturbed possession.&lt;ref name=Harrison135&gt;Harrison. The Common People. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; To make it difficult for squatters to build, an act was passed known as the [[Erection of Cottages Act 1588]]  whereby a cottage could only be built as long as it had a minimum of {{convert|4|acre|ha sqmi|2|lk=on}} of land associated with it.&lt;ref name=Harrison135/&gt;&lt;ref name=statute664&gt;Basket. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA664&amp;dq=%22An+act+against+erecting+and+maintaining+cottages%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rt2cUqL2JIuqhAe9toBI&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20act%20against%20erecting%20and%20maintaining%20cottages%22&amp;f=false Statutes at Large.] Retrieved 10 November 2014 p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649 at St George's Hill, [[Weybridge]] in [[Surrey]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and others calling themselves The [[Diggers|True Levellers]] occupied disused [[common land]] and cultivated it collectively in the hope that their actions would inspire other poor people to follow their lead. Gerrard Winstanley stated that "the poorest man hath as true a title and just right to the land as the richest man".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Ed. Wates and Wolmar (1980)''Squatting: The Real Story'' (Bay Leaf Books) {{ISBN|0-9507259-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the True Levellers, later more commonly known as the Diggers, were perhaps not the first squatters in England, their story illustrates the heritage of squatting as a form of radical direct action.

===Post World War II===
There was a huge squatting movement involving ex-servicemen and their families following [[World War II]]. In Brighton, [[Harry Cowley]] and the Vigilantes installed families in empty properties and all around the country, in London suburbs and villages such as Chalfont St Giles families occupied derelict camps and in some cases stayed there until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/chalfont-st-giles Chalfont St Giles 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; As word spread, more and more people squatted until there were an estimated 45,000 in total.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, J. 'Self-help and Socialism The Squatters' Movement of 1946' in ''History Workshop Journal'' (1988) 25(1): 100-126.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, [[Aneurin Bevan]] reported to the House of Commons that 1,038 camps in England and Wales were occupied by 39,535 people.&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Webber |first=H. |url=https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume4/Webber-Squatters_movement.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Domestic Rebellion: The Squatters' Movement of 1946 |journal=Ex Historia |year=2012 |volume=4 |pages=125&amp;ndash;146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the Government prevaricated, there was considerable public support for the squatters, since they were perceived as honest people simply taking action to house themselves. [[Clementine Churchill]], wife of the ex-Prime Minister, commented in August 1946: "These people are referred to by the ungraceful term 'squatters', and I wish the press would not use this word about respectable citizens whose only desire is to have a home."&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"/&gt;

On 8 September 1946, 1,500 people squatted flats in Kensington, Pimlico and St.Johns Wood. This action, termed the 'Great Sunday Squat' garnered much media attention and resulted five of the leaders being arrested for 'conspiring to incite and direct trespass.' The squatters left the apartments but did receive temporary accommodation. A sympathetic judge merely bound the squatters over to good behaviour.&lt;ref name="Webber, H. 2012 pp125-146"/&gt;

===1960s===
In the context of a severe housing crisis, the late 1960s saw the development of the Family Squatting Movement, which sought to mobilise people to take control of empty properties and use them to house homeless families from the [[Council house|Council Housing]] Waiting List. This movement was originally based in London (where Ron Bailey and [[Jim Radford]] were instrumental in helping to establish family squatting campaigns in several [[London borough]]s and later the Family Squatting Advisory Service), and several local Family Squatting Associations signed agreements with borough councils to use empty properties under licence (although only after some lengthy and bitter campaigns had been fought—most particularly in the borough of [[London Borough of Redbridge|Redbridge]]).&lt;ref name="Bailey, Ron 1973"&gt;Bailey, Ron ''The Squatters'' (1973) Penguin:UK {{ISBN|0140523006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey commented in 2005 that "The whole concept of community-based housing associations – that's where it all started, with squatting groups. It shows that the solution to housing problems isn't estate based, it should be based on mutual aid. The government should do all it can to enable self-help groups to flourish." &lt;ref&gt;Martin, D. 'A Squat of Their Own' in ''Inside Housing'' August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, the [[Principality of Sealand]] has existed as an unrecognised [[micronation]] on [[HM Fort Roughs]], a sea fort off the coast of Suffolk. It was occupied by [[Paddy Roy Bates]] who styled himself as His Royal Highness Prince Roy.

In 1969, members of the [[London Street Commune]] squatted a mansion at [[144 Piccadilly]] in central London to highlight the issue of homelessness but were quickly evicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Police storm squat in Piccadilly'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_3092000/3092343.stm News On This Day] 21 September 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eel Pie Island]] Hotel was occupied by a small group of local anarchists including illustrator [[Clifford Harper]]. By 1970 it had become the UK's largest [[hippy]] [[commune]].&lt;ref name='Faiers'&gt;{{cite book | last = Faiers | first = Chris | title = Eel Pie Dharma | publisher=Unfinished Monument Press | year = 1990 | url = | id = | isbn = 0-920976-42-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s onwards===

[[File:StAgnesPl.squats.JPG|thumb|St Agnes Place pre-demolition]]

By the early 1970s, there was a growing conflict between the original activists of the Family Squatting Movement and a newer wave of squatters who simply rejected the right of landlords to charge rent and who believed (or claimed to) that seizing property and living rent-free was a revolutionary political act or more practically decided it was a good way to save money. These new-wave squatters (often young and single rather than homeless families) were a mixture of anarchists, [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]—the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) being especially prominent—and self-proclaimed [[hippie]] [[Dropping out|dropouts]], and they denounced the idea that squatters should seek to make agreements with local Councils to use empty property and that Squatting Associations should then become landlords (or Self Help Housing Associations as they were sometimes styled) in their own right and charge [[Renting|rent]].

The [[Advisory Service for Squatters]] (ASS) continued the work of the Family Squatting Advisory Service, running a volunteer service helping squatters. ASS has been in continuous existence for almost forty years. It publishes the ''Squatters' Handbook'' and has drafted a legal warning to be used by squatters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://squatter.org.uk/ Advisory Service for Squatters]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St Agnes Place]] was a squatted street in Kennington, South London, which was occupied from 1969 until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4481284.stm 'Oldest squat' residents evicted ]&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC documentary series [[Lefties]] profiled a squatted street called Villa Road in Brixton, which is still in existence.

Local Authority Housing Departments, facing rising court costs when evicting squatters, often resorted to taking out the plumbing and toilets in empty buildings to deter squatters. In the 1970s, some housing councils would attempt to deter squatters from entering their properties by "gutting" the houses, rendering them uninhabitable by pouring concrete into toilets and sinks or smashing the ceilings and staircases.&lt;ref name="Bailey, Ron 1973"/&gt;

Activists such as Terry Fitzpatrick teamed up with the local community in Whitechapel to form the Bengali Housing Action Group (BHAG) in 1976. At a time when the National Front was a threat in the area, Bengali families found strength squatting in numbers. Members of [[Race Today]] were involved in BHAG. When the [[Greater London Council]] declared an amnesty for squatters in 1977, they offered the Bengali families estates in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, S. [http://www.sarahglynn.net/The%20Battle%20for%20Housing.html 'East End Immigrants and the Battle for Housing: A comparative study of political mobilisation in the Jewish and Bengali communities'] in ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 31 pp 528-545 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, there were estimated to be 50,000 squatters throughout Britain, with the majority (30,000) living in [[London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Kearns, K (1979) ''Intraurban Squatting in London'', Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 69, No. 4 (December 1979), pp. 589-598&lt;/ref&gt; There was a London's Squatters' Union in which [[Piers Corbyn]] was involved. For eighteen months, it was housed at Huntley Street, where over 150 people lived in 52 flats. The union organised festivals and provided homes for the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Etoe, C ''Empty again, the squat attacked by bulldozers'' Camden New Journal 21 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatters occupied the [[Centre Point]] building in central London to protest homelessness and set up a free state in west London called [[Frestonia]] which attempted to secede from England. 
Actor [[David Rappaport]] was the Foreign Minister, while playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] served as Ambassador to Great Britain. The squatters later formed themselves into a [[housing co-operative]] which still owns the buildings. In Euston, Tolmers Square was occupied by more than one hundred squatters, who engaged with local groups to fight for a redevelopment plan which fitted the community. "Demolitions and threats to Georgian Bloomsbury and to Tolmers Square in Euston (the 'locus classicus of London's intellectual squatting movement'), succeeded anew in drawing public attention to the plight of the squares, and precipitated the initial stirrings of the movement for their preservation." &lt;ref&gt;Longstaffe-Gowan, T. (2012) ''The London Square: Gardens in the Midst of Town'' New Haven: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The squatters lived there for six years, during which time Alara Wholefoods &amp; Community Foods started up. Community Foods grew to  become the largest wholefood company in Britain in the 1980's and 1990's.  Nick Wates writes that "It was only by taking direct action that anyone could intervene. By occupying empty buildings, squatters were able to halt the decline, revive the community and revive leadership in the struggle against the developers." &lt;ref&gt;Wates, N. (1976) ''The Battle for Tolmers Square'' Routledge: London.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Railton Road in Brixton, the 121 Centre was set up, having first been squatted by the black feminist [[Olive Morris]]. Until its eviction in 1999, the 121 hosted events and in the 1980s printed a squatters newspaper called Crowbar and the anarchist [[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]] magazine in its basement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Aufheben ''Kill or Chill - An analysis of the Opposition to the Criminal Justice Bill'' in Aufheben 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Centro Iberico]] was an old school squatted as a social centre in the 1980s, following on from the [[Wapping Autonomy Centre]].

Elsewhere in England, there were sizeable squatting communities in Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge,  Leicester and Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;Wates, N. &amp; Wolmar, C. (1983) ''Squatting the Real Story'' Bay Leaf:London.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bristol, in the mid-1980s, squatters had the Full Marx bookshop, the Demolition Ballroom and the Demolition Diner, all on Cheltenham Road.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 1990s, squatters in Brighton formed a group called [[Justice?]] and squatted an old Courthouse. They later set up a Squatters Estate Agency which received national media coverage.
The 2012 [[Brighton Photo Biennial]] focused on 'Agents of Change' and released a full colour pamphlet entitled 'Another Space: Political Squatting in Brighton 1994 – present.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/photoworks_uk/docs/another_space_bpb12 Another Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as the aforementioned estate agency, a community garden, exhibitions and an anti-supermarket project were all featured. The curator commented that "While millionaires leave 'spare' houses empty for months on end and Tesco buy up land to be left vacant indefinitely, so called public space continues to diminish. By opening buildings to the public to make and share art, squatters create temporary autonomous spaces that radically refute this logic." &lt;ref&gt;Burbridge, B. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/sep/28/squatting-art-brighton-photo-biennial 'Political squatting: an arresting art'] in ''The Guardian'' 28 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

[[File:Topple the Tyrants occupation.jpg|thumb|300px|A "Topple the Tyrants" occupation at the home of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] in London in 2011.]]
In 2003, it was estimated that there were 15,000 squatters in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Fallon A ''Squatters are back, and upwardly mobile'' in ''The Independent on Sunday'' 12 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Ministry of Justice deemed the figure to be 20,000.&lt;ref name="consultationamendment"&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/dealing-with-squatters.htm 'Options for dealing with squatters']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistics compiled by the [[Empty Homes Agency]] in 2009, the most empty homes in the UK were in [[Birmingham]] (21,532), [[Leeds]] (24,796) [[Liverpool]] (20,860) and [[Manchester]] (24,955).&lt;ref&gt;Empty Homes Figures 2009 http://www.emptyhomes.com/usefulresources/stats/statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fewest empty homes were in [[South East England]] and [[East Anglia]].

In recent years, there have been squatted [[social centre]]s in many UK cities, linked through the [[UK Social Centre Network]]. The OKasional Cafe in Manchester began in 1998 and periodically created short-term autonomous spaces including cafes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radicalmanchester.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/okasional-cafes/ Okasional Cafes]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RampART Social Centre]] in Whitechapel, London, existed from May 2004 until October 2009, hosting meetings, screenings, performances, exhibitions and benefit gigs. As part of [[Occupy London]] the [[Bank of Ideas]] was occupied in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Owen and Peter Walker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/nov/18/occupy-london-takes-over-empty-ubs-bank-live |title=Occupy London takes over empty UBS bank |work=The Guardian |accessdate=21 January 2012 |date=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spike Surplus Scheme]] was a venue and garden based in a former doss-house in Peckham, squatted from 1999 until 2009.

The [[491 Gallery]] in Leytonstone, East London is a multidisciplinary art gallery.&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/wfnews/9839388.LEYTONSTONE__Community_art_space_under_threat/|title=Community art space under threat|author=Figen Gunes|publisher=Waltham Forest Guardian|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young artists who cannot afford to rent studio or gallery space, occupy abandoned buildings. Artist [[Matthew Stone]] from the [[!WOWOW!]] collective in South London states "I was obsessed with the idea of it, but also with getting to London and being part of a dynamic group of young people doing things."&lt;ref name="The artists who are hot to squat"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/apr/12/artists-collectives-squats/print ] ''The artists who are hot to squat...'' Hoby, Hermione, &lt;u&gt;The Observer&lt;/u&gt;, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyndhurst Way]] was squatted as a gallery from 2006 to 2007.

Temporary Autonomous Art, run by a group called Random Artists, is a series of squatted exhibitions which have been occurring since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomartists.org/about_ra.shtml About Random Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in London, the events have also taken place in Brighton, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;Macindoe, M. (2011). ''Out of Order: A Photographic Celebration of the Free Party Scene'' Bristol: Tangent Books. pp. 429–436. {{ISBN|978-190647743-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups have also squatted land as community gardens. Two such London projects were the [[Kew Bridge Ecovillage]] and the [[Hounslow community land project]]. In Reading, a garden called Common Ground was opened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afed.org.uk/org/issue69/common_ground_post_eviction.html 'Creating Common Ground: A squatted community garden as a strategy for anti-capitalists'] in Organise issue 69&lt;/ref&gt; It was then resquatted the following year as part of the April2008 days of action in support of autonomous spaces.

====Gremlins====
[[File:Gremlins.jpg|thumb|''Gremlins'' protesting on the roof of the squatted Spin Bowling, Cardiff, 2012.]]

As a result of the criminalisation of squatting in residential buildings, a group calling themselves ''The Gremlins'' in October 2012 resisted eviction of Spin Bowling in Cardiff from bailiffs and police. The group covered their faces with scarves and masks, posting on ''Bristol [[Indymedia]]'' claiming; ''"The state tries to make people homeless, anarchists have no sympathy for the state and its lackeys."'' The protest was believed to be in response to the imprisonment of Alex Haigh, who was the first person jailed under the new Section 144 law in the UK.&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2012/10/06/activists-occupying-former-cardiff-bowling-alley-pledge-to-stay-put-91466-31976722/ | location=| work=Wales Online | title=Activists occupying former Cardiff bowling alley pledge to 'stay put' | date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bindy"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bristol.indymedia.org/article/711041 | work=Bristol Indymedia | title=Gremlin Alley Eviction Resistance happening now | date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activists have renamed the building ''Gremlin Alley Social Centre'' and continue to organise events at the squat.&lt;ref name="gremin"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://welcometogremlinalley.wordpress.com/ | work=Wordpress.com | title=

In November 2012, masked squatters moved into the Bute Dock Hotel in [[Cardiff Bay]], owned by the nearby [[letting agent]]s Keylet. They were seen on the roof and were believed to be from the group, after a post on the Gremlin Alley [[Twitter]] account. Managing Director and Chairman of the Association of Letting and Management Agents, Mr Vidler, said ''"It's distressing because I have items in there which are part of our business"'', concerned it would cost a lot of money to remove them.&lt;ref name="butedock"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yourcardiff.walesonline.co.uk/2012/11/21/masked-squatters-move-into-bute-dock-hotel/ | work=Wales Online | title=Masked squatters move into Bute Dock Hotel | date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week they had left, after the owners took legal action, as it was being used for storage.

==Legality==
[[File:Vacant property for squatters.jpg|thumb|right|A property in [[Oxford]] owned by [[University College, Oxford|University College]] which has been occupied by squatters.]]

===Common law===
{{main|Adverse possession}}
Historically, there is a [[common law]] right (known as "adverse possession") to claim ownership of a dwelling after continual unopposed occupation of land or property for a given period of several years or more, depending on the laws to a particular jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Adverse possession is defined as, "An open, notorious, exclusive and adverse possession for twenty years operates to convey a complete title...not only an interest in the land...but complete dominion over it." [[Sir William Blackstone]] (1759), Commentaries on the Laws of England, Volume 2, page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

UK laws allow for adverse possession claims range after 10 to 12 years, depending on if the land is [[Land registration#United Kingdom|unregistered]]. In practice, adverse possession can be difficult. For example, [[St Agnes Place]] in [[London]] had been occupied for 30 years until 29 November 2005, when [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] evicted the entire street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4481284.stm 'Oldest squat' residents evicted]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of adverse possession was fundamentally altered following the passing of the [[Land Registration Act 2002]]. In effect, after 10 years of actual physical possession, a squatter may apply to the [[HM Land Registry|Land Registry]] to have their title recognised as the owner in [[fee simple]]. However the original titled owner of the property, who will be notified by the Land Registry of the change in ownership, has the right to defeat the application by way of objection.

===Criminal Law Act 1977===
Section 6 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] covers the occupation of property. The Act was implemented to stop [[slum landlord]]s forcibly evicting tenants (as was the case with the notorious London landlord [[Peter Rachman]] in the 1950s-1960s), and made "violence for securing entry" an offence. The law states:
:if "(a) there is someone present on those premises at the time who is opposed to the entry which the violence is intended to secure; and (b) the person using or threatening the violence knows that that is the case."&lt;ref name="Criminal Law Act 1977"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/12 Criminal Law Act 1977]&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not distinguish for this purpose between violence to persons or property (e.g. breaking a door down).

People who squatted in buildings would often put up a "Section 6" legal notice on the front door.&lt;ref&gt;The Section 6 Legal Warning&lt;/ref&gt; The notice stated there were people living in the property who claimed they had a legal right to be there. It warned anyone — even the actual owner of the property — who tried to enter the building without lawful permission that they would be committing an offence.

In September 2012, the law was changed making [[trespass]] in a residential building with the intention of permanently residing a criminal offence. Although a Section 6 warning still applies for non-residential buildings.

===Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994===

The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] introduced section 6.1(A) and other provisions were added, which override this and give the right of entry to "displaced residential occupiers", "protected intending occupiers" (someone who had intended to occupy the property, including some tenants, [[licensee]]s and [[landlord]]s who require the property for use), or someone acting on their behalf. These terms are defined in sections 12 and 12A. Such people may legally enter an occupied property even using force as the usual section 6 provision does not apply to them, and may require "any person who is on [their] premises as a trespasser" to leave. Failure to leave is a criminal offence under section 7 and removal may be enforced by police.

===Civil Procedure Rules===

In 2001, the [[Civil Procedure Rules]] introduced new processes for civil repossession of property and related processes, under section 55. These include a fast track process whereby the legally rightful occupier can obtain an interim possession order (IPO) in a civil court which will enable them to enter the premises at will.  Any unlawful occupiers who refuse to leave after the granting of an IPO is committing a criminal offence&lt;ref name="Criminal Law Act 1977"/&gt; and can then be removed by police. However some of these processes may not be available unless used within 28 days of the time that the claimant knew of the unauthorised occupancy.

Criminal law refers to an "occupier"&lt;ref name="crimlaw1977" /&gt; or "trespasser",&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1977 section 12, and especially 12(3) and 12(6)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Civil Procedure Rules part 55 refer to possession claims against "trespassers".

In March 2011, [[Mike Weatherley]], Conservative MP for [[Hove]], proposed an [[Early Day Motion]] calling for the criminalisation of squatting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-11/1545 Early day motion 1545]&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign was backed by a series of articles in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in which [[Kenneth Clarke]] (the Secretary of Justice) and [[Grant Shapps]] (Minister of Housing) were reported to be backing the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In response, Jenny Jones, Green mayoral candidate for London, said that squatting was an "excellent thing to do".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/politics/article-23939705-squatting-is-an-excellent-thing-to-do-says-green-mayor-candidate.do Squatting is an excellent thing to do, says Green mayoral candidate]&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners relaunched SQUASH (Squatters Action for Secure Homes) with a Parliamentary briefing chaired by [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] MP.

A total of 158 concerned academics, barristers and solicitors specialising in property law published a letter in ''The Guardian'' stating their concerns that "misleading" comments were being made in the mainstream media about squatting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Government opened a consultation entitled 'Options for dealing with squatters' on 13 July 2011, which ran until 5 October. It was "aimed at anyone affected by squatters or has experience of using the current law or procedures to get them evicted."&lt;ref name="consultationamendment"/&gt; The pro-squatting campaign group SQUASH stated that there were "2,217 responses and over 90% of responses argued against taking any action on squatting."&lt;ref name=squash&gt;[http://www.squashcampaign.org/2011/10/campaign-lobbies-against-rush-to-criminalise/ 'Campaign lobbies against rush to criminalise']&lt;/ref&gt; Groups supporting a change in the law included the [[Crown Prosecution Service]], [[Transport for London]] and the [[Property Litigation Association]]. Groups against a change included the [[Metropolitan Police]], squatter networks, [[The Law Society]], homelessness charities and the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]].

Kenneth Clarke then announced an amendment to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill which would criminalise squatting in residential buildings.&lt;ref name=legalaidbill&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/bills-and-acts/bills/legal-aid-and-sentencing-bill.htm 'Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Clarke stated "There are no valid arguments in defence of squatting. It represents the seizure of another's property without consent."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/oct/15/squatting HC Deb 15 October 1991 vol 196 cc151-65]&lt;/ref&gt; John McDonnell commented that "by trying to sneak this amendment through the back door the government are attempting to bypass democracy."&lt;ref name=squash2&gt;[http://www.squashcampaign.org/2011/10/government-bypasses-democracy-to-sneak-through-anti-squatting-laws/ 'Government ‘bypasses democracy’ to sneak through anti-squatting laws']&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment states that "the new offence will be committed where a person is in a residential building as a trespasser having entered it as a trespasser, knows or ought to know that he or she is a trespasser and is living in the building or intends to live there for any period."&lt;ref name="consultationamendment"/&gt;

The change in legislation has been referred to by Mike Weatherley as "Weatherley's Law" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikeweatherleymp.com/2012/04/12/%E2%80%9Cweatherley%E2%80%99s-law%E2%80%9D-soon-to-become-reality/&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force on 1 September 2012, making squatting in a residential building a criminal offence subject to arrest, fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 | work=BBC News | title=Squatting set to become a criminal offence | date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Alex Haigh was the first squatter imprisoned under the new law, receiving a sentence of 3 months after occupying a housing association property in London.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/first-squatter-jailed-new-law | title=First squatter jailed under new law | publisher=The Guardian | date=27 September 2012 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two men were then found guilty of squatting above the Lamb Inn, in [[Romford]].&lt;ref name="romford"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.london24.com/news/court/pair_found_guilty_of_squatting_above_historic_lamb_inn_in_romford_1_1692923 | title=Pair found guilty of squatting above historic Lamb Inn in Romford | publisher=London24 | date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Conservative MPs called for the criminalisation of squatting in commercial buildings as well, due to the perceived increase in the squatting of business properties. These included the following pubs: the Cross Keys in Chelsea, the Tournament in Earls Court (both in London) and the Upper Bell Inn near Chatham, Kent.&lt;ref name="tories"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/30/criminalise-squatting-commercial-property | title=Criminalise squatting in commercial premises, say Tory MPs | publisher=The Guardian | date=30 November 2012 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Bowcott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, a homeless man named Daniel Gauntlett froze to death on the doorstep of an abandoned bungalow, in a case that has been linked with the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Two other squatters were also arrested and had previously had the charges against them dropped completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10375093.Two_Brighton_squat_cases_rejected_in_court/ | title = Two Brighton squat cases rejected in court | date = 24 April 2013 | newspaper = [[Brighton Argus]] | accessdate = 7 November 2013 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14356">Like virtually all other [[voting system|electoral system]]s, in the [[two-round system]], there is potential for both '''tactical voting''' and '''strategic nomination'''.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]] shows that any voting method which does not allow tactical voting must be either dictatorial or non-deterministic (incorporating random elements). A non-deterministic system may not select the same outcome every time it is applied to the same set of ballots, so non-deterministic systems are rarely suggested for public elections.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tactical voting]] is where voters do not vote in accordance with their true preferences, but instead vote insincerely in an attempt to influence the result. Runoff voting is intended as a method that reduces tactical voting, but two tactics called compromising and pushover are still possible in many circumstances. In particular voters are strongly encouraged to compromise by voting for one of the three leading candidates in the first round of an election.

[[Strategic nomination]] is where candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. Runoff is intended to reduce the [[spoiler effect]], but it does not eliminate it. A famous example of the importance of both strategic nomination and tactical voting in runoff voting was the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 French presidential election]].

==Sample election==

For illustrative purposes, the following is a sample election that does not involve any tactical manipulation. Imagine an election to choose which food to eat for dessert. There are 100 people having dessert and three candidates: Ice Cream, Apple Pie and Fruit. Runoff voting is used to find the winner.

'''Round 1:''' In the first round of voting each diner votes for the one candidate they most prefer. The results are as follows:

*Ice Cream: 43 votes
*Apple Pie: 16 votes
*Fruit: 41 votes

'''Round 2:''' No candidate has an absolute majority of votes (in this election that would be 51) so the two candidates with the most votes, Ice Cream and Fruit, proceed to a second round, while Apple Pie is eliminated. Because their favourite candidate has been eliminated Apple Pie supporters must now vote for one of the two remaining candidates. The Apple Pie supporters split into two even groups: 8 vote for Ice Cream and 8 for Fruit. Of those who supported Ice Cream and Fruit in the first round, no one decides to change their vote. The results of the second round are, therefore, as follows:

*Ice Cream: 51
*Fruit: 49

'''Result:''' Ice Cream now has an absolute majority so is declared the winner.

==Tactical voting==

Runoff voting attempts to reduce the potential for tactical voting by eliminating wasted votes. Under the [[plurality voting system|first past the post]] (plurality) system, voters are indirectly encouraged to vote tactically by voting only for one of the two leading candidates, as a vote for any other candidate will not affect the result. Under runoff voting this tactic, known as compromising, is sometimes unnecessary because, even if a voter's favourite candidate is eliminated in the first round, she will still have an opportunity to influence the result of the election by voting for a more popular candidate in the second round. However, the tactic of compromising can still be used in runoff voting because it is sometimes necessary to compromise as a way of influencing which two candidates will survive to the second round.

===Compromise===

Compromising is where a voter gives a first or other preference to a candidate, not because they necessarily support them, but as a way of avoiding the election of a candidate who they dislike even more. The compromising tactic is sometimes effective because runoff voting eliminates many candidates in the first round, and these often include a candidate who might have received an absolute majority of votes had the candidate been permitted to participate in the second round. This creates strong incentives for voters to vote tactically in the first round to ensure that at least one of the two candidates who survives to the second round is acceptable to them. To do this, it is necessary to vote for one of the ''three'' leading candidates in the first round, just as in an election held under the plurality system it is necessary to vote for one of the ''two'' leading candidates.

Whether or not compromising will be an effective tactic depends on the precise candidates and voting patterns present in each election. For example, if there are two very popular centrist candidates standing in the election, such that the outcome of the first round is inevitable, then compromise will be unnecessary.

====Examples====

In Example I above, if Fruit supporters had voted tactically for Apple Pie in the first round then Apple Pie (their second choice) would have been elected instead of Icecream (their last choice). By voting tactically, they ensure that Apple Pie has the opportunity to advance to the second round, Apple Pie is then able to achieve an absolute majority. However in the following election compromising is unnecessary; in the first round 100 voters vote as follows:

*Far-Left candidate: 10
*Centre-Left candidate: 41
*Centre-Right candidate: 40
*Far-Right candidate: 9

If the second preference of Far-Left voters is the Centre-Left candidate, and the second preference of Far-Right voters is the Centre-Right candidate, the result of the second round will be as follows:

*Centre-Left candidate: 51
*Centre-Right candidate: 49

In this election, once the Far-left Candidate is eliminated, the supporters have the opportunity to vote for the Centre-Left candidate in the second round; thus it is unnecessary and ineffective for Far-Left supporters to vote tactically for the Centre-Left candidate. For the same reason, the outcome will not be altered if Far-Right supporters vote tactically in the first round for Centre-Right.

Were the election conducted using the plurality system, compromising would be effective. For example, if Far-Right supporters voted tactically for Centre-Right then he would be elected instead of Centre-Left. To counteract this tactic Far-Left supporters would also have to vote tactically. In this example, therefore, runoff voting removes the potential for tactical voting that would be there under the plurality system.

===Push over===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}

Pushover is a tactic by which voters vote tactically for an unpopular pushover candidate in the first round to help their true favourite candidate win in the second round. The purpose of voting for the pushover is to ensure that it is this weak candidate, rather than a stronger rival, who remains to challenge a voter's preferred candidate in round two. By supporting a pushover candidate, it is hoped to eliminate a stronger candidate who might have won the second round. The pushover tactic requires voters to be able to predict, reliably, how others will vote. It runs the risk of backfiring, as if the tactical voter miscalculates, the candidate intended as a pushover might end up actually beating the voter's preferred candidate in the second round.

===Example===

Imagine an election, like the one at the start of this article, in which there are 100 voters who vote as follows:

*Ice cream: 25 votes
*Apple Pie: 30 votes
*Fruit: 45 votes

No candidate has an absolute majority of votes so Ice cream is eliminated in the first round. Ice cream supporters prefer Apple Pie to Fruit so in the second round they vote for Apple Pie and Apple Pie is the winner. However, if only six Fruit supporters had used the tactic of pushover, they could have changed this outcome and ensured the election of Fruit. These six voters can do this by voting for Ice cream in the first round as a pushover. If they do this then the votes cast in the first round will look like this:

*Ice cream: 31
*Apple Pie: 30
*Fruit: 39

This will mean that Apple Pie is eliminated in the first round instead of Ice cream. This outcome is deliberate. The tactical voters know that Ice cream will be an easier candidate for Fruit to beat in the second round than Apple Pie. In the second round the tactical voters vote for their real first preference, Fruit. Thus, even if only 6 Apple Pie supporters prefer Fruit to Icecream, the result of the second round will be as follows:

*Icecream: 49
*Fruit: 51

Fruit will be elected. The success of this tactic relies on the Fruit supporters being able to predict that Ice cream can be beaten by Fruit in the second round. If a large majority of Apple Pie supporters had voted for Ice cream then the pushover tactic would have backfired, leading to the election of Ice cream, which Fruit partisans like even less than Apple Pie.

==Strategic nomination==
{{main|Strategic nomination}}
Runoff voting can be influenced by strategic nomination; candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. Runoff voting is vulnerable to strategic nomination for the same reasons that it is open to the voting tactic of compromising. This is because it is sometimes necessary for a candidate who knows they are unlikely to win to ensure that another candidate he supports makes it to the second round by withdrawing from the race before the first round occurs, or by never choosing to stand in the first place. By withdrawing candidates a political faction can avoid the [[spoiler effect]], whereby a candidate splits the vote of her supporters and prevents any candidate acceptable to them from surviving to the last round.

Runoff voting's system of two rounds makes it less vulnerable to the spoiler effect than the plurality system. This is because a potential spoiler candidate often has only minor support so that candidate will not take away sufficient support from any candidate likely to win in the second round to prevent the other candidate from surviving to that point. Voters can counteract the effect of vote splitting in the first round, in the two-round system, by using the compromise tactic. The spoiler effect is impossible in the second round because there are only two candidates.

Because it is vulnerable to certain forms of strategic nomination, IRV is said by electoral scientists to fail the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] criterion. This criterion is so strict that it is failed by almost all voting systems, even those that are less susceptible to strategic nomination than runoff voting.

==2002 French presidential election==
{{main|French presidential election, 2002}}
The 2002 French presidential election is a famous example of the importance of both tactical voting and strategic nomination in runoff voting. The three main candidates were [[Jacques Chirac]] of the centre-right, [[Lionel Jospin]] of the centre-left, and the far-right [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]. However there were sixteen candidates in total.

In French presidential elections, the usual outcome is for one candidate of the centre-right and one of the centre-left to proceed to the second round. However, in 2002, the two candidates to advance to the second round were Chirac and Le Pen. Chircac then won the election but the inclusion of Le Pen in the second round was highly controversial, because of what many considered his 'extreme' political views. Le Pen was an unpopular candidate, as testified by the fact that he won only 18% of the vote in the second round. Had Jospin proceeded to the second round, as expect, it would have been a closer contest. In the first round the results were as follows:

'''The right'''

*Jacques Chirac ([[Rally for the Republic]]): '''19.88%'''
*Jean-Marie Le Pen ([[National Front (France)|National Front]]): '''16.86%'''
*[[François Bayrou]] ([[Union for French Democracy]]): 6.84%
*[[Alain Madelin]] ([[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]]): 3.91%
*[[Bruno Mégret]] ([[National Republican Movement]]): 2.34%
*[[Christine Boutin]] (Forum of Social Republicans): 1.19%
*'''Total:''' 51.02%

'''The left'''

*Lionel Jospin ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]): '''16.18%'''
*[[Arlette Laguiller]] ([[Workers' Struggle]]) 5.72%
*[[Noël Mamère]] ([[The Greens (France)|The Greens]]) 5.25%
*[[Olivier Besancenot]] ([[Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire|Revolutionary Communist League]]) 4.25%
*[[Robert Hue]] ([[French Communist Party]]) 3.37%
*[[Christiane Taubira]] ([[Left Radical Party]]) 2.32%
*[[Daniel Gluckstein]] ([[Party of the Workers]]) 0.47%
*'''Total:''' 37.56%

The reason that the left had no candidate in the second round was not a shortage of voters. As can be seen above, more than 37% of voters supported left-wing candidates. The problem was that the left-wing vote was split between seven different candidates. The left could have improved its performance using strategic nomination. If even a small left-wing party had withdrawn its candidate, Jospin might have had enough votes to avoid elimination. On the other hand, even with seven different candidates, left-wing voters could have altered the first round by voting tactically.

If only about 2% more left-wing voters had practiced the tactic of compromise and voted for Jospin rather than their true favourite, then he would have survived elimination. One reason that Jospin was eliminated was that many voters assumed that he would survive to the second round and so felt free to cast a protest vote for a minor candidate, rather than vote tactically. Had Jospin survived, by tactical voting or strategic nomination, it is possible he could have won the second round and beaten Chirac.

A similar situation occurred in [[Louisiana]], which uses a form of runoff voting called the [[run-off primary election]]. In the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1991|1991]], white supremacist [[David Duke]] secured enough votes to be admitted to the second round, in place of the incumbent governor, who would have been expected to survive. In the second round Duke lost to the more moderate [[Edwin Edwards]]. Louisiana uses a form of runoff voting called the [[run-off primary election]].

'''The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium: O'Reilly vs. Stewart 2012''' was a [[debate]] between [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' and [[Jon Stewart]] of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and moderated by [[CNN]] news anchor [[E. D. Hill]]. It took place on October 6, 2012 in [[Washington, D.C.]], starting at 8 pm with most of its audience viewing via [[Internet stream]] and subsequent download.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{Cite news|last=Adams |first=Cindy |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/no_spin_just_fun_for_charity_lDUXOvUgfKPdquZrDnkZfK |title=If you like Bill O’Reilly, read this. Don’t like him, read it anyway |publisher=NYPOST.com |date= September 17, 2012|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', O'Reilly and Stewart "have been guests on each other’s programs since 2001" but "rarely agree on anything except their mutual respect for each other."&lt;ref name=nytblog&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hautman|first=Emmarie|title=Stewart and O’Reilly Share Stage in Political Joust|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/stewart-and-oreilly-share-stage-in-political-joust/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2012|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name of the event evokes the 1974 boxing match [[the Rumble in the Jungle]];&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'': [http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-elections-2012/as-u-s-elections-inch-closer-one-debate-promises-some-comic-relief-1.465425 As U.S. elections inch closer, one debate promises some comic relief].

The format of the debate was broken up into two sections: the first half followed the usual "presidential debate" format, while for the second half, the three took seats closer to the audience and answered questions posted by the audience and viewers on the Internet. While the discussion topics were essentially the same as the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|presidential debate a few days prior]], much of the event was laced with humour: an oft reused gag was the notable height difference between {{height|ft=6|in=4}} O'Reilly and the {{height|ft=5|in=7}} Stewart – to compensate, Stewart had a mechanical riser built into his podium, which he would often use for comic effect.

==Viewing==
Promotional posters had explicitly announced, "It's why [[Al Gore and information technology#1999 CNN interview|Al Gore invented the Internet]]." A live internet stream and downloadable video files were offered for $4.95, with O'Reilly and Stewart donating half of the net profits to a number of charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium – Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.therumble2012.com/f/faq|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the debate was announced, tickets to attend the event live at the [[Lisner Auditorium]] at [[George Washington University]] were sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Auditorium|first=Lisner|url=http://www.lisner.org/eventdetails.asp?id=751|title=GW Lisner Auditorium Box Office|publisher=GW Lisner Auditorium|date=|accessdate=September 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007223518/http://www.lisner.org/eventdetails.asp?id=751|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Technical troubles arose at the start of the debate, preventing thousands of users from being able to watch the event live. The event's Facebook page cited overwhelming demand as the cause. Many were outraged since they sold the online tickets beforehand and were still unprepared. Nox Solutions was cited as the company providing streaming services for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Cirilli|first=Kevin|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82113.html|title=Tech glitch hits Jon Stewart-Bill O’Reilly debate|date=October 6, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: "It may not have been the most important debate of the 2012 presidential election season but it was certainly, so far, the most entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;"Jon Stewart-Bil O'Reilly debate brings the humor" by Carol Memmott and Lindsay Deutsch, ''USA Today'', October 8, 2012, [http://www.ksdk.com/news/article/342131/71/OReilly-Stewart-rumble-debate-brings-the-humor- Retrieved 2012-10-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' wrote of the event: "O'Reilly and Stewart attacked each other's arguments but not their personalities, armed with facts and a fair bit of passion.

At a post-debate press conference, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted that Stewart "resisted attempts to analyze the meaning and influence of the event" and that he had similarly maintained his 2010 "[[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity]]" was purely for entertainment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|title=The Stewart-O’Reilly Debate: An Inside View of a Seriously Hilarious Rumble|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/07/the-stewart-oreilly-debate-an-inside-view-of-a-seriously-hilarious-rumble/|accessdate=October 7, 2012|newspaper=Time|date=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' described The Rumble as "a giant promotion to attract more followers" to ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' on Comedy Central and ''The O’Reilly Factor'' on ''Fox News''" with the potential to serve as [[infotainment]] that would raise civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Terry|first=Allison|title=The Bill O'Reilly-Jon Stewart 'rumble': More than a jab-fest?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/Vox-News/2012/1006/The-Bill-O-Reilly-Jon-Stewart-rumble-More-than-a-jab-fest|accessdate=October 7, 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nicholas Sywak of [[Salon.com]] felt the entertainment value was lacking and that it was "barely worth $4.95, much less a Saturday night."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sywak|first=Nicholas|title=The Rumble 2012: Jon Stewart steamrolls Bill O'Reilly|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/07/the_rumble_2012_jon_stewart_steamrolls_bill_oreilly_in_their_first_on_stage_debate/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Fiji}}

The position of the '''Vice-President of the Republic of Fiji''' was created in 1990, to provide a constitutional successor to the [[President of Fiji|President]] of [[Fiji]], in the event of the latter's death or resignation, or of his otherwise being unable to carry out his duties. The Vice-President's role in government was mostly ceremonial.

==History of the office==
Under the terms the 1990 Constitution of Fiji, the Vice-Presidential office was divided between two persons, styled '''First Vice-President''' and '''Second Vice-President''', respectively, but a single person has held the office of '''Vice-President''' from 1999, when the 1997 Constitution of Fiji came into effect. 

Under the terms of the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]], the Vice-President was appointed by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], after consultation with the [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Fiji Islands#Section 90 Appointment of President and Vice-President|Constitution of Fiji, s.90]]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, however, the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis|Constitution was suspended]], following the [[Great Council of Chiefs#Suspension.2C and projected revival|earlier suspension]] of the Great Council of Chiefs in April 2007. Six days after the suspension of the Constitution, the government issued a decree stating that the Vice-President would henceforth be appointed by the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/uploads/Decree8.pdf ''Office of the Vice-President and Succession Decree''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913161336/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/uploads/Decree8.pdf |date=13 September 2009 }}, 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Ratu [[Epeli Nailatikau]] was appointed Vice-President the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/200904/s2545954.htm "Fiji appoints Ratu Epeli Nailatikau as Vice President"], Radio Australia, 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the [[2013 Constitution of Fiji|2013 Constitution]], the Vice-Presidential office was abolished, with its duties and powers transferred to the [[Chief Justice of Fiji|Chief Justice]].

Being appointees of the all-indigenous Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's Vice-Presidents, like its Presidents, have all been [[Fijians|indigenous Fijians]] ([[ratu|of chiefly rank]]). In 2007, Reverend [[Akuila Yabaki]], Director of the Citizens Constitutional Forum, suggested that "the time may be right now to allow a person from [[Fiji#Ethnic groups|any race]] to take up this position".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110717084308/http://www.radiofiji.com.fj/fullstory.php?id=6925 "Promote multi-racism in Fiji"], Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, 30 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2118">The term '''Year Zero''' ({{lang-km|ឆ្នាំសូន្យ}} ''chhnam saun''), applied to the takeover of [[Cambodia]] in April 1975 by the [[Khmer Rouge]], is an analogy to the [[Year One]] of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]]. During the [[French Revolution]], after the [[Proclamation of the abolition of the monarchy|abolition]] of the [[France|French]] [[monarchy]] (September 20, 1792), the [[French National Convention|National Convention]] instituted a new calendar and declared the beginning of the Year I. The Khmer Rouge [[Fall of Phnom Penh|takeover]] of [[Phnom Penh]] was rapidly followed by a series of drastic revolutionary [[de-industrialization]] policies resulting in a [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|death toll]] that vastly exceeded that of the French [[Reign of Terror]].

== Concept ==
The idea behind Year Zero is that all culture and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch.  All history of a nation or people before Year Zero is deemed largely irrelevant, as it will ideally be purged and replaced from the ground up.

In [[Democratic Kampuchea]], so-called [[New People]]—teachers, artists, and intellectuals—were especially singled out and executed during the purges accompanying Year Zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1978cambodia.html|title=Cambodia: Year Zero|last=Ponchaud|first=François|date=1978|publisher=[[Internet Modern History Sourcebook]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnpilger.com/videos/year-zero-the-silent-death-of-cambodia|title=''Year Zero: The Silent Death of Cambodia'' (Documentary)|last=Pilger|first=John|date=1979|publisher=Associated Television (ATV) (1979) (UK) (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
