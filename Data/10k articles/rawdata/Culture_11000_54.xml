'''''After the Hole''''' (1993) is a [[psychological horror]] novel by [[Guy Burt]]. It won a [[Betty Trask Award]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.societyofauthors.org/betty-trask-past-winners The Betty Trask Prizes and Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 film ''[[The Hole (2001 film)|The Hole]]'' was based on this book.

==Plot summary==
At an English [[independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]], five students – Liz (the narrator of many flash backs), Mike (the protagonist of most of the student's time in the titular "hole"), Alex, Frankie and Geoff – are lured into an abandoned cellar by a malevolent prankster named Martyn.  All is well for the three days, in which they socialise and get to know each other better; but when three days pass and Martyn is nowhere to be seen, the group must face the possibility that they are trapped indefinitely.

Flash forwards of a "dream summer" section punctuate the story, narrated by Liz, reveal that most of them got out of the hole (Liz interacts awkwardly with Alex at one point) and Mike and Liz are now living together while Liz writes a book based on everything that happened within the Hole.   Liz also keeps tapes of interviews with a girl named "Lisa" who talks of her romantic relationship with Martyn.

In the Hole, they become increasingly desperate for food, beginning to face up to the fact that Martyn's experiment was really to play God with all of them.  Mike and Liz meet at night in the small bathroom section and talk a lot.   At one point Mike believes he sees the keyhole of the trapdoor locking them in the Hole "winking" at him, but dismisses this on grounds that he is hallucinating, or so he thinks.

The water supplies go off.  Mike tells Liz his experience with the "winking" keyhole and from this she decides that Martyn must have bugged the main room but not the bathroom area where Mike and Liz have been talking.  Liz formulates a plan to test their theory, by saying how lucky they are to have light, and see if Martyn turns off the electricity.  They then sleep together.

Liz follows through with it, and everything goes to plan.  The electricity goes off. Liz tells the others that a friend of hers knows about the prank and if she doesn't return he will come and rescue them. Everyone rejoices, but Mike is suspicious.

Lisa's story goes on in parallel to this, via the tapes Liz has made of "interviews" she had with Lisa.   On the same day Liz plots this, Lisa goes over to Martyn's house and tries to break up with him.   Martyn barely listens and, in anger, rapes Lisa.  After this, he walks out and supposedly never returns.  Lisa goes into his office, searching for him, and sees the tapes of The Hole.  She realises everything that has gone on and goes to the Hole, rescuing everyone.

At this point, Liz's narrative ends and there is an extremely ambiguous epilogue written by Dr. Phillippa Horwood, who casts the whole of Liz's testimony in doubt by saying that Michael ("Mike") Rollins died on the sixteenth day in the Hole, that Liz was the "sole survivor" and that no records of the infamous Martyn exist, heavily implying that Liz created Martyn to place blame on someone other than herself.  It is also heavily implied – but never actually decided – that Liz and Lisa are the same person.

'''Alcoholism in family systems''' refers to the conditions in families that enable [[alcoholism]], and the effects of alcoholic behavior by one or more family members on the rest of the family. Mental health professionals are increasingly considering alcoholism and [[Substance dependence|addiction]] as diseases that flourish in and are enabled by family systems.&lt;ref name="CRNKOVIC1998"/&gt; Family members react to the alcoholic with particular behavioral patterns. They may enable the addiction to continue by shielding the addict from the negative consequences of their actions. Such behaviors are referred to as [[codependence]]. In this way, the alcoholic is said to suffer from the [[disease model of addiction|disease of addiction]], whereas the family members suffer from the disease of codependence.&lt;ref name="OFARRELL2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CERMAK1989"/&gt; While it is recognized that addiction is a family disease, affecting the entire family system, "the family is often ignored and neglected in the treatment of addictive disease." &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uppers, downers, all arounders : physical and mental effects of psychoactive drugs|last=Darryl.|first=Inaba,|date=2011|publisher=CNS Publications|others=Cohen, William E., 1941–|isbn=9780926544307|edition=7th|location=Ashland, Or.|oclc=747281783}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual member is affected and should receive treatment for their own benefit and healing, but in addition to benefitting the individuals themselves, this also helps to better support the addict/alcoholic in his/her recovery process. "The chances of recovery are greatly reduced unless the co-dependents are willing to accept their role in the addictive process and submit to treatment themselves." &lt;ref&gt;(Gorski, 1993; Liepman, Keller, Botelho, et al., 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; "Co-dependents are mutually dependent on the addict to fulfill some need of their own." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, if the "Chief Enabler" (the main enabler in the family) will often turn a blind eye to the addict's drug/alcohol use as this allows for the enabler to continue to play the victim and/or martyr role, while allowing the addict to continue his/her own destructive behavior. Therefore, "the behavior of each reinforces and maintains the other, while also raising the costs and emotional consequences for both." &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loosening the grip : a handbook of alcohol information|last=1943–|first=Kinney, Jean,|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073404684|edition=10th|location=New York, NY|oclc=696942382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcoholism is one of the leading causes of a [[dysfunctional family]].&lt;ref name="BARNETT2003"/&gt; "About one-fourth of the U.S. population is a member of family that is affected by an addictive disorder in a first-degree relative." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Liepman, Parran, Farkas, et al., 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2001, there were an estimated 26.8 million children of alcoholics (COAs) in the United States, with as many as 11 million of them under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="MULLIGAN2001"/&gt; Children of addicts have an increased suicide rate and on average have total [[health care costs]] 32 percent greater than children of nonalcoholic families.&lt;ref name="MULLIGAN2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DRAKE1990"/&gt;

According to the American Psychiatric Association, physicians stated three criteria to diagnose this disease: (1) physiological problems, such as hand tremors and blackouts, (2) psychological problems, such as excessive desire to drink, and (3) behavioral problems that disrupt social interaction or work performance.&lt;ref name="allpsych.com"/&gt;

Adults from alcoholic families experience higher levels of [[Psychological resistance#State and trait resistance .28situational and characteristic.29|state and trait]] [[anxiety]] and lower levels of [[Murray Bowen#Differentiation of self|differentiation of self]] than adults raised in non-alcoholic families.&lt;ref name="MAYNARD1999"/&gt; Additionally, adult children of alcoholics have lower [[self-esteem]], excessive feelings of responsibility, difficulties reaching out, higher incidence of [[clinical depression|depression]], and increased likelihood of becoming alcoholics.&lt;ref name="CUTTER1987"/&gt;

Parental alcoholism may affect the fetus even before a child is born. In pregnant women, alcohol is carried to all of the mother’s organs and tissues, including the placenta, where it easily crosses through the membrane separating the maternal and fetal blood systems. When a pregnant woman drinks an alcoholic beverage, the concentration of alcohol in her unborn baby’s bloodstream is the same level as her own. A pregnant woman who consumes alcohol during her pregnancy may give birth to a baby with [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] (FAS).&lt;ref name="allpsych.com"/&gt; FAS (fetal alcohol syndrome) is known to produce children with damage to the central nervous system, general growth and facial features. The prevalence of this class of disorder is thought to be between 2–5 per 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1002/ddrr.67| title=Intervention for individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Treatment approaches and case management| last1=Paley| first1=Blair| last2=O'Connor| first2=Mary J.| journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews| date=3 September 2009| volume=15| issue=3| pages=258–267| pmid=19731383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcoholism does not have uniform effects on all families. The levels of dysfunction and resiliency of the non-alcoholic adults are important factors in effects on children in the family. Children of untreated alcoholics score lower on measures of family cohesion, intellectual-cultural orientation, active-recreational orientation, and independence. They have higher levels of conflict within the family, and many experience other family members as distant and non-communicative. In families with untreated alcoholics, the cumulative effect of the family dysfunction may affect the children's ability to grow in developmentally healthy ways.&lt;ref name="MOOS1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Moos | first = R.H. |author2=Billinop, A.B. | title = Children of alcoholics during the recovery process: Alcoholic and matched control families | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–164 | year=1982 | doi = 10.1016/0306-4603(82)90040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WINDLE1997"/&gt;

== Family roles ==
The role of the "Chief Enabler" is typically the spouse, significant other, parent, or eldest child of the alcoholic/addict. This person demonstrates "a strong tendency to avoid any confrontation of the addictive behavior and a subconscious effort to actively perpetuate the addiction." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The "Chief Enabler" also often doubles as the "Responsible One,"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or "Family Hero"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; another role assumed by family members of the alcoholic/addict. Both the "Chief Enabler" and "Responsible One" (aka "Model Child"&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;) will take "over [the alcoholic/addict's] roles and responsibilities." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, a parent might pay for expenses and take over responsibilities (i.e. car payments, the raising of a grandchild, provide room and board, etc.), while a child may provide care for their siblings, become the "peace keeper" in the home, take on all the chores and cooking, etc. A spouse or significant other may overcompensate by providing all the care to the children, being the sole financial contributor to the household, covering up or hiding the addiction from others, etc. This role often receives the most praise from non-family members, causing the individual to struggle to see that it is an unhealthy role which contributes to the addict/alcoholic's disease as well as the family's disfunction.

Another role is that of the "Problem Child" or "Scapegoat." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This person "may be the only [one] clearly seen as having a problem"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; outside of the actual addict/alcoholic. These children (or adult children of the alcoholic(s)) "gets blamed for everything; they have problems at school, exhibit negative behavior, and often develope drug or alcohol problems as a way to act out. Their behavior demands whatever attention is available from parents and siblings."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This often "takes the focus off the parental alcohol problem," and the child can be the "scapegoat" under the myth that his/her behavior fuels the parent's drinking/using.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, this child draws attention from outsiders which may contribute to the recognition of the family alcohol problem by outsiders.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The "Lost Child" role is identified in this system through children that are "withdrawn, 'spaced-out,' and disconnected from the life and emotions around them."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They often avoid  "any emotionally confronting issues, [and so are] unable to form close friendships or intimate bonds with others." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Other children, "trivialize things by minimizing all serious issues as an avoidance strategy [and] are well liked and easy to befriend but are usually superficial in all relationships, including those with their own family members." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These children are known as the "Mascot" or "Family Clown." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Based on the number of children with parents meeting the DSM-V criteria for alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, in 1996 there were an estimated 26.8 million children of alcoholics (COAs) in the United States of which 11 million were under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="EIGEN1996"/&gt; As of 1988, it was estimated that 76 million Americans, about 43% of the U.S. adult population, have been exposed to alcoholism or problem drinking in the family, either having grown up with an alcoholic, having an alcoholic blood relative, or marrying an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="SCHOENBORN1991"/&gt; While growing up, nearly one in five adult Americans (18%) lived with an alcoholic. In 1992, it was estimated that one in eight adult American drinkers were alcoholics or experienced problems as consequences of their alcohol use.&lt;ref name="HARWOOD1998"/&gt;

== Familiality ==
Children of alcoholics (COAs) are more susceptible to alcoholism and other drug abuse than children of non-alcoholics. Children of alcoholics are four times more likely than non-COAs to develop alcoholism. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the development of alcoholism in COAs.&lt;ref name="WINDLE1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ELLIS1997"/&gt;

COAs perceptions of their parents drinking habits influence their own future drinking patterns and are developed at an early age. Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring.&lt;ref name="JACOB1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZUCKER1975"/&gt; Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents.&lt;ref name="ELLIS1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JACOB1997"/&gt; Several factors related to parental alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, negative affect and decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and negative affect correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.&lt;ref name="JACOB1997"/&gt;

After drinking alcohol, sons of alcoholics experience more of the physiological changes associated with pleasurable effects compared with sons of non-alcoholics, although only immediately after drinking.&lt;ref name="FINN1997"/&gt;

Compared with non-alcoholic families, alcoholic families demonstrate poorer problem-solving abilities, both among the parents and within the family as a whole. These communication problems many contribute to the escalation of conflicts in alcoholic families. COAs are more likely than non-COAs to be aggressive, impulsive, and engage in disruptive and sensation seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="JACOB1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SHER1997"/&gt;
Alcohol addiction is a complex disease that results from a variety of genetic, social, and environmental influences. Alcoholism affected approximately 4.65 percent of the U.S. population in 2001–2002, producing severe economic, social, and medical ramifications (Grant 2004). Researchers estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of alcoholism risk is determined by genetics (Goldman and Bergen 1998; McGue 1999).This strong genetic component has sparked numerous linkage and association studies investigating the roles of chromosomal regions and genetic variants in determining alcoholism susceptibility.

== Marital relationships ==
Alcoholism usually has strong negative effects on marital relationships. Separated and divorced men and women were three times as likely as married men and women to say they had been married to an alcoholic or problem drinker. Almost two-thirds of separated and divorced women, and almost half of separated or divorced men under age 46 have been exposed to alcoholism in the family at some time.&lt;ref name="SCHOENBORN1991"/&gt;

Exposure was higher among women (46.2 percent) than among men (38.9 percent) and declined with age. Exposure to alcoholism in the family was strongly related to marital status, independent of age: 55.5 percent of separated or divorced adults had been exposed to alcoholism in some family member, compared with 43.5 percent of married, 38.5 percent of never married, and 35.5 percent of widowed persons. Nearly 38 percent of separated or divorced women had been married to an alcoholic, but only about 12 percent of currently married women were married to an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="SCHOENBORN1991"/&gt;

== Children ==
=== Prevalence of abuse ===
Over one million children yearly are confirmed as victims of [[child abuse]] and [[neglect]] by state child protective service agencies. Substance abuse is one of the two largest problems affecting families in the United States, being a factor in nearly four-fifths of reported cases. Alcoholism is more prevalent among child abusing parents. Alcoholism is more strongly correlated to child abuse than [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other disorders.&lt;ref name="BAVOLEK1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DARO1990"/&gt;

Adoption plays only a slight role in alcoholism in the family. Studies were done comparing children who were born into a family with an alcoholic parent and raised by adoptive (non-alcoholic) parents as compared to children born to non-alcoholic parents and raised by adopted alcoholic parents. The results (in US and Scandinavian studies) were that those adopted children born of an alcoholic parent (and adopted by non-alcoholic parents ) developed alcoholism at higher rates as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/ahrw20-1/18%E2%80%9323.pdf| last1=Cloninger| first1=C. Robert| last2=Sigvardsson| first2=Sören| last3=Bohman| first3=Michael| date=1996| title=Type I and Type II alcoholism: An update| journal=Alcohol Health &amp; Research World| volume=20| issue=1| pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Correlates ===
Children of alcoholics exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety more than children of non-alcoholics. COAs have lower self-esteem than non-COAs from childhood through young adulthood.&lt;ref name="ELLIS1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SHER1991"/&gt; Children of alcoholics show more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and externalizing behavior disorders than non-COAs. Some of these symptoms include crying, lack of friends, fear of going to school, nightmares, perfectionism, hoarding, and excessive self-consciousness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Many children of alcoholics score lower on tests measuring cognitive and verbal skills than non-COAs. Lacking requisite skills to express themselves can impact academic performance, relationships, and [[job interview]]s. The lack of these skills do not, however, imply that COAs are intellectually impaired.&lt;ref name="DREJER1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GABRIELLI1983"/&gt; COAs are also shown to have difficulty with abstraction and conceptual reasoning, both of which play an important role in problem-solving academically and otherwise.&lt;ref name="SCHAEFER1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TARTER1985"/&gt;

In her book ''Adult Children of Alcoholics'', Janet G. Woititz describes numerous traits common among adults who had an alcoholic parent. Although not necessarily universal or comprehensive, these traits constitute an ''adult children of alcoholics syndrome'' (cf. the work of Wayne Kritsberg).

=== Coping Mechanism ===
Suggested practices to mitigate the impact of parental alcoholism on the development of their children include:&lt;ref name="WOLIN1980"/&gt;
* Maintaining healthy family traditions and practices, such as vacations, mealtimes, and holidays
* Encouraging COAs to develop consistent, stable, relationships with significant others outside of the family.
* Planning non-drinking activities to compete with alcoholic behaviour and tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Farrell, T. J. and Fals-Stewart, W. (2003), ALCOHOL ABUSE. Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 29: 121–146. {{doi|10.1111/j.1752-0606.2003.tb00387.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resilience ===

Professor and psychiatric Dieter J. Meyerhoff state that the negative effects of alcohol on the body and on health are undeniable, but we should not forget the most important unit in our society that this is affects the family and the children.  The family is the main institution in which the child should feel safe and have moral values.  If a good starting point is given, it is less likely that when a child becomes an adult, has a mental disorder or is addicted to drugs or alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hdbp.org/psychiatria_danubina/pdf/dnb_vol25_sup2/dnb_vol25_sup2_74.pdf|title=The Impact of Family Environment on the Development of Alcohol Dependence|last1=Bratek|first1=Agnieszka|last2=Beil|first2=Julia|last3=Banach|first3=Monika|last4=Jarząbek|first4=Karolina|last5=Krysta|first5=Krzysztof|journal=Psychiatria Danubina|volume=25|issue=Supplement 2|date=2013|pages=74–77|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) children are in a unique position when their parents abuse alcohol.  The behavior of a parent is the essence of the problem, because such children do not have and do not receive support from their own family.  Seeing changes from happy to angry parents, the children begin to think that they are the reason for these changes.  Self-accusation, guilt, frustration, anger arises because the child is trying to understand why this behavior is occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The impact on children|url=https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/family-marital-problems/#The%20Impact%20on%20Children|website=American Addiction Centers|publisher=Centers, American Addiction|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependence on alcohol has a huge harm in childhood and adolescent psychology in a family environment.   Psychologists Michelle L. Kelley and Keith Klostermann describe the effects of parental alcoholism on children, and describe the development and behavior of these children.   Alcoholic children often face problems such as behavioral disorders, oppression, crime and attention deficit disorder, and there is a higher risk of internal behavior, such as depression and anxiety.  Therefore, they are drinking earlier, drinking alcohol more often and are less likely to grow from moderate to severe alcohol consumption.  Young people with parental abuse and parental violence are likely to live in large crime areas, which may have a negative impact on the quality of schools and increase the impact of violence in the area.  Paternity alcoholism and the general parental verbal and physical spirit of violence witnessed the fears of children and the internalization of symptoms, greater likelihood of child aggression and emotional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaur D, Ajinkya S.|title=Psychological impact of adult alcoholism on spouses and children|journal=Med J DY Patil University|volume=7|issue=2|date=2014|pages=124–7|url=http://www.mjdrdypu.org/text.asp?2014/7/2/124/126309|accessdate=15 November 2017|doi=10.4103/0975-2870.126309}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research on alcoholism within families has leaned towards exploring issues that are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research as Resistance: Revisiting Critical, Indigenous, and Anti-Oppressive Approaches|last=Brown, Strega|first=Leslie, Susan|publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-1551308821|location=Toronto|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members to identify with the positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amodeo|first=Maryann|last2=Griffin|first2=Margaret|last3=Paris|first3=Ruth|title=Women's Reports of Negative, Neutral, and Positive Effects of Growing Up With Alcoholic Parents|journal=Families in Society: The Journal of Contemporary Social Services|volume=92|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.4062|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18-year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werner|first=E E|date=2015-01-04|title=Resilient offspring of alcoholics: a longitudinal study from birth to age 18|journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=34–40|doi=10.15288/jsa.1986.47.34|pmid=3959559}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that there was no significant difference between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.

Due to the flawed research that has been conducted in the past, many stereotypes have followed ACOAs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Deborah M.|last2=Heppner|first2=P. Paul|title=Examining the well-being of nonclinical college students: Is knowledge of the presence of parental alcoholism useful?|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=324–334|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.40.3.324|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACOAs have been identified as having a variety of emotional and behavioral problems, such as sleep problems, aggression and lowered self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  When it comes to being a COA or ACOA, there is still hope. Results showed that a supportive and loving relationship with one of the parents can counterbalance the possible negative effects of the relationship with the alcoholic parent. When there is one alcoholic parent in the household, it helps if the child relies on other family members for support. It may be the second parent, siblings or members of the extended family. Having other supportive family members can help the child feel like s/he is not alone.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Richard P.|last2=Jacob|first2=Theodore|date=1997-01-01|title=Parent-child interactions and child outcomes as related to gender of alcoholic parent|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089932899790016X|journal=Journal of Substance Abuse|volume=9|pages=189–208|doi=10.1016/S0899-3289(97)90016-X|pmid=9494949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger generations of ACOAs scored more positively, in terms of coping mechanisms. This may be due to fact that alcoholism is seen more as an illness nowadays, rather than a moral defect. There has been less victim blaming of alcoholism on parent’s, because it has now been declared a disease rather than a behavioral problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies show that when ACOAs use positive coping mechanisms, it is related to more positive results. When an ACOA approaches their issues, rather than avoids them, it often relates to having a positive outlook.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Studies have shown that ACOAs and COAs have more compulsive behaviors that may cause the need for higher achievement.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harter|first=Stephanie Lewis|date=2000-04-01|title=Psychosocial adjustment of adult children of alcoholics: A review of the recent empirical literature|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735898000841|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=20|issue=3|pages=311–337|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(98)00084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ACOAs have shown that the only way to survive is to fend for themselves. This causes a sense of independence that helps them become more self-reliant. Because they perceive that independence and hard work as necessary, ACOAs develop a sense of survival instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gandara|first=Patricia|date=1994-05-16|title=Choosing Higher Education: Educationally Ambitious Chicanos and the Path to Social Mobility|url=http://epaa.asu.edu/ojs/article/view/671|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|language=en|volume=2|pages=8|doi=10.14507/epaa.v2n8.1994|issn=1068-2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications for Counselors ===
Counselors serving ACOAs need to be careful to not assume that the client’s presenting problems are due solely to the parent’s alcoholism. Exploring the ACOAs life events, such as the number of alcoholic parents, length of time the client lived with the alcoholic parent, past interventions, and the role of extended family may help in determining what the correct method of intervention may be.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Many factors can affect marital and/or parenting difficulties, but there has not been any evidence found that can link these issues specifically to ACOAs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Research has been conducted to try to identify issues that arise when someone is a COA. It has been hard to isolate these issues solely to the fact that the child’s parents are alcoholics. Other behaviors need to be studied, like dysfunctional family relationships, childhood abuse and other childhood stressors and how they may contribute to things like depression, anxiety and bad relationships in ACOAs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Counselors serving ACOAs can also help by working on building coping mechanisms such as creating meaningful relationships with other non-alcoholic family members. Having other family members who are supportive can help the ACOA feel like they are not alone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Counselors can also provide some psycho-education on alcoholism and its effects on family members of alcoholics. Research shows that ACOAs feel less like blaming their parents for their alcoholism after learning that alcoholism is a disease, rather than a behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pregnancy ==
Prenatal alcohol-related effects can occur with moderate levels of alcohol consumption by non-alcoholic and alcoholic women. Cognitive performance in infants and children is not as impacted by mothers who stopped alcohol consumption early in pregnancy, even if it was resumed after giving birth.&lt;ref name="JACOBSON1997"/&gt;

An analysis of six-year-olds with alcohol exposure during the second-trimester of pregnancy showed lower academic performance and problems with reading, spelling, and mathematical skills. 6% of offspring from alcoholic mothers have [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] (FAS). The risk an offspring born to an alcoholic mothers having FAS increases from 6% to 70% if the mother's previous child had FAS.&lt;ref name="LARKBY1997"/&gt;

People diagnosed with FAS have [[IQ]]s ranging from 20–105 (with a mean of 68), and demonstrate poor concentration and attention skills. FAS causes growth deficits, morphological abnormalities, [[mental retardation]], and behavioral difficulties. Among adolescents and adults, those with FAS are more likely to have mental health problems, dropping out or be suspended from schools, problems with the law, require assisted living as an adult, and problems with maintaining employment.&lt;ref name="LARKBY1997"/&gt;

An '''aphorism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφορισμός: ''aphorismos'', denoting "delimitation", "distinction", and "definition") is a concise, terse, [[laconic]], and/or memorable expression of a general truth or principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aphorism Definition of ''Aphorism''] from the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are often handed down by [[tradition]] from generation to generation. The concept is distinct from those of an [[adage]], [[brocard (law)|brocard]], [[chiasmus]], [[epigram]], maxim ([[legal maxim|legal]] or [[maxim (philosophy)|philosophical]]), [[principle]], [[proverb]], and [[saying]]; some of these concepts are species of aphorism.

==History==
The word was first used in the ''[[s:Aphorisms|Aphorisms]]'' of [[Hippocrates]], a long series of [[proposition]]s concerning the symptoms and diagnosis of [[disease]] and the art of healing and [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aphorism|volume=2|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The often cited first sentence of this work (see [[Ars longa, vita brevis]]) is:
{{quote|Life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experience deceptive, judgment difficult.}}

This aphorism was later applied or adapted to physical science and then morphed into multifarious aphorisms of philosophy, morality, and literature. Presently an aphorism is generally understood to be a concise and [[eloquence|eloquent]] statement of [[truth]].

Aphorisms are distinct from [[axiom]]s. Aphorisms generally originate from experience and [[Norm (social)|custom]], whereas axioms are self-evident truths and therefore require no additional proof. Aphorisms have been especially used in subjects to which no methodical or scientific treatment was originally applied, such as [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[jurisprudence]] and [[politics]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A famous example is:

{{quote|Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. |[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]}}

==Literature==
Aphoristic collections, sometimes known as [[wisdom literature]], have a prominent place in the canons of several ancient societies, such as the [[Sutra]] literature of [[India]], the [[bible|Biblical]] [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Islam]]ic [[hadith]]s, [[the golden verses of Pythagoras]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''Works and Days'', the Delphic maxims, and [[Epictetus]]' Handbook.  Aphoristic collections also make up an important part of the work of some modern authors. A 1559 oil–on–oak-panel painting, ''[[Netherlandish Proverbs]]'' (also called ''The Blue Cloak'' or ''The Topsy Turvy World'') by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], artfully depicts a land populated with literal renditions of Flemish aphorisms ([[proverb]]s) of the day.

The first noted published collection of aphorisms is ''[[Adagia]]'' by [[Erasmus]]. Other important early aphorists were [[Baltasar Gracián]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].

Two influential collections of aphorisms published in the twentieth century were ''The Uncombed Thoughts'' by [[Stanisław Jerzy Lec]] (in Polish), and ''Itch of Wisdom'' by [[Mikhail Turovsky]] (in Russian and English).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Заголовок: |url=http://www.peoples.ru/art/painter/turovskiy/ |script-title=ru:ЗАЛОЖНИК ВЕЧНОСТИ Михаил Туровский/ЗАЛОЖНИК ВЕЧНОСТИ Михаил Туровский |publisher=Peoples.ru |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2013-10-15|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
Many societies have traditional sages or [[culture hero]]es to whom aphorisms are commonly attributed, such as the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], [[Confucius]] or [[King Solomon]].

Misquoted or misadvised aphorisms are frequently used as a source of humour; for instance, wordplays of aphorisms appear in the works of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Douglas Adams]]. Aphorisms being misquoted by sports players, coaches, and commentators form the basis of [[Private Eye]]'s [[Colemanballs]] section.

[[File:AthenaeumMadonnaLoreto-CorridoioCuneo.jpg|thumb|Excavations of the Athenaeum: View of the corridor between the central and the south hall.]]
The '''Athenaeum''' was   a school (''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]]'') founded by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] in [[Rome]], for the promotion of literary and scientific studies (ingenuarum artium) and called Athenaeum from the town of [[Athens]], which was still regarded as the seat of intellectual refinement. The Athenaeum was situated near the [[Capitoline Hill]]: its site was discovered in 2009 during excavation for the construction of the [[Rome Metro C Line]], in the middle of what is now [[Piazza Venezia]].

A staff of professors, for the various branches of study, was regularly engaged. Under [[Theodosius II]], for example, there were three orators, ten grammarians, five sophists, one philosopher, two lawyers, or jurisconsults. Besides the instruction given by these magistri, poets, orators, and critics were accustomed to recite their compositions there, and these prelections were sometimes honoured with the presence of the emperors themselves. There were other places where such recitations were made, as the [[Library of Trajan]]; sometimes also a room was hired, and made into an auditorium.

The Athenaeum seems to have continued in high repute till the sixth century. Little is known of the details of study or discipline in the Athenaeum, but in the constitution of the year 370, there are some regulations respecting students in Rome, from which it would appear that it must have been a very extensive and important institution. And this is confirmed by other statements contained in some of the Fathers and other ancient authors, from which we learn that young men from all parts, after finishing their usual school and college studies in their own town or province, used to resort to Rome as a sort of higher university, for the purpose of completing their education.

After the moving of the capital city to [[Milan]] and [[Constantinople]] similar schools were opened also in these cities, as well as in the other main cities of the Empire, like [[Carthage]].

In the modern period, the term "[[Athenaeum (disambiguation)|Athenaeum]]" is widely used in various countries for schools, libraries, museums, cultural centers, performance halls and theaters, periodicals, clubs and societies - all aspiring to fulfill a cultural function similar to that of the ancient Roman school.

'''''Before We Forget''''' is a 2011 observational [[documentary film]] about two women with [[dementia]], who live in an Asian society where terminal illnesses and dying remain taboo. It is directed by Singaporean first-time filmmakers [[Jeremy Boo]] and [[Lee Xian Jie]], who have also started an online platform that encourages people in Asia to share their experiences about dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_707904.html |title='Before We Forget' web project puts spotlight on dementia |publisher=The Straits Times |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother, Celine Fernandez, who has had [[Alzheimer's Disease]] for 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rdasia.com/before-we-forget |title=Before We Forget - Reader's Digest Asia (October 2011) |publisher=Rdasia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Celine suffers a mild [[stroke]] and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together, especially after Celine loses all of what little speech and she originally had. The duo, staunch [[Catholics]], keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer.

The documentary also captures frank interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and [[atheist]], with strong views about death in the face of [[terminal illness]]. She is first filmed after being diagnosed with [[mild cognitive impairment]], likely due to [[systemic fibrosis]], an [[autoimmune disorder]] which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, [[vascular dementia]] causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beforeweforget.org/your-stories/2011/05/rewriting-obituary/ |title=Rewriting the obituary |publisher=Beforeweforget.org |date=2011-05-23 |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simone Forti.jpg|thumb|[[Simone Forti]] at Beyond Baroque]]
'''Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center''' is a literary [[arts center]] located at 681 [[Venice Boulevard]], [[Venice, Los Angeles]], [[California]], founded in 1968.&lt;ref name="beyondbaroque.org"&gt;http://beyondbaroque.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
George Drury Smith started publishing the magazine ''Beyond Baroque'' in 1968 from a storefront in Venice, which soon became a meeting place with workshops and space for readings, art, and music. Although 10,000 copies of the first issue were printed offset, subsequent issues were printed in-house using a [[four-color process]]. Later the magazines were printed on bound newsprint and distributed free. The workshops, over the years, have generated numerous writers, presses, and some of the leading poets in Los Angeles.  The facilitators have included founders [[Joseph Hansen (writer)|Joseph Hansen]] and [[John Harris (American poet)|John Harris]], [[Leland Hickman]], [[Bob Flanagan]], [[John Thomas Idlet|John Thomas]], [[Will Alexander (poet)|Will Alexander]], [[Jeff McDaniel]], [[Philomene Long]], [[Simone Forti]], [[Sarah Maclay]], [http://lizgonzalez.com/ liz gonzalez], and others. The Center’s first librarian was [[Exene Cervenka]] of the "[[X (U.S. band)|X]]", which was formed when Exene and [[John Doe (musician)|John Doe]] met at the Wednesday Night Poetry Workshop. Some of the LA artist [[Mike Kelley’s]] first performances were at the Center, and the cover of one of the Center’s early issues of ''Beyond Baroque'', featuring an array of experimental filmmakers, was displayed in the Pompidou’s 2006 show on LA art. The Center's reading series, featuring over 200 writers a year, has included such names as [[John Ashbery]]; [[Amiri Baraka]]; [[Raymond Carver]]; [[Gerald Casale|Jerry Casale]] from the band [[Devo]]; [[Wanda Coleman]]; [[Ed Dorn]]; [[Allen Ginsberg]]; [[Leland Hickman]]; [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]]; [[Lewis MacAdams]]; [[Viggo Mortensen]]; [[Harry Northup]], original member of the Wednesday night poetry workshop; [[Alice Notley]]; [[Graeme Revell]], from the band [[SPK (band)|SPK]]; [[Patti Smith]]; [[James Tate (writer)|James Tate]]; [[V Vale]], who formed a tabloid format zine focusing on various counterculture and underground topics named RE/Search Publications documenting [[punk subculture]]; and [[CK Williams]], among thousands of others both famous and infamous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freevenicebeachhead.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/beyond-baroque-venice%E2%80%99s-unique-poetry-center/ Beyond Baroque, Venice’s Unique Poetry Center By Harry E. Northup]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Baroque archives and sells chapbooks, [[small press]] poetry and experimental fiction. An index of the chapbook archive is online. Center series include experimental music, film screenings, and visual art, including the [[Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival]]. Beyond Baroque has facilitated or organized festivals, including the citywide [[World Beyond Festivals]], with the World Stage and other LA organizations, and the Beyond Text Festivals, with [[LACMA]] and others. Its yearly event with the [[LA Poetry Festival]], the ''Younger Poets'', has consistently presented the best emerging voices from around the Los Angeles region at the Downtown Central Library In addition to on-site work, the Center has curated and organized permanent public art projects highlighting Los Angeles poets, including the Poetry Walls on the Venice Boardwalk and the lobby of the Junipero Serra State Office Building downtown.

Publications that have come out of the Center, some originally through its typesetting facilities, include [[Momentum Press]], edited by [[Bill Mohr]]; ''Little Caesar'', edited by programs curator [[Dennis Cooper]]; a series edited by [[David Trinidad]]; the magazine ''[[FOREHEAD]]'', edited by [[Benjamin Weissman]]; a readings curator; and more. The Center’s imprint was launched in 1998 by Fred Dewey and has published fourteen books, including works by [[Nancy Agabian]], [[Ammiel Alcalay]], [[April Durham]], [[Simone Forti]], [[Benjamin Hollander]], [[Philomene Long]], [[K. Curtis Lyle]], [[Olive Martin]], [[Majid Naficy]], and [[Eve Wood]],  along with anthologies from both the Wednesday Workshop, the World Stage, and several magazines featuring challenging writing and art from around the country and the world, including the recent ''TRUTH ETC'', with works by [[Ammiel Alcalay]], [[Wanda Coleman]], [[Christoph Dreager]], [[Sesshu Foster]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Jack Hirschman]], [[Yan Li (writer)|Yan Li]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.wmingart.com/www_wmingart_com/Yan_Li_CV_090916.pdf |title=Yan Li |website=wmingart.com |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Meltzer]], [[Diane di Prima]], and more.

The Center’s staff and board have historically included writers and artists, from the organization's founding by Smith, an experimental fiction writer, in 1968, through key programming figures, including [[Dennis Cooper]], [[Manazar Gamboa]], [[Amy Gerstler]], [[Dennis Philips]], [[Benjamin Weissman]], Tosh Berman and the current director, [[Richard Modiano]].

The Center is based near the beach in Los Angeles’s old Venice City Hall, built in 1906. It offers an extensive program of public readings, free workshops, a project room, bookstore, publications, and chapbook/small press archive.&lt;ref name="beyondbaroque.org" /&gt;

== Beyond Baroque Books ==
The Center launched its own imprint, Beyond Baroque Books, in 1998, dedicated to emerging, overlooked, out of print, and experimental writing, as well as the history and legacy of experimental and alternative writing, poetry, and the arts in Los Angeles.

'''Bon pour l'Orient''' (good enough for the [[Orient]]) is a [[French language|French]] condescending term that refers to the stamps affixed in the 19th century to the diplomas of students coming from [[Colony|colonial]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territories. These students were subjected to a less intensive level of education in [[Western world|Western]] educational institutions and obtained degrees which despite being useless in Europe, were deemed good enough to secure employment in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reporting the Middle East: The Practice of News in the Twenty-First Century|last=Harb|first=Zahera|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2017|isbn=1786721767|location=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern use, the phrase pejoratively describes practices which although unacceptable in advanced Western countries, might be thought appropriate for less developed countries.

A '''Cache-cœur''' ([[French language|French]] for "hide the heart") is a [[top (clothing)|top]] for women, composed of two finished triangular parts, each having a strap.  It is closed by overlapping the two segments and tying the straps behind the back or along the side, depending on the length.  The triangular shape of the sides makes the garment a type of V-neck.

Until the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] is inserted an arch has no strength and needs the centring to keep the [[voussoir]]s in their correct relative positions. A simple centering without a truss is called a '''common centering'''.&lt;ref name="Century"/&gt; A cross piece connecting centering frames is called a lag or bolst.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, Frank (1995). ''A visual dictionary of architecture''. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold. p. 3. {{ISBN|0471284513}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centring is normally made of [[wood]] timbers, which was a relatively straightforward structure in a simple arch or vault, but with more complex shapes, involving double curvature, such as a small [[dome]] or the bottle-shaped [[Chimney|flues]] of the kitchens of some [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-period houses; [[clay]] or [[sand]] bound by a weak [[Calcium hydroxide|lime]] [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] mix could be used. The shaping of this sort of centring would probably be done by eye, perhaps with the help of a template and the [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[brick]] structure laid against it. On bigger work, like a 19th-century commercial [[pottery]] [[kiln]], this was impractical. The structure would be built round a post acting as a datum, and each course of stonework would be set at a distance from the datum as measured by a stick or string.

On completion of the intended structure, the centring of whichever sort is removed called "...''striking the centering''...",&lt;ref name="Century" /&gt; and work on pointing and other finishing continued.

[[history of art|Art historians]] and [[philosophy of art|philosophers of art]] have long had '''classificatory disputes about art''' regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as [[art]]. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today.&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics of the Media By [[Winfried Nöth]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Zk_Meiva7MC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;lpg=PA621&amp;dq=%22fine+art%22+%22art+objects%22+semiotics&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Syp47RdWZg&amp;sig=D-Tio3vfK-UkLs2s2DJzHHGCoDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of art==
[[File:Wanluan Thatched Hall by Dong Qichang.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Dong Qichang]], ''Landscape'' 1597. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] civil servant, painting imaginary landscapes in the Chinese tradition of [[literati painting]], with collector's seals and poems.]]
Defining art can be difficult. [[Aesthetics|Aestheticians]] and art philosophers often engage in disputes about how to define art. By its original and broadest definition, '''''art''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning "skill" or "[[craft]]") is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge, most often using a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as "[[liberal arts]]" and "[[martial arts]]". However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence after 1750, “art” is commonly understood to be skill used to produce an [[aesthetic]] result (Hatcher, 1999).

Britannica Online defines it as "the use of skill or imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others".&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; But how best to define the term “art” today is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art” (Davies, 1991 and Carroll, 2000). [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.” It is not clear who has the right to define art. Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each other's.

The second, more narrow, more recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or “[[fine art]].” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities. Often, if the skill is being used to create objects with a practical use, rather than paintings or sculpture with no practical function other than as an [[Work of art|artwork]], it will be considered it as falling under classifications such as the [[decorative arts]], [[applied art]] and [[craft]] rather than fine art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it will be considered [[design]] instead of art. Some thinkers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference (Novitz, 1992). The modern distinction does not work well for older periods, such as [[medieval art]], where the most highly regarded art media at the time were often [[metalwork]], [[engraved gems]], [[textiles]] and other "applied arts", and the perceived value of artworks often reflected the cost of the materials and sheer amount of time spent creating the work at least as much as the creative input of the artist.

==Theories of art classification==
===Historical systematic classifications===
In the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China, excellence in the ''liù yì'' (六藝), or "[[Six Arts]]", was expected of the ''junzi'' (君子), or "perfect gentleman", as defined by philosophers like [[Confucius]]. Because these arts spanned both the [[Civil service#China|civil]] and [[Military history of China before 1911|military]] aspects of life, excelling in all six required a scholar to be very well-rounded and [[polymath]]ic. The Six Arts were as follows:

* [[Confucianism#Rite and centring|Rites]] (禮)
* [[Music of China|Music]] (樂)
* [[Archery]] (射)
* [[Chariot]]eering and [[equestrianism]] (御)
* [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] (書)
* [[Chinese mathematics|Mathematics]] (數) 

Later in the history of imperial China, the Six Arts were pared down, creating a similar system of [[Four Arts]] for the [[scholar-official]] [[caste]] to learn and follow:

* ''[[Guqin|Qín]]'' (琴), an instrument representing music
* ''[[Go (game)|Qí]]'' (棋), a board game representing military strategy
* ''Shū'' (書), or [[Chinese calligraphy]], representing literacy
* ''Huà'' (畫), or [[Chinese painting]], representing the visual arts

Another attempt to systematically define art as a grouping of disciplines in antiquity is represented by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Muses]]. Each of the standard nine Muses symbolized and embodied one of nine branches of what the Greeks called ''[[techne]]'', a term which roughly means "art" but has also been translated as "craft" or "craftsmanship", and the definition of the word also included more scientific disciplines. These nine traditional branches were:
* [[Epic poetry]], embodied by [[Calliope]]
* [[History]], embodied by [[Clio]]
* [[Music]] and [[lyric poetry]], embodied by [[Euterpe]]
* [[Love poetry]], embodied by [[Erato]]
* [[Tragedy]], embodied by [[Melpomene]]
* [[Hymns]] and [[pantomime]], embodied by [[Polyhymnia]]
* [[Dance]] and [[Greek chorus|chorus]], embodied by [[Terpsichore]]
* [[Comedy]] and [[idyll|idyllic poetry]], embodied by [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]]
* [[Astronomy]], embodied by [[Urania]]

In [[Christendom#Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]], [[Medieval university|universities]] taught a standard set of seven [[liberal arts]], defined by early medieval philosophers such as [[Boethius]] and [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York]] and as such centered around philosophy. The definitions of these subjects and their practice was heavily based on the educational system of Greece and Rome. These seven arts were themselves split into two categories:
* the [[Trivium]], considered the foundation of knowledge, and comprising the three basic elements of philosophy: [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]];
* and the [[Quadrivium]], comprising [[music]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]].

At this time, and continuing after the [[Renaissance]], the word "art" in English and its cognates in other languages had not yet attained their modern meaning. One of the first philosophers to discuss art in the framework we understand today was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who described in his ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'' a ranking of the five major arts from most material to most expressive:
#[[architecture]]
#[[sculpture]]
#[[painting]]
#[[music]]
#[[poetry]]

Hegel's listing of the arts caught on particularly in France, and with continual modifications the list has remained relevant and a subject of debate in French culture into the 21st century. This classification was popularized by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], an early scholar of film who wrote "Manifesto of the Seventh Art" in 1923. The epithets given to each discipline by its placement of the list are often used to refer to them through paraphrase, particularly with calling film "the seventh art". The French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] often participates in the decision making for defining a "new" art.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html "For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ten arts are generally given as follows:
#''le premier art:'' [[architecture]]
#''le deuxième art:'' [[sculpture]]
#''le troisième art:'' [[painting]]
#''le quatrième art:'' [[music]]
#''le cinquième art:'' [[literature]], including [[poetry]] and [[prose]]
#''le sixième art:'' the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]] and [[theatre]]
#''le septième art:'' film and cinema
#''le huitième art: "les arts médiatiques",'' including [[radio]], [[television]], and [[photography]]
#''le neuvième art:'' [[comics]]
#''le dixième art:'' [[video games]], or digital art forms more generally&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154034/http://big-presse.com/big-article-Art-1707.php "Connaissez-vous le 10eme art ? L'art numérique."], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing dispute over what should constitute the next form of art has been fought for over a century. Currently, there are a variety of contenders for ''le onzième art'', many of which are older disciplines whose practitioners feel that their medium is underappreciated as art. One particularly popular contender for the 11th is [[multimedia]], which is intended to bring together the ten arts just as Canudo argued that cinema was the culmination of the first six arts. [[Performance art]], as separate from the performing arts, has been called ''le douzième'', or "twelfth", art.&lt;ref&gt;Mas, Jean. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MreyR7VhSh0 ''Manifeste de la Performance''], AICA-France/Villa Arson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalized definitions of art===
The traditional Western classifications since the Renaissance have been variants of the [[hierarchy of genres]] based on the degree to which the work displays the imaginative input of the artist, using artistic theory that goes back to the ancient world. Such thinking received something of a boost with the [[aesthetics]] of [[Romanticism]]. A similar theoretical framework applied in traditional [[Chinese art]]; for example in both the Western and Far Eastern traditions of [[landscape painting]] (see [[literati painting]]), ''imaginary'' landscapes were accorded a higher status than realistic depictions of an actual landscape view - in the West relegated to "[[topographical view]]s".

Many have argued that it is a mistake to even try to define art or beauty, that they have no essence, and so can have no definition. Often, it is said that art is a cluster of related concepts rather than a single concept. Examples of this approach include Morris Weitz and Berys Gaut.

[[Image:Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]] exhibited wooden sculptures of [[Brillo|Brillo Boxes]] as art.]]
Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums, and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This [[institutional theory of art]] has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider a store-bought [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or a sculptural depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it, art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For [[John Dewey]], for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem.

[[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Functionalists, like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context. For instance, the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure).

==Disputes about classifying art==
Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreements about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem, rather that “the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life” are “so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art” (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about our values and where we are trying to go with our society than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]]’s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst’s and Emin’s work.

On the other hand, [[Thierry de Duve]]&lt;ref&gt;Thierry de Duve, ''Kant After Duchamp''. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; argues that disputes about the definition of art are a necessary consequence of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s presentation of a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] as a work of art. In his 1996 book ''Kant After Duchamp'' he reinterprets Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' exchanging the phrase "this is beautiful" with "this is art", using Kantian aesthetics to address post-Duchampian art.

===Conceptual art===
{{main article|Conceptual art}}

The work of the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] from the 1910s and 1920s paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works (the [[readymade]]s, for instance) that defied previous categorisations. Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s. The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Douglas Huebler]].

More recently, the “[[Young British Artists]]” (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work is seen as conceptual, even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a conceptual artist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression.

====Recent examples of disputed conceptual art====
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using young girls to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2002: [[Miltos Manetas]] confronts the Whitney Biennial with his Whitneybiennial.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1F31F937A35750C0A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew | last=Mirapaul | title=ARTS ONLINE; If You Can't Join 'Em, You Can Always Tweak 'Em | date=4 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in the UK====
[[Image:Stuckist International Gallery 2003 (shark 1).jpg|thumb|''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', [[Stuckism International Gallery]], 2003]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002, in a [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstration]], deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004. Retrieved from findarticles.com, 7 April 2008.{{Dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/WhiteCube.html "White Cube demo 2002"] stuckism.com. Retrieved 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] exhibited a preserved shark under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', clearly referencing the Damien Hirst work (see disputes above).&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1128824.ece "Traditionalists mark shark attack on Hirst"], ''[[The Times]]'', 10 April 2003. Retrieved 6 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC2 ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme on 19 October 1999 hosted by [[Jeremy Paxman]] with Charles Thomson attacking that year's Turner Prize and artist [[Brad Lochore]] defending it, Thomson was displaying Stuckist paintings, while Lochore had brought along a plastic detergent bottle on a cardboard plinth. At one stage Lochore states, "if people say it's art, it's art". Paxman asks, "So you can say anything is art?" and Lochore replies, "You could say everything is art..." At this point Thomson, off-screen, can be heard to say, "Is my shoe art?" while at the same time his shoe appears in front of Lochore, who observes, "If you say it is. I have to judge it on those terms." Thomson's response is, "I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life before."&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Frank, ed. ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'', pp.32-48, [[National Museums Liverpool]] 2004, {{ISBN|1-902700-27-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]], an art school graduate, denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3585205/The-entries-are-tat.-Theyre-made-badly.-Theyre-just-very-boring-and-very-thin.html ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1473165/Saatchi%27s-latest-shock-for-the-art-world-is---painting.html "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA ([[Young British Artists]]) collection.

===Computer and video games===
{{main article|Video games as an art form}}
Computer games date back as far as 1947, although they did not reach much of an audience until the 1970s. It would be difficult and odd to deny that computer and video games include many kinds of art (bearing in mind, of course, that the concept "art" itself is, as indicated, open to a variety of definitions). The graphics of a video game constitute [[digital art]], [[graphic art]], and probably [[video art]]; the original soundtrack of a video game clearly constitutes [[music]]. However it is a point of debate whether the video game as a whole should be considered a piece of art of some kind, perhaps a form of [[interactive art]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], for example, has gone on record claiming that video games are not art, and for structural reasons will always be inferior to cinema, but then, he admits his lack of knowledge in the area when he affirmed that he "will never play a game when there is a good book to be read or a good movie to be watched.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&amp;date=20051127 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Why did the chicken cross the genders? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125645/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman&amp;date=20051127 |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] has argued that playing a videogame is not art, but games do have artistic style and incorporate art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title= Official PlayStation Magazine (US) |journal= |volume= Feb 2006 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050011/http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723020624/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6350406 A videogame is not art!]&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer Chris Crawford argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Crawford, ''The Art of Computer Game Design'' 1982 mirrored with permission at [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Esquire columnist Chuck Klosterman also argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Klosterman “The Lester Bangs of Video Games” ''Esquire'' July 2006 at [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a797/esq0706kloster-66/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tadhg Kelly argues that play itself is not art and that fun is a constant required for all games &lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/09/fun-simple-to-explain-hard-to-accept.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Fun: Simple to Explain, Hard to Accept'', 2011, at]&lt;/ref&gt; so the art in games is the art of location and place rather than interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/11/living-galleries-games-are-art.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Living Galleries'', 2011 at]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyneweard of Laughern''' or simply '''Cyneweard''' (died 1079 x 1086) was a mid-11th century [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[thegn]] and [[High Sheriff of Worcestershire|sheriff]] in [[Worcestershire]], England. Probably the son of Æthelric Kiu and grand-nephew of [[Wulfstan Lupus]], [[List of Archbishops of York|Archbishop of York]] (1003&amp;ndash;1023), he was one of the leading nobles of the county at the [[Norman Conquest of England]]. On the death of [[Edward the Confessor]] he held lands in [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]] as well as Worcestershire.

A [[vassal]] of the [[bishop of Worcester|bishops of Worcester]], he was sheriff in the county until 1069. He lost this after the arrival of [[Urse d'Abetot]], and it was Urse and his brother [[Robert Despenser]] who deprived Cyneweard and his family of many of their holdings in the region. Cyneweard's other holding were taken by this family after his own death, which occurred sometime between 1079 and 1086.

==Domesday estates in 1066==
Cyneweard's name was uncommon in Anglo-Saxon England. It occurs only seven times in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', and it is probable that all references are to Cyneweard of Laughern.&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; From the evidence in ''Domesday'', Cyneweard held under the [[Bishop of Worcester]] half a [[Hide (unit)|hide]] at [[Wichenford|Laughern, Wichenford]], five hides at [[Wyre Piddle]], two hides at [[Elmley Castle]], and along with his probable vassal Ulfkil, a manor of three hides at [[Hanley, Worcestershire|Hanley]].&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 24; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', pp. 476&amp;ndash;77, 489&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Warwickshire]] Cyneweard possessed, along with a thegn named Beorhtric, six hides at [[Stretton-on-Fosse]].&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 24; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', p. 668&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gloucestershire]], he held a manor of two hides at [[Duntisbourne Abbots]], and in the same county in the vill of [[Coates, Gloucestershire|Coates]] he held one of three manors; his manor was worth one hide, with another one-hide manor being held by Beorhtric, and a third manor worth half a hide being held by a thegn named Leofwine.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 24; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', pp. 463, 465, 469&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Cyneweard held in 1066 the five hide manor of Duntisbourne Abbots later given by the mother of [[Roger de Lacy]] to [[Gloucester Abbey]].&lt;ref name="Ref_d"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 24; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cyneweard was probably the son of Æthelric Kiu, a relative of [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan]] (nicknamed "Lupus"), [[List of Archbishops of York|Archbishop of York]] (1003&amp;ndash;1023) and [[List of Bishops of Worcester|Bishop of Worcester]] (1003&amp;ndash;1016).&lt;ref name=Williams-25&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop Wulfstan's sister Wulfgifu had married a Worcester thegn named Wulfric.&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;{{citation|title=Sawyer 1459|url= http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1459}}; Williams, "Introduction", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Wulfgifu (presumably with Wulfric) had a son named [[Beorhtheah]], who himself became Bishop of Worcester (1033&amp;ndash;1038); it is likely that they had another son called Æthelric, as [[Hemming (monk)|Hemming]] describes Æthelric and Beorhtheah as brothers.&lt;ref name=Williams-25/&gt;

Historian [[Ann Williams (historian)|Ann Williams]] argued that, on the evidence land-holdings, Cyneweard was the son of this Æthelric.&lt;ref name=Williams-25/&gt; This argument has been accepted by other historians, such as the historian of the [[earldom of Mercia]], Stephen Baxter.&lt;ref name="Ref_f"&gt;Baxter, ''Earls of Mercia'', pp. 248, 252, and p. 253 figure 6.3&lt;/ref&gt; A [[thegn]] named Godric is known directly to have been the son of this Æthelric too, and thus Cyneweard's brother.&lt;ref name=Williams-25/&gt; They had a sister named Eadgyth, who became a nun and was still living in 1086.&lt;ref name="Ref_g"&gt;Baxter, ''Earls of Mercia'', p. 253 figure 6.3; Williams and Martin (eds.), ''Domesday Book'', p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

Beorhtheah used his position as bishop to lease to his brother Æthelric, Cyneweard's probable father, manors at Alton, [[Himbleton]], Lower Wolverton and [[Whittington, Worcestershire|Whittington]].&lt;ref name=Williams-25/&gt; Æthelric complemented the family's landholdings by receiving more leased land from his brother's successor [[Lyfing of Winchester|Lyfing]], bishop of Worcester with a little interruption from 1038 or 1039 until 1046.&lt;ref name="Ref_h"&gt;Barlow, "Lyfing"; Williams, "Introduction", p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This included Elmley Castle held by Cyneweard in 1066, as well as [[Armscote]], [[Bentley-in-Holt]] and [[Hill Croome]].&lt;ref name=Williams-25/&gt; These bishops leased out other lands to other members of this family, meaning that in 1066 Cyneweard was a leading member of a kin-group, closely related to the famous bishop, strongly entrenched and dominant in the region.&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;Williams, "Introduction", pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Not associated (unlike some thegns in the region) with the family of the [[Earl of Mercia]], Williams describes Cyneweard and his kindred as "in the ''mouvance'' of the bishops of Worcester just as much if not more than the king".&lt;ref name="Ref_j"&gt;Williams, "Vice-Comital Family", p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
It is clear from a document dating to 1079 x 1089 that Cyneweard held, at an earlier date, the position of [[sheriff]] of Worcester.&lt;ref name=Green-sheriffs&gt;Green, ''Sheriffs'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Records are poor, and it is unclear when he obtained this position, but he probably held it until the arrival of the Norman knight [[Urse d'Abetot]] in 1069.&lt;ref name="Ref_k"&gt;Williams, ''The English'', p. 163; Williams, "Introduction", p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He had survived the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066, and however he lost this position to Urse in 1069 (it is not known), he was still alive in 1072 when he witnessed a charter [as ''Kineward de Lauro''] of [[Robert de Stafford]].&lt;ref name=Green-Williams&gt;Green, ''Sheriffs'', p. 87; Williams, ''The English'', p. 163; Williams, "Introduction", p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last [[Anglo-Saxon]] sheriff of the county.&lt;ref name=Green-sheriffs/&gt;

He probably survived for some time after that, as he was present at a [[plea]] between the church of Worcester and [[Evesham Abbey]] regarding the estates of [[Bengeworth]] and Hampton heard at an unknown date between 1079 and 1083.&lt;ref name="Ref_l"&gt;Green, ''Sheriffs'', p. 87; Williams, "Introduction", p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; These manors were held by Evesham but Worcester claimed them as part of the triple [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] of the [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]].&lt;ref name=Williams-163&gt;Williams, ''The English'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was between Bishop [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan (II) of Worcester]] and Walter, [[Abbot of Evesham]], and Cyneweard's appearance was made, along with other Worcestershire notables, to substantiate Wulfstan's claim, a claim to which Abbot Walter yielded.&lt;ref name="Ref_m"&gt;Williams, ''The English'', p. 163, and n. 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Hemming, after Cyneweard's death his manors of Laughern and Elmley Castle were seized by Urse d'Abetot's brother [[Robert Despenser]].&lt;ref name=Williams-26&gt;Williams, "Introduction", p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This must have occurred before 1086, when it was recorded in ''Domesday Book'' that they were in Robert's possession.&lt;ref name=Williams-26/&gt; Cyneweard's brother Godric had lost his land at Alton to [[William fitz Osbern]] sometime in or before 1071, the year of William's death, though despite this Godric was still alive in 1086.&lt;ref name=Williams-26/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">In music, '''eclecticism''' is the conscious use of styles alien to the [[composer]]'s own nature, or from a bygone era. The term is also used pejoratively to describe music whose composer, thought to be lacking originality, appears to have freely drawn on other models {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}. This word can also be used to describe the music of composers who combine multiple styles, such as using a whole-tone variant of a pentatonic folksong over chromatic counterpoint, or a tertian arpeggiating melody over quartal or secundal harmonies. Eclecticism can also be through quotations, whether of a style (e.g., [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpZtBNzVKQ Shostakovich: Symphony No. 9]),{{Clarify|date=January 2015}}&lt;!--What style is Shostakovich "quoting" in his Ninth Symphony?--&gt; direct quotations of folksongs/variations of them (e.g., Mahler: Symphony No. 1; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBKd78WUa74 II] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQCHgnpCGf4 III]) or direct quotations of other composers (e.g., Berio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YU-V2C4ryU Sinfonia; III]) {{harv|Cope|1997|loc=230–33}}.

{{TOC_right}}
'''Educational stages''' are subdivisions of [[formal learning]], typically covering [[early childhood education]], [[primary education]], [[secondary education]] and [[tertiary education|tertiary (or higher) education]]. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) recognizes seven levels of education in its International Standard Classification of Education system ([[ISCED]], from Level 0 (pre-primary education) through Level 6 (second stage of tertiary education)). UNESCO's International Bureau of Education maintains a database of country-specific education systems and their stages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nt5.scbbs.com/cgi-bin/om_isapi.dll?clientID=29207847&amp;infobase=iwde.nfo&amp;softpage=PL_frame]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[Education]] during childhood and early adulthood is typically provided through either a two- or three-stage system of childhood [[school]], followed by additional stages of [[higher education]] or [[vocational education]] for those who continue their formal education:
*Early childhood education at [[preschool]], nursery school, or [[kindergarten]] (outside the U.S. and Canada)
*Primary education at [[primary school]] or elementary school, and sometimes in the early years of [[middle school]]
*Secondary education at [[secondary school]] or [[high school]], and sometimes in the latter years of middle school
*[[Higher education]] or [[vocational education]]

The following table introduces the main concepts, although terms and ages may vary in different places:

==Alternative organizational structures==

===Sudbury schools===
[[Sudbury school]]s do not use formal grade levels or educational stages. Instead, students ages 4 through 18 are intermingled in a [[democratic education]]al system, relying on a series of [[certification]]s to use equipment that may require specialized knowledge or safety procedures. These certifications are not typically restricted by age, but rather by demonstrated ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Michael|title=A Sudbury Valley Education: The View from Inside|url=http://www.sudval.org/essays/102007.shtml|website=Sudbury Valley School|accessdate=2015-07-25|location=Framingham, MA, USA|date=2007|quote=" How do you get access to a computer at school? There are a whole lot of kids that want to use it. What you instantly find is a culture of rules. You have to be certified to use a computer, which means someone who knows has to tell you how you turn it on, how you turn it off, all the things you have to do to not damage the machine, and you have to show them that you know how to do that before you can use the computer on your own."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Education in Belarus}}
In Belarus, education is guaranteed for everyone. Primary school lasts for 4 years, but some psycho-physically challenged children study for 5 years according to a special standard. Forms 1 to 9 are considered compulsory. After completing general basic school a person can study in a special establishment to get a job. To enter a higher educational establishment a person must complete general secondary school (all 11 forms) and pass three centralized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rikc.by/eng/|title=Республиканский Институт Контроля Знаний|website=rikc.by|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, there are three levels of basic education: "Educação Infantil" (preschool), "Ensino Fundamental" (primary school) and "Ensino Médio" (high school), which are generally completed by age eighteen. Basic education is designed to provide the necessary minimum knowledge for the exercise of citizenship. It also serves to develop consciousness for choosing future professions. In Brazil, after the name of the grade one may use the names "série" or "ano." The educational stages in Brazil are divided as follows:

===Canada===
{{main article|Education in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], schooling officially begins at Kindergarten (or Maternelle in Quebec), followed by ''grades'', with some variations for certain levels in certain provinces/territories. When referred to as a grade, school years are usually referred to by their cardinal number ("Grade Three").

At the post-secondary level in (Anglophone) Canada, a student is usually referred to by the year of study they are in (i.e. First Year, Second Year, etc.). If they are pursuing something higher than an undergraduate degree, the designation usually refers to what year of study they are in since entering Graduate studies (i.e. First Year Graduate Student, etc.). Any student who has completed their first year of undergraduate studies is considered to be an Upper Year Student.

Each province and territory has its own autonomous education system. As such, the name of each level of education and what year each level begins at will vary across the country (as will the curriculum itself).

====Grade structure by province/territory====
The following table shows how grades are organized in various provinces. Often, there will be exceptions within each province, both with terminology for groups, and which grades apply to each group.

===China===
{{main article|Education in China}}
In the [[People's Republic of China]] (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), the years are organized in three stages and renumbered within each stage: 6 years in [[elementary school]] (小学) years 1 to 6, then 3 years in [[middle school|lower secondary]] (初级中学, abbreviated 初中) years 7 to 9, then 3 years in [[high school|higher secondary]] (高级中学, abbreviated 高中) years 1 to 3. The first nine years (elementary 1–6 and junior secondary 1–3) are [[Compulsory education|compulsory]], and the years in higher secondary school are voluntary. Completing higher secondary education or attaining an equivalent level is required before one may receive [[higher education]] (高等教育) at universities.

====Hong Kong====
The [[Hong Kong]] system was based on the [[United Kingdom]] system, with an optional year at [[kindergarten]], six years of [[primary school]] (小學) and six years of [[secondary school]] (中學), followed by four years at university. Primary 1&amp;nbsp;– 6 (小一&amp;nbsp;– 小六) corresponds to Years 1&amp;nbsp;– 6 in the UK, and Forms 1&amp;nbsp;– 6 (中一&amp;nbsp;– 中六) correspond to Years 7&amp;nbsp;– 12. Usually students begin Primary 1 at age 5 or 6 and complete Form 6 at age 17 or 18.

In Hong Kong, international schools follow the system of the country they are based upon, for example the [[English Schools Foundation]] uses the UK year system, and French International Schools use the French [[collège]], [[Grandes écoles|école]], [[lycée]] system. Also, the [[English language|English]] term ''form'' followed by the English number is common usage even in otherwise [[Cantonese]] conversations.

===India===

The central and most state boards uniformly follow the "10+2+3" pattern of education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges,and then 3 years of graduation for a bachelor's degree. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.

====Pre-Primary education====
* '''Play group (pre-nursery)''': At play schools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness. The age limit for admission into pre-nursery is 2 to 3 years
* '''Nursery''': Nursery level activities help children unfold their talents, thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities. The age limit for admission in nursery is 3 to 4 years.
* '''LKG''': It is also called the Junior Kindergarten (Jr. kg) stage. The age limit for admission in LKG is 4 to 5 years.
* '''UKG''': It is also called the Senior Kindergarten (Sr. kg) stage. The age limit for admission in UKG is 5 to 6 years.

====Primary education====
The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education, also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old. Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.

====Secondary education====
Secondary education covers children aged 12 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 [[crore]] children according to the [[2001 Census of India]]. The final two years of secondary is often called '''Higher Secondary (HS)''', Senior Secondary, or simply the '''"+2" stage'''. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.

UGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as Engineering, Medical, and Business Administration.

===Indonesia===
{{main article| Education in Indonesia}}
In [[Indonesia]], children spend 12 years of formal education, but some children attend nursery playgroup (called Kelompok Belajar in 2 years) and attend kindergarten (Called Taman Kanak-Kanak in 2 years).

===Iran===
The [[Iran]]ian system has experienced several changes in the last seven to eight decades. Prior to 1940–1950, the education system had consisted of three levels, called in order: an optional year in [[kindergarten]], six years of [[primary school]], finally followed by six years of [[secondary school]] ending up with a diploma. After some improvements during [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]], the system was changed to four consecutive periods: two optional years in [[kindergarten]] and pre-primary school, primary school consisting of 5 years, 3 years in middle school, and finally four years in high school. The system ended up by honoring a diploma in certain majors, e.g. math and physics.

Around 1996–1997, one year was reduced from the entire education system and one was honored with a diploma after three years in high school. However, if one would have liked to continue her/his education towards university degrees, one would have been required to take the last year, so called pre-university year. This year had been a requirement to participate in the [[Iranian University Entrance Exam]] for high school students. Again, around 2012, the system turned back to its previous system, consisting of two 6-year periods.

There are 2 formal stages of education in [[Iran]]: primary school (دبستان, ''Dabestãn'') and high school (دبیرستان, ''Dabirestãn''). The high school itself is broken into 2 parts: A and B.{{Elucidate|reason=What constitutes A and what constitutes B?|date=May 2017}} Preschool educations are informal, therefore Grade 1 is the first year. In Grade 1 (پایه‌ی 1, ''Paye 1'') also known as the 1st [[Class (education)|class]] (کلاس اوّل, ''Klãs Avval''), children learn the basics of reading and writing.

In [[Japan]], the years are organized in three stages and renumbered within each stage: 6 years in [[elementary school]] (小学校, ''shōgakkō'') years 1 to 6, then 3 years in [[middle school|lower secondary]] (中学校, ''chūgakkō'') years 1 to 3, then 3 years in [[high school|higher secondary]] (高等学校, ''kōtōgakkō'', abbreviated 高校, ''kōkō'') years 1 to 3. The first nine years (elementary 1–6 and lower secondary 1–3) are [[Compulsory education|compulsory]], and the years in higher secondary school are voluntary. Completing higher secondary education or attaining an equivalent level is required before one may receive [[higher education]] at universities (大学, ''daigaku'').

===Malaysia===
{{main article|Education in Malaysia}}

Compulsory education in Malaysia spans a period of 11 years and comprises both [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]]. Kindergarten is optional.

Malaysian primary school consists of six years of education, referred to as Year 1 to Year 6 (formerly Standard 1 to Standard 6). Year 1&amp;nbsp;– 3 are classified as Level One (''Tahap Satu'' in Malay) while Year 4&amp;nbsp;– 6 make up Level Two (''Tahap Dua''). Primary schooling usually begins at the age of 7 and ends at 12. Students take their first national examination, the [[Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah|UPSR]], towards the end of the Year 6 school year. Performance in the UPSR has no effect on their resuming schooling; all students continue with their secondary education after leaving primary school.

Secondary schooling usually begins at age 13. Secondary schools offer education for a total of five years, starting with Form 1 and finishing at Form 5. Forms 1&amp;nbsp;– 3 are grouped together into the "Lower Form" and Forms 4 &amp; 5 are considered the "Upper Form". Students in Form 3 will have to sit for their second national exam, the [[Pentaksiran Tingkatan Tiga|PT3]]. They are then streamed into sciences or humanities classes for the Upper Form according to their performance in this exam. At age 17 students in Form 5 sit for the final level of national examinations, the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia|SPM]] (Malaysian Certificate of Education). Achieving a passing grade in the ''Bahasa Melayu'' (Malay Language) portion of the exams is compulsory; failure results in an automatic failing grade for all subjects taken in the examination and the student is held back to repeat Form 5. Completion of the examination signifies that the student has completed formal education in Malaysia; an SPM certificate remains the base requirement to secure most jobs in Malaysia.

After the SPM, students have a choice of either continuing with Form 6 (which comprises 2 years, Lower and Upper Six) or entering matriculation (pre-university programs). If they opt for Form 6, they will be required to take the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|STPM]] examination. Although generally taken by those desiring to attend public universities in Malaysia, an STPM certification is internationally recognized and may also be used, though rarely required, to enter private local universities for undergraduate courses.

===Nepal===
{{main article|Education in Nepal}} In [[Nepal]], the stages of education are primary education, secondary education, and higher secondary. Pre-primary education is also found in some areas. Generally, the pre-primary level covers nursery and kindergarten. Primary education consists of grades one through five, while lower secondary education covers grades six through eight and secondary education covers grades nine through ten. Higher secondary covers grades eleven and twelve. Students get Secondary Education Examination certificate in grade ten. According to the new Education Act, the national grade 12 Examination will result in the [[School Leaving Certificate]] (SLC).

===New Zealand===
{{main article|Education in New Zealand}}In [[New Zealand]] children are required by law to attend 10 years of educational instruction, from the age of 6 to 16. The law also provides in the same legislation that all people are allowed to attend free education to the age of 18, this legislation is the Education Act 1989. Children can enroll at primary school when they turn five years old, and must be enrolled by the time they turn six years old. From years 1–6 students attend primary school. In years 7 and 8 students attend intermediate, or a joint school (years 1–8 or years 7–13). The final years of free education are spent in secondary school (years 9–13). New Zealand also has two older educational stage-numbering systems; standards 5 &amp; 6 were largely unused with the introduction of intermediate schools in the 1950s, while "primmer" numbering was in use well into the 1970s, and some academically focused secondary schools still use "form" numbering.

===Norway===
{{main article|Education in Norway}}

In Norway children start school at the age of six; before that kindergarten is voluntary. This school is called ''barneskole'' (childrenschool):

* 6–7: First grade
* 7–8: Second grade
* 8–9: Third grade
* 9–10: Fourth grade
* 10–11: Fifth grade
* 11–12: Sixth grade
* 12–13: Seventh grade

The second school is ''ungdomsskole'' (youth-school). At this level the students are rated with grades in each subject, in addition to behavior and orderliness:

* 13–14: Eighth grade
* 14–15: Ninth grade
* 15–16: Tenth grade

The last school before higher education is called ''videregående skole'' (ongoing school) and is voluntary, though most choose to attend. At this level students decide among separate career-related schools. The most popular such school is designed to prepare one for further education,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} while others prepare students for such as mechanics, electricians, cooks and so on. Educational stages in these schools begin again at "one" and are named Vg1, Vg2, Vg3 and Vg4. Some of the more practical schools last only two years, and some students may choose to attend an extra year to study higher education. The typical duration is three years, though some schools offer a four-year program to enable students to engage in more athletics or gather real work experience.

* 16–17: Vg1
* 17–18: Vg2
* 18–19: Vg3
* 19–20: Vg4

===Philippines===
{{Main article|Education in the Philippines}}
Previously in the Philippines, there are only ten years of compulsory education. School starts on the first or second week of June, while school ends in the last week of March or first week of April. There are three stages of education in the Philippines&amp;nbsp;— elementary, junior high school, and senior high school. The original ten years of compulsory education, was raised to twelve years of education. This policy was implemented in June, 2012. Here is the table:

===Russia===
In [[Russia]], compulsory education lasts eight or nine years and begins the year the child turns seven (8 years) or, sometimes, six (9 years). The first stage of elementary school can last either 3 years (so called 1–3 programme for children starting at the age of 7) or 4 years (so called 1–4 programme for children starting at the age of 6). After of the first stage all pupils enter 5th grade, thus pupils that started at the age of 7 do not attend the 4th grade.

===Singapore===
{{main article|Education in Singapore}}
In [[Singapore]], compulsory education lasts ten years and begins the year the child turns seven. However, most children receive a [[preschool]] education spanning two to three years before entering primary school after which they will move on to a secondary school, where Sec 5 is only made compulsory for students who have achieved a determined score for their [[Primary School Leaving Examination|PSLE]]. For Secondary School, there are two (some) or three streamings: Express (Exp), Normal Academic (NA), and Normal Technical (NT), among which Exp and NT students study for four years while NA students need to study for five years. Depending on which stream one is in, and whether the school's scoring requirement is met, a student may be retained/transferred to NA/NT.

===Sweden===
{{main article|Education in Sweden}}

In Sweden children start school at the age of seven; before that preschool is voluntary. It is unusual to skip a year of "preschool class", with most children attending at age six.

* 6–7: Preschool class (Förskoleklass)

First set of grades are called "lågstadiet" (low grades).
* 7–8: "ettan" (First Grade)
* 8–9: "tvåan" (Second Grade)
* 9–10: "trean" (Third grade)

Second set of grades are called "mellanstadiet" (middle grades).
* 10–11: "fyran" (Fourth grade)
* 11–12: "femman" (Fifth grade)
* 12–13: "sexan" (Sixth grade)

Third set of grades are called "högstadiet" (high grades).
* 13–14: "sjuan" (Seventh grade)
* 14–15: "åttan" (Eighth grade)
* 15–16: "nian" (Ninth grade)

The last school before higher education is called "gymnasiet" (ongoing school) and is voluntary, though most choose to attend. At this level students decide among separate career-related schools. Some of the more practical schools last only two years, and some students may choose to attend an extra year to study higher education. The typical duration is three years, though some schools offer a four-year program to enable students to engage in more athletics or gather real work experience.

* 16–17: "första ring" (First Level)

{{main article|Education in the United Kingdom}}

====England and Wales====
In [[England]] and [[Wales]] education is divided into two stages: [[primary education]] and [[secondary education]]. Required assessment within the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] takes place in years 2 and 6 ([[National Curriculum assessment]]s) and Year 11 ([[GCSE]]s). School education is generally followed by two years of further education&amp;nbsp;– often in a 6th form or 6th form college and then three or four years at university by those who decide to stay in education.

Children begin school either in the school year or school term in which they reach their fifth birthday. [[Primary school]]s educate children from Reception through to [[Year Six (School)|Year 6]], and may be subdivided into [[infant school|infant]] and [[junior school]]s. Alternatively, children may attend private [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]]s.

Secondary education is compulsory to the age of 16. However, in England you will be required to return to full time education, take on an apprenticeship or internship or work or volunteer at least 20 hours a week while part time studying [[until the age of 18]]. Schools have various possible names, such as [[Grammar school|grammar]], [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] and [[secondary schools]], which may or may not indicate selective admission or tuition fees (see main article). 6th form|6th form education is not compulsory at present, and not all secondary schools have a 6th form. There are also 6th form colleges just for Year 12 and 13 students.

Some secondary schools still use the 'form' system, with Year 7 being 1st Form (or '1st year'), Year 8 being Second Form, et cetera, up until Year 12 and Year 13, which together make up the 6th Form (namely lower and upper sixth form). Some independent schools use other naming systems.

In some areas in England, a [[three-tier education|three-tier system]] of education is used, in which students pass through three stages: [[First school]]/[[Lower school]] ([[Reception (School)|Reception]] to Year 3/4), [[Middle school]] (Year 4/5 to Year 7/8) and finally High or [[Upper School]] (Year 8/9–Year 13)

====Scotland====
{{main article|Education in Scotland}}In [[Scotland]], education is divided into two stages: [[primary education]] and [[secondary education]]. Primary education is delivered almost exclusively through [[primary school]]s which offer education for pupils aged between 4 and 12. Children are entitled to pre-school education from their third birthday, and must enter compulsory education from the August after their 5th birthday. There is some leeway in the starting date or pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk/Startingschool/StartingSchoolForTheFirstTime/StartingSchool.asp|title=Starting school for the first time|work=Parentzone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612084341/http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk/Startingschool/StartingSchoolForTheFirstTime/StartingSchool.asp|archivedate=2008-06-12|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Education lasts 7 years in the primary school, before pupils move to a secondary school for between 4 and 6 years, the last two being optional.
There is some variation in the phasing of education in more remote areas of Scotland, where provision may be made in a through school, or in other combinations of institutes.

===United States===
{{main article|Education in the United States}}
In the [[United States]] (U.S.), the ''grades'' traditionally begin at 1 and run to 12; they are referred to by ordinal number (e.g. first grade, or 3rd grade to 12th grade). An additional preceding level called [[kindergarten]] ("K") is now standard in most areas, and a further preceding level called [[preschool education]] or [[nursery school]] is not uncommon. In some parts of the state of Wisconsin, kindergarten is split further into junior and senior kindergarten.

Before the term "middle school" became much more commonly applied, grades 7–8 were placed in "[[junior high school#United States|junior high school]]" (with grade 6 in some schools).

At the secondary school level ("high school"), grades 9–12 are also known as [[freshman]] (or "first-year"), [[Tenth grade#United States|sophomore]], [[High school junior|junior]], and [[twelfth grade|senior]]. At the post-secondary level (college or university), these terms are used almost exclusively to refer to what would otherwise be grades 13–16, ending denoted as "[[college senior]]". Then come post-graduate levels.

The Table US (''at left)'' outlines the ages, in years, of each grade level in the US. However, students are sometimes older because of [[grade retention]] or younger because of [[grade skipping]].

In some classes, students from various grades might attend together as a multi-grade class, to offer more variety in course subjects, rather than have only a single grade attend those classes.

'''Environmental art''' is a range of artistic practices encompassing both historical approaches to nature in art and more recent ecological and politically motivated types of works.&lt;ref name=Profusion&gt;{{cite web|last=Bower|first=Sam|title=A Profusion of Terms|url=http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=306|publisher=greenmuseum.org|year=2010|accessdate=29 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203816/http://greenmuseum.org/generic_content.php?ct_id=306|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WEAD&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinman|first=Susan|title=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory|url=http://weadartists.org|publisher=WEAD, Women Environmental Artists Directory|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental art has evolved away from formal concerns, worked out with earth as a [[Sculpture|sculptural material]], towards a deeper relationship to systems, processes and phenomena in relationship to social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, J. and Wallis, B.

The term "environmental art" often encompasses "ecological" concerns but is not specific to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Linda|title=Untangling Eco from Enviro|url=http://lindaweintraub.com/blog/item/untangling-eco-from-enviro|publisher=Artnow Publications|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily celebrates an artist's connection with nature using natural materials.&lt;ref name=Profusion /&gt;&lt;ref name=WEAD/&gt; The concept is best understood in relationship to historic [[Land art|earth/Land art]] and the evolving field of [[ecological art]]. The field is interdisciplinary in the fact that environmental artists embrace ideas from science and philosophy. The practice encompasses traditional media, new media and critical social forms of production. The work embraces a full range of landscape/environmental conditions from the rural, to the suburban and urban as well as urban/rural industrial.

==History: Landscape painting and representation==

[[File:Claude Monet - Waterloo Bridge, London.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''Waterloo Bridge, London'']]
It can be argued that environmental art began with the [[Paleolithic religion|Paleolithic]] [[cave paintings]] of our ancestors. While no landscapes have (yet) been found, the cave paintings represented other aspects of nature important to early humans such as animals and human figures. "They are prehistoric observations of nature. In one-way or another, nature for centuries remained the preferential theme of creative art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/11/the-landscape-in-art-nature-in-the-crosshairs-of-an-age-old-debate/|title=The Landscape in Art: Nature in the Crosshairs of an Age-Old Debate - ARTES MAGAZINE|website=ARTES MAGAZINE|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404205809/http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/11/the-landscape-in-art-nature-in-the-crosshairs-of-an-age-old-debate/|archivedate=2016-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern examples of environmental art stem from landscape painting and representation.  When artists painted onsite they developed a deep connection with the surrounding environment and its weather and brought these close observations into their canvases. [[John Constable|John Constable's]]  sky paintings "most closely represent the sky in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's [[Houses of Parliament series (Monet)|London Series]]  also exemplifies the artist's connection with the environment. "For me, a landscape does not exist in its own right, since its appearance changes at every moment; but the surrounding atmosphere brings it to life, the air and the light, which vary continually for me, it is only the surrounding atmosphere that gives subjects their true value."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Challenging traditional sculptural forms==
[[File:Observatorium Robert Morris 1.JPG|thumb| [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], ''Observatorium'', Netherlands]]

The growth of environmental art as a "movement" began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  In its early phases it was most associated with sculpture—especially [[Site-specific art]], [[Land art]] and [[Arte povera]]—having arisen out of mounting criticism of traditional sculptural forms and practices that were increasingly seen as outmoded and potentially out of harmony with the natural environment.

In October 1968, Robert Smithson organized an exhibition at Dwan Gallery in New York titled “Earthworks.” The works in the show posed an explicit challenge to conventional notions of exhibition and sales, in that they were either too large or too unwieldy to be collected; most were represented only by photographs, further emphasizing their resistance to acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Kastner, Jeffrey and Wallis, Brian (1998) ''Land and Environmental Art'', London: Phaidon Press, p. 23, {{ISBN|0-7148-3514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these artists escaping the confines of the gallery and modernist theory was achieved by leaving the cities and going out into the desert.

”They were not depiciting the landscape, but engaging it; their art was not simply of the landscape, but in it as well.”&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; This shift in the late 1960s and 1970s represents an avant garde notion of sculpture, the landscape and our relationship with it. The work challenged the conventional means to create sculpture, but also defied more elite modes of art dissemination and exhibition, such as the Dawn Gallery show mentioned earlier. This shift opened up a new space and in doing so expanded the ways in which work was documented and conceptualized.&lt;ref name=Overlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|title=Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art of Prehistory|year=1995|publisher=The New Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-56584-238-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, artists such as [[Nils Udo]], [[Jean-Max Albert]],&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Becker, Sculpture Nature, Centre d'Arts Plastiques Contemporain, Bordeaux, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piotr Kowalski]],&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Kowalski, by Jean-Christophe Bailly : Éditions Hazan, Paris, 1988,&lt;/ref&gt; among others, had been creating environmental art such as [[Sculptures Bachelard]] since the 1960s.

Some of them are said to be old whaling ships whose owners did not want to pay to have them properly disposed of. They would haul them to the Creek and burn them down to the waterline. The Army Corps of Engineers has identified abandoned ships in other parts of the city, but not here.

In 1978 Barry Thomas and friends illegally occupied a vacant CBD lot in Wellington New Zealand. He dumped a truck load of topsoil then planted 180 cabbage seedlings in the shape of the word "Cabbage" for his 'vacant lot of cabbages. The site was then inundated with contributing artists' work - the whole event lasted 6 months and ended with a week long festival celebrating native trees and forests. In 2012, [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]—the country's largest cultural institution—purchased all of the cabbage patch archives citing it as 'an important part of our artistic and social history'.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives | date=November 2, 2012 | first=Sarah |last=Farrar | publisher=[[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]]

While this earlier work was mostly done in the deserts of the American west, the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s saw works moving into the public landscape. Artists like Robert Morris began engaging county departments and public arts commissions to create works in public spaces such as an abandoned gravel pit.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Herbert Bayer used a similar approach and was selected to create his [[Mill Creek Canyon Earthworks]] in 1982. The project served functions such as erosion control, a place to serve as a reservoir during high rain periods, and a 2.5 acre park during dry seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucy Lippard]]'s groundbreaking book, on the parallel between contemporary land art and prehistoric sites, examined the ways in which these prehistoric cultures, forms and images have "overlaid" onto the work of contemporary artists working with the land and natural systems.&lt;ref name=Overlay/&gt;

The expanding term of environmental art also encompasses the scope of the urban landscape. [[Agnes Denes]] created a work in downtown Manhattan ''Wheatfield - A Confrontation'' (1982) in which she planted a field of wheat on the two-acre site of a landfill covered with urban detritus and rubble. The site is now Battery Park City and the World Financial Center: morphing from ecologic power to economic power.
[[File:Paroucheva Source Energie pcp.jpg|thumb|Paroucheva Source Energie pcp]] Electric art: In 1999, the Bulgarian artist Elena Paroucheva created a new concept for the electricity pylons of  power lines.

[[Alan Sonfist]] introduced the key environmentalist idea of bringing nature back into the urban environment with his first historical Time Landscape sculpture, proposed to New York City in 1965, and visible to this day at the corner of Houston and LaGuardia in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Today Sonfist is joining forces with the broad enthusiasm for environmental and green issues among public authorities and private citizens to propose a network of such sites across the metropolitan area, which will raise consciousness of the key role that nature will play in the challenges of the 21st century. The sacredness of nature and the natural environment is often evident in the work of Environmental Artists.

Just as the earthworks in the deserts of the west grew out of notions of landscape painting, the growth of public art stimulated artists to engage the urban landscape as another environment and also as a platform to engage ideas and concepts about the environment to a larger audience. "Many environmental artists now desire not merely an audience for their work but a public, with whom they can correspond about the meaning and purpose of their art."&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Polli|Andrea Polli's]] installation ''Particle Falls'' made particulate matter in the air visible in a way that passersby could see.&lt;ref name=Particle&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensing Change: Particle Falls|publisher=Science History Institute|year=2013|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/particle-falls|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''HighWaterLine'' [[Eve Mosher]] and others walked through neighborhoods in at-risk cities such as [[New York City]] and [[Miami]], marking the projected flood damage which could occur as a result of [[climate change]] and talking with

[[Superstorm Sandy]] initiated numerous artists responses to New York City's forgotten waterfront and historical waterways. The exhibition, ''Silent Beaches, Untold Stories: New York City's Forgotten Waterfront'', curated by St. John's University professor, [[Elizabeth Alpert]], presented a range of artists approaches to the urban environment and complex [[ecological systems]] of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trapasso|first=Clare|title=St. John’s University exhibit sheds light on forgotten waterfront|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/exhibit-highlights-forgotten-city-waterfront-article-1.1448006|accessdate=7 February 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoArt definition:'''
There is discussion and debate among Ecological Artists, if Ecological Art or EcoArt, should be considered a discrete discipline within the Arts, distinct from Environmental Art. A current definition of Ecological Art, drafted collectively by the EcoArtNetwork is "Ecological Art is an art practice that embraces an ethic of social justice in both its content and form/materials. EcoArt is created to inspire caring and respect, stimulate dialogue, and encourage the long-term flourishing of the social and natural environments in which we live. It commonly manifests as socially engaged, activist, community-based restorative or interventionist art.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Sacha (2014). The practice of ecological art. [plastik] 4 .

==Considering environmental impact==

Within environmental art, a crucial distinction can be made between environmental artists who do not consider the possible damage to the environment that their artwork may incur, and those whose intent is to cause no harm to nature. For example, despite its aesthetic merits, the American artist [[Robert Smithson]]’s celebrated sculpture ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1969) inflicted permanent damage upon the landscape he worked with, using a bulldozer to scrape and cut the land, with the spiral itself impinging upon the lake. Similarly, criticism was raised against the European sculptor [[Christo]] when he temporarily wrapped the coastline at Little Bay, south of Sydney, Australia, in 1969.  Conservationists' comments attracted international attention in environmental circles and led contemporary artists in the region to rethink the inclinations of land art and site-specific art.

[[Sustainable art]] is produced with consideration for the wider impact of the work and its reception in relationship to its environments (social, economic, biophysical, historical, and cultural). Some artists choose to minimize their potential impact, while other works involve restoring the immediate landscape to a natural state.&lt;ref name=WEAD/&gt;

British sculptor [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] has for several decades made temporary outdoor sculptural work by rearranging natural materials found on site, such as rocks, mud and branches, which will therefore have no lingering detrimental effect. [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]] instituted a work entitled "[[Medicine Wheel]]" which was the fruit and result of a daily meditative walk, once a day, for a calendar year.  The deliverable of this work was a mandala of mosaicked found objects: nature art as [[process art]]. [[Crop art]]ist Stan Herd&lt;ref&gt;Herd, Stan (1994) ''Crop Art and Other Earthworks", New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., {{ISBN|0810925753}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows similar connection with and respect for the land.

Leading environmental artists such as the Dutch sculptor [[Herman de Vries]], the Australian sculptor [[John Davis (sculptor)|John Davis]] and the British sculptor [[Andy Goldsworthy]] similarly leave the landscape they have worked with unharmed; in some cases they have revegetated damaged land with appropriate indigenous flora in the process of making their work. In this way the work of art arises out of a sensitivity towards habitat. Perhaps the most celebrated instance of environmental art in the late 20th century was ''[[7000 Oaks]]'', an ecological action staged at Documenta during 1982 by [[Joseph Beuys]], in which the artist and his assistants highlighted the condition of the local environment by planting 7000 oak trees throughout and around the city of [[Kassel]].

==Ecological awareness and transformation==
[[File:Give-if-you-can.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacek Tylicki]] ''Give if you can – Take if you have to,'' Palolem Island, India]]

Other artists, like [[eco-feminist]] artist [[Aviva Rahmani]] reflect on our human engagement with the natural world, and create ecologically informed artworks that focus on transformation or reclamation. In the last two decades significant environmentally concerned work has been made by [[Rosalie Gascoigne]], who fashioned her serene sculptures from rubbish and junk she found discarded in rural areas. Similarly, [[Marina DeBris]] uses trash from the beach to create [[trashion]], educating people about beach and ocean trash.  [[Patrice Stellest]] created big installations with junk, but also incorporated pertinent items collected around the world and solar energy mechanisms. [[John Wolseley]] hikes through remote regions, gathering visual and scientific data, then incorporates visual and other information into complex wall-scale works on paper. Environmental art or ''Green art'' by Washington, DC based glass sculptors Erwin Timmers and [http://www.torpedofactory.org/artists/sigethy_a.htm Alison Sigethy] incorporates some of the least recycled building materials; structural glass. EcoArt writer and theoretician [[Linda Weintraub]] coined the term, "cycle-logical" to describe the correlation between recycling and psychology. The 21st century notion of artists' mindful engagement with their materials harkens back to paleolithic [[midden]] piles of discarded pottery and metals from ancient civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weintraub|first=Linda, with Shuckmann, Skip|title=Cycle-Logical Art: Recycling Matters for Eco-Art|year=2007|publisher=Artnow Publications: Avant-Guardians Textlets on Art and Ecology|location=New York|isbn=0-9777421-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weintraub cites the work of MacArthur Fellow [[Sarah Sze]] who recycles, reuses, and refurbishes detritus from the waste stream into elegant sprawling installations. Her self-reflective work draws our attention to our own cluttered lives and connection to consumer culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sze|first=Sarah|title=Sarah Sze Selected Exhibitions|url=http://www.sarahsze.com|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sze|first=Sarah|title=At Venice Biennale, Sara Sze's 'Triple Point'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/arts/design/at-venice-biennale-sarah-szes-triple-point.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigitte Hitschler]]'s ''Energy field'' drew power for 400 red diodes from the to-be-reclaimed potash slag heap upon which they were installed, using art and science to reveal hidden [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="HYLE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hitschler |first1= Brigitte |title=Energy Field|page=16|journal= HYLE – International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |series= Chemistry in Art - A Virtual Art Exhibition Jointly Published with the Special Issue on "Aesthetics and Visualization in Chemistry" |date=2003 |volume=9 |issue=3 |url= http://www.hyperzine.de/files/downloads/hyle/files/chemistry_in_art.pdf |location=Karlsruhe, Germany |accessdate= 27 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological artist and activist, [[Beverly Naidus]], creates installations that address environmental crises, nuclear legacy issues, and creates works on paper that envision transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Beverly Naidus |url= http://weadartists.org/artist/naidusb |publisher= WEAD Women Environmental Artist Directory |accessdate= 8 February 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140221162543/http://weadartists.org/artist/naidusb |archivedate= 21 February 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her community-based permaculture project, ''Eden Reframed'' remediates degraded soil using phytoremediation and mushrooms resulting in a public place to grow and harvest medicinal plants and edible plants.

==Renewable energy sculpture==
[[File:Worldsavingmachine III.jpg|thumb|[[Ralf Sander]], ''World Saving Machine III'', MoA Museum of Art, Seoul, South Korea]]
[[Renewable energy sculpture]] is another recent development in environmental art. In response to the growing concern about global climate change, artists are designing explicit interventions at a functional level, merging aesthetical responses with the functional properties of energy generation or saving. [[Andrea Polli|Andrea Polli's]] ''Queensbridge Wind Power Project'' is an example of [[experimental architecture]], incorporating wind turbines into a bridge's structure to recreate aspects of the original design as well as lighting the bridge and neighbouring areas.&lt;ref name=Queensbridge&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queensbridge Wind Power Project

      <comment>Changed the word "size" to "width" of the bin since to a naive reader the word "size" could be interpreted as "number of points I'm supposed to put in the bin", rather than it's width.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">In [[statistics]], the '''Freedman&amp;ndash;Diaconis rule''' can be used to select the width of the bins to be used in a [[histogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=David|last2=Diaconis|first2=Persi|date=December 1981|year=|title=On the histogram as a density estimator: ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; theory|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/mp364022824748n3/fulltext.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|journal=Probability Theory and Related Fields|location=Heidelberg|publisher=Springer Berlin|volume=57|issue=4|pages=453–476|doi=10.1007/BF01025868|issn=0178-8051|via=|authorlink=David Freedman (statistician)|authorlink2=Persi Diaconis|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[David A. Freedman]] and [[Persi Diaconis]]. 

For a set of empirical measurements sampled from some [[probability distribution]], the Freedman-Diaconis rule is designed to minimize the difference between the [[integral|area under the empirical probability distribution]] and the area under the theoretical probability distribution.{{Clarify|reason=What is the empirical probability distribution? Why would minimizing this difference be a good thing?|date=June 2017}}

The general equation for the rule is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Bin width}=2\, { \text{IQR}(x) \over{  \sqrt[3]{n}  }}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{IQR}(x) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[interquartile range]] of the data and &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the number of observations in the sample &lt;math&gt; x. &lt;/math&gt;

==Other approaches==
Another approach is to use [[Histogram#Number_of_bins_and_width|''Sturges' rule'']]: use a bin so large that there are about &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1+\log_2n&lt;/math&gt; non-empty bins (Scott, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = D.W. | year = 2009 | title = Sturges' rule | url = | journal = WIREs Computational Statistics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 303–306 | doi=10.1002/wics.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This works well for ''n'' under 200, but was found to be inaccurate for large&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hyndman | first1 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = The problem with Sturges’ rule for constructing histograms | url = http://robjhyndman.com/papers/sturges.pdf | journal =  | volume =  | issue = | pages =  | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ger Brennan''' is an Irish [[Gaelic football]]er who plays for [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincents]] and formerly played for [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]].

==Early life==
From a family of nine, he attended [[Belvedere College]]. At Belvedere he played Rugby, soccer, hurling and Gaelic Football.

Graduating from [[Maynooth College]] with undergraduate and master's degrees, he qualified as a school teacher and taught Irish and religion at St. Kevin's College, Ballygall Road, in Dublin 11. In November 2015 he was appointed Gaelic Games Executive at [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/newsandopinion/news/gerbrennanappointedgaelicgamesexecutiveatucd/ Ger Brennan appointed Gaelic Games Executive at UCD] www.ucd.ie, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Club===
Brennan won his first [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] medal with St Vincents in 2007 in the final against [[St Brigids]] at [[Parnell Park]]. He then went on to win the [[Leinster Senior Club Football Championship]] final against Tyrrellspass of [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]]. Brennan was chosen as the Leinster club player of the year for his performances in the Leinster club championship with St Vincents.

Brennan won the 2008 [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship]] with [[St Vincents GAA|St Vincents]] in a hard fought game. He won the [[Dublin Senior Football Championship]] for St. Vincents, as captain, in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131107123144/http://www.thescore.ie/st-vincents-dublin-football-champions-1164006-Nov2013/ |archivedate=2013-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-county===
Brennan madee his national league debut for Dublin against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] on 3 February 2007.  He was a member of Dublin team that won the [[2007 O'Byrne Cup|2007]] [[O'Byrne Cup]], playing against Laois at [[O'Connor Park]] in Offaly. The game finished on a scoreline of 1-18 to 2-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/?jp=CWSNOJEYAUQL]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the tournament with a total of 0-04.

In 2008, he retired from Dublin's football panel, citing burnout and fatigue as his reasons. However, on July 30, 2008, he was named in Dublin's panel for the quarter-final and accepted a return. He was part of the victorious Dublin squad that won the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. He won an All-Ireland with Dublin for a second time in 2013, scoring two points in the final against Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/dublin-are-all-ireland-champions-29597446.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Brennan announced his retirement from Inter County football but will continue to play club football.

==Personal life==
Brennan is a Catholic who has spoken about his faith in God. He has stated that while non-denominational schools may teach subjects such as science, Catholic schools "enable young students to have the skills to pray".&lt;ref name=time_to_learn_about_faith&gt;{{cite news|first=Pamela|last=Duncan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/ger-brennan-says-time-for-young-people-to-learn-more-about-faith-1.1661808|title=Ger Brennan says time for young people to learn more about faith: Catholic Schools Week 2014 begins next Sunday, January 26th|work=The Irish Times|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was praised for his "nonchalant delivery" of thanks to the "girlfriends and boyfriends of the players" after St Vincent's defeated Castlebar Mitchels in the 2014 All-Ireland Club Championship Final at Croke Park (a speech delivered in front of a live television audience).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26646416|title=Ger Brennan's 'inclusive' speech praised by gay rights groups|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=19 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However just over a year later, Brennan wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' arguing against the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]] in that year's [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Marriage Equality referendum]], which was ultimately carried in a 62% to 38% popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ger|last=Brennan|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/dublin-football-star-ger-brennan-why-im-voting-no-31217917.html|title=Dublin football star Ger Brennan: Why I'm voting No|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His stance was criticised by others, including fellow GAA star [[Conor Cusack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Cullen|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/conor-cusack-challenges-dubs-star-ger-brennan-on-opposition-to-samesex-marriage-31220546.html|title=Conor Cusack challenges Dubs star Ger Brennan on opposition to same-sex marriage|newspaper=Evening Herald|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Half-Life: Blue Shift''''' is an [[expansion pack]] for [[Valve Corporation|Valve Software's]] science fiction [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The game was developed by [[Gearbox Software]] with [[Valve Corporation]] and published by [[Sierra On-Line]] on June 12, 2001. ''Blue Shift'' is the second expansion for ''Half-Life'', originally intended as part of a [[Dreamcast]] version of the original game. Although the Dreamcast port was later cancelled, the PC version continued development and was released as a standalone product. The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 24, 2005.

As with Gearbox's previous expansion pack ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', ''Blue Shift'' returns to the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story through the eyes of another person. The protagonist in ''Blue Shift'' is a security guard, [[Barney Calhoun]], employed by the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both ''Blue Shift'' and the preceding ''Half-Life'' games was praised.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Half-Life Blue Shift screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|''Blue Shift'' is the first game in the ''Half-Life'' series to feature consistent interaction with a single [[non-player character]], Dr Rosenberg]]
{{see also|Half-Life (video game)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Half-Life}}

As an expansion pack for ''Half-Life'', ''Blue Shift'' is a [[first-person shooter]]. The overall gameplay of ''Blue Shift'' does not significantly differ from that of ''Half-Life'': players are required to navigate through the game's [[level (video games)|levels]], fight hostile [[non-player character]]s and solve a variety of puzzles to advance.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The game continues ''Half-Life''{{'}}s methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the [[first person narrative|first person perspective]] of the protagonist and remains in control of the player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than [[cut scene]]s. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

The player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. ''Blue Shift'' also includes a substantial section dedicated to keeping a major character in the story safe from enemy characters, and escorting him to a specific location.&lt;ref name="PCZone"/&gt; A selection of enemies from ''Half-Life'' populate the game, including alien creatures such as [[headcrab]]s and [[Vortigaunt]]s. The player also encounters human opponents in the form of a detachment of [[US Marines]] who have been sent to eliminate the alien threat and silence any witnesses.&lt;ref name="GSpy"/&gt; ''Blue Shift'' does not elaborate on the storyline in ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', the preceding expansion pack, and no enemy characters or weapons introduced in it appear in the game. The player is instead given access to a limited selection of ''Half-Life''{{'}}s original weaponry.&lt;ref name="PCZone"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Blue Shift'' is set in the same location and time frame as that of ''Half-Life'', taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. In ''Half-Life'', the player takes on the role of [[Gordon Freeman]], a scientist involved in an accident that opens an [[multiverse|inter-dimensional portal]] to the borderworld of [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |title=''Half-Life'': The Story so Far |accessdate=March 24, 2008 |publisher=[[Valve Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725080723/http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in ''Opposing Force'', ''Blue Shift'' shows the events of ''Half-Life'' from the perspective of a different protagonist. The player assumes the role of [[Barney Calhoun]], a security guard working near the labs where the accident takes place. Calhoun is responsible for the preservation of equipment and materials and the welfare of research personnel, and after the accident turns Black Mesa into a warzone, he must work with Dr. Rosenberg, a high-ranking scientist involved in the experiment, to evacuate the facility.&lt;ref name="IGNstory"/&gt;

===Plot===
''Blue Shift'' begins in a similar manner to ''Half-Life'', as Barney Calhoun rides a train through the Black Mesa facility to reach his place of work. After reporting for duty, Calhoun is instructed to assist in maintenance on a malfunctioning elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Half-Life: Blue Shift | developer = [[Gearbox Software]] | date = 2001| platform = PC| level = Insecurity| quote='''Security guard''': Uh oh, now what? Looks like some people are having problems with the main access lift in Sector G. Why don't you go over there and see what you can do?}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Calhoun finishes repairs, however, Freeman's experiment takes place and results in a "resonance cascade", causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures into the base. The elevator is badly damaged and fails, sending Calhoun plummeting into the depths of Black Mesa.

Calhoun regains consciousness at the bottom of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's [[classification yard]]s, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Half-Life: Blue Shift | developer = [[Gearbox Software]] | date = 2001| platform = PC| level = Captive Freight| quote='''Harold''': The military is rounding up everyone and everything they can find, and either killing them or bringing them up here for questioning. So much for a rescue. A colleague and I came up with our own plan for escape, and we were on our way to one of the old prototype labs when we ran into them. But listen to me: if you still want to get out of here alive your only hope may be to find my friend. If you can get past the soldiers, find Dr. Rosenberg. With him you may have a chance to get out of this place...}}&lt;/ref&gt; After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a teleport destination outside of Black Mesa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Half-Life: Blue Shift | developer = [[Gearbox Software]] | date = 2001| platform = PC| level = Focal Point| quote='''Dr. Rosenberg''': Some of the more promising research on the matter led to a device that could be attached to the strange crystalline structures we found on this borderworld. Now this device could then be used as a focal point and a relay to aid in the teleportation. Well, in theory that is. We lost contact with the survey group shortly after the device was in place. We later discovered other methods of aiming the field, but all of the equipment in this lab uses the older technology. In order for any of us to get out of here alive, someone will have to go to the border world to activate the device. I'm afraid you're the only one who can do this, seeing as how everyone else is needed to operate the equipment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.

Calhoun travels to the power generators on a lower level to find a fresh power cell while firefights rage between the Marines and the forces of Xen. After returning with a new power cell, Calhoun assists Rosenberg in evacuating the few surviving personnel through the teleporter. Calhoun is the last to enter the portal and as he does so, Marines breach the laboratory and fire on him, causing the teleporter to explode. As a result of the teleporter's destruction, Calhoun enters a "harmonic reflux", causing him to be rapidly teleported to a variety of locations in Xen and Black Mesa. At one location, he witnesses Freeman's capture by Marines midway through ''Half-Life'', before eventually stabilizing at the intended teleport location with Rosenberg at the outskirts of Black Mesa, where they then escape the facility in a company SUV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = Half-Life: Blue Shift | developer = [[Gearbox Software]] | date = 2001| platform = PC| level = A Leap of Faith| quote='''Dr. Rosenberg''': Thank God you made it! I was worried that a malfunction occurred at the last moment and you might have been caught in an infinite harmonic reflux. If that's the case then you're lucky to be standing here! Then again, we're all lucky. Thanks to you, however, we were actually able to pull off this half-brained idea. We made it Mr. Calhoun, we made it!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:High Definition Half-Life comparison.jpg|thumb|right|The High Definition pack placed higher quality models in the game, doubling the number of [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] used in the original models.]]
A second ''Half-Life'' [[expansion pack]], revolving around a security guard in the facility, was first announced in the second quarter of 2000 as part of an upcoming [[Dreamcast]] version of ''Half-Life'', under the working title ''Half-Life: Guard Duty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/p_halflife_dc | title = Half-Life : Dreamcast | last = Tylor | first = Martin | date = September 7, 2000 | website = [[Eurogamer]] | publisher = [[Gamer Network]] | accessdate = July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the main Dreamcast port was to be developed by Captivation Digital Laboratories, the new expansion was to be developed by [[Gearbox Software]], the same studio who developed ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-preview/1100-2606931/|title=''Half-Life'' Preview|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Chris|last=Kirchgasler|date=July 24, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publisher [[Sierra Entertainment]] later officially announced the expansion on August 30, 2000, revealing the name as ''Blue Shift''. As with ''Opposing Force'', the name ''Blue Shift'' has a double meaning, referring to both the [[blue shift]] light phenomenon, and the name of the [[shift work|shift]] that the protagonist is assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-half-life-includes-blue-shift/1100-2621501/|title=DC ''Half-Life'' Includes ''Blue Shift''|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Doug|last=Trueman|date=August 29, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dreamcast version of the game was set to include higher detail models and textures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ectshalf-life-dreamcast-hands-on/1100-2624258/|title=ECTS ''Half-Life'' Dreamcast Hands-On|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Ben|last=Stahl|date=September 5, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were double the [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon count]] of [[Valve Corporation|Valve Software's]] original ''Half-Life'' models.&lt;ref name="IGNDCrelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/084/084495p1.html|title=ECTS 2000: Hands-On With ''Half-Life''|website=[[IGN]]|date=August 1, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[European Computer Trade Show]] in September 2000, information about ''Blue Shift''{{'}}s story and development direction was revealed, along with a release date of November 1, 2000, for the Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life''.&lt;ref name="IGNDCrelease"/&gt; The game was delayed by Sierra to ensure the "high expectations of consumers" were met, anticipating release by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sierra-explains-half-life-delay/1100-2651756/|title=Sierra Explains Half-Life Delay|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Shane|last=Satterfield|date=November 8, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further media, gameplay and story information was released in the following weeks and months.&lt;ref name="IGNstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/094/094304p1.html|title=''Half-Life'' Week, Day 2: The ''Half-Life'' ''Blue''s ''Shift''|website=[[IGN]]|date=May 8, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/dreamcast/action/halflife/news.html?sid=2653878&amp;mode=all|title=''Half-Life'' Feature Preview|first=Ben|last=Stahl|date=November 16, 2000|accessdate=October 26, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717043713/http://uk.gamespot.com/dreamcast/action/halflife/news.html?sid=2653878&amp;mode=all|archivedate=July 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life'' still did not emerge, and speculation in May 2001 suggested the game would be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095363p1.html|title=''Half-Life'' For Dreamcast Is Canceled?|website=[[IGN]]|date=May 30, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 2001, Sierra terminated development on the Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life'', citing "changing market conditions" in a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-for-the-dreamcast-officially-cancelled/1100-2776155/|title=''Half-Life'' for the Dreamcast officially cancelled|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Shane|last=Satterfield|date=June 15, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; GamePro magazine, however, received and published a 2-page review of the game. A late stage build of the Dreamcast version was eventually leaked to the Internet, featuring essentially complete versions of both ''Half-Life'' and ''Blue Shift''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextdimension.org/betahalflife/dc.htm |title=Beta Half-Life for Sega Dreamcast|website=nextdimension|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life'' was cancelled, ''Blue Shift'' persevered. Prior to the cancellation of the Dreamcast version, Sierra announced on March 29, 2001, that ''Blue Shift'' would be released for PC as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/092/092908p1.html|title=Ready to Jump Back into the Black Mesa Research Facility?|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 29, 2001|accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack, a product that does not require the original ''Half-Life'' to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-blue-shift-announced/1100-2703247/|title=''Half-Life: Blue Shift'' announced|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Trey|last=Walker|date=March 30, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life'' would also be included in the PC version as the ''Half-Life'' High Definition pack. In addition, Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for ''Blue Shift'', but could be applied to both ''Half-Life'' and ''Opposing Force'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-blue-shift-qanda/1100-2716373/|title=''Half-Life: Blue Shift'' Q&amp;A|website=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 3, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in 2001, Gearbox announced that development of ''Blue Shift'' had been completed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2001-half-life-blue-shift-goes-gold/1100-2762024/|title=E3 2001: Half-Life: Blue Shift goes gold|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Amer|last=Ajami|date=May 18, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibited a playable version of the end product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2001-hands-onhalf-life-blue-shift/1100-2762022/|title=E3 2001 Hands-on ''Half-Life: Blue Shift''|website=[[GameSpot]]|first=Amer|last=Ajami|date=May 18, 2001|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on June 12, 2001.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/016/016257.html|title=''Half-Life: Blue Shift''|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blue Shift'' and the High Definition pack were initially absent from the launch of Valve's content delivery system [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in September 2003, despite the presence of both ''Half-Life'' and ''Opposing Force'' on the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=60659|title=Free ''Half-Life 1'' Expansion|website=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Tom|last=Bramwell|date=August 25, 2005|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on Steam on August 29, 2005 along with the High Definition Pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/438/|title=Steam Client Update Available|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|date=August 29, 2005|accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Shift'' was also published as part of Sierra's ''Half-Life: Generation'' compilation in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/half-life-generation|title=''Half-Life: Generation|website=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of Valve Software and [[Electronic Arts]]' ''Half Life 1: Anthology'' on September 26, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/half-life-1-anthology/pc-767570|title=''Half-Life 1: Anthology''|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blue Shift'' received a mixed reaction from critics, holding overall scores of 67.40%&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt; and 71/100 &lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; on the review aggregator sites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]], respectively. The game has sold around 800,000 copies at retail (this figure does not include later sales on Steam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21319|title=Analysis: Valve's Lifetime Retail Sales For ''Half-Life'', ''Counter-Strike'' Franchises|website=[[Gamasutra]]|first=Chris|last=Remo|date=December 3, 2008|accessdate=February 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for [[IGN]], critic Tal Blevins noted that ''Blue Shift''{{'}}s gameplay "is pretty much what we've come to expect out of ''Half-Life''" by blending action and puzzle solving, stating that the latter "were all logical and well done, although some of the jumping puzzles were frustrating". Though IGN praised the game for maintaining the "epic" feel of the original, Blevins was critical of the relatively short length of the game.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] reviewer [[Greg Kasavin]] agreed with many of IGN's criticisms, stating that "it's not that the game is easy so much that it's extremely short" and that ''Blue Shift'' "doesn't amount to much on its own terms". In addition, Kasavin described the graphical enhancements brought about by the High Definition pack as "helpful", but noted that "they still don't make ''Half-Life'' look like a new game—nor are many of the changes themselves very noticeable".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt;

Other reviews echoed complaints about the similarity of ''Blue Shift'' to previous games. [[GameSpy]]'s reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game "feels like just a few more levels for the original game", he noted that this is what ''Blue Shift'' was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of ''Half-Life''. Madigan described the single-player campaign as "decent" and commented that the High Definition pack made the game "worthy of consideration".&lt;ref name="GSpy"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]] echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'' and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; [[PC Zone|''PC Zone''{{'}}s]] Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as ''Blue Shift''{{'}}s "greatest achievement". ''PC Zone''{{'}}s review closed by commenting that "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it."&lt;ref name="PCZone"/&gt;

'''''Hegira''''' is a 1979 [[science fiction]] novel by [[US|American]] writer [[Greg Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hegira by Greg Bear|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1763383.Hegira|website=[[Goodreads]]|publisher=goodreads.com|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with themes including [[cyclic time]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[artificial life]], and artificial structures of planetary scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=Dave|title=Greg Bear Hegira|url=http://ansible.uk/writing/hegira.html|publisher=ansible.uk|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEGIRA: Bear, Greg|url=https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=14486506448&amp;searchurl=tn%3Dhegira%26sortby%3D17%26an%3Dgreg%2Bbear%26sgnd%3Don|publisher=abebooks.com|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In the novel, "young" humans (recreations of the medieval originals) are transported through the [[Big Collapse]], at the end of time, to seed the next cycle of the universe. They are transported to Hegira, an [[artificial world|artificial environment]] of the scale of the planet [[Jupiter]], which has habitats for several species on its surface. The habitats are protected and uncoupled from the universe's [[entropy]] by means of [[force shield|force fields]] projected by giant [[obelisk]]s. In the human realm, these are inscribed with the recorded history of humankind, sorted chronologically from the bottom up, including the science that went with it. People try to understand and copy what they can read on the obelisks, using balloons in some places to reach higher points on the obelisks.&lt;!--"Each city they pass through shows a different facet of how a human community might develop given slight differing versions of the basic information provided by the obelisks"--&gt;

A legend tells the protagonist that his beloved (frozen in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]) will awaken if he goes on quest to the rim walls of the habitat, and he does so. On the way, he lands on an island with a good view of an obelisk (at least {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} high) which is just tumbling down in the distance. Its fall causes a [[tsunami]] and devastates a continent. After the devastation, the inscriptions at the top of the fallen obelisk about human history are revealed. The hero's quest to the rim succeeds. He makes contact with an artificial intelligence guardian of Hegira, who tells him the story and advises him to go and populate the new universe since he has become part of the last one.

[[File:Vieux la Romaine Villa hypocauste.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hypocaust under the floor in a [[Roman villa]] in Vieux-la-Romaine, near [[Caen]], [[France]]]]

A '''hypocaust''' (Latin ''hypocaustum'') is a system of central heating in a building that produces and circulates hot air below the floor of a room, and may also warm the walls with a series of pipes through which the hot air passes. This air can warm the upper floors as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0o1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=hypocaust&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust&amp;f=false|title=A rudimentary treatise on warming and ventilation: being a concise exposition of the general principles of the art of warming and ventilating domestic and public buildings, mines, lighthouses, ships, etc|last=Tomlinson|first=Charles|date=1850-01-01|publisher=J. Weale|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=53|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''hypo'' meaning "under" and ''caust-'', meaning "burnt" (as in ''[[caustic (disambiguation)|caustic]]''). The earliest reference to such a system suggests that the temple of Ephesus in 350 BC was heated in this manner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S64mLfBs2vAC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=hypocaust&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust&amp;f=false|title=Central Heating, Installation, Maintenance and Repair|last=Mitchell|first=Patrick|date=2008-03-01|publisher=WritersPrintShop|year=|isbn=9781904623625|location=|pages=3|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Vitruvius]] attributes its invention to [[Sergius Orata]] in c.80 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VmmHdm5STIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=hypocaust&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust%20greek&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|last=Forbes|first=|date=1966-01-01|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004006265|location=|pages=54–55|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its invention improved the hygiene and living conditions of citizens, and was a forerunner of modern [[central heating]].

==Roman operation==
[[Image:Villa Romana La Olmeda 030 Pedrosa De La Vega - Saldaña (Palencia).jpg|thumb|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa at [[La Olmeda]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and León]], Spain).]]
 
Hypocausts were used for heating hot baths and other public buildings in [[Ancient Rome]], but their use in homes was limited due to their high cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ruins of Roman hypocausts have been found throughout Europe (for example in Italy, England,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/hypocaust|title=hypocaust {{!}} architecture|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSiK-qh99acC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=hypocaust+spain&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja47L5sr_RAhVJthoKHbTBBP0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust%20spain&amp;f=false|title=Vandals to Visigoths: Rural Settlement Patterns in Early Medieval Spain|last=Carr|first=Karen Eva|date=2002-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=|isbn=0472108913|location=|pages=185|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Switzerland and Germany&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Y3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=hypocaust+modern+heating&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust%20modern%20heating&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|date=1965-01-01|publisher=Brill Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=49–50|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in Africa&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well.

The ceiling of the hypocaust was raised above the ground by pillars, called [[pilae stacks]], supporting a layer of tiles, followed by a layer of concrete, then the floor tiles of the rooms above. Hot air and smoke from the furnace would circulate through this enclosed area and then up through clay or tile flues in the walls of the rooms above to outlets in the roof, thereby heating the floors and walls of the rooms above. These tile flues were referred to as ''caliducts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kp_DAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201&amp;dq=roman+caliduct&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS_YaH2fbaAhUWo4MKHWUdBSoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20caliduct&amp;f=false|title=Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture|last=Harris|first=Cyril M.|date=2013-02-28|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486132112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rooms intended to be the warmest were located nearest to the furnace below, the heat output of which was regulated by adjusting the amount of wood fed to the fire. It was expensive and labour-intensive to run a hypocaust, as it required constant attention to the fire and a lot of fuel, so it was a feature usually encountered only in large villas and public baths.

[[image:Caldarium.JPG|thumb|[[Caldarium]] from the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Roman Baths]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], in Britain. The floor has been removed to reveal the empty spaces through which the hot air would flow.]]

[[Vitruvius]] describes their construction and operation in his work ''[[De architectura]]'' in about 15 BC, including details about how fuel could be conserved by building the hot room ([[caldarium]]) for men next to that for women, with both adjacent to the [[tepidarium]], so as to run the public baths efficiently. He also describes a device for adjusting the heat by a [[bronze]] ventilator in the domed ceiling.

Remains of many Roman hypocausts have survived throughout Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa.

==Non-Roman analogues==
Excavations at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in what is now [[Pakistan]] have unearthed what is believed to be a hypocaust lined with [[bitumen]]-coated bricks. If it fulfilled a similar role, the structure would pre-date the earliest Roman hypocaust by as much as 2000 years.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1984–1985, in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], excavations in the ancient settlement of [[Dzalisi]] uncovered a large castle complex, featuring a well-preserved hypocaust built between 200–400 BC.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Dating back to 1000 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bean|first=Robert|last2=Olesen|first2=Bjarne W.|last3=Kim|first3=Kwang Woo|year=2010|title=History of Radiant Heating &amp; Cooling Systems|url=http://libraries.state.ma.us/login?gwurl=http://go.galegroup.com.resources.library.brandeis.edu/ps/i.do?p=PROF&amp;sw=w&amp;u=mlin_m_brandeis&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA238178341&amp;asid=e8e9fe9b1cb35f2b7449f8a398832c20.|journal=ASHRAE|volume=52|pages=|via=Gale: Educators Reference Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean houses have traditionally used ''[[ondol]]'' to provide floor heating on similar principles as the hypocaust, drawing smoke from a wood fire typically used for cooking. Ondol heating was common in Korean homes until the 1960s, by which time dedicated ondol installations were typically used to warm the main room of the house, burning a variety of fuels such as coal and biomass.

On a smaller scale, in Northern China the [[Kang bed-stove]] has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthyheating.com/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling/History_of_Radiant_Heating_and_Cooling_Part_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhuang&gt;{{citation |title=Chinese kang as a domestic heating system in rural northern China—A review |first=Zhi |last=Zhuang |first2=Yuguo |last2=Li |first3=Bin |last3=Chen |last4=Jiye |last5=Guo |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=111–119 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2008.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Romans==
[[File:2006 0814HistriaTerme20060371.jpg|Detail of flues in a Roman wall.|thumb|Wall flues for hot air circulation.]]
With the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the hypocaust fell into disuse, especially in the western provinces. In Britain, from c.400 until c.1900, it was thought that central heating did not exist, and hot baths were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=[[Winston Churchill]]|title=[[A History of the English Speaking Peoples|A History of the English Speaking Peoples: The Birth of Britain]]|publisher=[[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]]|year=1956|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an evolution of the hypocaust was used in some monasteries in calefactories, or warming rooms, which were heated via underground fires, as in the Roman hypocaust, but retained heat via granite stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/03/heat-storage-hypocausts-air-heating-middle-ages.html | title=Heat Storage Hypocausts: Air Heating in the Middle Ages, Low Tech Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eastern Europe, the development of radiant ceramic or stone stoves were also used. In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the Roman system was adopted for the heating of Hispano-Islamic ([[Al Andalus]]) baths (hammams).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLAryx8bC8UC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=hypocaust+spain&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja47L5sr_RAhVJthoKHbTBBP0Q6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=hypocaust%20spain&amp;f=false|title=Al-Andalus: The Art of Islamic Spain|last=Dodds|first=Jerrilynn Denise|last2=N.Y.)|first2=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|last3=Alhambra|first3=Patronato de la|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=|isbn=9780870996368|location=|pages=141|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A derivation of hypocaust, the [[Gloria (heating system)|gloria]], was in use in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] until the arrival of modern heating. After the fuel (mainly wood) was reduced to ashes, the air intake was closed to keep hot air inside and to slow [[combustion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5967">'''Individualistic culture''' is a society which is characterized by [[individualism]], which is the prioritization or emphasis, of the individual over the entire group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures are oriented around the self, being independent instead of identifying with a group mentality. They see each other as only loosely linked, and value personal goals over group interests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Individualistic cultures tend to have a more diverse population and are characterized with emphasis on personal achievements, and a rational assessment of both the beneficial and detrimental aspects of relationships with others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individualistic cultures have such unique aspects of communication as being a low power-distance culture and having a low-context communication style. Highly individualistic cultures include the U.S., Australia, Great Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication|last=Rothwell|first=J.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=65–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low power distance==
Power distance is defined to be the degree to which unequal distribution of power is accepted in a culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Low power distance cultures challenge authority, encourage a reduction of power differences between management and employees, and encourage the use of power legitimately. Low power distance is more likely to occur in an individualistic culture, because in a collectivist culture, people protect the well being of the group and established order&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so they would be less likely to challenge authority or people in power. Even though individualistic cultures are more likely to be low power distance, these cultures don't expect to completely eliminate power difference. People within this low power distance culture, however, are more likely to respond to such imbalances in power with more negative emotional responses than in the alternative, high power distance cultures. Low power distance cultures include Austria, Israel, Denmark, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Sweden. The U.S. ranks 38th on the scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Low-context communication style==
Individualistic cultures are also more likely to have a low-context communication style. This means that communication is precise, direct, and specific.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hidden Differences: Doing Business with the Japanese|last=Hall|first=Edward|publisher=Anchor Press/Doubleday|year=1987|isbn=0385238835|location=University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in high-context communication, reading between the lines is not necessary in low-context communication. This explicit communication is used in order to prevent any form of misunderstanding between cultures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ability to articulate the thoughts and opinions one holds as well as to express them eloquently are encouraged, as is persuasive speaking. Low-context communication is all content and no relationship dimension.

== Emotion display and display rules ==
Individualistic cultures tend to prioritize the individual person over the group,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture's Consequences|last=Hofstede|first=Geert|publisher=SAGE|year=2001|isbn=0803973241|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can be seen in how the display rules vary from a collectivist culture compared to an individualistic culture. Display rules are the rules that exist in different cultures that determine how emotion should be displayed publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekman|first=Paul|date=1975|title=Facial Areas and Emotional Information|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=25|pages=21–29|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1975.tb00577.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an individualistic culture, self-expression is highly valued, making the display rules less strict and allowing people to display intense emotion such as: happiness, anger, love, etc. While in a collectivist culture, moderation and self-control is highly valued for the well being of the group, and collectivist cultures therefore tend to restrain from showing emotion in public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Conflict strategies ==
Conflict strategies are methods used to resolve different problems. There are different approaches to resolving conflict, and depending the culture a person is brought up in, the more likely it is for them to use a certain approach. Since individualistic culture sets greater value to personal achievement, contrary to collectivist cultures who value harmony,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S|date=2006|title=The effects of national culture and face concerns on intention to apologize|url=|journal=Journal of Intercultural Communication Research|volume=3|pages=183–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is more likely for a person from an individualistic culture to use competition as their method of resolving conflict. When using competition as an approach to resolving conflict, a person is more confrontational and seeks to achieve his or her own goals with no regard of the goals of others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sillars|first=A.|date=1980|title=Attributions and communication in roommate conflicts|url=|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=47|pages=180–200|doi=10.1080/03637758009376031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach a person seeks domination, which means to get others to do what the person wants instead of what they initially wanted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the contrary, a collectivist culture would more likely use a less confrontational approach such as accommodation to end the conflict with compromise so that each party is benefited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">'''Interactive communication''' is an exchange of ideas where both participants, whether human, machine or art form, are active and can have an effect on one another. It is a [[:wikt:dynamic|dynamic]], two-way flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.elprofesionaldelainformacion.com/contenidos/2016/mar/06.pdf|title = A profile of the interactive communication professional foundations, current trends and perspectives|last = Soler-Adillon|first = Joan|date = 2016|website = Elprofesionaldelainformacion.com|publisher = Elprofesionaldelainformacion|access-date = 30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many forms of [[communication]] previously thought one-way, like books and television, have become [[interactive]] with the rise of computers, the Internet, and digital and mobile devices. These developing collaborative technologies, or [[new media]], have rapidly increased the opportunities for interactive communication across mediums, disciplines, cultures, social classes, locations, and even time. 

Interactive communication is a modern term that encompasses these evolving forms of [[conversation]]. It is a primary characteristic of the present [[Information Age]]. New experiments in [[interaction design]] are evolving on a daily basis. 

Interactive communication forms include basic dialogue and [[nonverbal communication]], [[gamebooks|game-books]], interactive fiction and storytelling, [[hypertext]], interactive television and movies, photo and video manipulation, [[video sharing]], video games, social media, [[user-generated content]], interactive marketing and public relations, [[augmented reality]], [[ambient intelligence]], and virtual reality. 

==History of Interactivity==
Interactivity is rooted in basic communication, the development of [[rhetoric]], and the evolution of [[social interface]]. Gesture, touch and [[body language]] were the earliest forms of communication. The time line of spoken and written language’s emergence is still under debate. Rhetoric is the effective use of language.

Once human [[cognition]] and thought evolved, varieties of language and communication increased exponentially. Braille and [[sign language]] are forms of interface, as are the arts of [[music]], cooking, photography and [[fashion]]. Politics, trade, [[international relations]], immigration and war are examples of group interaction. 

[[Industrial design]], the aesthetics and engineering of human and machine interface, arrived with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Examples of perfected [[usability]] include the chopstick, the corkscrew and the paper clip. The automobile dashboard, the iconic [[Fender Stratocaster]] electrical guitar, and popular telephones from the Western Electric [[Model 302 telephone|Model 302]] rotary dial to the Apple iPhone multi-touch screen are examples of effective [[Control panel (engineering)|control panels]]. 

Interest in interactive communication has grown with the increase in [[human-computer interaction]]. Hardware peripherals include keyboards, [[Computer mouse|mice]], game controllers and webcams. [[Graphical user interface]] examples include the [[desktop metaphor]], software programs like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, websites and web browsers, search engines, and the increasing number of smartphone [[mobile applications]]. 

An important consideration in the development of any modern [[user interface]] is its interactivity.

The '''International Research Center for Traditional Polyphony''' ('''IRCTP''' or '''Polyphonic Center''') is an academic organization focused on the study of the phenomenon of traditional [[vocal]] [[polyphony]]. It is a part of [[Tbilisi Vano Sarajishvili State Conservatory]]. Establishment of IRCTP was announced during the First International Symposium of Traditional Polyphony in 2002, and it was logistically established by the order of the Rector of [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in February 2003. Its director is Rusudan Tsurtsumia. The head of its International Bureau is [[Joseph Jordania]]. Central activity of the Polyphonic Center is organizing [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]], with subsequent publication of the presented papers, fostering dissemination of the knowledge on human musical cultures and establishing close professional contacts between ethnomusicologists interested in study of the phenomenon of traditional [[choral singing]].

==History ==
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been known among ethnomusicologists as the country with extremely rich traditions of [[vocal]] [[polyphony]] since the 1920s. Study of vocal polyphony has been one of the central issues for Georgian ethnomusicology from the second half of the 19th century. In 1972 [[Union of Composers]] of [[Soviet Union]] organized the conference dedicated to traditional polyphony in Georgia (this was the very first conference in the world, fully dedicated to traditional polyphony). The ongoing series of [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|conferences]] dedicated to the problems of traditional polyphony, with the wide participation of the experts from Soviet Union, Europe and America, were organized in 1984, 1986 and 1988. The following conference (scheduled in 1990) was initially postponed and later canceled due to the political instability in post-soviet Georgia. The series of biannual conferences on traditional polyphony were revived in 1998 and 2000, leading to the organizing of the First International Symposium on Traditional Polyphony in 2002. The first symposium was preceded by proclamation of Georgian traditional polyphony among the '''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''' by [[UNESCO]] in 2001. Representative of '''UNESCO''' attended the Symposium, providing support of '''UNESCO'''. The Polyphonic Centre has been supported during the recent years by the Presidents of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and [[Mikhail Saakashvili]]. For several years the Polyphonic Centre was also supported by the Japanese government.
There has been a steady increase in interest towards the study of traditional [[polyphony]] ([[choral singing]]) during the recent years. In the 1970s there were two initial conferences organized on this subject, in the 1980s four conference, in the 1990s three conferences, and during the first decade of the 21st century nine conferences had been organized in several countries (apart from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in [[Taiwan]] in 2002, in Austria in 2005 and 2008, in [[Portugal]] in 2007). A centre for the study of European traditional polyphony was established at [[Vienna University]] in 2005, and the study group on multipart music of [[ICTM]] was established in 2009 and organized a conference in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2010. The earliest international organization to dedicate its activity entirely to study of traditional choral singing was '''Polifonies Vivante''', organized in France during the 1991-1994 by [[Simha Arom]].

==International symposia==
[[International]] [[Academic conference|symposia]] on the problems of traditional polyphony had been organized biannually from 2002. The last one was held on September 26 - October 1, 2016. All of them had been organized in late September - early October, at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. The geography of representation of scholars from different countries of the world had been steadily increasing. A group of international expert-ethnomusicologists, including [[Simha Arom]] from France, Dieter Christensen from the United States, Franz Fodermayr from Austria, Polo Vallejo from Spain, had been participating in virtually every symposia, together with ethnomusicologists from different countries (including experts from China, Japan, Australia, Canada, eastern and western [[Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]]. The general program of the symposia is stable and contains twelve themes, covering wide range of research topics, including problems of [[vocal]] and [[instrumental]] polyphony, [[Folk music|folk]] and [[church music]], regional styles, elements of [[musical language]], [[social]] and [[gender]] aspects, history, links with [[popular music]]al styles. Participating scholars are traditionally provided by the hosts with hotel accommodation, internal transport and food during the Symposium. In 2010 for the first time a special theme was added (''vocal polyphony is Asia''). 2012 symposium (September 24–29) had the special theme ''comparative research in traditional polyphony'', 2014 Symposium main theme was ''Polyphony in Minority Music'' (September 22–26, 2014), and 2016 symposium was dedicated to the geographic dynamics of traditional polyphony (September 26 - October 1, 2016). Next symposium is planning to a later date: October 29 - November 3, 2018.

==Publications==
The most important publication of the IRCTP is the [[proceedings]] of the [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]]. They are usually prepared under the editorship of Rusudan Tsurtsumia and [[Joseph Jordania]]. All the papers of the previous symposia are freely available on the website of the IRCTP on both Georgian and English languages &lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.polyphony.ge/en/proceedings/ Papers presented at the Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulletins are another periodic publication of the IRCTP &lt;ref&gt;[http://polyphony.ge/en/category/publications-2/bulletin/ Bulletins of the Polyphonic Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Centre also published several collections of the articles, including '''Seventeen Arguments on Georgian Polyphony''' and numerous audio and video materials.

'''''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths''''' is an original [[direct-to-video]] [[Animation|animated]] [[superhero film]] released on February 23, 2010. It is based on the abandoned direct-to-video feature ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'', which was intended as a bridge between the then-concluding ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated television series and its then forthcoming sequel series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. ''Crisis on Two Earths'' was reworked from the ''Worlds Collide'' script to remove references to the TV series' continuity. The film is directed by [[Lauren Montgomery]] &amp; [[Sam Liu]] and [[screenplay|written]] by [[Dwayne McDuffie]].&lt;ref name=cbrobit&gt;{{cite web |first=Kiel |last=Phegley |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=30969 |title=Milestone Creator Dwayne McDuffie has Died |publisher=Valnet Inc. |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |location=United States }} [https://www.webcitation.org/5whQWxgt5?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=30969 WebCitation archive] (requires scrolldown)&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise of ''Crisis on Two Earths'' is borrowed from the 1964 [[Gardner Fox]]-scripted ''Justice League of America'' #29–30 entitled [[Crisis (DC Comics)#"Crisis on Earth-Three!"|"Crisis on Earth-Three!"]] and the 2000 [[Grant Morrison]] ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' graphic novel, with a heroic [[Lex Luthor]] from an alternate universe coming to the [[Justice League]]'s universe for help against the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. The film is the seventh of the [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] released by [[Warner Premiere]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The two-disc special edition also includes an animated short [[DC Showcase: The Spectre|featuring the Spectre]].

On August 11, 2015, Warner Home Video re-released the film in a combo pack which includes a DVD and Blu-Ray copy, a digital copy, and the graphic novel on which it was based.

==Plot==
In an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where the roles of the heroes and villains are reversed from their counterparts in the mainstream DC Universe, heroic analogues of [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the "Quantum Trigger" from the headquarters of the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Hawkgirl]] respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members ([[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]], [[Superwoman]], [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic [[Justice League]] by activating a dimensional travel device.

Luthor locates a police station, but is mistaken for the evil Luthor and ends up strip-searched. The Justice League is summoned and [[Superman]]'s [[x-ray]] vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at [[Stryker's Island]]. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Wally West|Flash]] and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth.

Arriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]], who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives. His daughter, [[Rose Wilson|Rose]], however, regards him as a coward. Martian Manhunter inadvertently reads her mind and explains that as a military man her father actually holds life more dear than others. Martian Manhunter later foils an assassination attempt on Rose, and the pair fall in love.

Owlman has developed a weapon, the Quantum Eigenstate Device or Q.E.D., which the Syndicate intend to use as the equalizer to the threat of a nuclear reprisal. When pressed by Superwoman, Owlman reveals that he's secretly planning to overthrow Ultraman and take control of the Crime Syndicate. He also admits the weapon can [[Planet killer|destroy entire worlds]]. Believing there are many parallel Earths, and that each one develops from the choices that each person makes, Owlman becomes obsessed with the idea that [[nihilism|nothing he does can possibly matter]], as there will always be parallel worlds where he explored another option. As a result, he searches for Earth-Prime, the very first Earth from which all other universes originated, intending to use the Q.E.D. to destroy it and spark a chain reaction that will erase the entire multiverse, as it is the only action that would not result in the creation of another universe. Superwoman agrees to help him, as it would give her the power to kill everyone who's ever lived. Owlman sends Superwoman with three of her lieutenants to the League's dimension, and on the Watchtower they battle Batman, [[Aquaman]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and [[Red Tornado]]. Superwoman and one of her lieutenants escape with the Quantum Trigger, but are followed by Batman.

Batman defeats Superwoman and summons the League. Johnny, hopeful to reinstate fear in the Syndicate, decides to come down to commit big crimes. Power Ring rejects this  because Scarlet Archer had been arrested by J'onn. J'onn and Rose bond, and Rose decides to learn the location of the Syndicate base to allow the Justice League to confront them. The League arrive at the Crime Syndicate's moon-base with the captive Superwoman, and eventually battle the Syndicate. Owlman fights off Batman and takes the Q.E.D. bomb to Earth-Prime, finding it to be uninhabited and lifeless, having suffered an unknown cataclysm that caused it to leave solar orbit. Luthor speculates that a speedster might be able to vibrate and match the temporal vibration of the teleported Q.E.D. device and open a portal. Flash volunteers but Batman states that he isn't fast enough, only [[Johnny Quick]] is. Johnny agrees and opens a portal.

Batman pursues Owlman to Earth-Prime and engages in a brutal battle with his doppelganger. Batman manages to teleport Owlman and the Q.E.D. device to another uninhabited Earth, and triggers the Q.E.D. Seeing what is about to happen, Owlman does not even attempt to defuse the bomb, simply saying "It doesn't matter" after realizing that an alternate Owlman in the multiverse would do the opposite action regardless of his choice. The bomb destroys the alternate Earth, killing Owlman in the process. Batman returns to the Syndicate's Earth, where the strain of acting as a vibratory conduit has aged Johnny Quick to near death. Before dying, Johnny correctly deduces Batman lied about Flash not being fast enough and knew what would happen. Despite this, he shows no ill will toward Batman, dying with a smile. Martian Manhunter returns, accompanied by President Wilson and the U.S. Marines, and together they arrest Ultraman, Superwoman, and Power Ring.

Wilson thanks the heroes for helping save their world and tells them he had ordered the Marines to support the local police forces and resume on arresting the remaining members of the Syndicate. Although Rose asks Martian Manhunter to remain with her, the group return to their dimension. Batman and Superman later discuss a membership drive with the five heroes summoned previously greeting the Justice League.

== Production ==
In 2004, [[Bruce Timm]] revealed that a [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] [[direct-to-video]] ''[[Justice League]]'' feature was in development to connect ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episodeC/episodeC.htm|title=World's Collide|author=|date=|website=jl.toonzone.net|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was titled as ''Justice League: Worlds Collide''. One of the objectives of the film was to explain how [[Wonder Woman]] acquired her Invisible-Jet. However, the project was finally scrapped by [[Warner Bros.]] In 2008, however, Timm stated that ''Justice League: Worlds Collide'' could be released someday in the future.&lt;ref name="cbrobit"/&gt;

Finally, ''Worlds Collide'' was rewritten by the late [[Dwayne McDuffie]] for [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]] as ''Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths'', but removing all connections with the animated series. Also, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s Green Lantern was changed with [[Hal Jordan]]'s Green Lantern.

'''Lancôme''' is a French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house that distributes products internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chesters|first=Anna|title=A brief history of Lancôme|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/mar/19/brief-history-lancome|accessdate=11 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancôme is part of the [[L'Oréal]] Luxury Products division, which is its parent company and offers [[skin care]], [[fragrances]], and makeup at higher-end prices.

==History==
[[Image:Lancome NYC Boutique Exterior.jpg|thumb|right|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side|Lancôme Boutique on NYC's Upper West Side]]

Founded in 1935 by Guillaume d'Ornano and his business partner Armand Petitjean in France, as originally a fragrance house. The name "Lancôme" was inspired by the forest of Lancosme that lies in the Indre valley in the heart of France in the region of La Brenne - the name was chosen by Guillaume's wife Elisabeth d'Ornano. The roses in the area inspired the company's symbol of the single golden rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.in/content/exclusive-80-years-lancome-film/|title=Exclusive: 80 years of Lancôme in a 2-minute film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancôme launched its first five fragrances in 1935 at the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|World's Fair]] in Brussels: ''Tendre Nuit'', ''Bocages'', ''Conquete'', ''Kypre'' and ''Tropiques''. Petitjean entered into the luxury skincare market, launching Nutrix, his first "all-purpose repair cream" in 1936, followed by make-up, cosmetics, and skincare products. Lancôme was acquired by L'oreal in 1964, and quickly became part of its luxury products division.

On 5 June 2016, Lancôme canceled a promotional concert by Hong Kong [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy]] singer [[Denise Ho]] that was scheduled to be held on 19 June in [[Sheung Wan]].&lt;ref name="scraps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeung|first1=Raymond|title=Lancome scraps Hong Kong concert with Denise Ho: online backlash over move to distance itself from pro-democracy star|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1966367/lancome-scraps-hong-kong-concert-denise-ho-online-backlash|work=South China Morning Post|date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation was due to a boycott campaign launched by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]-controlled ''[[Global Times]]'', which denigrated the [[Cantopop]] star for supposedly advocating Hong Kong and Tibet independence.&lt;ref name="scraps"/&gt; Lancôme posted on [[Facebook]] that Ho is not a spokesperson for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lancome cancels concert after Chinese online backlash|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36457450|publisher=BBC News|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation drew a heavy backlash in Hong Kong, resulting in some Lancôme shops in Hong Kong shutting down during the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denise Ho controversy: protesters march despite Lancome closing Hong Kong stores|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1969055/denise-ho-controversy-protesters-march-despite-lancome|work=South China Morning Post|date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hong Kong merchants refused to accept the political pressure from the [[China|Chinese]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong merchant cancel corporation with Lancôme Chinese|url=http://www.appledaily.com.tw/realtimenews/article/international/20160611/883724/applesearch/%E8%81%B2%E6%8F%B4%E4%BD%95%E9%9F%BB%E8%A9%A9%E3%80%80%E6%B8%AF%E5%95%86%E6%94%BE%E6%A3%84%E8%98%AD%E8%94%BB%E6%AF%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%E8%A8%82%E5%96%AE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Listerine]], another brand that Ho represents, retained the singer despite criticism from the ''Global Times'' for hiring Ho as its spokesperson.&lt;ref name="scraps"/&gt;

'''Laura Smith Haviland''' (December 20, 1808- April 20, 1898) was an American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], [[suffragette]], and social reformer. She was an important figure in the history of the [[Underground Railroad]].

==Early years and family==
Laura Smith Haviland was born on December 20, 1808, in [[Kitley Township, Ontario|Kitley Township]], Ontario, Canada to American parents, Daniel Smith and Asenath "Sene" Blancher,&lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, William Wade. ''Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV.'' Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory. Note: Her first name is recorded as both "Asenath" and "Sene" in the Quaker Records. Sene was a short form of the name Asenath, not her full given name. She was born in Jamaica, VT.&lt;/ref&gt; who had immigrated shortly before her birth.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland wrote that Daniel was "a man of ability and influence, of clear perceptions, and strong reasoning powers,"&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; while her mother Sene was "of a gentler turn, ... a quiet spirit, benevolent and kind to all, and much beloved by all who knew her."&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; The Smiths, farmers of modest means, were devout members of the [[Society of Friends]], better known as Quakers. Haviland's father was a minister in the Society and her mother was an [[Religious elder|Elder]].&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

Though the Quakers dressed plainly, and strictly forbade dancing, singing, and other pursuits they deemed frivolous, many of their views were progressive by the standards of the day.&lt;ref name=Eisenmann&gt;Eisenmann, Linda. ''Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States,'' pages 332-333. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quakers encouraged the equal education of men and women, an extraordinarily forward-thinking position in an age when most individuals were illiterate, and providing a woman with a thorough education was largely viewed as unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith ''Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics,'' Pages 1-3. Roxbury, MA: Roxbury Pub., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, R. Drew Page 111"&gt;Smith, R. Drew ''Freedom's Distant Shores: American Protestants and Post-colonial Alliances,'' Page 111. Waco: Baylor University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Quaker women as well as men acted as ministers.&lt;ref name="Smith, R. Drew Page 111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, Susan. ''Industry of Devotion: The Transformation of Women's Work in England,'' Page 115. New York: Columbia University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; While most Quakers did not agitate vocally for abolition, the majority condemned slavery as brutal and unjust.&lt;ref name=Eisenmann/&gt; It was in this atmosphere that Haviland was raised.

In 1815, her family left Canada and returned to the United States, settling in the remote and sparsely populated town of [[Cambria, New York|Cambria]], in western New York.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; At the time there was no school near their home, and for the next six years Haviland's education consisted of little more than "a spelling lesson" given to her daily by her mother.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland described herself as an inquisitive child, deeply interested in the workings of the world around her, who at a young age began questioning her parents about everything from scripture to Newton's [[Law of Universal Gravitation]]. Once she had mastered spelling, Haviland supplemented her meager education by devouring every book she could borrow from friends, relatives, and neighbors, reading everything from religious material to serious historical studies.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

At sixteen, Laura met Charles Haviland, Jr., a devout young Quaker, whose parents were both respected ministers. They were married on November 11, 1825, at Lockport, New York. According to Laura, Charles was a devoted husband and theirs was a happy marriage.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They were the parents of eight children.

The Havilands spent the first four years of their marriage in Royalton Township, near Lockport, New York, before moving in September, 1829, to [[Raisin Township, Michigan|Raisin]], [[Lenawee County, Michigan|Lenawee County]] in the [[Michigan Territory]]. They settled three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from the homestead her parents acquired four years earlier.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Michigan was then a largely unsettled wilderness, but land was cheap, and there were a number of other Quakers in the vicinity.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

==Anti-slavery work and the Raisin Institute==
Haviland vividly recalled seeing African Americans verbally abused, and even physically assaulted, in Lockport, New York, when she was a child. These experiences, combined with the horrific descriptions in [[John Woolman]]'s history of the slave-trade, made an indelible impression.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The pictures of these crowded slave-ships, with the cruelties of the slave system after they were brought to our country, often affected me to tears ... My sympathies became too deeply enlisted for the poor negroes who were thus enslaved for time to efface.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Haviland and other members of the Raisin community helped [[Elizabeth Margaret Chandler]] organize the [[Logan Female Anti-Slavery Society]] in 1832. It was the first [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] organization in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;''Laura Smith Haviland.'' Michigan Historical Center, Department of History, Arts and Libraries. The Official State of Michigan Website. http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19271_19357-163242--,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, in 1837, Haviland and her husband founded a "''manual labor school ... designed for indigent children,''" which was later known as the Raisin Institute. Haviland instructed the girls in household chores, while her husband and one of her brothers, Harvey Smith, taught the boys to perform farm work.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; At the Havilands' insistence, the school was open to all children, "regardless of race, creed, or sex." It was the first racially integrated school in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berson&gt;Berson, Robin Kadison. ''Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American History,'' pages 114-120. Greenwood Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Haviland's white students, upon learning they were to study with African Americans, threatened to leave. Most were persuaded to remain, however, and Laura wrote that once the students were together in the classroom their prejudices "soon melted away."&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In 1838, Harvey Smith sold his farm, and the proceeds were used to erect accommodations for fifty students. The Havilands expanded the school's curriculum, operating it more closely along the lines of traditional elementary and secondary schools.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They then hired a graduate of [[Oberlin College]] to serve as the school's principal. Due to their diligence, the Raisin Institute was soon recognized as one of the best schools in the Territory.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

As the Havilands became more actively involved in anti-slavery work, tensions grew within the Quaker community.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; There was a split between the so-called "radical abolitionists," like the Havilands, who wanted immediate emancipation, and the majority of Orthodox Quakers. Although the Quakers condemned slavery, most did not approve of active participation in abolitionist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Grover, Kathryn. ''The Fugitive's Gibraltar: Escaping Slaves and Abolitionism in New Bedford, Massachusetts,'' page 32. Boston: Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; By 1839, in order to continue with their abolitionist work, the Havilands, her parents, and fourteen other like-minded Quakers, felt compelled to resign their membership.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, William Wade. ''Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV,'' Page 1366. Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory.&lt;/ref&gt; They then joined a group of [[Methodist]]s known as the [[Wesleyans]], who were equally devoted to the abolitionist cause.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In the spring of 1845, an epidemic of [[erysipelas]] killed six members of Haviland's family, including both of her parents, her husband, and her youngest child.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Haviland also fell ill, but survived. At thirty-six, Haviland found herself a widow with seven children to support, a farm to run, the Raisin Institute to manage, and substantial debts to repay.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Sadly, just two years later tragedy struck again, when her eldest son died.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Due to lack of funds, Haviland was forced to close the Raisin Institute in 1849.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In spite of her personal losses, she continued with her abolitionist work, and in 1851, she helped organize the Refugee Home Society in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada. Fugitive slaves were settled there, a church and school were erected for them, and each family was given twenty-five acres to farm.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S. ''History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War,'' page 151. Greenwood Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Laura remained on for several months as the settlement's teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Philip S. ''History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War,'' pages 151-152. Greenwood Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; She then traveled to Ohio, where, with her daughter Anna, she taught in a school founded for African American children in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

By 1856, she had raised enough funds to reopen the Raisin Institute, and returned to Michigan.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; The new curriculum included having former slaves give lectures about the realities of life on a slave plantation.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; The Institute closed once again in 1864, after most of the staff, and some of the students, enlisted to fight during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Work for the Underground Railroad==
During the 1830s, the Haviland family began hiding runaway slaves on their farm. Their home became the first [[Underground Railroad]] station established in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; After her husband's death, Haviland continued to shelter fugitive slaves in her home, in some cases, personally escorting them to Canada.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; She played an important role in the Detroit branch of the group, where she was considered railroad "superintendent", with [[George DeBaptiste]] the "president"and William Lambert the "vice president" or "secretary".&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Jacqueline L. From Midnight to Dawn: The Last Tracks of the Underground Railroad. Anchor, 2008. p200-209&lt;/ref&gt;

She also traveled to the South on multiple occasions to aid escaped slaves. Her first trip was made in 1846, in an effort to free the children of fugitive slaves, Willis and Elsie Hamilton. The children were still in the possession of their mother's former slave owner, John P. Chester, a tavern-keeper in [[Washington County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1850 United States Census. The 4th Subdivision, Washington Co., TN, Page 113A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chester had learned of the Hamilton's whereabouts and sent slave-catchers after them. When that failed, Chester attempted to lure the Hamiltons to his plantation with the promise that they would be treated as freedmen and reunited with their children.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Suspecting a trap, Haviland went to [[Tennessee]] in their place, accompanied by her son Daniel and a student from the Raisin Institute, James Martin, who posed as Willis Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Mr. Chester became irate once he realized Willis Hamilton was not with Mrs. Haviland. He held the trio at gunpoint, threatening to murder them, kidnap James Martin, and enslave him in Willis Hamilton's stead.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; They managed to escape, but Mr. Chester did not forget Laura Haviland. His family would continue to haunt her for fifteen years, pursuing her legally in court and privately with slave catchers, while barraging her with derogatory letters.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; The following letter was sent by Chester's son, Thomas K. Chester, in February 1847. It's provides a good example of the tone which permeated the Chester family's correspondence with Haviland:

{{quote|... By your cunning villainies you have deprived us of our just rights, of our own property. ... Thanks be to an all wise and provident God that, my father has more of that sable kind of busy fellows, greasy, slick, and fat; and they are not cheated to death out of their hard earnings by villainous and infernal abolitionists, whose philanthropy is interest, and whose only desire is to swindle the slave-holder out of his own property, and convert its labor to their own infernal aggrandizement ... Who do you think would parley with a thief, a robber of man's just rights, recognized by the glorious Constitution of our Union! Such a condescension would damn an honest man, would put modesty to the blush. What! To engage in a contest with you? A rogue, a damnable thief, a Negro thief, an out-breaker, a criminal in the sight of all honest men; ... I would rather be caught with another man's sheep on my back than to engage in such a subject, and with such an individual as old Laura Haviland, a damned nigger-stealer ...

You can tell Elsie that since our return my father bought her eldest daughter; that she is now his property and the mother of a likely boy, that I call Daniel Haviland after your pretty son. ... What do you think your portion will be at the great Day of Judgment? I think it will be the inner temple of hell.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;}}

Haviland responded, sarcastically thanking him for naming the child after her family and stating that she hoped ''"like Moses, may he become instrumental in leading his people away from a worse bondage than that of Egypt."''&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; Enraged by what he deemed her insolence, Thomas Chester placed a bounty on Haviland's head. All throughout the South he circulated "hand-bills" ([[Flyer (pamphlet)|fliers]]) describing Mrs. Haviland, detailing her abolitionist work, naming her place of residence and offering $3000, a considerable sum at the time, to anyone willing to kidnap or murder her on his behalf.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Three years later, after the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], the Chester family attempted to have Haviland tried under the new statute for "''stealing''" their slaves. Haviland not only ran the risk of being physically harmed by angry slave-owners, like the Chesters, or their slave-catchers, if found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Law she would also be subject to hefty fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Still, Haviland was determined to continue with her work, no matter what the personal cost:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... I would not for my right hand become instrumental in returning one escaped slave to bondage. I firmly, believe in our Declaration of Independence, that all men are created free and equal, and that no human being has a right to make merchandise of others born in humbler stations, and place them on a level with horses, cattle, and sheep, knocking them off the auction-block to the highest bidder, sundering family ties, and outraging the purest and tenderest feelings of human nature.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fortunately for Haviland, her case was brought before Judge Ross Wilkins, who sympathized with the abolitionists.&lt;ref name="Haviland"/&gt; The Chesters attempted to regain possession of the Hamiltons by force, but were prevented by Haviland and her neighbors. Judge Wilkins delayed her case, allowing Haviland to help the Hamiltons escape to Canada.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt; In the end, Haviland evaded legal punishment.&lt;ref name=Haviland/&gt;

In addition to another failed rescue attempt, detailed in her autobiography, Haviland later made other, more successful journeys south that went unmentioned in her memoirs.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; In the guise of a white cook, and once even posing as a fair skinned [[Free people of color|free person of color]], she visited plantations and managed to help some slaves escape north.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey, Julie Roy. ''The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism: Ordinary Women in the Antislavery Movement,'' page 221. University of North Carolina Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War and Reconstruction==
[[Image:Laura Haviland holding slave irons ca. 1864.jpg|thumb|right|Laura Haviland holding slave irons.]] During the Civil War, Laura toured many refugee camps and hospitals, even venturing onto the frontlines, to distribute supplies to displaced citizens, freed slaves, and soldiers.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In the spring of 1865, the commissioner of the newly created [[Freedmen's Bureau]], General [[Oliver O. Howard]], named Haviland Inspector of Hospitals.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanding, Leonard Clark. ''Genealogy of the Blanding Family,'' Page 496. Published privately by the author, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Haviland's actual duties consisted of far more than inspecting hospitals. She spent the next two years traveling through [[Virginia]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kansas]] and Washington, D.C., distributing supplies, reporting on the living conditions of Freedmen and indigent whites, organizing refugee camps, establishing schools, working as a teacher, volunteering as a nurse at Freedmen's hospitals, and giving public lectures.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; In an effort to help whites understand what the Freedmen had endured under slavery, she toured abandoned plantations and collected chains, irons, restraints, and other implements which had been used on slaves. Haviland transported these items north and exhibited them during her lectures.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; She also met personally with President [[Andrew Johnson]] to petition for the release of former slaves still being held in Southern prisons for attempting years before to escape slavery.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

While working at the Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., Haviland met and befriended [[Sojourner Truth]], who later recalled an incident that took place one day when they had gone into town to get supplies. Haviland suggested they take a [[Streetcar|street car]] back to the hospital. Truth described what happened next as follows:

{{quote|As Mrs. Haviland signaled the car, I stepped to one side as if to continue my walk and when it stopped I ran and jumped aboard. The conductor pushed me back, saying, 'Get out of the way and let this lady come in.' I said 'I am a lady, too.' We went with no further opposition 'til we were obliged to change cars. A man coming out as we were going into the next car asked if 'niggers were allowed to ride.' The conductor grabbed me by the shoulder and jerking me around, ordered me to get out.  I told him I would not.

Mrs. Haviland took hold of my other arm and said, 'Don't put her out.'  The conductor asked if I belonged to her. 'No,' replied Mrs. Haviland, 'She belongs to humanity.'&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Dorothy. ''We are Your Sisters: Black Women in the Nineteenth Century,'' page 254. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Haviland Home orphanage==
After the Civil War, the Freedmen's Aid Commission acquired the former Raisin Institute, renamed it the Haviland Home, and converted it into an orphanage for African American children. Its first residents were seventy-five homeless children brought by Haviland from Kansas.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; As other  children joined their ranks, and their numbers increased, many whites in Michigan became unnerved. They claimed that Haviland was burdening white taxpayers and demanded that Haviland Home be closed.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Matters came to a head in 1867, when the orphanage was purchased by the American Missionary Association, who closed the orphanage, and literally threw the orphans out into the street.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

Haviland abandoned her work in Washington, D.C., to return to Michigan and help the children.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; She managed to collect enough donations to purchase the orphanage and began to manage it herself.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; By 1870, funds were extremely scarce. The situation became so dire that, at Haviland's urging, the state took over the orphanage and it became the Michigan Orphan Asylum.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Later years==
When the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] ended in 1877, many African Americans fled the South, where they were subject to attacks by racist individuals and groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Thousands of African American men, women and children, crowded into makeshift refugee camps in Kansas.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt; Determined to help, Haviland set out with her daughter Anna for Washington, D.C., where she testified about the appalling conditions at the camps, before traveling to Kansas with supplies for the refugees. Using her personal savings, Haviland purchased {{convert|240|acre|km2}} in Kansas for the Freedmen at one of the refugee camps to live on and farm.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
During her life, Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen, she was also actively involved in other social causes, advocating for [[women's suffrage]], and helping to organize the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] in Michigan.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Laura Haviland died on April 20, 1898 in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], at the home of her brother, Samuel Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. Historical Newspapers, Birth, Marriage, &amp; Death Announcements, 1851-2003 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2006. Original data: "Obituary of Laura S. Haviland" ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', April 21, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried next to her husband in the Raisin Valley Cemetery in Adrian, Michigan.

Symbolically, at Haviland's funeral, hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers, and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pall-bearers.&lt;ref name=Berson/&gt;

In recognition of her efforts, the town of [[Haviland, Kansas]] was named in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=4704 | title=Profile for Haviland, Kansas | publisher=[[ePodunk]] | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian, Michigan.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt; The inscription on the statue reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Tribute to a Life Consecrated to the Betterment of Humanity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Laura Smith Haviland Elementary School in [[Waterford, Michigan]] is named in her honor.

Laura Smith Haviland will be inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame in Peterboro, NY in October, 2018 (www.nationalabolitionhalloffameandmuseum.org)  https://newyorkhistoryblog.org/2018/07/08/hall-of-fame-inducts-three-who-resisted-fugitive-slave-laws/

== Plot ==
Iris is a teenage girl who likes to sing and help others. However, when she sings, strange events happen. Encouraged by her best friend Nathaniel, Iris auditions for a girl rock band, but her power destroys the room and she is later attacked by two strangers. The judges at the audition, Talia and Auriana, come to help her, and they explain to her that she is actually a princess with magical powers who must save her kingdom of Ephedia from the clutches of Gramorr, who has taken over. The only way to save it is to master her powers and to find the Oracle Gems of the Royal Crown of Ephedia, which are scattered across the Earth. Over the course of the series, the three girls try to live as both ordinary teenagers as well as rock stars of the [[all-girl band]] "LoliRock", while training Iris in secret and gathering the gems. But when Gramorr sends twin siblings Praxina and Mephisto to fight them and summon monsters to cause chaos, the girls must work together as magical girl warrior princesses.

In season 2, the three girls are joined by Ephedian girls Carissa and Lyna, who also transform into warrior princesses, but are not part of the band. &lt;!-- http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/153557107138/lolirock-season-2-production-over-drawing --&gt; The girls continue gathering Oracle Gems while helping those in need, but Gramorr and the evil twins continue to get stronger as well. When the last oracle gem is collected, Iris faces the reality of having to say goodbye to Nathaniel and returning to Ephedia, but when Gramorr claims the final gem and is freed, the girls work together to face him in one last battle.

She has long dark brown hair with straight bangs, dark skin, and amber eyes. She is serious, kind, and very intelligent. As the second princess of Xeris, she was imprisoned by Gramorr before going on the search for the princess of Ephedia with the help of Auriana.

===Conception===
Jean-Louis Vandestoc drew inspiration for ''LoliRock'' from watching anime in his childhood that was broadcast on the French channels, including ''[[Sherlock Hound]]'', ''[[Space Adventure Cobra]]'', ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', but his most influential title he watched was ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]''. He wrote "I loved the very core of it: a child transforming into an adult, helping people and making good deeds, the nice chara design, and finally the tone of the show: it could be funny and light, but also dramatic and tearful at other times. My soul was marked forever." After working on French cartoons ''[[Monster Buster Club]]'' and ''[[Rekkit Rabbit]]'' he wanted to make a [[magical girl]] show. He chose ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' as references for the magical girl part, and ''[[Jem and the Holograms]]'' for the music career part.

The producers at Marathon Media asked designers to draw Iris for a [[magical girl]] project as a teenage alien princess with ice/crystal powers. Character designer Bertrand Todesco drew inspiration from Betty Autier, a French fashion blogger of "le blog de betty". She had dark hair and straight bangs, but Todesco figured the producers wanted a blonde girl for a lead, so he went with the look of [[Jenny Humphrey]] of the TV series ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', portrayed by [[Taylor Momsen]]. The producers also wanted the girls' irises to be star-shaped. Autier's appearance as well as her wardrobe was retained for Talia.&lt;ref name="design1"/&gt;

Following the initial picture, Todesco needed to design a princess/rockstar outfit, of which he chose a green dress worn by [[Blake Lively]]. The colour was changed to pink as green was not suitable for merchandising. Todeco added a magical pet creature in the custom of ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', which would later become Amaru. He designed in the hair streaks for when the girls were rock stars, and dresses that weren't so frilly that they would be complicated to draw.&lt;ref name="design1"/&gt;

In designing Talia and the then-named Aurora, Todesco originally started with a black girl and an Asian girl with typical hairstyles, but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name="design2"/&gt; He then found inspirations from other ''Gossip Girl'' characters as well as actresses [[Amber Stevens West]] and [[Ariana Grande]], the latter of whom was how she acted in the teen sitcom ''[[Victorious (TV series)|Victorious]]'' rather than her current pop singer image. He also referenced [[Keri Hilson]] and [[Alicia Keys]]. ''Victorious'' was also the inspiration for some of the key visuals he used in promoting the series to get funding.&lt;ref name="design3"/&gt;

Early promotions of the series pictured the antagonist named Gromar to be an evil uncle of Iris who imprisoned the king and queen, and that he sent his two evil twin nephews to Earth to thwart Lolirock and take the gems.&lt;ref name="licensemag 20131001"/&gt; Paxson said that they abandoned the idea as it would have made him more of a stereotype.&lt;ref name="uncle gramorr rejected"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/124071399250/interview-with-writer-madellaine-paxson-behind|title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson – Behind the Scenes – LoliRock|author=Team LoliRock|date=14 July 2015|work=Tumblr|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todesco originally conceived of antagonists Praxina and Mephisto to have guitar playing sound powers that would counter the girls' singing voice powers but the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name="design5"/&gt; After several iterations, Praxina's final design was approved where she would have a butterfly brooch and motif, while Mephisto's was approved later, after director Jean-Louis had suggested he have a snake motif and a half-covered face.&lt;ref name="design5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="design6"/&gt; Eventually Gramorr would have the covered face,&lt;ref name="design7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="design6"/&gt;

The design for the crystal [[magic circle]]s and related animation was first done in 2D based off some reference pictures. Different colours and symbols were assigned to each character. It was later created in CGI.&lt;ref name="tumblr 20160511"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/144189468088/lolirock-research-development-the-crystal | title=LoliRock Research &amp; Development : The Crystal Magic | date=11 May 2016 | accessdate=15 June 2016  | author=Team LoliRock |work=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation tools used include [[Toon Boom Animation|Toon Boom Harmony]], [[Adobe After Effects]], and [[Blender (software)|Blender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/147387459038/hello-i-started-watching-lolirock-on-netfilx-with#notes | title=Hello!

Lyna and Carissa were created in response to a request from the producers when the writing for season 1 was nearing completion. The request was to add two new princesses to increase the member count to five. However, the LoliRock developers thought they already had too many characters so they made Lyna and Carissa supporting characters that were "outside the main gang but always ready and willing to help when needed". The two girls' transformations resemble Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. The designers considered making one of the two girls look Asian to balance out the overall group's look; they applied the look to both girls, and chose Lyna. There was also a concern that Carissa might be confused with Auriana as the show's redhead, they decided to go with giving her an Irish redhead theme anyway.&lt;ref name="lyna and carissa dev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/162714405036/lyna-carissas-developpment|title=Lyna &amp; Carissa's Developpment|author=Team LoliRock|date=7 July 2017 |work=Tumblr|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes and writing===
''LoliRock'' head writer Madellaine Paxson, who had worked on children's shows ''[[Making Fiends (TV series)|Making Fiends]]'', ''[[Power Rangers RPM]]'' as well as the horror film ''[[Blood Punch]]'', described the themes of the show as: friendship and love, magic, singing / music, and good vs. evil. She said the hardest part in writing an episode is the beginning and also in integrating the themes along with a story with a person that needs help. Her favourite scenes from the show were where the princesses are together doing ordinary teenage girl things as they had opportunities for comedy. She summarised the show as having something for everybody, very girly, but good action too.&lt;ref name="paxson interview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZf6fDXjqw |title=Interview with Writer Madellaine Paxson – Behind the Scenes – LoliRock |last=LoliRock |date=9 July 2015 |access-date=18 June 2016 |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release, Zodiak Kids describe the show as having a "cast of characters that are aspirational role models for a generation of children for whom justice has become a core value".&lt;ref name="press 20150327"/&gt; Jean-Louis Vandestoc chose a band concept for the series as it was different from his other shows which involved characters that went to school and then saved the world. The school part was replaced by the girls training or rehearsing for the concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/155290204503/from-where-will-come-the-idea-of-this-band |title=From where will come the idea of this band?? |last=Team LoliRock |date=2 January 2017 |access-date=16 January 2017 |work=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers later commented in their production blog [[FAQ]] that Iris was still attending school and that the episodes aren't all during summer vacation.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/faq|title=F.A.Q.|author=Team LoliRock|work=Tumblr|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to posts on the production Tumblr, ''LoliRock'' is classified as somewhere between a script-driven and storyboard-driven show. They started with a full script and then recorded lines with scratch voices or final voices, as re-recording after storyboarding would be costlier. The storyboard is then worked on, and some of the storyboard artists and supervisor adding and changing things they felt were important such as with the kiss scene in the Shanila episode and the Iris becoming a dark princess. Storyboard stage also included fixes for continuity and plot holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/144656358703/hi-i-hope-you-had-a-good-day-d-i-was-wondering |title=Hi!

===Music and voice-over===
The music score was composed and produced by Norbert "Yellowshark" Gilbert, with about 600 tracks over the course of the 52 26-minute episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/142998972173/lolirock-score-show-reel-by-yellowshark-and | title=Team LoliRock – Lolirock Score Show Reel (by Yellowshark) And... | date=18 April 2016 | accessdate=15 June 2016 |work=Tumblr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recurring songs (including the theme song) were recorded for each season. Due to limited resources in production, the team posted that Iris would be the only one singing on those songs, so they recorded Yasmin Shah in English and then developed the music videos. After realising that it would be unnatural for the other girls to not sing, they designed Iris to have a microphone while the others would just sing along. They considered recording singing for Talia and Auriana but were constrained by budget. Cassandre Berger provided the singing on the French dub. The voices were then mixed. As the dialogue was done later, the voice actors only sang on the incidental bits such as rehearsals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/133350263328/lolirockers-fanquestions-songs-and-lyrics | title=Team LoliRock – LoliRockers FanQuestions : Songs and Lyrics | date=16 November 2015 | accessdate=15 June 2016 |work=Tumblr | author=Team LoliRock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes were written and dubbed in English first and then adapted into French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamlolirock.tumblr.com/post/153883769745/whoiam989-its-official-lolirock-is-written-and#notes|title=Team LoliRock – whoiam989: It's official.

===Marketing and promotion===
Zodiak Media announced ''LoliRock'' in April 2013 at the [[MIPTV]] event in Cannes, France.&lt;ref name="licensemag miptv"/&gt; Early promotions included the idea of princesses with magical singing voices.&lt;ref name="issuu catalog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://issuu.com/zodiakmedia/docs/zodiak_kids_catalogue_2012/23 | title=Kids Catalogue | publisher=issuu.com | accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic target audience is girls ages 6 to 12, and the group has partnered with France Televisions and Disney Channel France.&lt;ref name="licensemag miptv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/miptv-kids-rule-cannes | title=MIPTV: Kids Rule in Cannes | work=License!

==Reception==
Ella Anders of BSC Kids wrote that ''LoliRock'' "plays it clear as a magical girl series and even nods other iconic shows in the genera" such as ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', but that it is "grand in its own right and should be held up as a great magical girl series". She liked the diverse cast, plot, humor and background story, the last of which she had not seen since ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]'', and that it was a type of show she would have loved growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2016/04/lolirock-arrives-long-last-us/|title=Lolirock Arrives at Long Last to US|date=27 April 2016|publisher=bsckids.com|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather Newman of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine described the series as "A French animated series about an impossibly thin, stylish, magical girl who sings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2016/04/29/new-on-netflix-sherlock-doc-grace-and-frankie-sixteen-candles/|title=New on Netflix: 'Sherlock' Doc, 'Grace And Frankie,' 'Sixteen Candles'|first=Heather|last=Newman|work=[[Forbes]]|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked whether ''LoliRock'' would have a cross-over episode with French superhero show ''[[Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir]]'' from [[Zagtoon]], Thomas Astruc, who was the creator and director on ''Miraculous'' and a storyboarder on ''LoliRock'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-astruc-48b3a311|title=Thomas Astruc|publisher=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; said it was unlikely given they are from two different production companies, but that the animation community is small and that both companies share the same love of animation. He has posted about the two being cousin shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2015/12/countdown-to-miraculous-is-on/|title=Countdown to Miraculous Tales of Ladybug &amp; Cat Noir Is On|date=5 December 2015|publisher=bsckids.com|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--&gt;

'''Semeç Masgûf''' ([[Arabic]]: سمچ مسگوف), or simply '''masgûf''', is a [[Iraqi cuisine|Mesopotamian]] dish consisting of seasoned, grilled [[carp]]; it is often considered the [[national dish]] of [[Iraq]].

==Geographical Distribution==
The Iraqi capital city [[Baghdad]] prides itself of making the best masgûf, with the [[Abu Nawas|Ebû Newâs]] district on the shores of the [[Tigris]] river, "dedicated" to this dish, having more than two dozen fish restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article1991034.ece|title=Imams put fatwa on carp caught in Tigris|location=London|work=The Times|first=Richard|last=Beeston|date=27 June 2007|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906105424/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article1991034.ece|archivedate=6 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, one can find masgûf all over Iraq, especially near the [[Tigris-Euphrates river system|Tigris-Euphrates Basin]].

Outside of Iraq, masgûf is more or less popular in the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīra]] as in the rural parts of [[Syria]], especially in the regions bordering Iraq, such as in the [[Raqqa]] Governorate, which is crossed by the [[Euphrates]]. It is also seen, at a lesser scale, in the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazīra]] areas located in [[Turkey]], such as [[Nusaybin]] and [[Cizre]], on the Iraqi border.

Masgûf is now also found in [[Damascus]] due to a high number of Iraqis exiles living there since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Dp"&gt;[http://www.dp-news.com/pages/detail.aspx?l=1&amp;articleId=6207 "أسعار العقارات في جرمانا تتحدى الإنحدار .. والجمود لم " ("Real estate prices in Jaramana challenge Downgrade ..")] ''De Press - Buildex Online'' 19 March 2009, in Arabic, last accessed 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the district of [[Jaramana|Jeremana]] alone, where most Iraqis live, more than ten masgûf restaurants, staffed by Iraqis. The fish is brought daily from the Syrian Euphrates to these restaurants, and is kept alive in a fishpond or a big [[aquarium]] until it is ordered.

==Preparation and Serving==
[[File:Maskuf9.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Live carp]]

The fish is caught alive and weighed. It is clubbed to kill it, then split lengthwise down the belly, cleaned and spread out into a single flat piece. It is then partially scaled, gutted and cut in two identical halves from the back while leaving the belly intact, opening the fish in the shape of a large, symmetrical circle. From there, the cook bastes the inside of the fish with a marinade of olive oil, rock salt, tamarind, and ground turmeric.

The fish is then either impaled on two sharp piles of wood, or placed in a big cast iron grill with a handle and a locking snare, designed specifically for this dish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/food/Overview_Sephardic_Cuisine/The_Middle_East/Food_Perspective_Masgouf_Recipe.htm Masgouf :Prepare fish like they did along the Tigris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105190025/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/food/Overview_Sephardic_Cuisine/The_Middle_East/Food_Perspective_Masgouf_Recipe.htm |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Maskuf5.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The locking grills made of [[cast iron]]]]

The fish, together with the grill or the piles, is then placed near the fire of the "fire altar", a feature shared by all masgûf restaurants. This "altar" typically consists of a big open-air area centered by a raised, podium-like sandbox that is either round, octagonal or sometimes rectangular, in the middle of which there is a large fire of [[apricot tree]] logs.

Cooking typically takes between one and three hours, until most of the fish's fat is burned off, during which time the guests will pick at their [[meze]]s.
[[File:Maskuf4.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Masgûf served on a tray]]

When the fish is well cooked and crispy on the outside, it is typically laid on a large tray garnished with [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] (or [[lemon]]), slices of [[onion]] and Iraqi [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]]. Sometimes, in [[Baghdad]], a little [mango chutney]] is also spread on the inside. The tray is then covered by a large crispy flatbread straight of a [[tandoor|clay oven]] to keep its contents hot until served to the client.&lt;ref name="Iraq in Pictures"&gt;Taus-Bolstad, Stacy (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FnJPct6scxcC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Masgouf+iraq&amp;num=30&amp;ei=4u8RSu7nF5vuzQS9wcyQCw#PPA55,M1 ''Iraq in Pictures''], Twenty-First Century Books, p.55, {{ISBN|0-8225-0934-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

The [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmens]] of Northern Iraq are known to prepare a similar recipe, often using a [[tandoor|clay oven]].

==Notes==

Masgûf arguably being the most famous dish of [[Iraq]], it is also the one that is always the foremost served to foreign delegations visiting the country by the Iraqi statesmen.
Two notable admirers of this dish are said to be the former President of France, [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], the former chairman of the Russian [[Duma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=8882|title=Fish chef nostalgic about Iraq's glory past}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac apparently fell for masgûf during a visit to Iraq in a formal dinner given to his honor by [[Saddam Hussein]].

A '''meditation''' (derived from the  [[Latin languages|Latin]]  ''[[:wikt:meditatio|meditatio]]'', from a verb ''[[:wikt:meditor|meditari]]'', meaning "to think, contemplate, devise, ponder") is a written work or a discourse intended to express its author's reflections, or to guide others in contemplation.  Often they are an author's musings or extended thoughts on deeper philosophical or religious questions.

Examples of meditations are:
* [[Thomas Traherne]]'s ''Centuries of Meditations''
* [[T.S. Eliot]]'s ''[[Four Quartets]]''
* ''[[Meditations]]'' a series of personal writings by [[Marcus Aurelius]], Roman Emperor 161–180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy
* ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' by [[René Descartes]]

Melmastia requires hospitality and profound respect to be shown all visitors, regardless of distinctions of race, religion, national affiliation as well as economic status and doing so without any hope of remuneration or favour. [[Pashtuns]] will go to great extents to show their hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan the People |last1=Banting |first1=Erinn |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=|isbn=0778793354|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl8cd15sc7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Erinn%20Banting%22&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Schultheis |title=Hunting Bin Laden: How Al-Qaeda Is Winning the War on Terror |year=2008 |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse |page=14 |isbn=9781602392441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rizwan |last=Hussain |title=Pakistan and the Emergence of Islamic Militancy in Afghanistan |year=2005 |location=Aldershot |publisher=Ashgate |page=221 |isbn=0754644340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mountstuart Elphinstone|Elphinstone]] in 1815 observed: "The most remarkable characteristic of the [[Ethnic_Afghans|Afghans]] is their hospitality. The practice of this virtue is so much a point of national honor, that their reproach to an inhospitable man is that he has no Pushtunwali". (Elphinston 1969: 226). 

Hospitality to strangers is an obligation and is offered free, without expecting any reciprocity. But hospitality to one's kinsmen or tribesmen puts the recipient under reciprocal obligation, accompanied by the "fear that he will not be in the position to return it adequately when the occasion demands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan: Political Frailty and External Interference |first=Nabi |last=Misdaq |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |page=273 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hHmTAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;ots=N1h_wPUlYR&amp;dq=fear%20that%20he%20will%20not%20be%20in%20the%20position%20to%20return%20it%20adequately%20when%20the%20occasion%20demands&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q=fear%20that%20he%20will%20not%20be%20in%20the%20position%20to%20return%20it%20adequately%20when%20the%20occasion%20demands&amp;f=false|isbn=9780415470247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pedestrian malls''', also known as '''pedestrian streets''', are the most common form of [[pedestrian zone]] in large cities in the [[United States]].  They are typically streets lined with storefronts and closed off to most [[automobile]] traffic. [[Emergency vehicle]]s may have access at all times and [[delivery vehicle]]s may be restricted to either limited delivery hours or entrances on side streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= How to Create a Pedestrian Mall | url=http://www.culturechange.org/issue14/pedestrianmall.html | work= | publisher=www.culturechange.org | date= | accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pedestrian mall" as a term is most often used in the United States and Australia. "Pedestrian street" and "[[Pedestrian zone]]" are the more common terms worldwide.

== History ==
In the 1960s and early 1970s, many mid-sized U.S. cities installed pedestrian malls in their [[downtown]] areas, as a response to increasing traffic jams and the commercial success of self-contained edge-of-town [[shopping mall]]s.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=Kent|title=The Status of Pedestrian Malls in American Downtowns|journal=Urban Affairs Quarterly|date=1990|volume=26|issue=2|pages=250–273|doi=10.1177/004208169002600206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, there were at least 75 pedestrian malls in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= North America cities that have (or had) a pedestrian mall | url=http://www.urbanreviewstl.com/?cat=676 | work= | publisher=www.urbanreviewstl.com | date= | accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the [[Kalamazoo Mall]], some notable examples are the [[Church Street Marketplace]] in Burlington, Vermont; the [[Downtown Mall]] in Charlottesville, Virginia; the [[Third Street Promenade]] in Santa Monica, California; the [[Fremont Street Experience]] in Las Vegas, Nevada; the Buffalo Place Main Street Pedestrian Mall in Buffalo, New York; [[Ithaca Commons]] in Ithaca, New York; the [[Pearl Street Mall]] in Boulder, Colorado; St. Charles, Missouri; Salem, Massachusetts; [[Ped Mall (Iowa City)|Ped Mall]] in Iowa City, Iowa; [[Lincoln Road]] in Miami Beach, Florida; the [[Fulton Mall (Fresno)|Fulton Mall]] in Fresno, California; the [[K Street Mall]] in Sacramento, California; the [[16th Street Mall]] in Denver, Colorado; [[State Street (Madison)|State Street]] in Madison, Wisconsin; [[Nicollet Mall]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota; [[The Grove at Farmers Market|The Grove]] in Los Angeles, California; Fort Street Mall in Honolulu, Hawaii; [[Oakland City Center|City Center]] in Oakland, California; [[Des Moines, Iowa|Walnut Street]] in Des Moines, Iowa, [[Downtown Crossing]] and [[Faneuil Hall]]/[[Quincy Market]] in Boston; [[Washington Street Mall]] in Cape May, New Jersey; The Downtown Cumberland Mall in Cumberland, Maryland; and more recently former New York Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] worked hard over his final term in office to create pedestrian malls in major tourist centers that had also been areas of severe automobile congestion such as [[Times Square]]&lt;ref name=Torossian_Observer&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Ronn Torossian|Torossian, Ronn]]|title=New York For New Yorkers|url=http://observer.com/2014/05/new-york-for-new-yorkers/|newspaper=New York Observer|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Herald Square]], and many others around the country. Typically these downtown pedestrian malls were three or four linear blocks simply blocked off to private street traffic, with fountains, benches, planters that doubled as seating areas, [[bollard]]s, playgrounds, interfaces to public transit and other amenities installed to attract shoppers.

Many were later re-converted to accommodate automobile traffic within twenty years. However, most of these areas are still popular attractions today. The [[Pearl Street Mall]] in Boulder continues to thrive with its college crowd atmosphere and the [[Third Street Promenade]] in Santa Monica thrives on tourist traffic.  The [[Downtown Mall]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], now a vital business, entertainment, and retail area, spent roughly twenty years as a somewhat depressed stretch until an ice skating rink and [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] opened on it in the mid-1990s. Broadway St. in [[Eugene, Oregon]], is finally being developed with a hotel, movie theater, and retail after decades of limited economic activity following its experiment with a pedestrian mall.  The Federal Plaza in [[Downtown Youngstown]], Ohio is a similar case.  Since the unsuccessful Federal Plaza has been ripped up and redesigned in 2004, the city of Youngstown has seen the development of a new entertainment district erupt.  A new arena, two new courthouses, federal buildings, bistros and other new night-spots have placed themselves in Youngstown's core. Burlington, Vermont's [[Church Street Marketplace]] has been expanded from the original three blocks to four, encompassing the entirety of the city's commercial "main street," and remains a thriving cultural center with shops, restaurants, vendor carts, sidewalk performers and special events which does not appear to be affected by the development of big box store farms in neighboring [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]]. [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on the other hand, has reverted its Main Mall to vehicular traffic, having failed at maintaining a place pedestrians wanted to be (it was, at least in part,  Poughkeepsie's initial success which convinced Burlington to proceed with its Marketplace project).

The [[San Antonio River Walk]] is a special-case pedestrian street, one level down from the automobile street.  The River Walk winds and loops under bridges as two parallel sidewalks lined with restaurants and shops, connecting the major tourist draws from [[Alamo Plaza]] to [[Rivercenter]], to [[HemisFair Plaza]], to the [[Transit Tower]].  Most downtown buildings have street entrances and separate river entrances one level below.  This separates the automotive service grid (delivery and ambulance/police vehicles) from pedestrian traffic below, provides bridges, walkways, and staircases, and attempts to balance retail, commercial, office, green space and cultural uses.

==Urban renewal==
In the last decades of the 20th century many [[urbanist]]s such as [[Jan Gehl]] and [[Peter Calthorpe]] have listed and explained what they see as the virtues of pedestrian streets.  [[Urban renewal]] activists have often pushed for the creation of auto-free zones in parts or in all of the sectors of a metropolitan area.

== Legal status ==
In some locations, the definition of a pedestrian mall is codified.

Pedestrian malls are streets that have limited or prohibited motor vehicle access, with the intent to create a walking zone.  This may be done to create a safer environment in areas that have high pedestrian traffic, to reduce the noise and pollution levels, or to increase exercise levels by encouraging walking.&lt;ref name="Downtown pedestrian mall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pojani|first=Dorina|title=Downtown Pedestrian Malls: Including a Case Study of Santa Monicas Third Street Promenade.|date=11 May 2005|pages=46–47|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/305007771/|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15444">The '''performative turn''' is a paradigmatic shift in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] that has affected such disciplines as [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]], [[ethnography]], [[history]] and the relatively young discipline of [[performance studies]]. Central to the performative turn is the concept of performance.

==The performative turn==
Previously used as a metaphor for [[Theatrical|theatricality]], performance is now often employed as a [[heuristic]] principle to understand [[human behaviour]]. The assumption is that all human practices are 'performed', so that any action at whatever moment or location can be seen as a public presentation of the self. This methodological approach entered the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]] in the 1990s but is rooted in the 1940s and 1950s.
Underlying the performative turn was the need to conceptualize how human practices relate to their contexts in a way that went beyond the traditional sociological methods that did not problematize representation. Instead of focusing solely on given symbolic structures and texts, scholars stress the active, social construction of reality as well as the way that individual behaviour is determined by the context in which it occurs. Performance functions both as a metaphor and an analytical tool and thus provides a perspective for [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] and analysing social and cultural phenomena.

==What is performance?==
Performance is a bodily practice that produces meaning. It is the presentation or 're-actualization' of [[symbolic system]]s through living bodies as well as lifeless mediating objects, such as [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic field, as opposed to the domain of the [[performance|performing arts]], the concept of performance is generally used to highlight dynamic interactions between [[social actor]]s or between a social actor and his or her immediate environment.  

Performance is an equivocal concept and for the purpose of analysis it is useful to distinguish between two senses of 'performance'. 
In the more formal sense, performance refers to a framed event. Performance in this sense is an enactment out of convention and tradition. Founder of the discipline of [[performance studies]] [[Richard Schechner]] dubs this category 'is-performance'.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; In a weaker sense, performance refers to the informal scenarios of daily life, suggesting that everyday practices are 'performed'. Schechner called this the 'as-performance'.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally the performative turn is concerned with the latter, although the two senses of performance should be seen as ends of a spectrum rather than distinct categories.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
===Origins===
The origins of the performative turn can be traced back to two strands of theorizing about performance as a social category that surfaced in the 1940s and 1950s. 
The first strand is anthropological in origin and may be labelled the dramaturgical model. [[Kenneth Burke]] (1945) expounded a 'dramatistic approach' to analyse the motives underlying such phenomena as communicative actions and the history of philosophy. Anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] focussed on cultural expression in staged theatre and ritual. In his highly influential ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]'' (1959), [[Erving Goffman]] emphasized the link between social life and performance by stating that 'the theatre of performances is in public acts'. Within the performative turn, the dramaturgical model evolved from the classical concept of 'society as theatre' into a broader category that considers all culture as performance. 
 
The second strand of theory concerns a development in the philosophy of language launched by [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]] in the 1950s. In ''How to do things with words''&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; he introduced the concept of the '[[performative utterance]]', opposing the prevalent principle that sentences are always statements that can be either true or false. Instead he argued that 'to say something is to do something'.&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s [[John Searle]] extended this concept to the broader field of speech act theory, where due attention is paid to the use and function of language. In the 1970s Searle engaged in polemics with postmodern philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]], about the determinability of context and the nature of authorial intentions in a performative text.

===Postmodernism===
The performative turn is anchored in the broader cultural development of [[postmodernism]]. An influential current in modern thought, postmodernism is a radical reappraisal of the assumed certainty and objectivity of scientific efforts to represent and explain reality.&lt;br /&gt; 
Postmodern scholars argue that society itself both defines and constructs reality through experience, representation and performance. From the 1970s onwards, the concept of performance was integrated into a variety of theories in the humanities and social sciences, such as [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[critical theory]] (the [[Frankfurt school]]), [[semiotic]]s, [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]], [[deconstructionism]] and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual shift became manifest in a methodology oriented towards culture as a dynamic phenomenon as well as in the focus on subjects of study that were neglected before, such as everyday life. For scholars, the concept of performance is a means to come to grips with [[human agency]] and to better understand the way social life is constructed.

==Elaborations and related concepts==
The concept of performance has been developed by such scholars as [[Richard Schechner]], [[Victor Turner]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]], [[John Searle]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], Stern and Henderson, and [[Judith Butler]].

===Performance studies===
[[Performance studies]] emerged through the work of, among others, [[theatre]] director and scholar [[Richard Schechner]], who applied the notion of performance to human behaviour beyond the [[performance|performing arts]]. His interpretation of performance as non-artistic yet expressive social behaviour and his collaboration in 1985 with anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] led to the beginning of performance studies as a separate discipline. Schechner defines performance as 'restored behaviour', to emphasize the symbolic and coded aspects of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Schechner understands performance as a continuum. Not everything is meant to be a performance, but everything, from performing arts to politics and economics, can be studied as performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performativity===
A related concept that emphasizes the political aspect of performance and its exercise of power is [[performativity]]. It is associated with philosopher and [[gender]] theorist [[Judith Butler]]. It is an [[non-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] theory of [[subjectification|subjectivity]] in which a performance of the self is repeated and dependent upon a social audience.  In this way, these unfixed and precarious performances come to have the appearance of substance and continuity.  A key theoretical point that was most radical in regards to theories of subjectivity and performance is that there is no performer behind the performance.  Butler derived this idea from [[Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] concept of "no doer behind the deed."  This is to say that there is no self before the performance of the self, but rather that the performance has constitutive powers.  This is how categories of the self for Judith Butler, such as gender, are seen as something that one "does," rather than something one "is."

===Habitus===
In the 1970s, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] introduced the concept of '[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]' or regulated improvisation, in a reaction against the structuralist notion of culture as a system of rules (Bourdieu 1972). Culture in his perspective undergoes a shift from 'a productive to a reproductive social order in which simulations and models constitute the world so that the distinction between real and appearance becomes erased'.&lt;ref&gt;Porter (1990), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Though Bourdieu himself does not often employ the term 'performance', the notion of the bodily habitus as a formative site has been a source of inspiration for performance theorists.
 
===Occasionalism===
The cultural historian [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] suggested using the term '[[occasionalism]]' to stress the implication of the idea of performance that '[...] on different occasions or in different situations the same person behaves in different ways'.&lt;ref&gt;Burke (2005), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-representational theory===
Within the social sciences and humanities, an [[interdisciplinary]] strand that has contributed to the performative turn is [[non-representational theory]]. It is a 'theory of practices' that focuses on repetitive ways of expression, such as speech and gestures. As opposed to representational theory, it argues that human conduct is a result of linguistic interplay rather than of codes and symbols that are consciously planned. Non-representational theory interprets actions and events, such as dance or theatre, as actualisations of knowledge. It also intends to shift the focus away from the technical aspects of representation, to the practice itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dirksmeier, (2008), p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and debates==
Despite cogent attempts at definition, the concept of performance continues to be plagued by ambiguities. Most pressing seems to be the paradox between performance as the consequence of following a script (cf. Schechners restored behaviour) and performance as a fluid activity with ample room for improvisation. Another problem involves the discrepancy between performance as a human activity that constructs culture (cf. Butler and Derrida) on the one hand and performance as a representation of culture on the other (cf. Bourdieu and Schechner). Another issue, important to pioneers such as Austin but now deemed irrelevant by postmodernism, concerns the sincerity of the actor. Can performance be authentic, or is it a product of pretence?
 
==Examples and manifestations==
Performance offers a tremendous interdisciplinary archive of social practices. It offers methods to study such phenomena as body art, ecological theatre, multimedia performance and other kinds of performance arts.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Performance also provides a new registry of kinaesthetic effects, enabling a more conscientious observation of the moving body. The changing experience of movement, for example as a result of new technologies, has become an important subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Moreover, the performative turn has helped scholars to develop an awareness of the relations between everyday life and stage performances. For example, at conferences and lectures, on the street and in other places where people speak in public, performers tend to use techniques derived from the world of theatre and dance.&lt;ref&gt;Thrift (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Performance allows us to study nature and other apparently 'immovable' and 'objectified' elements of the human environment (e.g. architecture) as active agents, rather than only as passive objects. Thus, in recent decades environmental scholars have acknowledged the existence of a fluid interaction between man and nature. 
 
The performative turn has provided additional tools to study everyday life. A household for example may be considered as a performance, in which the relation between wife and husband is a role play between two actors.

'''Peter Anthony Mancina''' (December 2, 1981) is an American cultural and political [[anthropologist]], [[Ethnography|ethnographer]], [[historian]], writer, and [[Trade union|labor union]] researcher who writes about [[sanctuary city]] politics, [[immigration]], governmental power, policy, social movements, and [[culture]].

== Biography ==
Mancina holds a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political economy|Political Economy]] and Social Movements from [[Evergreen State College|The Evergreen State College]], as well as a [[Master of Arts]] degree and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Anthropology]] from [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], United States. Mancina is a former United States [[National Science Foundation]] grantee and Wenner-Gren Foundation grantee. From 2013-2017, Mancina was Researcher for [[Service Employees International Union]] Local 1021 in San Francisco. Originally from [[Kansas City, Kansas]], United States, Mancina lives in [[Budapest|Budapest, Hungary]] with his partner Zina Bozzay, a musician and [[composer]], and their two daughters.

== Academic Work ==
As a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology at [[Vanderbilt University]], Mancina was trained as a [[Mayanist]] under the supervision of cultural and [[Economic anthropology|economic anthropologist]] [[Edward F. Fischer]] and studied politics, [[Social movement|social movements]], and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] culture in rural [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]]-Maya towns in [[Chiapas|Chiapas, Mexico]]. His first professional work examined the lives of Tzeltal-Maya migrants in San Francisco, California and returned migrants in Chiapas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mancina|first=Peter Anthony|date=2011-02-18|title=Crisis-management: Tzeltal-Maya transnational migration and the Foucauldian apparatus|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10624-011-9223-0|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=205–225|doi=10.1007/s10624-011-9223-0|issn=0304-4092}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transnational work charted the effect of their migration and [[day labor]] incomes in the U.S. upon development and politics in their towns of origin in [[Mexico]].

Mancina has conducted [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] [[field research]] and [[archival research]] on the creation and implementation of [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]'s [[sanctuary city]] policies. This has included interviews with [[sanctuary movement]] leaders, organizers, activists, and public officials; and "[[participant observation]]" with sanctuary movement organizations and sanctuary city [[policy advocacy]] groups. Part of this work has included conducting research in [[San Francisco City Hall]] and working as a constituent services staff member for sanctuary city law author District Supervisor [[David Campos]]. In this capacity, his participant observation work has included assisting [[Undocumented immigrants (U.S.)|undocumented]] city residents in seeking city services in a manner which itself was governed by sanctuary city laws. His sanctuary city-focused research has also included assisting a coalition of immigrant-serving [[Nonprofit organization|non-profits]] and legal organizations called the San Francisco Immigrant Rights Defense Committee, now renamed 
FREESF in drafting and [[Advocacy|advocating]] for sanctuary city laws. From this research, Mancina wrote a comprehensive history of San Francisco, California's sanctuary city laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu//available/etd-07112016-193322/unrestricted/Mancina.pdf.pdf|title=In the Spirit of Sanctuary: Sanctuary City Policy Advocacy and the Production of Sanctuary-Power in San Francisco, California.|last=Mancina|first=Peter|date=|year=2016|website=Vanderbilt University Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Sanctuary-Practices-in-International-Perspectives-Migration-Citizenship/Lippert-Rehaag/p/book/9780415673464|title=Birth of a Sanctuary City: A History of Governmental Sanctuary in San Francisco|last=Mancina|first=Peter|date=2012|website=Routledge|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cultural ecology]] [[Marshall Sahlins]] used this concept in order to develop alternative approaches to the [[environmental determinism]] dominant at that time in ecological studies. Theory by [[Strabo]] in 64 BC that humans can make things happen by their own intelligence over time. Strabo cautioned against the assumption that nature and actions of  humans were determined by the physical environment they inhabited. He observed that humans were the active elements in a human-environmental partnership.

The controversy between geographical ''possibilism'' and ''determinism'' might be considered as one of (at least) three dominant [[epistemologic]] controversies of contemporary geography. The other two controversies are 1) the "debate between neopositivists and neokantians about the "exceptionalism" or the specificity of geography as a science [and 2)] the contention between [[Halford Mackinder|Mackinder]] and [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]] about what is—or should be—geography".&lt;ref&gt;[[José William Vesentini]], [http://confins.revues.org/document1162.html ''Controvérsias geográficas: epistemologia e política''], [[Confins (magazine)]] - Revue Franco-Brésilienne de Géographie&lt;/ref&gt;

''Possibilism'' in geography is, thus, considered as a distinct approach to geographical knowledge, directly opposed to geographical ''determinism''.

{{Sociolinguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], a '''register''' is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting. For example, when speaking in a formal setting, an [[English language|English]] speaker may be more likely to use features of [[prescription and description|prescribed grammar]] than in an informal setting—such as pronouncing words ending in ''-ing'' with a [[velar nasal]] instead of an [[alveolar nasal]] (e.g. "walking", not "walkin'"), choosing more formal words (e.g. ''father'' vs. ''dad,'' ''child'' vs. ''kid,'' etc.), and refraining from using words considered nonstandard, such as ''[[ain't]]''.

As with other types of language variation, there tends to be a spectrum of registers rather than a discrete set of obviously distinct varieties—numerous registers could be identified, with no clear boundaries between them. Discourse categorisation is a complex problem, and even in the general definition of "register" given above (language variation defined by use not user), there are cases where other kinds of language variation, such as regional or age [[dialect]], overlap. Consequent to this complexity, scholarly consensus has not been reached for the definitions of terms including "register", "field" or "tenor"; different scholars' definitions of these terms are often in direct contradiction of each other. Additional terms including diatype, [[genre]], [[text types]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]], [[acrolect]], [[mesolect]], [[basilect]], [[sociolect]] and [[ethnolect]] among many others, may be used to cover the same or similar ground. Some prefer to restrict the domain of the term "register" to a specific vocabulary (Wardhaugh, 1986) (which one might commonly call [[slang]], [[jargon]], [[argot]] or [[Cant (language)|cant]]), while others{{Who|date=September 2013}} argue against the use of the term altogether. These various approaches with their own "register", or set of terms and meanings, fall under disciplines including [[sociolinguistics]], [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]] or [[systemic functional grammar]].

==History and use==
The term ''register'' was first used by the linguist [[:de:T.B.W. Reid|T.B.W. Reid]] in 1956 (Agha, 2008), and brought into general currency in the 1960s by a group of linguists who wanted to distinguish among variations in language according to the ''user'' (defined by variables such as social background, geography, sex and age), and variations according to ''use'', "in the sense that each speaker has a range of varieties and choices between them at different times" (Halliday et al., 1964). The focus is on the way language is used in particular situations, such as [[legalese]] or [[motherese]], the language of a biology research lab, of a news report, or of the bedroom.

[[Michael Halliday|M. A. K. Halliday]] and [[Ruqaiya Hasan|R. Hasan]] (1976) interpret ''register'' to be "the linguistic features which are typically associated with a configuration of situational features – with particular values of the field, mode and tenor...". Field for them is "the total event, in which the text is functioning, together with the purposive activity of the speaker or writer; includes subject-matter as one of the elements". Mode is "the function of the text in the event, including both the channel taken by language – spoken or written, extempore or prepared – and its genre, rhetorical mode, as narrative, didactic, persuasive, '[[Phatic expression|phatic communion]]', etc." The tenor refers to "the type of role interaction, the set of relevant social relations, permanent and temporary, among the participants involved". These three values – field, mode and tenor – are thus the determining factors for the linguistic features of the text. "The register is the set of meanings, the configuration of semantic patterns, that are typically drawn upon under the specified conditions, along with the words and structures that are used in the realization of these meanings." Register, in the view of M. A. K. Halliday and R. Hasan, is one of the two defining concepts of text. "A text is a passage of discourse which is coherent in these two regards: it is coherent with respect to the context of situation, and therefore consistent in register; and it is coherent with respect to itself, and therefore cohesive."

==Register being formality scale==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Quebec French]] --&gt;
One of the most analyzed areas where the use of language is determined by the situation is the formality scale. Especially in [[language teaching]], the term "register" often forms a shorthand for formal/informal style, although this is an aging definition. Linguistics textbooks may use the term "tenor" instead (Halliday 1978), but increasingly prefer the term "style" – "we characterise styles as varieties of language viewed from the point of view of formality" (Trudgill, 1992) – while defining "registers" more narrowly as specialist language use related to a particular activity, such as academic jargon. There is very little agreement as to how the spectrum of formality should be divided.

In one prominent model, [[Martin Joos]] (1961) describes five styles in spoken English:
* '''Frozen:''' Also referred to as '''static''' register. Printed unchanging language, such as [[Biblical]] quotations, often contains [[archaism]]s. Examples are the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] of the [[United States of America]] and other "static" vocalizations. The wording is exactly the same every time it is spoken.
* '''Formal:''' One-way participation; no interruption; technical vocabulary or exact definitions are important; includes presentations or introductions between strangers.
* '''Consultative:''' Two-way participation; background information is provided – prior knowledge is not assumed. "Back-channel behavior" such as "uh huh", "I see", etc. is common. Interruptions are allowed. Examples include teacher/student, doctor/patient, expert/apprentice, etc.
* '''Casual:''' In-group friends and acquaintances; no background information provided; [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] and [[slang]] common; interruptions common. This is common among friends in a social setting.
* '''Intimate:''' Non-public; intonation more important than wording or grammar; private vocabulary. Also includes non-verbal messages. This is most common among family members and close friends.

==ISO standard==
The [[International_Organization_for_Standardization|ISO]] has defined standard [[ISO 12620]] on Data Category Registry (ISO, 2018). This is a registry for registering linguistic terms used in various fields of translation, computational linguistics and natural language processing and defining mappings both between different terms and the same terms used in different systems. The registers identified are:

* bench-level register
* dialect register
* facetious register
* formal register
* in house register
* ironic register
* neutral register
* slang register
* taboo register
* technical register
* vulgar register

==Diatype==
The term diatype is sometimes used to describe language variation which is determined by its social purpose (Gregory 1967). In this formulation, language variation can be divided into two categories: [[dialect]], for variation according to ''user'', and diatype for variation according to ''use'' (e.g. the specialised language of an academic journal). This definition of diatype is very similar to those of ''register''.

The distinction between dialect and diatype is not always clear; in some cases a language variety may be understood as both a dialect and a diatype.

Diatype is usually analysed in terms of ''field'', the subject matter or setting; ''tenor'', the participants and their relationships; and ''mode'', the channel of communication, such as spoken, written or signed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1674">The '''ripieno''' ({{IPA-it|riˈpjɛːno}}, [[Italian language|Italian]] for "stuffing" or "padding") is the bulk of instrumental parts of a [[musical ensemble]] who do not play as soloists, especially in [[Baroque music]]. These are the players who would play in sections marked ''[[tutti]]'', as opposed to soloist sections. It is most commonly used in reference to instrumental music, although it can also be used in choral music. An individual member of the ripieno is called a '''ripienista'''.

In the [[concerto grosso]], it refers to the larger of the two ensembles as opposed to the group of soloists called the [[concerto grosso#Concertino|''concertino'']].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2nd Ed. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[ripieno concerto]], there is no dominant soloist, so it resembles an early symphony. It can also refer to the main body of orchestra in early orchestral music, although this use is today often disregarded.

In band music, the term (or its variant spellings ''repiano'' and ''ripiano'') is used similarly to designate the players not at the leading desk, especially the clarinet and cornet players in [[Military band|military bands]].&lt;ref name="GroveOnline"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Repiano|author=|access-date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression ''senza ripieni'' is an instruction to play without the ripienistas; this instruction is frequently found in works by [[George Frederick Handel]].&lt;ref name="GroveOnline" /&gt;

The term can also be used to designate a pipe organ [[Mixture (organ stop)|mixture stop]].

A '''room divider''' is a screen or piece of furniture placed in a way that divides a room into separate areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/divider| title=Divider| publisher=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/room+divider| title=Divider| publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex| accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Room dividers are used by [[interior design]]ers and [[architect]]s as means to divide space into separate distinct areas.[[File: WMF-Konferenz_Raumteiler.jpg|thumb|right|A room divider for a conference hall.]]

There are a number of different types of room dividers such as [[cubicle]] partitions, [[pipe and drape]] screens, [[Shōji|shoji screens]], and walls. Room dividers can be made from many materials, including wood, fabric, plexiglass, framed cotton canvas, pleated fabric or mirrors. Plants, shelves or railings might also be used as dividers. Portable room dividers have folded wall panels supported on wheels.

== Types ==

In general, room dividers are used in one of these ways:

* To divide rooms, creating a more efficient use of the space within the room.
* As decorators and/or accent pieces to add character to room space.
* To hide areas of different usage or privacy protection
* To decorate rooms for better home design effect

Room dividers differ in nature being either:

* Permanent as in using wine shelves in restaurants
* Built in as in sliding partitions in offices
* Portable or temporary as for example in convention centers
* Fixed room dividers and hanging room dividers

They may completely obscure as in floor to ceiling dividers, or may allow sight through as for example when plant pots are used to divide areas

== Uses ==
Houses, and other residences, use a room divider to divide the space more effectively or as a decorating focus point. There are many uses for a room divider including: dividing the room, adding privacy to any space, hiding clutter and increasing storage and accents to the room. Other uses include adding color, redirecting foot traffic, creating a foyer, adding a desk front modesty screen, creating coziness, or adding a decorative background.

Most commonly used in the residence is a small room divider, sometimes called a folding shoji screen. Shoji screens are usually tri-fold walls. A shoji screen may also be used to section off part of a bedroom or family room as an office.&lt;ref&gt;Berner, Jeff: "The Joy of Working from Home", page 27. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants,&lt;ref&gt;Chiara, Joseph De, Panero, Julius, Zelnik, Martin: "Time-saver Standards for Interior Design and Space Planning", page 1353. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; bookshelves,&lt;ref&gt;Petrowski, Elaine Martin: "Design Ideas for Home Storage", page 92. Creative Homeowner, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; railings,&lt;ref&gt;Jefferis, Alan, Madsen, David A.: "Architectural Drafting and Design", page 479. Thomson Delmar Learning, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; fireplaces,&lt;ref&gt;Stickels, Karen, Walker, Jessie: "Design Ideas for Fireplaces", page 132. Creative Homeowner, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; light fixtures, and drapes have all been used to effectively create distinct spaces in individuals apartments and homes.

In schools or religious facilities, room dividers primarily are used to create temporary classrooms for education in large open rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Pierce Dornbush, Sheryl K. Pruitt: "Teaching the Tiger", page 110. Hope Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Peter W.: "Houses of God", page 121. University of Illinois Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rooms were designed originally to be open for other purposes, the most common type of room divider is a portable room divider on casters which can easily be moved from place to place. After class, the room divider is rolled back into its storage area for future use.

Hotels and restaurants use two different types of room dividers. Commonly, you will see floor-to-ceiling room dividers&lt;ref&gt;Pile, John, F.: "Interior Design", Page 417. H.N. Abrams, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in banquet halls and meeting spaces. These fixed dividers can be used to divide a banquet room into smaller facilities. In areas where room dividers need more flexibility, hotels and restaurants might use [[portable partitions]] similar to those used in schools.

In offices, room dividers are typically more permanent in nature and attached directly to the floor. These office cubicles room dividers allow taking a large office space and breaking it into quieter and more focused subdivided offices.&lt;ref&gt;Meel, Juriaan van: "The European Office", Page 81. 010 Publishers, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convention centers, by their very nature, are large facilities with wide open internal spaces. Consequently, they often need to be broken down into smaller areas. The most common room divider used in convention center is pipe and drape.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, Leonard H., Dorf, David C., Jones, Thomas J. A.: "Managing Conventions and Group Business", page 28. Educational Institute of the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention center sets up frames made of plastic, metal, or wire tubing. Fabric material is then hung over the frame to create back drops and hide other unsightly places in addition to creating multiple subdivided rooms.

==History==
The folding room screens were found in China in the 7th century where they were mainly used by royalty. They were very heavy and ornate, and were not moved around. In the 8th century, the Japanese began using lighter, more portable room dividers for tea ceremonies, religious events and outdoor processions. European travelers developed their own version of Asian screen dividers using wood, leather, silk, mirrors and decoupage. Folding room dividers are now used in dwellings, hospitals, schools, restaurants, corporate offices and convention centers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15585">Many engineering educators see [[service-learning]] as the solution to several prevalent problems in engineering education today.  In the past, engineering curriculum has fluctuated between emphasizing engineering science to focusing more on practical aspects of engineering.  Today, many engineering educators are concerned their students do not receive enough practical knowledge of engineering and its context.  Some speculate that adding context to engineering help to motivate engineering students' studies and thus improve retention and diversity in engineering schools.  Others feel that the teaching styles do not match the learning styles of engineering students.  

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service-learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in engineering education as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service-learning into their curricula.

==History==

The end of World War II marked the beginning of a movement toward increased emphasis on engineering science in engineering education.  Initially, this movement enhanced the quality of engineering education.  However, after decades of rising focus on science engineering, undergraduate [[engineering education]] began to lack instruction on practical engineering applications.  Concurrently, the undergraduate engineering experience became increasingly fragmented.&lt;ref name="fromm"&gt;E. Fromm, ''The Changing Engineering Education Paradigm,'' J. Eng. Educ., vol. 92, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  As one author described it, "Schools break knowledge and experience into subjects, relentlessly turning wholes into parts, flowers into petals, history into events, without ever restoring continuity."&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferguson, ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s'', St. Martin's Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, many different organizations, including both research institutions and professional associations, conducted studies in attempts to resolve the educational problems in the engineering field.  Though they conducted their research independently, they arrived at several common conclusions.  Researchers agreed that the engineering schools should continue to provide solid basic theory knowledge.  However, they also called for added emphasis on synthesis and design understanding as well as increased exposure to societal context and interdisciplinary teamwork.&lt;ref name="fromm"/&gt;  Later reports reiterated the need for more exposure to engineering's context as well as a need to make engineering more attractive and relevant to students.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable of the American Society for Engineering Education, ''The Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World,'' [[American Society for Engineering Education]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Papers also reported the need for engineering students to develop professional and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Hissey, ''Education and Careers 2000,'' Proceedings of the [[IEEE]], vol. 88, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering education today==

Today, requirements for engineering programs reflect a movement to resolve the engineering education problems found in past studies.  Many engineering educators see service-learning as a way to enhance their programs by exposing students to engineering context while also giving them a chance to develop professional and interpersonal skills.  These values are reflected in the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) standards for engineering schools.  For an engineering program to maintain accreditation, ABET requires that they "demonstrate that their students attain the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context".&lt;ref&gt;ABET, ''Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs,'' The Engineering Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]]., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedagogical implications===

;Constructivism

The service-learning method ties in well with a teaching philosophy known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]].  Constructivism is an educational theory rooted in psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="mariappan"&gt;J. Mariappan, S. Monemi and U. Fan, ''Enhancing Authentic Learning Experiences through Community-based Engineering Service-Learning'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari"&gt;M. Ben-Ari, ''Constructivism in Computer Science Education,'' SIGCSE, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  It asserts that learners construct knowledge from previous knowledge rather than passively absorbing knowledge from outside sources.&lt;ref name="mariappan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Smith III, A. A. diSessa and J. Roschelle, ''Misconceptions Reconceived: A Constructivist Analysis of Knowledge in Transition,'' Journal of the Learning Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 115–163, 1993–1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, learning includes both creation of new factual knowledge and understanding the connections between different nodes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bransford and B. S. Stein, ''The IDEAL Problem Solver'', [[New York City]], Bice-Heath, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Service-learning provides an environment where students can actively construct knowledge while engaging in actual projects.  The reflection portion of service-learning gives students time to create connections between old and new knowledge.  

While accepted by many, some educators have criticized constructivism both [[epistemological]]ly and pedagogically.  Pedagogically, critics claim that a constructivist approach gives students in-depth knowledge but not breadth of knowledge.  Since in a constructivist approach takes a significant amount of time to allow students to create new knowledge and relate it to previous knowledge through reflection, instructors usually cannot cover a large amount of material.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Coll and T. G. N. Taylor, ''Using Constructivism to Inform, Tertiary Chemistry Pedagogy,'' Chemistry Education: Research and Practice in Europe, vol. 2, pp. 215–226, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while this may become a real concern for many courses, the specific role of service-learning plays in engineering school courses mitigates these concerns.  Service-learning typically appears in introductory or optional courses in the engineering school.  The goals of these courses is not so much to gain a detailed and broad understand of a field, but rather to have a real world engineering experience.  This is notably different from courses where students must obtain vast amounts of accurate knowledge for precise calculations.

Critics also worry that a constructivist approach to education leaves the learner too disconnected from reality since it constantly focuses on building new knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge.  Thus, theoretically, as they continue building knowledge off of their pre-existing knowledge in isolation, their view of the world could slowly become skewed from reality.&lt;ref name="olssen"&gt;M. Olssen, ''Radical Constructivism and Its Failing: Anti-Realism and Individualism,'' British Journal of Educational Studies, vol. 44, pp. 275–295, Sept., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a weakness for many courses, in service-learning, students work to create real solutions for a real customer.  Thus their ideas must be resolved, not only with fellow engineering team members, but also with reality.  

;Learning styles

In past years, studies on engineering education revealed the [[learning styles]] of most engineering students and the teaching styles of many engineering professors were incompatible.   The five well known learning style dimensions include: sensing/intuitive, visual/auditory, inductive/deductive, active/reflective, and global/sequential.  

According to Richard Felder from North Carolina State University and Linda Silverman from the Institute for the study of Advanced Development, most engineering students are visual, sensing, inductive, and active learners.  Also, many of the creative students are global learners.  However, most engineering education is auditory, intuitive, deductive, passive and sequential.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Felder and L. K. Silverman, ''Learning and Teaching Styles In Engineering Education,'' Engr. Education, vol. 78, pp. 674–681, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such conclusions are not well-supported by research.  There is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widespread "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name="pashler"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pashler | first1 = H. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = M. | last3 = Rohrer | first3 = D. | last4 = Bjork | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Learning styles: Concepts and evidence | url = | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 105–119 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Well-designed studies "flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis".&lt;ref name=pashler /&gt;

;Online service learning

Though the interest in service learning at educational institutions has increased, these projects are often very costly to students and universities.  However, there have been some examples of successful service learning projects facilitated over the Internet.

===Engineering programs with service-learning===

Many different universities have incorporated service-learning into their curricula to address the contextual, motivational, and multi-disciplinary team needs.  Purdue University created the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program in 1995.  Under this program, freshman to senior undergraduate engineering students form multi-disciplinary teams to meet community needs.  Students earn a variable number of credit hours based on their year in school and related contribution to the project.  At Purdue, the service projects are long-term and students earn up to seven semesters worth of credit working on the service project.  The program began with 40 students on 5 teams but has quickly grown to 400 students on 24 teams.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

The EPICS program at Purdue as well as service-learning programs at other universities, have succeeded in offering students practical experience, context, and motivation for engineering.  Seventy seven percent of the students who were able to come back to the EPICS program stayed for additional semesters.  On student evaluations, 70% of students indicated that the program positively impacted their decision to stay in engineering; of the 30% that responded differently, several indicated they had previously decided to stay in the engineering before the program and thus, the program did not affect their decision to stay in engineering.  Student responses also returned favorable results for the educational objectives.  The table below summarizes the responses:

On evaluation comments, students also expressed that EPICS had completely changed their view of engineering, giving them both meaning and direction in all of their engineering studies.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

Penn State University has created a certificate program entitled 'Humanitarian Engineering'.  The emphasis of the program is on relationship building – and are not simply project-driven exercises.  Long-term, sustainable, [[collaborative partnerships]] are formed with host universities and marginalized communities.  This enables development of outreach programs at the universities reaching into local communities.  The Penn State program is vertically integrated across the four-year engineering program allowing students to form these long-term relationships with the host communities.  This method allows for greater understanding of the cultural aspects of engineering design and its impact, as well as development of technical proficiency.  There is also a very strong emphasis on entrepreneurship in the program.  Engineering design solutions are developed and students are encouraged to develop business plans and implement them in the host community.\

[[Clemson University]] also hosts Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries (CEDC), a multi-level immersive student-led organization and class that provides Clemson students of any major with service-learning and project experience. The focus of the program is to provide sustainable solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for those living in the emerging world while using students for all design, planning, and project implementation. CEDC has a student-led corporate organizational structure, including vertical integration from freshmen to graduate students and horizontal integration from over 30 majors, and works on between 15 and 20 projects per semester.  The program also features multidisciplinary teams of 2–4 student interns who live in [[Haiti]] year- round, fall and spring break trips to Haiti for groups of 10–14 students to collect data for their projects, and a course at Clemson University for students to work on their multi-semester projects. The program has designed and managed over $2 million in construction projects in Haiti, all with direct oversight and management from the CEDC interns who are housed by [[Partners in Health]]. To date, CEDC students have implemented projects all over Haiti's rural Central Plateau (including several in [[Cange]]), which include several water systems, a fish hatchery, a [[biodigester]] system, and repairing public schools. 

==Social and ethical implications==

The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Code of Ethics lists contributing to society and human well-being as well as improving public understanding of an engineer's practice area.  Through service-learning provides engineers with the opportunity to both contribute to society and educate the public. 

Along with fostering a good community-university relationship, educators hope incorporating service-learning will increase diversity and retention in the engineering school.  Diversifying the engineering population will allow engineering teams to maintain a better understanding of the needs in a society.  So diversifying engineering teams will allow engineers to both meet real needs as well as provide interfaces to their solutions which the public can understand.  Likewise, a society needs a vast population of engineers to meet the needs of a vast society.

A '''sexual field''' is an arena of social life wherein individuals seek intimate partners and vie for sexual status.  Sexual fields emerge "when a subset of actors with potential romantic or sexual interest orient themselves toward one another according to a logic of desirability imminent to their collective relations and this logic produces, to greater and lesser degrees, a system of stratification" (Green 2014:27).  The term builds on [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s (1980) concept of field and has been defined as a "set of interlocking institutions" (Martin and George 2006) and an "institutionalized matrix of relations" (Green 2005, 2008, 2011) that confers status upon sexual actors based on individual variation in [[sexual capital]].  Relative to those with a sexual capital deficit, actors in possession of sexual capital reap the rewards of the sexual field&amp;mdash;including the ability to select desired sexual partners and the acquisition of social significance.  

Sexual fields are themselves distinguished by distinct "currencies of erotic capital" (Green 2005, 2008), the latter which are quite variable, acquiring dominance in relation to the collective preferences of players.  For example, Green (2005, 2008) argues that the characteristics which confer sexual capital in one field may not in another.  Thus, in a gay leather bar, a bearded, stocky white man in his late-thirties dressed in Levi's jeans and a leather jacket will possess an optimal form of sexual capital, whereas the same man in a swanky Martini bar catering to a twenty-something, high-fashion, urban gay customer base will face a sexual capital deficit.  This variation in power and status occurs because a gay leather bar and a gay Martini bar are physical sites organized by the logic of two distinct sexual fields with contrasting currencies of sexual capital (Green 2005, 2008)&amp;mdash;i.e., distinct "hegemonic systems of judgment" (Martin and George 2006).   

For [[sociological theory]], the study of the sexual field in the sexual fields framework offers a framework for analyzing how collective attributions of desire and desirability are shaped by the sexual field itself.  That is, rather than see desire and desirability as a simple function of individual wants and judgments, the sexual fields framework suggests that such wants and judgments are the consequence of sexual social life.  In this approach, the sexual field acts back on what we find desirable such that desires and desirability are regarded as '''field effects''' (Green 2014).  

To the extent that sexual [[social stratification|stratification]] is related to but not isomorphic with the structure of alternative fields, so the study of sexual fields cannot be subsumed to the study of an economic or political field, for example.  Nevertheless, to the extent that [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[gender]], [[ethnicity]], [[Ageing|age]] and ability, among others, are organizing features of sexual status within a given sexual field, so the relationship of sexual fields to broader historical systems of stratification requires consideration (Green 2005, 2008, 2011. 2014).

The '''Statue of Liberty''' ('''''Liberty Enlightening the World'''''; {{lang-fr|La Liberté éclairant le monde|links=no}}) is a colossal [[neoclassical sculpture]] on [[Liberty Island]] in [[New York Harbor]] in [[New York City]], in the [[United States]]. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]] and built by [[Gustave Eiffel]]. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

The Statue of Liberty is a figure of [[Libertas]], a robed Roman [[liberty goddess]]. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a ''[[tabula ansata]]'' inscribed in [[Roman numerals]] with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]]. A broken chain lies at her feet as she walks forward. The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, a [[national park]] tourism destination, and is a welcoming sight to [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants arriving from abroad]].

Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]], who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples. Because of the [[History of France#Second Empire, 1852–71|post-war instability in France]], work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.

The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, and in [[Madison Square Park]] in [[Manhattan]] from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds. Publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]], of the ''[[New York World]]'', started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000&amp;nbsp;contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was built in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first [[ticker-tape parade]] and a dedication ceremony presided over by President [[Grover Cleveland]].

The statue was administered by the [[United States Lighthouse Board]] until 1901 and then by the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]; since 1933 it has been maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916.

== Design and construction process ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:Disc Sol BM GR1899.12-1.2.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Libertas]] and [[Sol Invictus]] ("Unconquered Sun") both influenced the Statue of Liberty (3rd century disc found at [[Pessinus]] — [[British Museum]]).]]

According to the [[National Park Service]], the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by [[Édouard René de Laboulaye]], president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time. The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye, a staunch abolitionist, and [[Frédéric Bartholdi]], a sculptor. In after-dinner conversation at his home near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], Laboulaye, an ardent supporter of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], is supposed to have said: "If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort—a common work of both our nations."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}}  The National Park Service, in a 2000 report, however, deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet, and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870.&lt;ref name="NPS African American" /&gt; In another essay on their website, the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences, "With the abolition of slavery and the Union's victory in the Civil War in 1865, Laboulaye's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States. In order to honor these achievements, Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France. Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States, the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/stli/historyculture/abolition.htm |title=Abolition |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:U.S. Patent D11023.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Frédéric Bartholdi|Bartholdi's]] [[design patent]]]]

According to sculptor [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]], who later recounted the story, Laboulaye's comment was not intended as a proposal, but it inspired Bartholdi.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}} Given the repressive nature of the regime of [[Napoleon III]], Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye. Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects; in the late 1860s, he approached [[Isma'il Pasha]], [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt#Modern history|Egypt]], with a plan to build ''Progress'' or ''[[Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Statue of Liberty and its Ties to the Middle East|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/danh_vo_labels.pdf|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge [[lighthouse]] in the form of an ancient Egyptian female ''[[fellah]]'' or peasant, robed and holding a torch aloft, at the northern entrance to the [[Suez Canal]] in [[Port Said]]. Sketches and models were made of the proposed work, though it was never erected. There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal, the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]: an ancient [[bronze]] statue of the Greek god of the sun, [[Helios]]. This statue is believed to have been over {{convert|100|ft}} high, and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–8}} Both the khedive and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps|Lesseps]] declined the proposed statue from Bartholdi, citing the expensive cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|date=2003|p=243|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Port Said Lighthouse]] was built instead, by [[François Coignet]] in 1869.
[[File:Liberty-statue-from-behind.jpg|thumb|The Statue of Liberty from behind, showing that she is walking forward]]
Any large project was further delayed by the [[Franco-Prussian War]], in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was captured and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of [[Alsace]] was [[Franco-Prussian War|lost]] to the [[Prussia]]ns, and a [[French Third Republic|more liberal republic]] was installed in France.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=7–9}} As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=60–61}} In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, with [[letter of introduction|letters of introduction]] signed by Laboulaye.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=39–40}}

Arriving at [[New York Harbor]], Bartholdi focused on Bedloe's Island (now named [[Liberty Island]]) as a site for the statue, struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it. He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government—it had been ceded by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1800 for harbor defense. It was thus, as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye: "land common to all the states."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=12–13}} As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers, Bartholdi visited President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=102–103}} Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail, and met many Americans who he thought would be sympathetic to the project.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=39–40}} But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal, and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=16–17}}

Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=85}} The son of a friend of Bartholdi's, U.S. artist [[John LaFarge]], later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U.S. visit at La Farge's [[Rhode Island]] studio. Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=85}} He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians. One of these was the ''[[Lion of Belfort]]'', a [[monumental sculpture]] carved in sandstone below the fortress of [[Belfort]], which during the war had resisted a [[Siege of Belfort|Prussian siege]] for over three months. The defiant lion, {{convert|73|ft}} long and half that in height, displays an emotional quality characteristic of [[Romanticism]], which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=10–11}}

=== Design, style, and symbolism ===
[[File:Indian princess and Columbia.jpg|thumb|Detail from a fresco by [[Constantino Brumidi]] in the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] in Washington, D.C., showing two early symbols of America: [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] (left) and the Indian princess]]

Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}} In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation.&lt;ref name="dela" /&gt; One of these symbols, the personified [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that [[Britannia]] was identified with the United Kingdom and [[Marianne]] came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian princess]], which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans.&lt;ref name="dela" /&gt; The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from [[Libertas]], the [[Religion in ancient Rome#Roman deities|goddess of freedom]] widely worshipped in [[ancient Rome]], especially among [[emancipated slaves]]. A Liberty figure adorned most [[Coins of the United States dollar|American coins]] of the time,{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}} and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including [[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]]'s ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'' (1863) atop the dome of the [[United States Capitol Building]].{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}
[[File:Freedom 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Crawford (sculptor)|Thomas Crawford]]'s ''[[Statue of Freedom]]'']]
Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke [[Classical republicanism|republican ideals]] commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}  A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the [[Great Seal of France]].{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=17–19}}  However, Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famed ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830). In this painting, which commemorates France's [[July Revolution]], a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen.&lt;ref name="dela" /&gt; Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution, and so Bartholdi's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes.&lt;ref name="dela" /&gt; Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work, Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch, representing progress, for the figure to hold.&lt;ref name="Turner 2000" /&gt;

Crawford's statue was designed in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a ''[[pileus (hat)|pileus]]'', the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Jefferson Davis]], a Southerner who would later serve as President of the [[Confederate States of America]], was concerned that the ''pileus'' would be taken as an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=96–97}}
Delacroix's figure wears a ''pileus'',&lt;ref name="dela" /&gt; and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well. Instead, he used a [[diadem]], or crown, to top its head.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=105–108}} In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a ''pileus''.&lt;ref name="Blume 2004-07-16" /&gt; The seven rays form a halo or [[aureole]].&lt;ref name="faq1" /&gt; They evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents,&lt;ref name="mint" /&gt; and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.&lt;ref name="Turner 2000" /&gt;

Bartholdi's early models were all similar in concept: a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty, wearing a ''[[stola]]'' and ''pella'' (gown and cloak, common in depictions of Roman goddesses) and holding a torch aloft. According to popular accounts, the face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi, the sculptor's mother,{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=52–53, 55, 87}} but Regis Huber, the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this, as well as other similar speculations, have no basis in fact.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;Interviewed for Watson, Corin. ''Statue of Liberty: Building a Colossus'' (TV documentary, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; He designed the figure with a strong, uncomplicated silhouette, which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering [[New York Bay]] to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan. He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling, reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose.&lt;ref name="Turner 2000" /&gt; Bartholdi wrote of his technique:

{{Quote|The surfaces should be broad and simple, defined by a bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy the proportion of the work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.&lt;ref name="Bartholdi 1885 p42" /&gt;}}

Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved. Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain, but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War. The erected statue does stride over a broken chain, half-hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=105–108}} Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty's left hand; he settled on a ''[[tabula ansata]]'',{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=108–111}} used to evoke the concept of law.&lt;ref name="faq2" /&gt; Though Bartholdi greatly admired the [[United States Constitution]], he chose to inscribe "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" on the tablet, thus associating the date of the country's [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] with the concept of liberty.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=108–111}}

Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor, architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], in the project.&lt;ref name=TV /&gt; As chief engineer,&lt;ref name=TV /&gt; Viollet-le-Duc designed a brick [[pier (architecture)|pier]] within the statue, to which the skin would be anchored.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=120}}
After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co., Viollet-le-Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin, copper sheets, and the method used to shape it, [[Repoussé and chasing|repoussé]], in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers.&lt;ref name=TV /&gt;{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=118, 125}} An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume, as the copper need be only {{convert|0.094|in}} thick. Bartholdi had decided on a height of just over {{convert|151|ft}} for the statue, double that of Italy's [[Sancarlone]] and [[Hermannsdenkmal|the German statue]] of [[Arminius]], both made with the same method.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=26}}

=== Announcement and early work ===
By 1875, France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing interest in the upcoming [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=121}} In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, ''Liberty Enlightening the World''.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}} The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=44–45}} The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during [[Franco-Prussian War|the war with Prussia]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}} [[Orléanist|French monarchists]] opposed the statue, if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a [[senator for life#France|senator for life]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=44–45}} Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the [[Paris Opera]] on April 25, 1876, that featured a new [[cantata]] by composer [[Charles Gounod]]. The piece was titled ''La Liberté éclairant le monde'', the French version of the statue's announced name.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=123–125}}

[[File:Collossal hand and torch. Bartholdi's statue of "Liberty.", from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Stereoscope|Stereoscopic image]] of right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty, [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Centennial Exposition]]]]
Initially focused on the elites, the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181&amp;nbsp;French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the [[Franco-American alliance|French contingent]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]]. The copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in [[Visnes, Rogaland|Visnes]], Norway,&lt;ref name="News of Norway" /&gt; though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2009-07-02 part 2" /&gt; According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the [[Museum of the City of New York]], {{convert|200,000|lb|kg}} was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist [[Eugène Secrétan]] donated {{convert|128,000|lb|kg}} of copper.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=36}}

Although plans for the statue had not been finalized, Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm, bearing the torch, and the head. Work began at the Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co. workshop.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=126–128}} In May 1876, Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition,{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=25}} and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=26}} The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August; because of its late arrival, it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue, and while some reports correctly identified the work, others called it the "Colossal Arm" or "Bartholdi Electric Light". The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers' interest, including [[Bartholdi Fountain|an outsized fountain]] designed by Bartholdi.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=130}} Nevertheless, the arm proved popular in the exhibition's waning days, and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=49}} After the exhibition closed, the arm was transported to New York, where it remained on display in [[Madison Square Park]] for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=49}}

During his second trip to the United States, Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project, and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco-American Union.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=134}} Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=30}} The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the "American Committee".{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=94}} One of its members was 19-year-old [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the future governor of New York and president of the United States.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=134}} On March 3, 1877, on his final full day in office, President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it. President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], who took office the following day, selected the Bedloe's Island site that Bartholdi had proposed.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=135}}

=== Construction in France ===
[[File:Head of the Statue of Liberty on display in a park in Paris.jpg|thumb|The statue's head on exhibit at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair]], 1878]]
On his return to Paris in 1877, Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head, which was exhibited at the 1878 [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World's Fair]]. Fundraising continued, with models of the statue put on sale. Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget, Gauthier &amp; Co. workshop were also offered.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=137}} The French government authorized a lottery; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a [[terracotta]] model of the statue. By the end of 1879, about 250,000&amp;nbsp;francs had been raised.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=32}}

The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=136–137}} The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder [[Gustave Eiffel]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=137}} Eiffel and his structural engineer, [[Maurice Koechlin]], decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron [[truss]] tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars&lt;ref name=TV /&gt; which culminated in a mesh of metal straps, known as "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=22}}{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=139–143}} To prevent [[galvanic corrosion]] between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with [[asbestos]] impregnated with [[shellac]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=30}}

Eiffel's design made the statue one of the earliest examples of [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] construction, in which the exterior of the structure is not [[wikt:load bearing|load bearing]], but is instead supported by an interior framework. He included two interior [[Spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=33}} Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided, but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder, {{convert|40|ft}} long.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=32}} As the pylon tower arose, Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=34}} The components of the pylon tower were built in the [[Eiffel (company)|Eiffel]] factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of [[Levallois-Perret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/hauts-de-seine/la-tour-a-vu-le-jour-a-levallois-30-04-2004-2004947854.php |title=La tour a vu le jour à Levallois |date=April 30, 2004 |work=Le Parisien |accessdate=December 8, 2012 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue's assembly. He had originally expected to assemble the skin on-site as the masonry pier was built; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe's Island.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=144}}

In a symbolic act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, was driven by [[United States Ambassador to France]] [[Levi P. Morton]].&lt;ref name="PBS StLi timeline" /&gt; The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=36–38}} Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of [[Montauban]].{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=39}} By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=38}} Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]]. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=37}} The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=38}}

[[File:Pedestal for Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Morris Hunt]]'s pedestal under construction in June 1885]]

The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal. The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the [[Washington Monument]] sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=159–160}} There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=159–160}} There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born [[Constantino Brumidi]] to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=163}} ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' declared its wish that "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once."{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=161}} ''The New York Times'' stated that "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances."{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=160}} Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=160}}

==== Design ====
[[File:Leslie Liberty.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'', June 1885, showing (clockwise from left) [[woodcut]]s of the completed statue in Paris, Bartholdi, and the statue's interior structure]]
The foundation of Bartholdi's statue was to be laid inside [[Fort Wood (New York)|Fort Wood]], a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it had served as a recruiting station.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=91}} The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name="statistics" /&gt;
In 1881, the New York committee commissioned [[Richard Morris Hunt]] to design the pedestal. Within months, Hunt submitted a detailed plan, indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=169}} He proposed a pedestal {{convert|114|ft}} in height; faced with money problems, the committee reduced that to {{convert|89|ft}}.&lt;ref name="stal" /&gt;

Hunt's pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture, including [[Doric order|Doric]] portals, as well as some elements influenced by [[Aztec architecture]].&lt;ref name=TV /&gt; The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail, in order to focus attention on the statue.&lt;ref name="stal" /&gt; In form, it is a truncated pyramid, {{convert|62|ft}} square at the base and {{convert|39.4|ft}} at the top. The four sides are identical in appearance. Above the door on each side, there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states (between 1876 and 1889, there were 38 U.S. states), although this was not done. Above that, a balcony was placed on each side, framed by pillars. Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal, above which the statue itself rises.&lt;ref name="Bartholdi 1885 p62" /&gt; According to author [[Louis Auchincloss]], the pedestal "craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty".&lt;ref name="stal" /&gt; The committee hired former army General [[Charles Pomeroy Stone]] to oversee the construction work.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=71–72}} Construction on the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} foundation began in 1883, and the pedestal's cornerstone was laid in 1884.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=169}} In Hunt's original conception, the pedestal was to have been made of solid [[granite]]. Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans; the final design called for poured concrete walls, up to {{convert|20|ft}} thick, faced with granite blocks.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=184–186}} This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in [[Branford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Branford's History Is Set in Stone |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/branfords-history-is-set-in-stone/ |publisher=Connecticut Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=184–186}}

[[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrant civil engineer [[Joachim Goschen Giæver]] designed the structural framework for the Statue of Liberty. His work involved design computations, detailed fabrication and construction drawings, and oversight of construction. In completing his engineering for the statue's frame, Giæver worked from drawings and sketches produced by Gustave Eiffel.&lt;ref name="structuremag.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1484|title=STRUCTUREmag – Structural Engineering Magazine, Tradeshow: Joachim Gotsche Giaver|date=November 27, 2012|website=archive.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127045537/http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1484|archivedate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fundraising ====
[[File:Head of the Statue of Liberty 1885.jpg|thumb|Unpacking of the face of the Statue of Liberty, which was delivered on June 17, 1885]]

Fundraising for the statue had begun in 1882. The committee organized a large number of money-raising events.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=163–164}} As part of one such effort, an auction of art and manuscripts, poet [[Emma Lazarus]] was asked to donate an original work. She initially declined, stating she could not write a poem about a statue. At the time, she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[pogrom]]s in eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced. She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=165–166}} The resulting [[sonnet]], "[[The New Colossus]]", including the iconic lines "Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free", is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=172–175}}

Even with these efforts, fundraising lagged. [[Grover Cleveland]], the [[governor of New York]], vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884. An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000, sufficient to complete the project, also failed. The New York committee, with only $3,000 in the bank, suspended work on the pedestal. With the project in jeopardy, groups from other American cities, including Boston and Philadelphia, offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it.&lt;ref name="Levine Story 1961" /&gt;

[[Joseph Pulitzer]], publisher of the ''[[New York World]]'', a New York newspaper, announced a drive to raise $100,000—the equivalent of $2.3&amp;nbsp;million today.&lt;ref name="meas" /&gt; Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor, no matter how small the amount given.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|pp=40–41}} The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers, especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors. "A young girl alone in the world" donated "60&amp;nbsp;cents, the result of self denial."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} One donor gave "five cents as a poor office boy's [[Lesson of the widow's mite|mite]] toward the Pedestal Fund." A group of children sent a dollar as "the money we saved to go to the circus with."{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=51}} Another dollar was given by a "lonely and very aged woman."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York's rival city of Brooklyn—the cities would not merge until 1898—donated $15; other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=107}} A kindergarten class in [[Davenport, Iowa]], mailed the ''World'' a gift of $1.35.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=105}} As the donations flooded in, the committee resumed work on the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=110–111}}

==== Construction ====
On June 17, 1885, the French steamer ''Isère'', arrived in New York with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board. New Yorkers displayed their new-found enthusiasm for the statue. Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the ship.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%206/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram%201885%20Jun%20-%201885%20Oct%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Evening%20Telegram%201885%20Jun%20-%201885%20Oct%20Grayscale%20-%200140.pdf#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&amp;u=ffffffffc423758c&amp;DocId=5727280&amp;Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20I%2dE&amp;HitCount=4&amp;hits=4f+179+197+198+&amp;SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&amp;.pdf |title=The Isere-Bartholdi Gift Reaches the Horsehoe Safely |work=The Evening Post |date=June 17, 1885 |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund, on August 11, 1885, the ''World'' announced that $102,000 had been raised from 120,000&amp;nbsp;donors, and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=114}}

Even with the success of the fund drive, the pedestal was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel [[I-beam]]s within the concrete pedestal and assembled.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=19}} Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=49}} Due to the width of the pedestal, it was not possible to erect [[scaffolding]], and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=64}} Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with [[gold leaf]]—and placed the lights inside them.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=36}} A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], co-designer of New York's [[Central Park]] and Brooklyn's [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]], supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=65}}

=== Dedication ===
[[File:EdwardMoran-UnveilingTheStatueofLiberty1886Large.jpg|thumb|''Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World'' (1886) by [[Edward Moran]]. Oil on canvas. The J. Clarence Davies Collection, [[Museum of the City of New York]].]]
A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event.{{sfn|Khan|2010|p=176}} On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at [[Madison Square]], once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to [[the Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]] at the southern tip of [[Manhattan]] by way of [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the ''World'' building on [[Park Row (Manhattan)|Park Row]]. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw [[ticker tape]] from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the [[ticker-tape parade]].{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=177–178}}

A nautical parade began at 12:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe's Island for the dedication.{{sfn|Bell|Abrams|1984|p=52}} De Lesseps made the first speech, on behalf of the French committee, followed by the chairman of the New York committee, Senator [[William M. Evarts]]. A [[Flag of France|French flag]] draped across the statue's face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts's speech, but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely. The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts's address.{{sfn|Khan|2010|pp=177–178}} President Cleveland spoke next, stating that the statue's "stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man's oppression until Liberty enlightens the world".{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=127}} Bartholdi, observed near the dais, was called upon to speak, but he declined. Orator [[Chauncey M. Depew]] concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=71}}

No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area [[suffragist]]s, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=127}} A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=128}}

Shortly after the dedication, ''[[The Cleveland Gazette]]'', an [[African American]] newspaper, suggested that the statue's torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation "in reality":

{{Quote|"Liberty enlightening the world," indeed! The expression makes us sick. This government is a howling farce. It can not or rather ''does not'' protect its citizens within its ''own'' borders. Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the "liberty" of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family, without being [[Ku Klux Klan|ku-kluxed]], perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged, and his property destroyed. The idea of the "liberty" of this country "enlightening the world," or even [[Patagonia]], is ridiculous in the extreme.&lt;ref name="Cleveland Gazette 1886-11-27" /&gt;}}

When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue's dedication, it produced only a faint gleam, barely visible from Manhattan. The ''World'' characterized it as "more like a glowworm than a beacon."{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light, but this proved too expensive. The [[United States Lighthouse Board]] took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch's effect; in spite of its efforts, the statue remained virtually invisible at night. When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893, he made additional suggestions, all of which proved ineffective. He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue, allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel's design.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=133–134}} In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt, once a member of the New York committee, ordered the statue's transfer to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], as it had proved useless as a lighthouse.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} A unit of the [[Army Signal Corps]] was stationed on Bedloe's Island until 1923, after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=24}}

The statue rapidly became a landmark. Many immigrants who entered through New York saw it as a welcoming sight. Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty. One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled:

{{Quote|I saw the Statue of Liberty. And I said to myself, "Lady, you're such a beautiful!{{sic}} You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here. Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America." And always that statue was on my mind.{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=78}}}}

Originally, the statue was a dull copper color, but shortly after 1900 a green [[patina]], also called [[verdigris]], caused by the oxidation of the copper skin, began to spread. As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2009-07-02 part 1" /&gt; Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion, Congress authorized {{USD|62800|1906|round=-3}} for various repairs, and to paint the statue both inside and out.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1906-07-19" /&gt; There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1906-07-29" /&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin, "softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful."{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=168}} The statue was painted only on the inside. The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=168}}

On July 30, 1916, during World War I, German saboteurs set off [[Black Tom explosion|a disastrous explosion]] on the Black Tom peninsula in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], in what is now part of [[Liberty State Park]], close to Bedloe's Island. Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Britain and France for their war efforts were detonated, and seven people were killed. The statue sustained minor damage, mostly to the torch-bearing right arm, and was closed for ten days. The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about {{USD|100000|1916|round=-4|about=yes}}. The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public-safety reasons, and it has remained closed ever since.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=71}}

That same year, [[Ralph Pulitzer]], who had succeeded his father [[Joseph Pulitzer|Joseph]] as publisher of the ''World'', began a drive to raise {{USD|30000|1916|round=-3}} for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors, but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. [[Gutzon Borglum]], who later sculpted [[Mount Rushmore]], redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights, successfully illuminating the statue.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=136–139}}

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the [[Liberty Bond]] drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=148–151}}

In 1924, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] used his authority under the [[Antiquities Act]] to declare the statue a [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]].{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} The only successful suicide in the statue's history occurred five years later, when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death, glancing off the statue's breast and landing on the base.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=147}}

=== Early National Park Service years (1933–1982) ===
[[File:Liberty 1927.gif|thumb|Bedloe's Island in 1927, showing the statue and army buildings. The eleven-pointed walls of [[Fort Wood (New York)|Fort Wood]], which still form the statue's base, are visible.]]

In 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered the statue to be transferred to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=136}} The [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete;{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=202}} the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. [[Copper sheathing]] was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=169}} The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=202}}

During World War II, the statue remained open to visitors, although it was not illuminated at night due to [[Blackout (wartime)|wartime blackouts]]. It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on [[D-Day]], June 6, 1944, when its lights flashed "dot-dot-dot-dash", the [[Morse code]] for [[V sign#The V campaign and the victory/freedom sign|V, for victory]]. New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on [[V-E Day]], the statue was once again illuminated after sunset. The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=141–143}} In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=169}}

In 1956, an [[Act of Congress]] officially renamed Bedloe's Island as Liberty Island, a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier. The act also mentioned the efforts to found an [[American Museum of Immigration]] on the island, which backers took as federal approval of the project, though the government was slow to grant funds for it.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=147–148}} Nearby [[Ellis Island]] was made part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument, Ellis Island and Liberty Island|Statue of Liberty National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1965.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=41}} In 1972, the immigration museum, in the statue's base, was finally opened in a ceremony led by President [[Richard Nixon]]. The museum's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an [[Ellis Island Immigration Museum|immigration museum]] on Ellis Island.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=19}}

In 1970, [[Ivy Bottini]] led a demonstration at the statue where she and others from the [[National Organization for Women]]'s New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read "WOMEN OF THE WORLD UNITE!"&lt;ref name="bare_url_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lapride.org/pages07/honorees07.htm |title=Honorees |publisher=Lapride.org |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=November 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906063337/http://lapride.org/pages07/honorees07.htm |archivedate=September 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feminist.org/research/chronicles/fc1970.html |title=The Feminist Chronicles, 1953–1993 – 1970 – Feminist Majority Foundation |publisher=Feminist.org |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning December 26, 1971, 15 anti-Vietnam War veterans occupied the statue, flying a US flag upside down from her crown. They left December 28 following a Federal Court order.&lt;ref&gt;''1973 World Almanac and Book of Facts'', p. 996.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican independence]], [[United States pro-life movement|opposition to abortion]], and opposition to [[Invasion of Grenada|US intervention in Grenada]].  Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a [[Gay Pride Parade]] rally and the annual [[Baltic states under Soviet rule (1944–91)|Captive Baltic Nations]] rally.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=72–73}}

A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the [[American Bicentennial]] in 1976. The statue was the focal point for [[Operation Sail]], a regatta of [[tall ship]]s from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=143}} The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=20}}

=== Renovation and rededication (1982–2000) ===

{{See also|Liberty Weekend}}

The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=165}} In 1982, it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration. Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure. It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of [[structural failure]]. In addition, the head had been installed {{convert|2|ft}} off center, and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind. The armature structure was badly corroded, and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced.{{sfn|Harris|1985|pp=169–171}} Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936, when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed, much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=38}}

In May 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by [[Chrysler Corporation]] chair [[Lee Iacocca]], to raise the funds needed to complete the work.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=204–205}} Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350&amp;nbsp;million in donations.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=216–218}} The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a [[cause marketing]] campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an [[American Express]] card, the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7&amp;nbsp;million to the restoration project.&lt;ref name="Daw 2006" /&gt;

In 1984, the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation. Workers erected the world's largest free-standing [[scaffolding|scaffold]],&lt;ref name=TV /&gt; which obscured the statue from view. [[Liquid nitrogen]] was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades, leaving two layers of [[coal tar]], originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion. [[Sodablasting|Blasting]] with [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=81}} The restorers' work was hampered by the asbestos-based substance that Bartholdi had used—ineffectively, as inspections showed—to prevent galvanic corrosion. Workers within the statue had to wear [[hazmat suit|protective gear]], dubbed "moon suits", with self-contained breathing circuits.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=76}} Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired, and new copper was added where necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=55}} The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at [[Bell Labs]], which had a patina that closely resembled the statue's; in exchange, the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=172}} The torch, found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations, was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi's unaltered torch.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=153}} Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=75}} The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one, whose flame is covered in 24-[[karat]] gold.&lt;ref name="faq2" /&gt; The torch reflects the sun's rays in daytime and is lighted by [[floodlight]]s at night.&lt;ref name="faq2" /&gt;

[[File:2016-11 Statue of Liberty 02.jpg|thumb|right|''Liberty Enlightening the World'']]
The entire [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddled iron]] armature designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant [[stainless steel]] bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of [[Duplex Stainless Steel|Ferralium]], an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|pp=74–76}} To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=57}} The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from [[metal-halide lamp]]s that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|p=153}} Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=71}} A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=84}} An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up to the level of the shoulder.{{sfn|Hayden|Despont|1986|p=88}}

July 3–6, 1986, was designated "[[Liberty Weekend]]", marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening. President Reagan presided over the rededication, with French President [[François Mitterrand]] in attendance. July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail,{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=106}} and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5.&lt;ref name="histcult" /&gt; In Reagan's dedication speech, he stated, "We are the keepers of the flame of liberty; we hold it high for the world to see."{{sfn|Sutherland|2003|p=106}}

=== Closures and reopenings (2001–present) ===

[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Statue of Liberty on September 11, 2001 as the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] burn in the background]]

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public. The island reopened at the end of 2001, while the pedestal and statue remained off-limits. The pedestal reopened in August 2004,&lt;ref name="histcult" /&gt; but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency. The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration.&lt;ref name="reopen" /&gt; New York Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] made the statue's reopening a personal crusade.&lt;ref name="Neuman 2007-07-05" /&gt; On May 17, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Ken Salazar]], announced that as a "special gift" to America, the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4, but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day.&lt;ref name="reopen" /&gt;

The statue, including the pedestal and base, closed on October 29, 2011, for installation of new elevators and staircases and to bring other facilities, such as restrooms, up to code. The statue was reopened on October 28, 2012,&lt;ref name="NPS StLi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raja 2010-08-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SacBee" /&gt;  only to close again a day later due to [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;  Although the storm did not harm the statue, it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty Island and [[Ellis Island]],  severely damaging the dock used by the ferries bearing visitors to the statue.  On November 8, 2012, a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2012-11-08" /&gt;  Due to lack of electricity on Liberty Island, a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night. The superintendent of [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], David Luchsinger, whose home on the island was severely damaged, stated that it would be "optimistically&amp;nbsp;... months" before the island was reopened to the public.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2012-11-30" /&gt; The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Long |first=Colleen |title=Statue of Liberty reopens as US marks July Fourth |url=https://news.yahoo.com/statue-liberty-reopens-us-marks-july-fourth-154837229.html |work=Yahoo!

On October 7, 2016, construction started on a new Statue of Liberty museum on Liberty Island. The new $70 million, {{Convert|26,000|ft2|m2|sing=on}} museum will be able to accommodate all of the island's visitors when it opens in 2019, as opposed to the current museum, which only 20% of the island's visitors can visit.&lt;ref name="nydn-20161006" /&gt;The museum, designed by [[FXFOWLE Architects]], will integrate with the parkland around it.&lt;ref name="dnainfo-20161006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amny.com/news/statue-of-liberty-museum-to-open-on-liberty-island-in-2019-1.12416472|title=Statue of Liberty Museum to open in 2019|last=Pereira|first=Ivan|date=October 6, 2016|work=|newspaper=am New York|access-date=October 7, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Fürstenberg heads the fundraising for the museum, and the project had garnered more than $40 million in fundraising as of groundbreaking.&lt;ref name="dnainfo-20161006" /&gt;

== Access and attributes ==

=== Location and tourism ===
[[File:Libertyferry.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Tourists aboard a [[Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises|Circle Line]] ferry arriving at [[Liberty Island]], June 1973]]

The statue is situated in [[Upper New York Bay]] on [[Liberty Island]] south of [[Ellis Island]],  which together comprise the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]]. Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800.&lt;ref name="NPS Bedloe's Island" /&gt; As agreed in an 1834 [[interstate compact|compact]] between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay's midpoint, the original islands remain New York territory though located on the New Jersey side of the state line. Liberty Island is [[List of smaller islands in New York City#Manhattan|one of the islands that are part]] of the [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York. Land created by [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] added to the {{convert|2.3|acre|ha|adj=on}} original island at Ellis Island is New Jersey territory.&lt;ref name="NJvsNY1998" /&gt;

No charge is made for entrance to the national monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use, as private boats may not dock at the island. A concession was granted in 2007 to [[Statue Cruises]] to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing [[Circle Line Downtown|Circle Line]], which had operated the service since 1953.&lt;ref name="Ramirez 2007-06-29" /&gt;
The ferries, which depart from [[Liberty State Park]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public, making a combined trip possible.&lt;ref name="ferry map" /&gt; All ferry riders are subject to security screening, similar to airport procedures, prior to boarding.&lt;ref name="NPS Safety and Security" /&gt; Visitors intending to enter the statue's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum/pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket.&lt;ref name="faq3" /&gt; Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket, which may be reserved up to a year in advance. A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend: ten per group, three groups per hour. Climbers may bring only medication and cameras—lockers are provided for other items—and must undergo a second security screening.&lt;ref name="faq4" /&gt;

=== Inscriptions, plaques, and dedications ===

[[File:Liberty Island photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island.]]

There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty.
* A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty, designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget, Gauthier et Cie (''Cie'' is the French abbreviation analogous to ''Co.''). {{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}
* A presentation tablet, also bearing Bartholdi's name, declares the statue is a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors "the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship."{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}
* A tablet placed by the New York committee commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}
* The cornerstone bears a plaque placed by the [[Freemason]]s.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}
* In 1903, a bronze tablet that bears the text of [[Emma Lazarus]]'s sonnet, "[[The New Colossus]]" (1883), was presented by friends of the poet. Until the 1986 renovation, it was mounted inside the pedestal; today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum, in the base.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}
* "The New Colossus" tablet is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977, celebrating the poet's life.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=222–223}}

A group of statues stands at the western end of the island, honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty. Two Americans—Pulitzer and Lazarus—and three Frenchmen—Bartholdi, Eiffel, and Laboulaye—are depicted. They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner.{{sfn|Harris|1985|p=163}}

== UNESCO World Heritage Site ==
In 1984, the Statue of Liberty was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The UNESCO "Statement of Significance" describes the statue as a "masterpiece of the human spirit" that "endures as a highly potent symbol—inspiring contemplation, debate and protest—of ideals such as liberty, peace, human rights, abolition of slavery, democracy and opportunity."&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt;

Hundreds of [[replicas of the Statue of Liberty]] are displayed worldwide.{{sfn|Moreno|2000|pp=200–201}} A smaller version of the statue, one-fourth the height of the original, was given by the American community in Paris to that city.

As an American icon, the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country's coinage and stamps. It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York's 2001 entry in the [[state quarters]] series.&lt;ref name="Statue of Liberty postage stamps" /&gt; An image of the statue was chosen for the [[American Platinum Eagle|American Eagle platinum bullion coins]] in 1997, and it was placed on the [[reverse (coin)|reverse]], or tails, side of the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program|Presidential Dollar series]] of circulating coins.&lt;ref name="mint" /&gt; Two images of the statue's torch appear on the current [[United States ten-dollar bill|ten-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name="newmoney.gov $10 note" /&gt; The statue's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 [[forever stamp]] proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino.&lt;ref name="Severson Healey 2011-04-14" /&gt;

Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions. Between 1986&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1986-01-24" /&gt; and 2000,&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2000-01-11" /&gt; New York State issued [[vehicle registration plates of New York|license plates]] with an outline of the statue.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1986-01-24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2000-01-11" /&gt; The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]'s [[New York Liberty]] use both the statue's name and its image in their logo, in which the torch's flame doubles as a basketball.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1997-02-14" /&gt; The [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] depicted the statue's head on their [[third jersey]], beginning in 1997.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 1997-01-12" /&gt; The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 Men's Basketball Final Four]], played at New Jersey's [[Meadowlands Sports Complex]], featured the statue in its logo.&lt;ref name="Sandomir 1996-03-29" /&gt;  The [[Libertarian Party of the United States]] uses the statue in its emblem.&lt;ref name="Libertarian" /&gt;

The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture. In music, it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies, as in [[Toby Keith]]'s song "[[Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)]]", and in opposition, appearing on the cover of the [[Dead Kennedys]]' album ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which protested the Reagan administration.&lt;ref name="popcult" /&gt; In film, the torch is the setting for the climax of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1942 movie ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]''.&lt;ref name="Spoto 1983 p262–263" /&gt; The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', in which it is seen half-buried in sand.&lt;ref name="popcult" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greene &amp; Slotkin 1998 p52" /&gt; It is knocked over in the science-fiction film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-movies-hated-statue-liberty.php/6 |title=10 Movies That Hated The Statue Of Liberty &gt;&gt; Page 6 of 10 |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324010619/http://whatculture.com/film/10-movies-hated-statue-liberty.php/6 |archivedate=March 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Cloverfield]]'' the head is ripped off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18028350 |title='Cloverfield' Release Will Be Test of Online Hype : NPR |accessdate=March 24, 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414143708/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18028350 |archivedate=April 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jack Finney]]'s time-travel novel ''[[Time and Again (novel)|Time and Again]]'', the right arm of the statue, on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park, plays a crucial role.&lt;ref name="Darrach 1970-06-26" /&gt; [[Robert Holdstock]], consulting editor of ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', wondered in 1979:

{{Quote|Where would science fiction be without the Statue of Liberty? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted &lt;nowiki&gt;[E]&lt;/nowiki&gt;arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens have found it curious&amp;nbsp;... the symbol of Liberty, of optimism, has become a symbol of science fiction's pessimistic view of the future.&lt;ref name="Nicholls 1979 p14" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">'''Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs''' ('''SASA''') is a division of the [[Office of Elementary and Secondary Education]] (OESE) of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) that administers programs of financial assistance to [[State education agency|State]] and [[Local Education Agency|local education agencies]] (LEA) and to colleges and universities. Under [[Title I]] of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] (ESEA) of 1965, SASA administers several Title I programs of supplementary instruction and other services. This includes programs such as the Improving Basic Programs Operated by LEAs and the Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children Who are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk. Under [[Title III]] of the ESEA, SASA administers the State Formula Grant Program for English Language Acquisition and Language Enhancement. SASA also administers the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program authorized by the [[McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] (P.L. 100-77).

== Organization ==
{{Education in the U.S.}}
SASA is headed by a Director who reports to the Assistant Secretary and/or Deputy Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. The current director is Dr. Zollie Stevenson, Jr.

SASA is divided into six Program Groups:

=== Policy Coordination Group ===
The Policy Coordination Group is responsible for policy coordination and develops policy guidance that clarifies for implementation purposes the principal themes of the President's education blueprint. Title I formula grant allocations are also managed by this group as is the programmatic focus on services to non-public schools. The group influences the educational community and others who need to understand the parameters for implementing Title I requirements.

=== Standards and Assessments Group ===
The Standards and Assessments Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop the standards and assessment systems required by the new [[Title I]]. The group provides direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized technical assistance through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment issues. They also work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.

=== Instructional Change Group ===
The Instructional Change Group is responsible for changing the face of teaching and learning in [[Title I]] schools in a manner that focuses on what works to generate improved results for children. This unit helps technical assistance providers work with schools to implement Title I programs in ways that focus on improving classroom instruction, including the involvement of parents in their child's education. In addition, this unit works with States to design, implement, and evaluate State systems of support for making Title I targeted assistance and schoolwide programs more effective vehicles for instructional change and for turning around low-performing schools. This group also has responsibility for working with content and regional comprehensive centers funded by the Department to develop strategies and materials to aid schools in corrective action and restructuring.

=== Monitoring Group ===
The Monitoring Group is responsible for instituting a process of achievement-focused monitoring for compliance with the implementation of [[Title I]], Parts A, B and D and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education programs. States not fully compliant are presented with the opportunity to take corrective actions to address identified concerns. It is through the monitoring process that this group influences the extent to which States, school districts, and schools consider how they are using federal education resources to improve student achievement.

=== Accountability Group ===
The Accountability Group is responsible for ensuring that States develop and update the accountability systems used to hold school districts and schools responsible for student achievement under [[Title I]], Part A as amended by the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB). This group reviews and recommends approval or disapproval of annual State amendments to their Title I required accountability plans and orchestrates the peer review process for the growth model accountability pilot program authorized by the Secretary. The group will also be involved with managing the development/refinement of data definitions associated with NCLB accountability and the annual Consolidated State Performance Report. The group will provide direct technical assistance to States and also provides specialized TA through external experts for longer term interventions for States with significant assessment and accountability issues. They also will work with the States to help them comply in a manner that results in systems of standards and assessments that drive instructional change.

=== Title III State Formula Grants Group ===
The Title III State Formula Grants Group is responsible for the administration of the [[Title III]] State formula grant program. The group works collaboratively with the [[Office of English Language Acquisition]] and the other SASA groups to develop policy guidance, monitor program compliance, ensure program accountability, and provide State and local educational agencies with technical assistance to develop and enhance their capacity for developing standards and assessment systems and providing high quality language instruction educational programs for [[English language learners]].

'''Subtext''' or '''undertone''' is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of [[metaphor]]. Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is content underneath the [[spoken dialogue|dialogue]]. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, [[anger]], [[competition]], [[pride]], showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and [[Base motive|motives]] of characters — what they really think and believe. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to [[censorship]] or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may include a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, science fiction and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in [[suspension of disbelief]].

Subtext includes information about the period and culture in which the author of a book is writing that may not be deliberately articulated but is conveyed through the text in speech, social customs or historical details. 

A more recently coined term, '''metamessage''' is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext.&lt;ref name="Ballon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Ballon|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sSIF2PMmEC&amp;pg=PT240|year=2009|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-342-6|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1112|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metamessage'' is a term more commonly used in the analysis of [[business communication]] rather than of literary works.&lt;ref name="LohmannLohmann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger A. Lohmann|author2=Nancy Lohmann|title=Social Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JpY07RJXqkC&amp;pg=PT225|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50261-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

==Definition==
The author [[David Baboulene]], in his practical academic work on story theory, ''The Story Book'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Baboulene| first = David| title = ''The Story Book - Guidance for writers on story creation, optimisation and problem resolution''| edition = 1st| year = 2010| publisher = DreamEngine Media Ltd| isbn = 978-0-9557089-2-3| pages = 256 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines subtext as "the result of any form of gap in knowledge between any of the participants in a story; for example, between the author and a character, between two characters or between the audience and at least one character."

An example occurs in the 1978 movie [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]. Lois Lane has just met Clark Kent. The subtext is that she has taken an instant dislike to him. At the surface, however, their conversation seems only to solicit and supply information about the existence of others of Clark Kent's type.  "Any more at home like you?" she inquires. "Uh, not really, no", Clark replies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = ''[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt] http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt, View source lines 1718-1722''}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Examples ==
In the play ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], subtext is important in gaining a greater understanding of the characters, as they cannot always speak freely due to the constrictions of social conventions at the time.

A scene in [[Woody Allen]]'s movie ''[[Annie Hall]]'', in which [[subtitles]] explain the characters' inner thoughts during an apparently innocent conversation, is an example of the subtext of a scene being made explicit.

Victorian novels may feature confining social norms such as strict marriage conventions, taboos against births out of wedlock, inheritance to first born sons, etc., that form the subtext of plot and character. These issues can be deployed unconsciously, as in [[Wilkie Collins]]' "The Woman in White" or as part of a concealed critique of gender politics, as in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s "Jane Eyre".

In the episode "My Best Friend's Bottom" of the British comedy TV series ''[[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]]'', "Captain Subtext" is a tool used in the narrative to explicitly make the viewers aware of the subtextual message in the dialogue. In it, the dialogue and the subtext have been deliberately made humorous.

Television sci-fi such as the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (both of which implicitly avoided onscreen sexual situations) have often been discussed with respect to certain scenes or lines of dialogue.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Cues for the subtext are sometimes given in the main text in the form of ''intertexts'', which are [[allusion]]s to the themes of other texts. An example is ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which can be interpreted as containing numerous biblical (intertextual) allusions, framing the subtext as a religiously inspired theme—the search for the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and the meaning of life beyond physical existence.&lt;ref name="Danesi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Messages, Signs, and Meanings: A Basic Textbook in Semiotics and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDI4mBnS8OoC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-250-8|page=142|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political use==
Historians have often identified an anticipated future revolution, often without the ruling party's understanding.

Such an example of the power and controversy of subtexts might include the deliverance theme pervasive in the songs, stories, and symbols of the slaves in the United States up through the [[Civil Rights]] era and, perhaps, still today. The slave prayers, with their theme of deliverance, may have seemed subversive, as striking at planter ideology and control &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DhlT0z9DX3cC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=slavery+deliverance+subtext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sR3Zu9t2Pq&amp;sig=DPczMb3EAQxtXp21ktJfQ0X1lC0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ogy4Us7CEoqihgf86oD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20deliverance%20subtext&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtext messages have seen fairly widespread use as a way to combat [[censorship]] in literary works, for example in the former [[Communist bloc]].&lt;ref name="Vianu1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lidia Vianu|title=Censorship in Romania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eDddelzL0oC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1998|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-09-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is of course much older; e.g. one find works from the [[middle ages]] criticizing the church establishment. Some of these works use a formal technique called ''double structure'' in which the same text can have different (usually antithetical) meanings by reading sentences or verses in two different orders.&lt;ref name="Shuger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Debora Shuger|title=Censorship and Cultural Sensibility: The Regulation of Language in Tudor-Stuart England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66zotoM7eMsC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2006|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0334-8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metamessage ==
{{see also|meta-communication}}
According to a 2008 [[organizational communication]] textbook, ''meta message'' is a term coined by lawyer [[Gerard Nierenberg]] in his 1995 book ''The Art of Negotiating'' to denote (in the words of the textbook) "those messages that are conveyed between the lines of what we explicitly say or write, possibly due to the purpose, context, or timing of the message and/or the relationship between the people communicating".&lt;ref name="BlundelIppolito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Blundel|author2=Kate Ippolito|title=Effective Organisational Communication: Perspectives, Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jxrepUBc5wC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-71375-3|page=10|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also appears in a 1972 book of [[Gregory Bateson]], who suggested a somewhat similar distinction, although in the form of a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so on.&lt;ref name="Bateson1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Bateson|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HewJbnQmn1gC&amp;pg=PA247|year=1972|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3|pages=247–248 and 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson argued that any message needs to be interpreted in the [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] established by a superordinate message cueing how the textual message is intended.&lt;ref name="Tannen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Deborah Tannen]]|title=Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk among Friends|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988515-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Wolfe]] points out that Bateson's concepts and terminlogy are rather technical, and are thus commonly misinterpreted. In particular, in Bateson's work the metamessage is the framing message, not the actual (subtext) meaning assigned to the subordinate message in the context of the framing message.&lt;ref name="Wolfe1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wolfe|title=Marginalized in the Middle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vdSwzN74qgC&amp;pg=PT204|date=January 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90517-4|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two decades before introducing the metamessage terminology into his works, Bateson studied by what "mood sign[al]" (his earlier term for metamessage) subordinated messages are interpreted "seriously, jokingly, sarcastically, as gestures of friendliness, as acts of aggression" etc. Invoking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Logical Types]], Bateson proposed that for every signal, there is always signal level above it which precisely determines its interpretation. Bateson's theory was however criticized as too rigid and lacking explanatory power for real-world communication phenomena in which signals of any kind (at any level) can be deceitful.&lt;ref name="Jones1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Jones|title=Communication and Meaning: An Essay in Applied Modal Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGYoAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-1543-2|pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metamessages can be delivered by a wide variety of means, including [[verbal modifier]]s (like "certainly", "only", "just", etc.),&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew McKay|author2=Martha Davis|author3=Patrick Fanning|title=Messages: The Communication Skills Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XsPAEpOiUgC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-853-3|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and—in spoken communication—by [[paralanguage]],&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"/&gt; e.g. by [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] and [[Pitch accent|pitch]].&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"/&gt; Metamessages can also be conveyed by [[body language]].&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Lefevre|title=Communicating with Children and Young People: Making a Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNv6zH437C0C&amp;pg=PA46|year=2010|publisher=The Policy Press|isbn=978-1-84742-282-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous pipe image from ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' with the subtitle "ceci n'est pas une pipe" (meaning "this is not a pipe") is sometimes given as an example of metamessage conveyed by paralanguage.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Language, Volume 28, Issues 1-2, J. Benjamins 2004, p. 247, {{doi| 10.1075/sl.28.1.14hai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superlópez''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] comic book character created by [[Jan (comics)|Jan]]. Created in 1973, Superlópez is a parody of [[Superman]].&lt;ref name="LaNuevaEspaña"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lne.es/secciones/cultura/noticia.jsp?pIdNoticia=64304|title=Diario La Nueva España. Interview with Jan.|accessdate=October 15, 2008|last=Amor|first=Pablo|date=July 7, 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003203031/http://www.lne.es/secciones/cultura/noticia.jsp?pIdNoticia=64304|archivedate=3 October 2003}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Born ''Jo-Con-Él'' (translated as ''Damn-with-him'') on the planet ''Chitón'' (Spanish [[slang]] meaning something like ''Shut up!'') much like Superman's home planet of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], he leaves his planet when he enters a spaceship and presses a button, an accident that sends him to Earth.  He was raised by adoptive parents in [[Barcelona]] and concealed himself under the identity of office-worker ''Juan López'' (which is actually author Jan's real name).  He works with his girlfriend, the bad-tempered ''[[Lois Lane|Luisa Lanas]]'', the not-so-pally ''[[Jimmy Olsen|Jaime González Lidenbrock]]''; and his demanding, unnamed [[Perry White|boss]].

This was revealed in the 8-page origin story in the first issue of his magazine. Other stories in the first issue reveal his "Fortress of Solitude", the "Villa Soledad" in the Arctic and have him fighting a rubber robot, the Galactic Gladiator, a sorceress from another dimension, La Incredible Maza (The Incredible Hulk), an atomic monster and a metal robot.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Superlopez.JPG|frame|right|El señor de los chupetes, no. 5]] --&gt;

Other recurring characters include ''Inspector Hólmez'' (a reference to [[Sherlock Holmes]]), an excessively bureaucratic police officer who suspects everyone; ''Martha Hólmez'', the Inspector's daughter, and computer geek ''Chico Humitsec''.

==Recurring villains==
Recurring villains include the evil professor ''Escariano Avieso''; ''Lady Araña'' (“Lady Spider”); the gangster ''Al Trapone'' (a reference to [[Al Capone]]; he is accompanied by goons like ''Carasucia'', ''Caracortada'', ''Carapincho'', gun-wielding ''Pistolet'', etc.); and the mob boss ''Refuller D'Abastos''.

==El Supergrupo (The Supergroup)==
In Issue No. 2 and 3 (“El Supergrupo”), Superlópez served as a member of a group of superheroes, all of which were Jan’s creations.  These included ''El Mago'' (''The Wizard'', a parody of [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]]); ''Capitán Hispania'' (''Captain Spain'', a parody of [[Captain America]]); ''Latas'' (''Tin-guy'', a parody of [[Iron Man]]); ''Bruto'' (''The Brute'', a parody of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]); and ''la Chica Increíble'' (''Incredible Girl'', a parody of the token generic superheroine).&lt;ref&gt;Guiral, Antoni (febrero de 2008). Los tebeos de nuestra infancia: La Escuela Bruguera (1964-1986). Colección Magnum n.º 7 (2a edición). Barcelona: El Jueves ediciones. page 267. {{ISBN|978-84-9741-589-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These spent more time fighting one another over the leadership of the Supergrupo than fighting evil (a parody or reference from the internecine strife that is part of Spain's history). They also made a short appearance in issue 6 where instead of going after the outlawed Superlopez, they argue then fight each other. The Supergroup come back in book 63, where a scientist is altering reality. In book 69, the Supergrupo meet Los Ligiones Justicieros, DC's JLA, featuring parodies of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Aquaman.

Superlópez began his career as a half-page comic strip without text then whole page strips with text where things for López normally ended up badly (reprinted in issue 13, The Genesis of Superlópez), before expanding into full albums which were later put together into annuals holding a number of issues, with adventures involving supervillains and criminal organizations, later evolving into longer, more complex stories concerning social topics affecting contemporary Spain (drug dealing and youth, political issues, pollution and environmental threats, etc.).  Original writer ''Efepé'' (pseudonym of Francisco Pérez Navarro) left the character after the early issues and, from that point on, artist Jan took over the writing as well.

==Other storylines==
Juan travels around the world after stories with Luisa and Jamie and encounters lost races, treasures and so on. He also encountered assorted aliens, monsters, robots, mad scientists, wars, [[Aztec gods]] and even had a trip to [[Hell]]. The stories are full of gags with him burning his large nose whenever he uses heat vision, of him getting a bump on the head when Luisa hits him, of him hurting his fist when he hits a metal robot. As well as bees, odd-looking little yellow creatures feature in the background in some panels and are revealed as [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasms]] in the "Los Petisos Carambanales" story. He even becomes a popstar and meets the ghost of the Prado Museum. Nothing was too way out for the strips as the characters went from one crazy scenario to another.

Often Superlópez not only parodies Superman but also popular literature. This is the case in ''El Señor de los Chupetes'' ("Lord of the Pacifiers", a parody for [[Lord of the Rings]]) or ''Al centro de la Tierra'' (after [[Jules Verne]]'s [[A Journey to the Center of the Earth]])

From the 1990s Superlópez adventures take place in real scenarios that are drawn using a realistic style. Famous buildings and monuments in [[Barcelona]] are often portrayed in detail, as well as those in other cities of [[Catalonia]] ([[Camprodon]]), [[Europe]] ([[Andorra]], [[Grenoble]], [[Bulgaria]]) or [[Japan]]. As an internal joke, Superlópez says once that his adventures are evolving into simple traveling guides.

Superlópez later often had science fiction stories like ''Tú, robot...'' (53) where an intelligent robot is created which then travels the world, unintentionally doing good and bad as it seeks to find out what it means to be human. Confronting the robot in the icy wastes, like in the original Frankenstein story, Superlópez is not sure what humanity is either. In ''El virus Frankenstein'' (56) a virus changes a young boy into a horrible monster while the ''El mundo de al lado'' (57) features a door to another dimension where maybe based on a [[The Little Prince|Little Prince]] story, the people are enslaved into pulling huge wagons around the planet and ''Elecciones en Kaxim'' (58) feature him interfering in [[election]]s on a strange alien world. In book 62, Superlópez goes near a beam giant aliens use to cut planets up and his left arm is cut off at the elbow. It suddenly reattaches itself a few pages later and is normal again.

In book 64, "The Time Thief", Superlópez meets [[Doctor Who]] with his [[Tardis]], the [[Daleks]] and the [[Cybermen]]. In book 66, the "super group" go to the Skroll (Marvel Skrulls) planet and also borrowed some of the story line from Fantastic Four 24 (March 1964). The book deals with hospital overcrowding too.

Later Superlópez books leave the caricaturesque tone of his first adventures to deal with current social issues: [[illegal drug trade]], [[smuggling]], [[tax haven]], [[gunrunning]] in [[Africa]], dictatorships, or [[illegal immigration]] in [[Europe]] are some later themes. Book 69 deals with the illegally built Algarrobico hotel in Almeria, southern Spain. Book 70 deals with Muslim radicalisation of youngsters and extremism, a subject few others dare to touch.

'''''The Suppliants''''' ({{lang-grc|Ἱκέτιδες}}, ''Hiketides''; [[Latin]] ''Supplices''),  also called '''''The Suppliant Maidens''''', or '''''The Suppliant Women''''', first performed in 423 BC, is an ancient Greek play by [[Euripides]].

==Background==

After [[Oedipus]] leaves Thebes, his sons fight for control of it.  [[Polyneices]] lays siege to Thebes against his brother [[Eteocles]].  Polyneices has married the daughter of Adrastus, King of Argos.  And so Polyneices has on his side the Argive army, leaders of which help form the [[Seven Against Thebes]].  The invaders lose the battle, and Polyneices and Eteocles both die.  Creon takes power in Thebes and decrees the invaders are not to be buried.  The mothers of the dead seek someone to help reverse this, so their sons can be buried.

==Story==
[[Aethra (mother of Theseus)|Aethra]], the mother of the Athenian king [[Theseus]], prays before the altar of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]] in [[Eleusis]]. She is surrounded by women from Argos whose sons died in battle outside the gates of Thebes. Because of Creon’s decree, their corpses remain unburied. [[Adrastus]], the king of [[Argos]] who authorized the expedition, lies weeping on the floor surrounded by the sons of the slain warriors. Aethra has sent a messenger to [[Theseus]] asking him to come to Eleusis.

The old women beg Aethra for help, evoking images of their sons’ unburied bodies and appealing to her sympathy as a mother. Theseus arrives. When he asks his mother what is going on, she directs him to Adrastus who begs him to reclaim the bodies. Adrastus explains that he supported the attack on Thebes, against the advice of the seer [[Amphiaraus]], in deference to his sons-in-law, [[Tydeus]] and Polyneices. Theseus observes that he favored courage over discretion. Admitting his mistakes, Adrastus appeals to Theseus as the ruler of the only city with the integrity and the power to stand up to Thebes.

After a bit of reflection on the state of mankind, Theseus resolves not to repeat Adrastus’ mistake. He tells Adrastus to go away and leave him alone. Although Adrastus is ready to concede, the women will not take no for an answer. Appealing to principles of common human decency, they beg Aethra to intervene. She reminds her son that he has a duty to uphold the ancient laws of Hellas and warns him that his refusal might be interpreted as cowardice. Moved by her tears and arguments, Theseus agrees to intervene, but only if the Athenian citizens endorse his decision. Confident that the people will support him, he and his mother set out for home, followed by Adrastus and the sons of the slain warriors, while the suppliant women pray that Theseus will prevail.

Some time later Theseus returns with a retinue. He dispatches his herald to Thebes to request the release of the bodies. If they cooperate, he says, thank them and come back. If they refuse, tell them Theseus will be in arms at their gates with the full backing of the Athenian people. Before the herald can leave, however, a herald from Thebes arrives looking for the local despot. When Theseus tells him that Athens is not ruled by a despot, but by the people, the herald adopts a disparaging tone. His city, he tells Theseus, is ruled by one man, not by an ignorant mob that is easily swayed by specious words. Theseus responds by saying that in a democracy every man can make a contribution if what he says is wise. The herald warns Theseus not to succumb to the patriotic fervor of the populace. “If death were before their eyes when they were giving their votes,” he says, “Hellas would never rush to her doom in mad desire for battle.” &lt;ref&gt;Euripides. ''The Complete Greek Drama'', edited by Whitney J. Oates and Eugene O'Neill, Jr. in two volumes. 1. ''The Suppliants'', translated by E. P. Coleridge. New York. Random House. 1938, line 484.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theseus reminds the herald that he does not take orders from Creon and asserts his right to uphold the ancient customs of Hellas regarding the recovery of the corpses. When the herald warns him against meddling in something that does not concern him, Theseus states his resolve to do what is right and holy. The herald taunts him to bring it on, while Theseus tells his army to prepare for the attack. He will lead the way with a sword in his hand and the gods at his side. The herald leaves for Thebes with Theseus and his men in close pursuit. They pointedly leave Adrastus behind so as not to confuse their current mission with the previous invasion.

As the men depart, the women express their fears of additional violence. They hope a compromise can be reached but offer prayers for victory just in case it cannot.

A messenger — a former servant of [[Capaneus]] who had been captured by the Thebans — arrives to announce the Athenian victory. After describing how Theseus forced the Theban army to retreat into the city, he reports that Theseus restrained his men at the gates, telling them that they had come to rescue the bodies, not to sack the city. This is the kind of leader men should choose, the messenger says, one who shows courage in danger, but does not overreach. His sentiments are echoed by Adrastus who questions why men choose war instead of settling their disputes with reason.

The messenger describes how Theseus himself washed the corpses and prepared them for burial. The women are pleased that the bodies have been recovered, but distressed at the thought of seeing them. It would have been better had they never married, they say.

When Theseus arrives with the corpses, Adrastus engages the women in a loud lament. At Theseus’ suggestion, Adrastus delivers a funeral oration in which he offers the fallen warriors as models for the Athenian youth to emulate. He describes Capaneus, for example, as a paragon of moderation and Eteocles as a man of such high honor that he spurned offers of gold to avoid corrupting his character.

Theseus refuses to allow the women to see the mangled and decaying bodies of their sons, but says that they will receive their ashes. All will be burned in a common pyre except Capaneus who, because he was struck down by Zeus, will have a special tomb.

The women continue their lament (“like some wandering cloud I drift”; “I have nothing left but tears.”) Suddenly, they spot Capaneus’ wife [[Evadne]] in her bridal dress climbing the rocks above her husband’s sepulcher. Recalling her wedding day, she announces her plan to join her husband in the flames of the pyre. Her father [[Iphis]] tries to talk her down, but she leaps to her death eliciting gasps from the onlookers and a cry of woe from her father.

As Iphis leaves, the orphaned youths arrive to hand over the ashes of their fathers to their grandmothers. The boys’ lamentations are laced with promises of vengeance. As he prepares to leave, Theseus reminds the Argives of their debt to Athens — which they gratefully acknowledge. Their gratitude, however, is not enough for [[Athena]]. She suddenly appears above the temple to instruct Theseus to extract a pledge from Adrastus never to invade Athens. After enjoining Theseus to memorialize the pledge at the temple of Apollo, she tells the young men that they will grow up to avenge the death of their fathers by sacking Thebes. Adrastus and the women depart, grateful for the assistance they have received from Theseus.

The same story had been mentioned years earlier in book 9.27 of ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The History]]'' by [[Herodotus]], in which the Athenians claimed the event as an example of their history of bravery.

==Unburied dead==
In ancient Greek literature, funeral rites are highly important to the citizenry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' contains scenes of fighters in violent conflict over the treatment of corpses, such as that of [[Patroclus]].  People are often willing to fight and risk dying to obtain the bodies of the dead. ''The Suppliants'' takes this characteristic even further, showing a whole city willing to wage war in order to retrieve the bodies of strangers. The theme of forbidding dead bodies from burial occurs many times throughout ancient Greek literature.  Examples include the body of [[Hector]] as portrayed in the ''Iliad'', the body of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]] as portrayed in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'', and the children of [[Niobe]].  For what happens to the body of [[Polyneices]], see Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.

'''''Thunderstruck''''' is a 2012 [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[John Whitesell]] and starring [[Taylor Gray]], along with professional [[basketball]] player [[Kevin Durant]], [[Brandon T. Jackson]], [[Doc Shaw]] and [[Jim Belushi]]. It was released on August 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="DurantPremieres" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Release" /&gt;

==Plot==
Brian is a 16-year-old living in [[Oklahoma]]. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, resigned to being [[water boy]] for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a [[Oklahoma City Thunder|Thunder]] game against the [[Detroit Pistons]] at [[Chesapeake Energy Arena]] in [[Oklahoma City]].

At halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits [[Rumble the Bison|Rumble, the mascot]] in the process. Later on, he meets [[Kevin Durant]] and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder [[basketball (ball)|basketball]] that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.

The next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to "do better", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.

After making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.

Shortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

At the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.

'''Travel insurance''' is [[insurance]] that is intended to cover [[medical]] expenses, trip cancellation, [[lost luggage]], flight accident and other losses incurred while [[travel]]ing, 

Travel insurance can usually be arranged at the time of the booking of a trip to cover exactly the duration of that trip, or a "multi-trip" policy can cover an unlimited number of trips within a set time frame. Some policies offer lower and higher medical-expense options; the higher ones are chiefly for countries that have high medical costs, such as the United States.

Some credit card issuers offer automatic travel insurance if travel arrangements are paid for using their credit cards, but these policies are generic and particular care must be taken to take into account personal requirements. There are many travel insurance policies available in the market place, but care must be taken of what events are covered by each policy, and what exclusions, exceptions and limits apply, besides other issues.

==Coverage types==

The most common risks that are covered by travel insurance plans are:

* [[Medical]] treatment, including transportation to the medical facility.
* Cancellation, curtailment and trip interruption
:This section covers any unused travel and or accommodation costs, pre-paid charges (including any additional travel expenses incurred, provided they are deemed reasonable and necessary) if a trip is canceled or cut short under a variety of circumstances, which may include any of the following, depending on the policy:
:* death, bodily injury, illness, disease, or pregnancy complications
:* compulsory quarantine
:* jury service
:* being called as a witness
:* termination of employment (provided you did not know about it before you booked the holiday)
:* being called up if you are a member of the armed forces or other public defense or safety organization
:* prohibition of travel by the government to the intended destination
:* officially recommended evacuation from the intended destination
:* official advisory against going to or remaining at the intended destination
:* death or serious illness of a family member (subject to age restrictions).
* [[Repatriation]] of remains
* Return of a minor
* Trip cancellation
* Trip interruption
* [[Visitor health insurance]]
* [[Accidental death]], [[injury]] or [[disablement]] benefit
* Overseas funeral expenses
* Lost, stolen or damaged baggage, personal effects or travel documents
* Delayed baggage (and emergency replacement of essential items)
* Flight connection was missed due to airline rescheduling or delay.
* Travel delays due to weather
* Hijacking

Medical expense coverage can be per-occurrence or maximum-limit.

==Optional coverage==
Some travel policies will also provide cover for additional costs, although these vary widely between providers. Almost $2 billion in travel insurance is sold each year.

In addition, often separate insurance can be purchased for specific costs such as:
* [[Pre-existing condition]]s (e.g. [[asthma]], [[diabetes]])
* Sports with an element of risk (e.g. [[skiing]], mountain climbing, [[scuba diving]])
* Travel to high risk countries (e.g. due to [[war]], [[natural disaster]]s or [[terrorism|acts of terrorism]])
* Additional [[Accidental death and dismemberment insurance|AD&amp;D]] coverage
* Rental Car Coverage
* Cancel for Any Reason Coverage 
* 3rd party supplier insolvency (e.g. the [[hotel]] or [[airline]] to which you made non-refundable pre-payments has gone into [[Administration (law)|administration]])
* Acute onset of pre-existing conditions
* Specific event coverage, (e.g., to cover travel cancellation costs if the reason the person is travelling, such as a concert, is cancelled. )

==Required coverage==
Certain countries will require that you have purchased sufficient coverage should something happen while you are traveling to that country. Those governments do not want to be burdened with the costs of your medical care and will require you to have a suitable plan meeting certain minimum requirements. 
* Students traveling to the USA are required to have a qualified plan during their period of study
* Depending on the length of stay, travelers to countries in the Schengen area are required to prove they have sufficient insurance at the time of their visa application 
* Health insurance is mandatory for visitors to enter the UAE (Dubai, Abu Dhabi etc) and require a visit or tourist visa&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finder.com.au/travel-insurance-compulsory|title=Is Travel Insurance Compulsory? - finder.com.au|first=Maurice|last=Thach|date=5 November 2015|website=finder.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies running group tours often require insurance&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;, as do many cruise companies.
* Generally, most countries where you are applying for a visa are likely to also require a minimum level of travel insurance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Common exclusions==
The common exclusions in travel insurance policies include [[pre-existing medical condition]]s, unlicensed operation of a vehicle,  travelling for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, [[elective surgery]] or treatment, or injury or illness caused by alcohol, drug use, or reckless behavior, including engaging in some sporting activities. Events arising from war and terrorism are usually excluded, but most policies allow trip cancellation arising from war or an act of terrorism that meets the policy's criteria.

Insurance companies issuing new policies will often exclude circumstances based on an ongoing event, such as [[Typhoon|typhoons]] or floods. Long-term exclusions may be announced for events such a [[Bali]]’s Mt Agung volcano being excluded from cover for the foreseeable future, (as of late 2017). 

Some policies exclude travel to certain countries, or parts of countries, where a greater risk is expected. These determinations are often made based on official government travel advice from organisations such as the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] or the Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs]]. 

Travel insurance can also provide helpful services, often 24 hours a day, 7 days a week that can include [[concierge service]]s and emergency travel assistance. Pre-existing medical conditions must be declared prior to the trip start date. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles to treatment in state-run hospitals in EU countries and Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
