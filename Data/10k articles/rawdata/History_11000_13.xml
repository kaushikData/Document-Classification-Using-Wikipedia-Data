      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3859">{{about|the 10th-century Arabic Christian historian||Agapius (disambiguation)}}

'''Mahbūb ibn-Qūṣṭānṭīn''' (anglicised as '''Agapius son of Constantine''') (d.941-2 AD) was a 10th-century Arabic Christian writer and historian, best known for his lengthy ''Kitab al-'Unwan'' (''Book of headings'' or ''History''). He was the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite]] bishop of [[Manbij]] (Mabbug, Hierapolis Bambyce), in Syria.

==Life==

He was a contemporary of the annalist [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]] (=Said al-Bitriq), also a Melchite. His history commences with the foundation of the world and runs up to his own times. The portion dealing with the Arabic period is extant only in a single [[manuscript]] and breaks off in the second year of the Caliphate of [[al-Mahdi]] (160AH = 776-7 AD) and during the time when Emperor was  [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] (775-780).

For the early history of Christianity, Agapius made use uncritically of apocryphal and legendary materials. For the following secular and ecclesiastical history, he relied on Syriac sources, in particular the World Chronicle of the [[Maronite]] historian [[Theophilus of Edessa]] (d. 785) for the end of the [[Ummayad]] period and the beginning of the [[Abbasids]]. He made use of [[Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' only through an intermediary compilation of short extracts. This he supplements from other sources. He gives an otherwise unknown fragment of [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]]; and a list of Eastern Metropolitans. He uses the lost History of [[Bardaisan]], but many of his sources remain unknown.

The ''History'' has been published with a French translation in the [[Patrologia Orientalis]] series and with a Latin translation in the [[Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium]] series.

== Testimonium Flavianum ==

His history contains an interesting version of the [[Josephus on Jesus|Testimonium Flavianum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2375">The '''Annalista Saxo''' ('''"Saxon annalist"''') is the anonymous author of an important [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] chronicle, believed to have originated in the mid [[12th century]] at [[Nienburg Abbey]] in the [[Duchy of Saxony]].

== General ==
The chronicle of the "Annalista Saxo" is a collection of dates and facts about the medieval German monarchs ([[King of the Romans|Kings of the Romans]]) and their [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] predecessors, beginning in the year 741 and continued until 1142.

The [[codex]] was created between 1148 and 1152. The anonymous author had more than 100 sources at his disposal, including some which no longer exist. The entries are arranged chronologically by year. 

The identity of the chronicler, sometimes identified with Abbot Arnold of Nienburg (d. 1166), has not been conclusively established.&lt;ref&gt;Nass 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The volume contains 237 [[parchment]] pages. The binding is from the 16th century. The book was restored in 1993. The cover is of brown cow's leather, the spine of [[vellum]], and the content includes 16 ornamental initials. 

The original of the "Annalista Saxo" is today in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in [[Paris]]. It is very fragile and is kept securely; a [[facsimile]] is on display. It is unknown how the volume came to be in France.

== Journalism and literary career ==
From 1988, Applebaum wrote about the collapse of communism from Warsaw. Working for&amp;nbsp;''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]'', she provided front-page and cover stories of important social and political transitions in Central and Eastern Europe, both before and after the&amp;nbsp;[[Fall of the Berlin Wall]]&amp;nbsp;in 1989. In 1994 she published her first book,&amp;nbsp;''Between East and West'', a travelogue describing the rise of nationalism in the Western republics of the Soviet Union. The book was awarded an Adolph Bentinck Prize in 1996.

Applebaum worked briefly as the Africa editor of ''[[The Economist]]'' in 1992. In 1993, she left the paper and became the foreign editor and then the deputy editor at&amp;nbsp;''[[The Spectator]]'' where she wrote about British and international politics, writing cover stories from Brussels, Moscow, Washington and Milan as well as London. She also wrote regular columns for both&amp;nbsp;''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[The Sunday Telegraph|''Sunday Telegraph'']] in London. In 1996 and 1997 Applebaum wrote exclusively about Britain, and in particular the victory of Tony Blair’s Labour Party, as the political columnist for London's&amp;nbsp;''[[Evening Standard]]''&amp;nbsp;newspaper.

Applebaum returned to Poland in 1998, where she continued to write for the ''Sunday Telegraph'' and other newspapers. In 2001 she did a major interview with prime minister Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4722273/I-am-still-normal.html|title=Telegraph|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began doing historical research for her book ''[[Gulag: A History]]'' (2003), on the Soviet concentration camp system, which won the 2004&amp;nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]].&lt;ref name="Idaho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.mtexpress.com/index2.php?ID=2005102224&amp;var_Year=2004&amp;var_Month=11&amp;var_Day=17#.Wyupial9jUI|title=From concentration camps to cotton|date=March 25, 2005|publisher=Express publishing inc.|work=Idaho Mountain express and guide.|accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/arts/05pulitzers-arts.html|title='The Known World' Wins Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|date=April 5, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2004-General-Nonfiction|title=The 2004 Pulitzer Prize Winners General Nonfiction|accessdate=2009-10-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002161041/http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2004-General-Nonfiction|archivedate=October 2, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also nominated for a National Book Award, for the LA Times book award and for the National Book Critics Circle Award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.randomhouseacademic.com/search?q=Gulag%3A+A+History Award Winning Books], [[Random House]] website&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually translated into more than 25 languages.

From 2001 to 2005, Applebaum lived in Washington where she was a member of ''The Washington Post'' editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/anne-applebaum/|title=Anne Applebaum|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote about a wide range of US policy issues, including healthcare, social security and education. [links] She also began writing a column for ''The Washington Post'', which continues to the present.

Her second history book,&amp;nbsp;''Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944–56'', was published in 2012 by Doubleday in the USA and Allen Lane in the UK; it was nominated for a National Book Award, shortlisted for the 2013&amp;nbsp;[[PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pen.org/literature/2013-penjohn-kenneth-galbraith-award|title=2013 PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award - PEN America|date=|website=Pen.org|author=|accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the Cundill Prize for Historical Literature as well as the Duke of Westminster Medal.

From 2011 to 2016, she created and ran the Transitions Forum&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;Legatum Institute, an international think tank and educational charity based in London. Among other projects, she ran a two-year program examining the relationship between democracy and growth in Brazil, India and South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.li.com/programmes/democracy-works|title=Democracy Works|website=www.li.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the Future of Syria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/preparing-for-a-syrian-transition_ghani_lockhart_november-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Blob|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Future of Iran projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.li.com/programmes/the-future-of-iran|title=The Future of Iran|website=www.li.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418081945/http://www.li.com/programmes/the-future-of-iran|archivedate=April 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; on future institutional change in those two countries; commissioned a series of papers on corruption in Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/georgia_transitions_a4_2014web.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Blob|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moldova&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/moldova-the-failing-champion-of-european-integration-a4.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Blob|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lif.blob.core.windows.net/lif/docs/default-source/publications/ukraine_imr_a4_web.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Blob|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Foreign Policy magazine she created Democracy Lab, a website which focused on countries in transition to, or away from, democracy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.li.com/programmes/democracy-lab|title=Democracy Lab|website=www.li.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which has since become Democracy Post&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/|title=DemocracyPost|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at ''The Washington Post''.

Started in 2014, the program anticipated later debates about “fake news.”

At the end of 2016, she left Legatum because of its stance on Brexit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/londoners-diary-loves-legatum-lost-in-battle-over-brexit-a3415381.html|title=Londoner's Diary: Love's Legatum Lost in battle over Brexit|date=2016-12-08|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the London School of Economics as a Professor of Practice at the Institute for Global Affairs. At the LSE she runs Arena, a program on disinformation and 21st&amp;nbsp;century propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/IGA/People/pip.aspx|title=Professors in Practice - People - Institute of Global Affairs - Home|website=www.lse.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Crimean crisis===
On February 21, 2014, Applebaum wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', documenting the breakdown in law and order in [[Ukraine]] over the previous fortnight. She concluded that it "is not a war, or even a conflict which either side can win with weapons. It will have to be solved through negotiations, elections, political debate; by civic organisations, political parties and political leaders, both charismatic and otherwise; with the participation of other European states and Ukraine's other neighbors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10653932/The-pictures-from-Kiev-dont-tell-the-whole-story.html |title=The pictures from Kiev don't tell the whole story |date=February 21, 2014 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applebaum has been a vocal critic of Western conduct regarding the [[2014 Crimean crisis]]. In an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on March 5, she maintained that the US and its allies should not continue to enable "the existence of a corrupt Russian regime that is destabilizing Europe," noting that the actions of Putin had violated "a series of international treaties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anne-applebaum-russias-western-enablers/2014/03/05/bcba2a88-a4a6-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html |title=Russia's Western enablers |date=March 5, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, in another ''Telegraph'' article, discussing an [[information war]], Applebaum argued that "a robust campaign to tell the truth about Crimea is needed to counter Moscow's lies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10683298/Russias-information-warriors-are-on-the-march-we-must-respond.html |title=Russia’s information warriors are on the march – we must respond |date=March 7, 2014 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August she asked whether Ukraine should prepare for "total war" with Russia and whether central Europeans should join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Applebaum |first=Anne |date=August 29, 2014 |title=War in Europe |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/08/vladimir_putin_s_troops_have_invaded_ukraine_should_we_prepare_for_war_with.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=September 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BLP primary sources|section|date=August 2017}}

=== Populism ===
In March 2016, six months before the election of President Trump, she wrote a column asking, “Is this the end of the West as we know it?” which argued that “we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html|title=Is this the end of the West as we know it?|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2016-03-04|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-03|last2=Applebaum|first2=Anne|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered unduly gloomy at the time, the column inspired the Swiss magazine ''Tagesanzeiger ''and the German magazine ''Der Spiegel'' to interview Applebaum in December 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ausland/amerika/es-liegt-etwas-aehnliches-in-der-luft-wie-in-den-1930erjahren/story/27519272|title="Ähnlich wie in den 1930er-Jahren"|last=Loser|first=Mit Anne Applebaum sprachen Alan Cassidy und Philipp|date=2016-12-27|work=Tages-Anzeiger, Tages-Anzeiger|access-date=2017-04-03|language=de|issn=1422-9994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/anne-applebaum-interview-about-president-donald-trump-a-1130988.html|title=Historian Anne Applebaum on Trump: 'Protest Is Insufficient' - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|last=Germany|first=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg|website=SPIEGEL ONLINE|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2017. She argued very early on that the movement had an international dimension, that populist groups in Europe share “ideas and ideology, friends and founders,” and that, unlike Burkean conservatives, they seek to “overthrow the institutions of the present to bring back things that existed in the past—or that they believe existed in the past—by force.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-is-a-threat-to-the-west-as-we-know-it-even-if-he-loses/2016/11/04/a8dc9100-a2cc-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html|title=Trump is a threat to the West as we know it, even if he loses|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2016-11-04|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-03|last2=Applebaum|first2=Anne|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Applebaum has been writing about Russia since the early 1990s. In 2000, she described the links between the then-new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, with the former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and the old KGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/secret-agent-man/article/12293|title=Secret Agent Man|date=2000-04-10|work=Weekly Standard|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 she began speaking about “Putinism” as an anti-democratic ideology, though most at the time still considered the Russian president to be a pro-Western pragmatist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanacademy.de/home/program/past/putinism-ideology|title=American Academy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applebaum has also focused on Russia’s failure to come to terms with the legacy of the USSR and of Stalin, both in her Gulag book and in other writing and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/website-archive/publicEvents/events/2012/11/20121120t1830vOT.aspx|title=The Gulag: what we know now and why it matters|last=editor|first=Events web|website=www.lse.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she asked whether “the most important story of the past twenty years might not, in fact, have been the failure of democracy, but the rise of a new form of Russian authoritarianism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/12/18/how-he-and-his-cronies-stole-russia/|title=How He and His Cronies Stole Russia|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|website=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described the “myth of Russian humiliation” and argued that Nato and EU expansion have been a “phenomenal success.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anne-applebaum-nato-pays-a-heavy-price-for-giving-russia-too-much-credita-true-achievement-under-threat/2014/10/17/5b3a6f2a-5617-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html|title=The myth of Russian humiliation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2014-10-17|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-03|last2=Applebaum|first2=Anne|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, before the US election, she was one of the first American journalists to write about the significance of Russia’s ties to Donald Trump&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-a-trump-presidency-could-destabilize-europe/2016/07/21/9ec38a20-4f75-11e6-a422-83ab49ed5e6a_story.html|title=How a Trump presidency could destabilize Europe|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2016-07-21|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-03|last2=Applebaum|first2=Anne|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to point out that Russian support for Trump is part of a wider Russian political campaign, designed to destabilize the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-danger-of-russian-disinformation/2016/05/06/b31d9718-12d5-11e6-8967-7ac733c56f12_story.html|title=The danger of Russian disinformation|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2016-05-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-03|last2=Lucas|first2=Edward|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Applebaum|first3=Anne|last4=Lucas|first4=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written that a summer spent as a student in Leningrad in 1985 has helped shape her views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/russia-great-forgetting/|title=Russia and the Great Forgetting - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Europe ===
Applebaum has written extensively about the history of central and eastern Europe, Poland in particular. In the conclusion to her book Iron Curtain, Applebaum argued that the reconstruction of civil society was the most important and most difficult challenge for the post-communist states of central Europe; in another essay, she argued that the modern authoritarian obsession with civil society repression dates back to Lenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|date=2015-10-19|title=The Leninist Roots of Civil Society Repression|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/595919|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=26|issue=4|pages=21–27|doi=10.1353/jod.2015.0068|issn=1086-3214}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, she has written essays on the Polish film-maker Andrzej Wajda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/02/14/a-movie-that-matters/|title=A Movie That Matters|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|website=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the dual Nazi-Soviet occupation of central Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/11/11/worst-madness/|title=The Worst of the Madness|last=Applebaum|first=Anne|website=The New York Review of Books|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on why it is inaccurate to define “Eastern Europe” as a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/does-eastern-europe-still-exist|title=Does Eastern Europe still exist?  {{!}}  Prospect Magazine|website=www.prospectmagazine.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disinformation, propaganda and fake news ===
In 2014, Applebaum and Peter Pomerantzev launched Beyond Propaganda, a program examining disinformation and propaganda, at the Legatum Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.li.com/programmes/beyond-propaganda|title=Beyond Propaganda|website=www.li.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, they expanded the program, renamed it Arena, moved it to the LSE and began piloting solutions to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/IGA/People/pip.aspx|title=Professors in Practice - People - Institute of Global Affairs - Home|website=www.lse.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applebaum has written that a 2014 Russian smear campaign, aimed at her, first taught her the techniques of modern Russian propaganda. That campaign was promoted by Wikileaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/i-was-a-victim-of-a-russian-smear-campaign-i-understand-the-power-of-fake-news/2016/12/20/0dfdc2aa-c606-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html|title=I was a victim of a Russian smear campaign.

'''Barbu Lăzăreanu''' (born '''Avram Lazarovici''',&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Valentin Chifor, "Lăzăreanu Barbu", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. I, pp. 839–840. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004. {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Barbou Lazareano'''&lt;ref name="pp818"&gt;[[Pompiliu Păltânea]], "Lettres roumaines", in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 627, August 1924, p. 818&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Barbu Lăzărescu''';&lt;ref name="strj390, 391"&gt;Straje, pp. 390, 391&lt;/ref&gt; October 5, 1881 – January 19, 1957) was a Romanian literary historian, bibliographer, and left-wing activist. Of [[Romanian Jews|Romanian Jewish]] background, he became noted for both his social criticism and his lyrical pieces while still in high school. His socialist-and-anarchist advocacy made him a target of the conservative establishment, which expelled him from the country in 1907. Lăzăreanu spent five years studying in France, then returned to Romania as a publicist, columnist, and workers' educator. He earned the reputation of a highly focused literary researcher and biographer, noted as the editor of works by [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].

By 1933, Lăzăreanu was a public critic of fascism, a fact which contributed to his persecution by the antisemitic far-right in the 1940s. Having narrowly escaped a deportation to [[Transnistria Governorate|Transnistria]] and a likely death in 1942, he returned to public life after the [[King Michael's Coup|1944 Coup]] and subsequent democratization. He rose to prominence post-1948, under the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], first as a rector of [[Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy]], then as a member of the [[Romanian Academy]] and its Presidium. Lăzăreanu spent his final decade as a decorated and lionized writer and political forerunner of the regime.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The future author, primarily known in his early years as "Bubi" Lazarovici,&lt;ref name="lfer857"&gt;[[Leon Feraru]], "The Mendacity of Roumania. How the Government Persecutes Its Jewish Men of Letters", ''The Reform Advocate'', Vol. XLVII, Issue 23, July 1914, p. 857&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Botoșani]] as the son of Herschel Lazarovici.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; As later noted by [[Traian Săvulescu]], his first home was the southern, poorer part of town, where Avram grew up "revolted by injustice and with a burning desire to rectify it."&lt;ref name="ts22"&gt;Săvulescu, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He attended primary school and [[A. T. Laurian National College|A. T. Laurian High School]] in his native town,&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; while becoming acquainted with [[Marxism]] through his perusing of ''[[Contemporanul]]'' review and, as noted by his official obituary of 1957, making a name for himself as a "propagandist of such ideas."&lt;ref name="acadbl247"&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; His first contribution to the [[Labor movement in Romania|Romanian labor movement]] was taking part in a bakers' strike at Botoșani,&lt;ref name="ts22"/&gt; and, in early 1899, the Laurian High School expelled him for his socialist agitation.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bejenaru, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazarovici debuted as a poet in his own magazine, ''Victor Hugo'',&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; where he also printed a manifesto in verse against [[aestheticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; His first work in satirical prose was hosted by [[George Ranetti]]'s paper, ''Zeflemeaua'',&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, p. 23; Straje, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipumbra"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui "Nimeni nu poate sări peste umbra epocii lui"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804111228/http://www.romlit.ro/nimeni_nu_poate_sri_peste_umbra_epocii_lui |date=2012-08-04 }}, ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2009&lt;/ref&gt; after which he became a regular contributor to the left-wing review ''[[România Muncitoare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247; Săvulescu, pp. 23, 24&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Victor Hugo'', he persisted in trying to establish a lasting newspaper of his own, putting out ''Gândul'' ("The Thought", 1902), then ''Inima și Mintea'' ("Heart and Mind", 1903).&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Maximiuc, "Posibile și necesare corective și completări la o (posibilă) istorie a presei locale", ''Hierasus'', Vol. X, 1997, pp. 226–227&lt;/ref&gt; By 1905, he was in [[Bucharest]], co-opted by [[Constantin Mille]] to write for ''[[Adevărul]]'', with a series of rhyming columns that he signed as "Trubadur".&lt;ref name="ts23"&gt;Săvulescu, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

With his Romanian-sounding adoptive surname, Lăzăreanu had poems hosted in [[A. D. Xenopol]]'s ''Arhiva'' of [[Iași]].&lt;ref&gt;Feraru, p. 857; Săvulescu, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Contemplative and rustic, such pieces brought him to the attention of [[A. C. Cuza]], a traditionalist and antisemitic poet-doctrinaire, who was unaware of Lăzăreanu's Jewishness. Cuza traveled to Botoșani just to greet the "national troubadour", only to be informed that "it is the Jew's Lazarovici's boy [...] who is as shriveled as a raisin, and who looks at the moon like a somnambulist".&lt;ref name="lfer857"/&gt; His other poetry included stanzas honoring those killed in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], published in ''Viitorul Social'' of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Haupt &amp; Slivăț, p. 37; Săvulescu, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Participating in socialist shows of solidarity with the Russian workers,&lt;ref&gt;Haupt &amp; Slivăț, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; he was by then drawn into [[Anarchism in Romania|anarchist circles]], and for a while co-publisher of [[Panait Mușoiu]]'s newspaper, ''Revista Ideei''.&lt;ref&gt;"Matin Veith: Panait Musoiu. ''Zu Leben und Publizistik des rumänischen Anarchisten''", ''Syfo – Forschung &amp; Bewegung'', Abstracts No. 2, 2002, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As an ally of Mușoiu's, by 1907 he was tutoring Bucharest workers, giving them lessons in Romanian grammar and literature, and also "educating them politically".&lt;ref name="ts23"/&gt;

[[File:NSPetrescuGaina - Conversatie cu dublu inteles.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Țivil-Cazon'', Issue 5, 1906. Cover art by [[Nicolae Petrescu Găină]]]]
In 1906, he founded the satirical weekly ''Țivil-Cazon'' ("Civilian-Conscript"),&lt;ref name="spod159"/&gt; for which he used the pseudonym "Bélé".&lt;ref name="strj390, 391"/&gt; The magazine hosted the work of [[Ioachim Botez]], Ioan Dragomirescu-Dragion, Leon Wechsler-Vero, and [[Victor Eftimiu]],&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 89, 233, 248–249, 420, 773&lt;/ref&gt; who was also a pseudonymous co-editor. Eftimiu and Lăzăreanu's work for it included rhyming quatrains that parodied or mocked the more serious literary reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, pp. 127–131&lt;/ref&gt; Eftimiu noted, years later, that Bélé was "very talented".&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; ''Țivil-Cazon'' became the first Romanian journal of its kind to feature colored prints, and included artwork by [[Iosif Iser]], [[Nicolae Petrescu Găină]], and [[Nicolae Mantu]]. Heavily inspired by [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and his ''[[Moftul Român]]'', it mainly targeted [[Romanian Army]] personnel, depicted as slow-witted and (especially if cavalry officers) as sex objects.&lt;ref&gt;Horia Vladimir Șerbănescu, "Caricatura militară în presa umoristică românească, de la Unire până la Războiul cel Mare (1859–1916)", ''Studii și Cercetări de Istoria Artei. Artă Plastică'', Vol. 3 (47), 2013, pp. 34–40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and return===
Lăzăreanu was eventually deported from the country shortly after the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt|1907 peasants' revolt]].&lt;ref name="lfer857"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pdk7"&gt;Paul de Coks, "Expulzarea unui trubadur", ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', Nr. 139/1907, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247; Petrescu, p. 201; Săvulescu, pp. 22, 23–24; Tănăsescu &amp; Ștefan, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to a detailed account of this incident, published in ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Dimitrie Sturdza]] had read Lăzăreanu's work in ''Zeflemeaua'', and had decided to punish his insolence.&lt;ref name="pdk7"/&gt; Săvulescu has it that Lăzăreanu "had merely helped the peasants" of [[Gorbănești]] petition [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], and that this was read as "anarchist propaganda against throne and religion".&lt;ref name="ts22"/&gt; Lăzăreanu was allegedly arrested at [[Colentina Hospital]],&lt;ref name="pdk7"/&gt; having suffered a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="lfer857"/&gt; The expulsion was facilitated by Lăzăreanu's Jewish ethnicity: under the still-restrictive laws of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]], he was classified as ''[[Statelessness|heimatlos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. "La Réaction en Roumanie", ''[[L'Humanité]]'', May 23, 1928, p. 2; Petrescu, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1907 to 1912, he lived in France, where he was admitted by examination to the Paris-based [[École des Hautes Études]]. There, he took courses with [[Sylvain Lévi]] and [[Charles Diehl]], and between 1908 and 1909 was a classmate of the future historian [[Orest Tafrali]].&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; He was published in the French socialist press,&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt; as well as, back home, in [[Christian Rakovski]]'s ''Viitorul Social''&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247; Săvulescu, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Barbu Nemțeanu]]'s ''Pagini Libere''.&lt;ref name="spod159"&gt;Podoleanu, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lăzăreanu helped establish a socialist association of Romanian guest workers,&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, p. 24; Tănăsescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; and, with fellow Botoșani exile [[Deodat Țăranu]], joined the Romanian socialist students' society in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Bejenaru, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 1908 (Romania's royal holiday), he and the worker Radu Florescu directed an intentional protest against King Carol, later hosting and giving exposure to their fellow socialist exile, Rakovsky.&lt;ref&gt;Tănăsescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 1910, Lăzăreanu stood on the "revolutionary jury" which "tried" the Romanian anarchist [[Adolf Reichmann]], suspected of being an ''[[agent provocateur]]''. He deemed Reichmann not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;"Dernière heure. Tribunal Révolutionnaire. Le Roumain Reichmann a été jugé la nuit dernière par les anarchistes réunis à Paris", ''[[Le Journal (Paris)|Le Journal]]'', May 29, 1910, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Lăzăreanu, sometimes passing himself off as "Matei Rareș", "Trubadurul", or "Alexandru B. Trudă",&lt;ref name="strj391"&gt;Straje, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; was an editor at the magazines ''Înfrățirea'', ''Viitorul Social'', ''Lupta Zilnică'', and ''Adevărul Literar''. He was still a contributor to the left-wing dailies ''Adevărul'' and ''[[Dimineața]]'',&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; and eventually also their cultural editor.&lt;ref name="spod159"/&gt; In 1915, using the pen name "Arald", he was featured in the pages of ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="strj390, 391"/&gt; Shortly before World War I, he was again involved in the Romanian labor movement. With [[I. C. Frimu]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910–18)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR), he established a "workers' university" in Bucharest, where he then taught literature and the [[history of socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, p. 25. See also "Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; His first book of literary portraits appeared in 1917, as ''Constantin Radovici, Agatha Bârsescu, Nora Marinescu''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spod160"&gt;Podoleanu, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his growing reputation, Lăzăreanu, like other Jewish professionals, was barred from joining the [[Romanian Writers' Society]] (SSR).&lt;ref name="lfer857"/&gt;

Lăzăreanu, noted for a while as a publisher of [[anti-war]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pompiliu Păltânea]], "Lettres roumaines", in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 576, June 1922, p. 803&lt;/ref&gt; remained in [[Romania during World War I|German-occupied Bucharest]] after 1916. He was a member of the underground PSDR and guest speaker at its defiant [[International Workers' Day|Labor Day]] picnic (May 1, 1917),&lt;ref&gt;Ion Toacă, "Locuri și case memoriale care evidențiază rezistența maselor populare românești împotriva regimului de ocupație (decembrie 1916 – noiembrie 1918)", ''Revista de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1977, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly became a [[Leninism|Leninist]] shortly after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, writing for ''Scena'' review, usually as "Alex. Bucur" or "Mathieu H. Rareșiu",&lt;ref&gt;Straje, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; he met and befriended writer [[I. Peltz]], who recalled that his "little essays" on literature, "of greatest interest to the reading public", took up most of Lăzăreanu's time, preventing him from publishing his poetry. Peltz also recalls Lăzăreanu's satire of "the oligarchy", noting him as an "elegant polemicist" of "fine humor".&lt;ref&gt;Peltz, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; His tireless glossing of texts earned accolades from [[Perpessicius]], who described Lăzăreanu as "all-knowing" and "without rival".&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; A posthumous reviewer, Marin Bucur, was unimpressed. He describes Lăzăreanu as a scholar who missed out on "the general layout", focused on documenting "infinitesimal" aspects of history, including "trifles" and "bromides".&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cu privire la...'' period===
Following the war and the creation of [[Greater Romania]], Lăzăreanu maintained a profile in the labor and socialist movements. A speaker at the funeral of Marxist doyen [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]],&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu ''et al.'', p. 602; Petrescu, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; he was closely followed by agents of the ''[[Siguranța]]'', who noted his association with labor organizer [[Herșcu Aroneanu]], "a very dangerous element".&lt;ref&gt;Leon Eșanu, "Doctor H. Aroneanu și mișcarea muncitorească din Bacău în anii 1918—1920", ''Carpica. Publicația Muzeului de Istorie și Artă Bacău'', Vol. VI, 1973–1974, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the postwar [[Socialist Party of Romania|Socialist Party]], he returned to his native region during the 1919 paper mill workers' strike, which Aroneanu assisted, and again during the 1920 commemoration of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leon Eșanu, "Activitatea secțiunilor din Moldova ale Partidului Socialist în anii premergători înființării P.C.R." and Elisabeta Ioniță, Gheorghe Grivețeanu, "Casa în care a fost votată constituirea Partidului Comunist Român", ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. II, 1971, pp. 271, 376&lt;/ref&gt; Lăzăreanu also became editor of the Socialist Party organ, ''[[Socialismul]]'',&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt; putting out its cultural pages.&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt; He still contributed biographies of socialist leaders as the newspaper became official organ of the new [[Romanian Communist Party]] (May 1921), before the both the party and newspaper were outlawed.&lt;ref name="ts25–6"&gt;Săvulescu, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; He also had contributions as a poet and scholar in the magazines ''Progresele Științei'' and ''Presa Dentară''.&lt;ref name="spod159"/&gt; His other work appeared in ''[[Flacăra]]'', ''[[Viața Românească]]'', ''[[Vremea]]'', ''[[Contimporanul]]'', ''[[Revista Literară]]'', ''[[Mântuirea]]'', ''Adam'', ''Luptătorul'', ''Curierul'', and ''Revista Idealistă''.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, pp. 159–160; Straje, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1930, Lăzăreanu resumed his work in popular education, reestablishing the workers' university, joining the [[Căile Ferate Române]] unions' school in [[Grivița]],&lt;ref name="ts25–6"/&gt; and becoming staff member for the [[Union of Romanian Jews]] People's University.&lt;ref name="spod159"/&gt; Although he worked in political and trade-union journalism, as well as a philologist and bibliographer, he was primarily a commentator on Romanian literature. Writing about numerous authors who included Caragiale, [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Gheorghe Asachi]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]], [[Anton Pann]], and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], his book titles for the early 1920s usually began ''Cu privire la...'' ("With a Look at...").&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 247; Bucur, p. 250; Săvulescu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Lăzăreanu annotated, prefaced and edited Caragiale's satiric verses, grouped into poetic cycles.&lt;ref name="ipumbra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, pp. 159, 160&lt;/ref&gt; The work was poorly reviewed by his colleagues in the literary press, who noted that Caragiale himself had made efforts to erase all memory of his work in verse. Lăzăreanu defended himself with chronicles in ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]'', arguing that the Caragiale poems had documentary and, "sometimes", artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;Pușcariu, pp. 1033–1035&lt;/ref&gt; Some 12 years after, Lăzăreanu received public thanks from [[Paul Zarifopol]], Caragiale's friend and biographer: "neither the richness and exactitude of his knowledge, nor the kindness with which he imparts it, have an end."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Feraru]], "Reviews. I. L. Caragiale, ''Opere, Tomul III''", ''The Romanic Review'', Nr. 1/1934, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing mainly for ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', Lăzăreanu discovered and published poetry by politicians such as [[Take Ionescu]], [[Gheorghe Nădejde]], and [[Constantin Istrati]], also republishing 19th-century tracts by [[Jean Alexandre Vaillant]] and physician Alcibiade Tavernier, and documenting the minutae of Hasdeu's literary and political activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pușcariu, pp. 994–995, 1000–1002, 1045&lt;/ref&gt; He also held a column on [[phonaesthetics]],&lt;ref&gt;Pușcariu, pp. 1016–1017, 1053&lt;/ref&gt; and completed in print a historical review of the Romanian [[Communards]] and their sympathizers.&lt;ref name="pp818"/&gt; Known to his Romanian peers as an "incidental" but noteworthy medical historian,&lt;ref&gt;Valeriu L. Bologa, "Institutul de istoria medicinei, farmaciei și de folklor medical din Cluj", ''Boabe de Grâu'', Nr. 6/1932, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; his 1924 collection of essays bridged philology and health historiography, as: ''Lespezi și moloz din templul lui Epidaur'' ("Slabs and Debris from [[Epidaurus (mythology)|Epidaurus]]' Temple").&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliografie", ''Foaia Diecezană. Organul Eparhiei Ortodoxe Române a Caransebeșului'', Nr. 41/1924, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied [[folkloristics]] and [[historical linguistics]], focusing especially on "the destiny of some words",&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt; and involved himself in literary and political polemics with liberal conservatives—[[Mihail Dragomirescu]], [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], and the ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'' writers.&lt;ref name="ts26"&gt;Săvulescu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, he researched and edited several volumes of essays by Dobrogeanu-Gherea, issuing, as part of the "Dobrogeanu-Gherea Collection", the socialist poetry of [[Dumitru Theodor Neculuță]] and [[Anton Bacalbașa]], and the biography of [[Ottoi Călin]] (''Doctorul Ottoi'').&lt;ref&gt;Podoleanu, pp. 159, 160. See also Bucur, p. 250; Cioculescu ''et al.'', pp. 631, 635; Pușcariu, p. 995&lt;/ref&gt; His 1924 review of "various raconteurs" (''Câțiva povestitori'') included monographs on [[Ion Creangă]] and [[N. D. Popescu-Popnedea]]. His critical verdicts were dismissed by Bucur, who described the book as "puerile" and "glib",&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], who sees Lăzăreanu as "a minor, socialist literato [who] did not shy away from distorting literary reality".&lt;ref name="ipumbra"/&gt; In 1927, he published at ''Adevărul'' an overview of Hasdeu's humorous writings (''Umorul lui Hajdeu''). Originally a report to the [[Romanian Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;Pușcariu, p. 1045&lt;/ref&gt; it was noted for its satirical tinges and a slight mockery of its protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Fortunescu, "Recenzii. Cărți", ''Arhivele Olteniei'', Nr. 32–33/1927, p. 396&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Lăzăreanu put out an ethnographic study of [[courtship]] (''Ursitul fetelor și al vădanelor'').&lt;ref name="spod160"/&gt;

===Anti-fascism and 1940s persecution===
In the 1930s, Lăzăreanu became a committed [[anti-fascist]], and one of the main contributors to [[Petre Pandrea]]'s left-wing review, ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1933)|Cuvântul Liber]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], ''Literatura română între cele două războaie mondiale'', Vol. I, p. 162. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1972.  {{OCLC|490001217}}; Săvulescu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the Communist Party attracted him into a semi-legal National Antifascist Committee, where he became colleagues with [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Sandu Eliad]], and [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Ioniță, Virgil Smîrcea, "Acțiuni de masă desfășurate în România în anii 1933—1940 pentru apărarea independenței și suveranității patriei, împotriva fascismului", in [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]] (ed.), ''Din lupta antifascistă pentru independența și suveranitatea României'', pp. 40–41. Bucharest: [[Editura Militară]], 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; His other focus was on researching [[Romanian folklore]], touring the country to lecture the public on related topics, billed alongside Peltz and S. Podoleanu.&lt;ref&gt;Peltz, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he wrote in ''Adevărul'' an homage to the Romanian Jewish linguist [[Moses Gaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ilie Bărbulescu (Slavist)|Ilie Bărbulescu]], "Sărbătorirea și personalitatea științifică a d-lui Moses Gaster", ''Arhiva, Organul Societății Istorico-Filologice din Iași'', Nr. 3–4/1936, pp. 253, 256–257&lt;/ref&gt;

Lăzăreanu was sidelined during the antisemitic ascendancy of the [[National Christian Party]] (1937), but returned to favor under the [[National Renaissance Front]] (1938): although fascist in nature, the latter stipended leftist and Jewish intellectuals, protected by [[Mihai Ralea]], the [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Labor Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 141–143&lt;/ref&gt; Like other men from Ralea's circle, he remained a regular contributor to ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', the sole leftist review still tolerated by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; He also frequented [[Petre V. Haneș]]'s ''Preocupări Literare'' society, where he lectured about early Romanian translations from [[Molière]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ședințele Soc. 'Prietenii Istoriei Literare' în anul 1939", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 10/1939, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he published his final ''Cu privire la...'' volume, focused on [[George Coșbuc]], followed in 1940 by an introduction to the work of [[Constantin Graur]] and a history of the ''Libertatea'' socialist club.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, having since obtained Romanian citizenship, he was stripped of it during the passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial laws]].&lt;ref name="ts26"/&gt;

As the country plunged into World War II alongside the [[Axis powers]], Lăzăreanu was again exposed to racial and political persecution. He was placed under constant surveillance by the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime,&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt; and his collection of documents in Botoșani was presumed looted.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on European Jewish Cultural Reconstruction, ''Tentative List of Jewish Cultural Treasures in Axis-Occupied Countries. Supplement to Jewish Social Studies, Volume 8, No. 1'', p. 63. New York City: Conference on Jewish Relations, 1946. {{OCLC|4225293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication and circulation of his work was explicitly banned,&lt;ref&gt;"Situația creatorilor de artă și literatură, în anii Holocaustului", in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 237/2005, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; but, reportedly, he continued to "speak passionately and resolutely at intimate reunions", condemning war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name="ts26"/&gt; In October 1942, he was arrested with other Jews and scheduled to be deported to [[Transnistria Governorate]], but was spared thanks to the interventions of [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Queen Helen]] and a Romanian physician, [[Victor Gomoiu]].&lt;ref&gt;D.

After the fall of Antonescu [[King Michael's Coup|in August 1944]], Lăzăreanu became a visible associate (later member)&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt; of the Communist Party, contributing to its main organs: ''[[România Liberă]]'', ''[[Scînteia]]'', ''Studii''.&lt;ref name="strj391"/&gt; From 1945 to 1948, he served as the inaugural rector of the new Workers' University in Bucharest, which became the [[Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy]] under his tenure.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 248; Săvulescu, pp. 26–27. See also: {{ro icon}} Paula Mihailov Chiciuc, [http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/istoria-comunismului/universitatea-pcr-12994.html "Universitatea PCR"], ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', September 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural speech, Lăzăreanu declared the school to be one of a fundamentally new type, with a mission to create the "[[New Soviet man|new man]]"; its curriculum was to be based on the four "great educators of mankind": [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1945, he was finally elected to the SSR, one of seven Jewish members enlisted on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 265–265&lt;/ref&gt; On September 18, 1947, he joined [[Gala Galaction]], [[Victor Eftimiu]], [[Mihail Macavei]] and others on the leadership board of the [[Romanian Athenaeum|Bucharest Atheneum]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Aldea, Adriana Gagea, Angela Oprea, "Biblioteca Ateneului Român", ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 1/2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to writing with a Creangă monograph, put out by the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union|Romanian–Russian Relations Library]],&lt;ref name="bucur250"&gt;Bucur, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; focusing his research on that writer's debt to [[Russian fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="acadbl247"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipumbra"/&gt; The communist party's Section for Political Education hosted his lectures on the "poets of labor and poets as laborers", which placed focus on laborist themes in the work of Eminescu or Creangă, and introduced the public to works by [[Zaharia Boiu]], [[Dumitru Corbea]], and [[Alexandru Toma]].&lt;ref&gt;"Poeții muncii și poeții muncitori", ''[[Scînteia]]'', March 1, 1946, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist period===
Shortly after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]], Lăzăreanu gave public endorsement to the [[Jewish Democratic Committee]], which followed a communist platform of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[Rootless cosmopolitan|anti-cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Month", ''Brooklyn Jewish Center Review'', Vol. XXXI, Issue 7, October 1949, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, when the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] revamped the Romanian Academy, he was elected a titular member.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Acad. B. Lăzăreanu", p. 248; Săvulescu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Lăzăreanu headed the [[Romanian Academy Library|Academy's library]], from 1948 to 1957.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acadbl248"&gt;"Acad.

Lăzăreanu was similarly involved, in 1952, with the Romanian [[Spelling reform|orthographic reform]], voted in as a member of the [[Iorgu Iordan - Alexandru Rosetti Institute of Linguistics|Linguistics Institute]], and nominally implementing locally the objectives of ''[[Marxism and Problems of Linguistics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ana Selejan]], ''Literatura în totalitarism.

Bucharest: [[Cartea Românească]], 2008.  {{ISBN|978-973-23-1961-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published in 1950 an anthology of anti-monarchic literature, which went through two more editions by 1957.&lt;ref name="bucur250"/&gt; He returned to socialist historiography and reissued as a book his earlier study on the Romanian Communards.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 250; [[Georges Haupt|Gh. Haupt]], "Primele asociații muncitorești în Romînia", ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 1/1957, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; His other work was in early-readers' literature, with the book ''Dan inimosul'' ("Hearty Dan").&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Breslașu]], "Literatura pentru copii și tineret", in ''Lucrările primului Congres al scriitorilor din Republica Populară Română: 18—23 iunie 1956'', p. 191. Bucharest: [[Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă]], 1956. {{OCLC|895460598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a representative of the new regime, in 1950 he signed a public protest in support of his friend Peltz, who had been exposed as a ''Siguranța'' informant and was facing communist imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Marian]], "Marea nedreptate suferită de scriitorul I. Peltz", in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 334–335/2010, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1952, his 70th anniversary was marked by an official ceremony at the Academy. Săvulescu, the Academy president, saluted him as a Romanian version of [[Tevye|Milkman Tevye]] and [[Till Eulenspiegel]], noting his "kind and open heart" and his ability to versify any situation; his speech also doubled as an attack on cosmopolitanism, praising Lăzăreanu's "[[socialist patriotism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Săvulescu, pp. 21–23, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death in January 1957, Lăzăreanu had served several times in the Academy Presidium. He was also a recipient of the [[Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic|Star of the People's Republic of Romania]], Second Class, and ''[[Ordinul Muncii]]'', First Class.&lt;ref name="acadbl248"/&gt; He was survived by son Alexandru Lăzăreanu, who worked as a Head of Department in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Ministry]] and was instrumental in obtaining Romania's affiliation to [[UNESCO]] and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="malița9"/&gt;

Incinerated at [[Cremation in Romania|''Cenușa'' crematorium]], Barbu Lăzăreanu's funeral, including the speeches, was held on the premises and closed with the singing of "[[The Internationale]]", the highest mark of adherence to the communist ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Rotar, ''History of Modern Cremation in Romania'', p. 317. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013.  {{ISBN|978-1-4438-4542-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were deposited near the mausoleum in [[Carol Park]], but his and all other remains at the complex were removed after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Petrișor Cană, [http://www.evz.ro/eroii-se-intorc-acasa-urne-cu-pamant-de-pe-frontul-de-est-depuse-la-mausoleul-eroilor-1041412.html "Urne cu pământ de pe Frontul de Est, aduse la Mausoleul Eroilor Neamului"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 8, 2013; Mihaela Grancea, "Moartea comunistă în România", ''Romanian Political Science Review'', Nr. 2/2008, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; Found and preserved by the [[World Jewish Congress]], his documentary collection is housed in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomo Leibovici Laiș, "Surse arhivistice pentru istoria evreilor din România", in Liviu Rotman, Camelia Crăciun, Ana-Gabriela Vasiliu (eds.), ''Noi perspective în istoriografia evreilor din România'', p. 27.

'''Benjamin Lee Whorf''' ({{IPAc-en|hw|ɔːr|f}}; April 24, 1897 – July 26, 1941) was an American [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[fire prevention]] engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newcombe|Uttal|2006}}; {{harvcoltxt|Chapman|Routledge|2005|pp=268–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world. This principle has frequently been called the "[[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]", after him and his mentor [[Edward Sapir]], but Whorf called it the principle of [[linguistic relativity]], because he saw the idea as having implications similar to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] principle of [[general relativity|physical relativity]].&lt;ref name="Heynick 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Heynick|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to the study of [[Biblical Hebrew]], but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of [[Mesoamerica]] on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the [[Nahuatl]] language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.

This led him to begin studying linguistics with Edward Sapir at [[Yale University]] while still maintaining his day job at the [[Hartford Fire Insurance Company]]. During his time at Yale he worked on the description of the [[Hopi language]], and the [[historical linguistics]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages]], publishing many influential papers in professional journals. He was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938. Whorf taught his seminar on "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In addition to his well-known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar sketch of Hopi and studies of [[Nahuatl]] dialects, proposed a deciphering of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic writing]], and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan.

After his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist friends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.

In the late 20th century, interest in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed. The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]], and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism. By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the [[allophone]] and the [[cryptotype]], and the formulation of "[[Whorf's law]]" in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
The son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf was born on April 24, 1897 in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]]. Harry Church Whorf was an artist, intellectual and designer&amp;nbsp;– first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist. Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and [[Richard Whorf|Richard]], who both went on to become notable artists. John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' and later an [[Emmy]]-nominated television director of such shows as ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory. He read [[William H. Prescott]]'s ''[[William H. Prescott#The Conquest of Mexico|Conquest of Mexico]]'' several times. At the age of 17 he began to keep a copious diary in which he recorded his thoughts and dreams.&lt;ref name="carroll6"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career in fire prevention ===
Whorf graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1918 with a degree in [[chemical engineering]] where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee.&lt;ref name="carroll6" /&gt; Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the [[The Hartford|Hartford Fire Insurance Company]]. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: "You couldn't do it in any other way."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf helped to attract new customers to the Fire Insurance Company; they favored his thorough inspections and recommendations. Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior.&lt;ref name="Pullum 1991"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pullum|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of flammable vapor the "empty" drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully to the point that they smoked in the room with "empty" drums, but not in the room with full ones. Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the "empty drums".&lt;ref name="HABITUAL" group="w"/&gt;

=== Early interest in religion and language ===
Whorf was a spiritual man throughout his lifetime although what religion he followed has been the subject of debate. As a young man he produced a manuscript titled "Why I have discarded [[evolution]]", causing some scholars to describe him as a devout [[Methodist Episcopalian]], who was impressed with [[fundamentalism]], and perhaps supportive of [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bergman|2011}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lakoff|1987|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout his life Whorf's main religious interest was [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], a nonsectarian organization based on [[Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] teachings that promotes the view of the [[holism|world as an interconnected whole]] and the unity and brotherhood of humankind "without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have argued that the conflict between spiritual and scientific inclinations has been a driving force in Whorf's intellectual development, particularly in the attraction by ideas of linguistic relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Rollins|1972}}; {{harvcoltxt|Rollins|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Whorf's unpublished manuscripts on spirituality also suggest that he was influenced by the ideas of [[Helena Blavatsky]] the founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] who wrote about [[Madame Blavatsky#Cosmic evolution|cosmic evolution]], a belief that regards [[reincarnation]] to be the source of evolution of human races towards continuously higher forms.&lt;ref name="JosephBlavatsky" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blavatsky"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hutton|Joseph|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf said that "of all groups of people with whom I have come in contact, Theosophical people seem the most capable of becoming excited about ideas—new ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Algeo|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1924 Whorf first became interested in [[linguistics]]. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the [[esoteric]] work ''La langue hebraïque restituée'' by [[Fabre d'Olivet|Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]], he began a semantic and grammatical analysis of [[Biblical Hebrew]]. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya have been described as exhibiting a considerable degree of [[mysticism]], as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.&lt;ref name="JosephBlavatsky"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Joseph|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early studies in Mesoamerica linguistics ===
Whorf studied Biblical linguistics mainly at the Watkinson Library (now [[Hartford Public Library]]). This library had an extensive collection of materials about [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American linguistics]] and [[folklore]], originally collected by [[James Hammond Trumbull]].&lt;ref name="Carroll11"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the Watkinson library that Whorf became friends with the young boy, [[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]], who later went on to study psychology under [[B. F. Skinner]], and who in 1956 edited and published a selection of Whorf's essays as ''Language, Thought and Reality'' {{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956b}}. The collection rekindled Whorf's interest in [[Mesoamerica]]n antiquity. He began studying the [[Nahuatl]] language in 1925, and later, beginning in 1928, he studied the collections of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic texts]]. Quickly becoming conversant with the materials, he began a scholarly dialog with Mesoamericanists such as [[Alfred Tozzer]], the Maya archaeologist at [[Harvard University]], and [[Herbert J. Spinden]] of the [[Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref name="Carroll11" /&gt;

In 1928 he first presented a paper at the International Congress of Americanists in which he presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at Harvard. He also began to study the comparative linguistics of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]], which [[Edward Sapir]] had recently demonstrated to be a linguistic family. In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the [[Piman languages|Piman]] and [[Tepecano language]]s, while in close correspondence with linguist [[J. Alden Mason]].&lt;ref name="Carroll11" /&gt;

=== Field studies in Mexico ===
Because of the promise shown by his work on Uto-Aztecan, Tozzer and Spinden advised Whorf to apply for a grant with the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC) to support his research. Whorf considered using the money to travel to Mexico to procure Aztec manuscripts for the Watkinson library, but Tozzer suggested he spend the time in Mexico documenting modern [[Nahuatl dialects]].&lt;ref name="Carroll11" /&gt; In his application Whorf proposed to establish the oligosynthetic nature of the Nahuatl language. Before leaving Whorf presented the paper "Stem series in Maya" at the [[Linguistic Society of America]] conference, in which he argued that in the [[Mayan languages]] syllables carry symbolic content. The SSRC awarded Whorf the grant and in 1930 he traveled to [[Mexico City]] where Professor [[R. H. Barlow|Robert H Barlow]] put him in contact with several speakers of Nahuatl to serve as his informants, among whom were [[Mariano Rojas]] of [[Tepoztlán]] and [[Luz Jimenez]] of [[Milpa Alta]]. The outcome of the trip to Mexico was Whorf's sketch of Milpa Alta Nahuatl, published only after his death, and an article on a series of [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]] found at the [[Tepozteco]] monument at Tepoztlán, [[Morelos]] in which he noted similarities in form and meaning between Aztec and Maya day signs.&lt;ref name="CarrollIntro"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Yale ===
[[File:Edward Sapir.jpg|thumb| [[Edward Sapir]], Whorf's mentor in linguistics at Yale]]
Until his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics. Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to [[Yale University|Yale]] from the [[University of Chicago]] to take a position as Professor of [[Anthropology]]. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on "Nahuatl tones and saltillo". Sapir replied stating that it "should by all means be published";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by [[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref name="Whorf1993"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Whorf|Campbell|Karttunen| 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on "American Indian Linguistics". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir. At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as [[Morris Swadesh]], [[Mary Haas]], [[Harry Hoijer]], [[G. L. Trager]] and [[Charles F. Voegelin]]. Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected.&lt;ref name="CarrollIntro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Darnell|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] tradition he acquired through [[Franz Boas]], which regarded language as the historical embodiment of ''volksgeist'', or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of [[logical positivism]], such as that of [[Bertrand Russell]] and the early [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], particularly through [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards|Richards']] ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'', from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through [[formal logic]]s. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards.&lt;ref name="JosephBlavatsky" /&gt; As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[General semantics]], which was espoused in the US by [[Stuart Chase]]. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be "utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings.

==== Work on Hopi and descriptive linguistics ====
Sapir also encouraged Whorf to continue his work on the [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[descriptive linguistics]] of Uto-Aztecan. Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the [[Hopi language]] and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in [[Manhattan]], New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the [[Second Mesa]] of the [[Hopi Reservation]] in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="Dinwoodie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Dinwoodie|2006|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Whorf was appointed Honorary Research Fellow in Anthropology at Yale, and he was invited by [[Franz Boas]] to serve on the committee of the Society of American Linguistics (later [[Linguistic Society of America]]). In 1937, Yale awarded him the Sterling Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a lecturer in Anthropology from 1937 through 1938, replacing Sapir, who was gravely ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Darnell|1990|pp=380–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf gave graduate level lectures on "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In 1938 with Trager's assistance he elaborated a report on the progress of linguistic research at the department of anthropology at Yale. The report includes some of Whorf's influential contributions to linguistic theory, such as the concept of the [[allophone]] and of [[cryptotype|covert grammatical categories]]. {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996}} has argued, that in this report Whorf's linguistic theories exist in a condensed form, and that it was mainly through this report that Whorf exerted influence on the discipline of descriptive linguistics.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The report is reprinted in {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Final years ====
In late 1938, Whorf's own health declined. After an operation for cancer he fell into an unproductive period. He was also deeply influenced by Sapir's death in early 1939. It was in the writings of his last two years that he laid out the research program of [[Linguistic relativity]]. His 1939 memorial article for Sapir, "The Relation of Habitual Thought And Behavior to Language",&lt;ref name="HABITUAL" group="w"&gt;''The Relation of Habitual Thought And Behavior to Language''. Written in 1939 and originally published in "Language, Culture and Personality: Essays in Memory of Edward Sapir" edited by [[Leslie Spier]], 1941, reprinted in {{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=134–59}}. The piece is the source of most of the quotes used by Whorf's detractors.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular has been taken to be Whorf's definitive statement of the issue, and is his most frequently quoted piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|2000|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last year Whorf also published three articles in the ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' titled "Science and Linguistics",&lt;ref name="SCIENCE" group="w"&gt;"Science and linguistics" first published in 1940 in [[MIT Technology Review]] (42:229–31); reprinted in {{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Linguistics as an Exact Science" and "Language and Logic". He was also invited to contribute an article to a theosophical journal, ''Theosophist'', published in [[Chennai|Madras]], [[India]], for which he wrote "Language, Mind and Reality".&lt;ref name="LMR" group="w"&gt;''Language Mind and reality''. Written in 1941 originally printed by the Theosophical Society in 1942 "The Theosophist" Madras, India. Vol 63:1. 281–91. Reprinted in {{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=246–270}}. In 1952 also reprinted in "Etc., a Review of General Semantics, 9:167–188.&lt;/ref&gt; In these final pieces he offered a critique of Western science in which he suggested that non-European languages often referred to physical phenomena in ways that more directly reflected aspects of reality than many European languages, and that science ought to pay attention to the effects of linguistic categorization in its efforts to describe the physical world. He particularly criticized the [[Indo-European languages]] for promoting a mistaken [[essentialist]] world view, which had been disproved by advances in the sciences, whereas he suggested that other languages dedicated more attention to processes and dynamics rather than stable essences.&lt;ref name="JosephBlavatsky" /&gt; Whorf argued that paying attention to how other physical phenomena are described in the study of linguistics could make valuable contributions to science by pointing out the ways in which certain assumptions about reality are implicit in the structure of language itself, and how language guides the attention of speakers towards certain phenomena in the world which risk becoming overemphasized while leaving other phenomena at risk of being overlooked.&lt;ref name="Subbiondo" /&gt;&lt;!-- difficult to parse --&gt;

=== Posthumous reception and legacy ===
At Whorf's death his friend G. L. Trager was appointed as curator of his unpublished manuscripts. Some of them were published in the years after his death by another of Whorf's friends, [[Harry Hoijer]]. In the decade following, Trager and particularly Hoijer did much to popularize Whorf's ideas about linguistic relativity, and it was Hoijer who coined the term "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" at a 1954 conference.&lt;ref name="Leavitt169"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trager then published an article titled "The systematization of the Whorf hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trager|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to the idea that Whorf had proposed a hypothesis that should be the basis for a program of empirical research. Hoijer also published studies of Indigenous languages and cultures of the American South West in which Whorf found correspondences between cultural patterns and linguistic ones. The term, even though technically a misnomer, went on to become the most widely known label for Whorf's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|p=169}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1997|p=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John A. Lucy]] "Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1992b|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Universalism and anti-Whorfianism ====
Whorf's work began to fall out of favor less than a decade after his death, and he was subjected to severe criticism from scholars of language, culture and psychology. In 1953 and 1954 psychologists [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Eric Lenneberg]] criticized Whorf for his reliance on anecdotal evidence, formulating a hypothesis to scientifically test his ideas, which they limited to an examination of a causal relation between grammatical or lexical structure and cognition or perception. Whorf himself did not advocate a straight causality between language and thought; instead he wrote that "Language and culture had grown up together"; that both were mutually shaped by the other.&lt;ref name="HABITUAL" group="w" /&gt; Hence, {{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1992a}} has argued that because the aim of the formulation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was to test simple causation, from the outset it failed to test Whorf's ideas.

Focusing on [[color term]]inology, with easily discernible differences between perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 a study of [[Zuni language|Zuni]] color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on color perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lenneberg|1953}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Lenneberg|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lenneberg|Roberts|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so they began a line of empirical studies that investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;For more on this topic see: [[Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical testing of the Whorfian hypothesis declined in the 1960s to 1980s as [[Noam Chomsky]] began to redefine linguistics and much of psychology in formal [[universalism|universalist]] terms. Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles.&lt;ref name="B&amp;K"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Berlin|Kay|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MALOTKI" /&gt; Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language, ridiculing Whorf's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See for example pages 623, 624, 631 in {{harvcoltxt|Malotki|1983}}, which is mild in comparison to later writings by {{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}, {{harvcoltxt|Pinker|2007}}, and {{harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir-Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging, and led to a widespread view that Whorf's ideas had been proven wrong. Because Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades, he has been described as "one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Parry-Jones|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, with the advent of [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf's reputation, as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|pp=189–212}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1997}};{{harvcoltxt|Gumperz|Levinson|1996}}; {{harvcoltxt|Levinson|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s [[Analytical philosophy|analytical philosophers]] also became aware of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and philosophers such as [[Max Black]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Davidson|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; published scathing critiques of Whorf's strong relativist viewpoints. Black characterized Whorf's ideas about metaphysics as demonstrating "amateurish crudity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Black|1959|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black and Davidson, Whorf's viewpoint and the concept of linguistic relativity meant that translation between languages with different conceptual schemes would be impossible.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011}} notes how Davidson cites an essay by Whorf as claiming that English and Hopi ideas of times cannot 'be calibrated'. But the word "calibrate" does not appear in the essay cited by Davidson, and in the essay where Whorf does use the word he explicitly states that the two conceptualizations ''can'' be calibrated. For Leavitt this is characteristic of the way Whorf has been consistently misread, others such as {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996}}, {{harvcoltxt|Alford|1978}} and {{harvcoltxt|Casasanto|2008}} make similar points.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent assessments such as those by Leavitt and Lee, however, consider Black and Davidson's interpretation to be based on an inaccurate characterization of Whorf's viewpoint, and even rather absurd given the time he spent trying to translate between different conceptual schemes. In their view the critiques are based on a lack of familiarity with Whorf's writings; according to these recent Whorf scholars a more accurate description of his viewpoint is that he thought translation to be possible, but only through careful attention to the subtle differences between conceptual schemes.&lt;ref name="LeavittPhil"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=121–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Lenneberg]], [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Pinker]]&lt;ref name="Pinker 1994"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker 2007"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also criticized Whorf for failing to be sufficiently clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments took the form of examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how "exotic" grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms&amp;nbsp;– attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ridington|1987|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2009|p=156}} argues that Whorf was mesmerized by the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]], Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which [[racism]] and [[jingoism]] were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that "savages" had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be "Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lakoff|1987|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many followers of universalist schools of thought continue to oppose the idea of linguistic relativity, seeing it as unsound or even ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Steven Pinker argues in his book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' that thought exists prior to language and independently of it, a view also espoused by philosophers of language such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Locke]] and [[Plato]]. In this interpretation, language is inconsequential to human thought because humans do not think in "natural" language, i.e. any language used for communication. Rather, we think in a meta-language that precedes natural language, which Pinker following Fodor calls "[[Language of thought hypothesis|mentalese]]." Pinker attacks what he calls "Whorf's radical position", declaring, "the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of a more "relativist" bent such as [[John A. Lucy]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson]] have criticized Pinker for misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against [[Strawman fallacy|strawmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=19–20}}; {{harvcoltxt|Casasanto|2008}};{{harvcoltxt|Gumperz|Levinson|1996}}; {{harvcoltxt|Darnell|2006}};{{harvcoltxt|Lamb|2000}}; {{harvcoltxt|Levinson|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See also [[Nick Yee]]'s evaluation of Pinker's criticism, [http://www.nickyee.com/ponder/whorf.html What Whorf Really Said], and Dan "Moonhawk" Alford's rebuttal of Chomsky's critique at [http://www.hilgart.org/enformy/dma-chm0.htm Chomsky's Rebuttal of Whorf: The Annotated Version by Moonhawk, 8/95] and [http://www.hilgart.org/enformy/dma-Chap7.htm The Great Whorf Hypothesis Hoax by Dan Moonhawk Alford].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Resurgence of Whorfianism ====
Linguistic relativity studies have experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, and a series of favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in [[cultural psychology]] and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|pp=189–212}}; {{harvcoltxt|Casasanto|2008}};{{harvcoltxt|Reines|Prinze|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Boroditsky|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Nisbett|2003|p=159}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1997}}; {{harvcoltxt|Darnell|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study directing positive attention towards Whorf's relativist position was [[George Lakoff]]'s "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things", in which he argued that Whorf had been on the right track in his focus on differences in grammatical and lexical categories as a source of differences in conceptualization.&lt;ref name="Lakoff 1987"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lakoff|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 psychologist John A. Lucy published two books on the topic, one analyzing the intellectual genealogy of the hypothesis, arguing that previous studies had failed to appreciate the subtleties of Whorf's thinking; they had been unable to formulate a research agenda that would actually test Whorf's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1992a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy proposed a new research design so that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be tested empirically, and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier studies which Lucy claimed had tended to presuppose the universality of the categories they were studying. His second book was an empirical study of the relation between grammatical categories and cognition in the [[Yucatec Maya language]] of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1992b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's writings was published,&lt;ref name="Lee 1996"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinstating Whorf as a serious and capable thinker. Lee argued that previous explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis had largely ignored Whorf's actual writings, and consequently asked questions very unlike those Whorf had asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in that year a volume, "Rethinking Linguistic Relativity" edited by [[John J. Gumperz]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson]] gathered a range of researchers working in [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]] to bring renewed attention to the issue of how Whorf's theories could be updated, and a subsequent review of the new direction of the linguistic relativity paradigm cemented the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lucy|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then considerable empirical research into linguistic relativity has been carried out, especially at the [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]] with scholarship motivating two edited volumes of linguistic relativity studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pütz|Verspoor|2000}}; {{harvcoltxt|Niemeier|Dirven|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in American Institutions by scholars such as [[Lera Boroditsky]] and [[Dedre Gentner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Leavitt|2011|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn universalist scholars frequently dismiss as "dull"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "boring",&lt;ref name="Pinker 2007"/&gt; positive findings of influence of linguistic categories on thought or behavior, which are often subtle rather than spectacular,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;McWhorter misquotes Paul Kay and Willett Kempton's 1984 article "What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis" ({{harvcoltxt|Kay|Kempton|1984}}), in which they criticize those of Whorf's interpreters who are only willing to accept spectacular differences in cognition. McWhorter attributes the view to Kay and Kempton that they were in fact criticizing.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that Whorf's excitement about linguistic relativity had promised more spectacular findings than it was able to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deutscher|2010|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's views have been compared to those of philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pula|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the late [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kienpointner|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chatterjee|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also been compared to the views of psychologists such as [[Lev Vygotsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lucy|Wertsch|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[social constructivism]] considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Schultz|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Dufva|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of [[Positivism|positivist]] science.&lt;ref name="Subbiondo"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Subbiondo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Linguistic relativity ===

{{main|Linguistic relativity}}
Whorf is best known as the main proponent of what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis", named for him and Edward Sapir. Whorf never stated the principle in the form of a hypothesis, and the idea that linguistic categories influence perception and cognition was shared by many other scholars before him. But because Whorf, in his articles, gave specific examples of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called "Sapir-Whorf studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|2005}}; {{harvcoltxt|Newcombe|Uttal|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sources of influence on Whorf's thinking ====
[[File:Whorf Shawnee Example.png|400px|thumb|Whorf's illustration of the difference between the English and Shawnee gestalt construction of cleaning a gun with a ramrod. From the article "Language and Science", originally published in the MIT technology Review, 1940. Image copyright of MIT Press.]]

Whorf and Sapir both drew explicitly on [[Albert Einstein]]'s principle of [[general relativity]]; hence linguistic relativity refers to the concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made.&lt;ref name="Heynick 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Alford|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying [[phoneme]] and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation is an example of how various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf was also influenced by [[gestalt psychology]], believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called "isolates from experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is how the action of cleaning a gun is different in English and [[Shawnee language|Shawnee]]: English focuses on the instrumental relation between two objects and the purpose of the action (removing dirt); whereas the Shawnee language focuses on the movement—using an arm to create a dry space in a hole. The event described is the same, but the attention in terms of [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure and ground]] are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lamb|2000}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Degree of influence of language on thought ====
If read superficially, some of Whorf's statements lend themselves to the interpretation that he supported [[linguistic determinism]]. For example, in an often-quoted passage Whorf writes:
{{quote|text=We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is of course, an implicit and unstated one, but its terms are absolutely obligatory; we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification of data that the agreement decrees. We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.&lt;ref name="SCIENCE" group="w" /&gt;}}

The statements about the obligatory nature of the terms of language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations.&lt;ref name="Pinker 1994"/&gt; However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which we speak of the world, not the terms in which we think of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=22}}; {{harvcoltxt|Levinson|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a [[speech community]] speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called "thinking for speaking". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that "No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible.&lt;!-- difficult to parse --&gt; Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be "calibrated" and thereby be made commensurable, but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.&lt;ref name="LeavittPhil" /&gt;

==== Hopi time ====
{{main|Hopi time controversy}}
Whorf's study of Hopi time has been the most widely discussed and criticized example of linguistic relativity. In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the [[Hopi]] people conceptualize time, how they speak of temporal relations, and the grammar of the Hopi language. Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi.&lt;ref name="HABITUAL" group="w" /&gt; He argued that the Hopi language, in contrast to English and other [[Standard Average European|SAE languages]], does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances, like "three days" or "five years", but rather as a single process. Because of this difference, the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time. He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior. In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present, or future...”&lt;ref name="HABITUAL" group="w" /&gt;

Linguist [[Ekkehart Malotki]] challenged Whorf's analyses of Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time.&lt;ref name="MALOTKI"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Malotki| 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malotki argues that in the Hopi language the system of tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and the Hopi system, is that the latter combines past and present to form a single category.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;It is not uncommon for non-Indo-European languages not to have a three way tense distinction, but instead to distinguish between realis (past/present) and irrealis (future) moods, and describe the past distinction using [[Completive (aspect)|completive aspect]]. This, for example, is the case in [[Kalaallisut|Greenlandic]]. But this had not been recognized when Whorf wrote. See [[Bernard Comrie]]'s {{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1984}} review of Malotki in which he argues that many of Malotki's examples of a tense distinction in fact rather suggest a modality distinction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malotki's critique was widely cited as the final piece of evidence in refuting Whorf's ideas and his concept of linguistic relativity while other scholars defended the analysis of Hopi, arguing that Whorf's claim was not that Hopi lacked words or categories to describe temporality, but that the Hopi concept of time is altogether different from that of English speakers.&lt;ref name="Dinwoodie" /&gt; Whorf described the Hopi categories of [[tense (grammar)|tense]], noting that time is not divided into past, present and future, as is common in European languages, but rather a single tense refers to both present and past while another refers to events that have not yet happened and may or may not happen in the future. He also described a large array of stems that he called "tensors" which describes aspects of temporality, but without referring to countable units of time as in English and most European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|p=140}}; {{harvcoltxt|Lee|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributions to linguistic theory ===
Whorf's distinction between "overt" (phenotypical) and "covert" (cryptotypical) grammatical categories has become widely influential in linguistics and anthropology. British linguist [[Michael Halliday]] wrote about Whorf's notion of the "[[cryptotype]]", and the conception of "how grammar models reality", that it would "eventually turn out to be among the major contributions of twentieth century linguistics".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Halliday|1985|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Whorf introduced the concept of the [[allophone]], a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early [[phoneme]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=46, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]] in a 1941 paper on English phonology&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trager|Bloch|1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hymes|Fought|1981|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single [[phoneme]] in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even to the point that they are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: "[allophones] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [a] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940)&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Unpublished paper quoted in {{harvcoltxt|Lee|2000|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Whorf's inquiries was the approach later described as [[metalinguistics]] by G. L. Trager, who in 1950 published four of Whorf's essays as "Four articles on Metalinguistics".&lt;ref group="w"&gt;"''Four articles on Metalinguistics''" 1950. Foreign Service Institute, Dept. of State&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf was crucially interested in the ways in which speakers come to be aware of the language that they use, and become able to describe and analyze language using language itself to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lee|1996|pp=224–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf saw that the ability to arrive at progressively more accurate descriptions of the world hinged partly on the ability to construct a metalanguage to describe how language affects experience, and thus to have the ability to calibrate different conceptual schemes. Whorf's endeavors have since been taken up in the development of the study of [[metalinguistics]] and [[metalinguistic awareness]], first by [[Michael Silverstein]] who published a radical and influential rereading of Whorf in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Silverstein|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the field of [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zhou|2000|p=347}};{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Schultz|1990|pp=21–22}}; {{harvcoltxt|Mertz|Yovel|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Studies of Uto-Aztecan languages ===
Whorf conducted important work on the [[Uto-Aztecan languages]], which Sapir had conclusively demonstrated as a valid language family in 1915. Working first on Nahuatl, Tepecano, Tohono O'odham he established familiarity with the language group before he met Sapir in 1928. During Whorf's time at Yale he published several articles on Uto-Aztecan linguistics, such as "Notes on the [[Tübatulabal language]]".&lt;ref group="w"&gt;''Notes on the Tubatulabal Language.'' 1936. [[American Anthropologist]] 38: 341–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he published "The Comparative Linguistics of Uto-Aztecan",&lt;ref group="w"&gt;"The Comparative Linguistics of Uto-Aztecan." 1935. [[American Anthropologist]] 37:600–608.&lt;/ref&gt; and a review of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber's]] survey of Uto-Aztecan linguistics.&lt;ref group="w"&gt;"''review of: Uto-Aztecan Languages of Mexico. A. L. Kroeber''" American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 37, No. 2, Part 1 (Apr.&amp;nbsp;– Jun., 1935), pp.
343–345&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf's work served to further cement the foundations of the comparative Uto-Aztecan studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carroll|1956|pp=16–17}}; {{harvcoltxt|Whorf|Campbell|Karttunen|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Native American language Whorf studied was the Uto-Aztecan language [[Nahuatl]] which he studied first from colonial grammars and documents, and later became the subject of his first field work experience in 1930. Based on his studies of [[Classical Nahuatl]] Whorf argued that Nahuatl was an [[oligosynthetic language]], a typological category that he invented. In Mexico working with native speakers, he studied the dialects of Milpa Alta and Tepoztlán. His grammar sketch of the Milpa Alta dialect of Nahuatl was not published during his lifetime, but it was published posthumously by [[Harry Hoijer]]&lt;ref name="MILPA" group="w"&gt;''The Milpa Alta dialect of Aztec (with notes on the Classical and the Tepoztlan dialects)''. Written in 1939, first published in 1946 by Harry Hoijer in Linguistic Structures of Native America, pp. 367–97. Viking Fund Publications in Anthropology, no. 6. New York: Viking Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; and became quite influential and used as the basic description of "[[Nahuatl dialects|Modern Nahuatl]]" by many scholars. The description of the dialect is quite condensed and in some places difficult to understand because of Whorf's propensity of inventing his own unique terminology for grammatical concepts, but the work has generally been considered to be technically advanced. He also produced an analysis of the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of these dialects which he related to the history of the glottal stop and vowel length in Nahuan languages. This work was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen in 1993, who also considered it a valuable description of the two endangered dialects, and the only one of its kind to include detailed phonetic analysis of [[Segment (linguistics)|supra-segmental]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="Whorf1993" /&gt;

In Uto-Aztecan linguistics one of Whorf's achievements was to determine the reason the Nahuatl language has the phoneme {{IPA|/tɬ/}}, not found in the other languages of the family. The existence of {{IPA|/tɬ/}} in Nahuatl had puzzled previous linguists and caused Sapir to reconstruct a {{IPA|/tɬ/}} phoneme for proto-Uto-Aztecan based only on evidence from Aztecan. In a 1937 paper&lt;ref group="w"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1937|title=''The origin of Aztec tl''|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|volume=39|pages=265–274 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1937.39.2.02a00070|last1=Whorf|first1=B. L.|issue=2 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the journal [[American Anthropologist]], Whorf argued that the phoneme resulted from some of the [[Nahuan languages|Nahuan or Aztecan languages]] having undergone a [[sound change]] from the original *{{IPA|/t/}} to {{IPA|[tɬ]}} in the position before *{{IPA|/a/}}. This [[sound law]] is known as "[[Whorf's law]]", considered valid although a more detailed understanding of the precise conditions under which it took place has since been developed.&lt;!-- needs cite here --&gt;

Also in 1937, Whorf and his friend G. L. Trager, published a paper in which they elaborated on the [[Aztec-Tanoan languages|Azteco-Tanoan]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Whorf and Trager suggested the term "Azteco-Tanoan" instead of the label "Aztec-Tanoan" used by Sapir. However, Sapir's original use has stood the test of time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[language family]], proposed originally by Sapir as a family comprising the Uto-Aztecan and the Kiowa-[[Tanoan languages]]—(the [[Tewa language|Tewa]] and [[Kiowa language]]s).&lt;ref group="w"&gt;with George L.Trager. ''The relationship of Uto-Aztecan and Tanoan''. (1937). [[American Anthropologist]], 39:609–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maya epigraphy ===
In a series of published and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic.&lt;ref group="w"&gt;{{cite book| year = 1975 | origyear = 1933 | title = The Phonetic Value of Certain Characters in Maya Writing | publisher = Krauss Reprint | location = Millwood, N.Y. | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="w"&gt;{{cite book | year = 1970 | origyear = 1942 | title = Maya Hieroglyphs: An Extract from the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1941 | publisher = Shorey Book Store | location = Seattle | isbn = 978-0-8466-0122-7 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, [[J.E.S. Thompson]], strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thompson|1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whorf argued that it was exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by [[Yuri Knorozov]]'s syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coe|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Houston|Chinchilla Mazariegos|Stuart|2001|pp=144, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Rossiter Crozier''' (4 August 1918 in [[Shire of Cloncurry]], [[Queensland]]&amp;nbsp;– 4 August 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9462513/Brian-Crozier.html|title=Brian Crozier obituary|publisher=Telegraph|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a historian, strategist and journalist.

==Biography==
Born in Australia, Crozier grew up in France, learning French. His family then moved to England, where he received a scholarship to study piano and composition at the [[Trinity College of Music]] in London. Early in [[personal life|life]] he believed in [[communism]], as a reaction to the [[Great Depression]] and to [[Adolf Hitler]], but later he changed his philosophy and worked to combat it.&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brian Crozier|author=Joseph D'Agostino|publisher=Human Events|date=26 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crozier eventually became interested in journalism and pursued a career that led him to become a foreign correspondent for [[Reuters]], a columnist for ''[[The Economist]],'' a reporter for the [[BBC]] and - during a brief return to Australia - a writer for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Student of Subversion|author=David Rees|publisher=National Review|date=31 December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crozier worked as the director of ''[[Forum World Features]]'', set up in 1966 by the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which had ties to the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). While editing the ''Economist'''s "insider" news-sheet ''Foreign Report'', Crozier, as he later recorded in his memoirs, kept some of the best stories that reached him for the CIA. He stated in 1975 that ''Forum World Features'' had broken all ties to the CIA when he became its director in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CIA News Service Reported|publisher=Washington Post|date= 3 July 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Crozier founded the [[Institute for the Study of Conflict]], based in London, to study insurgencies and [[terrorism]]. He presided over it for most of the 1970s. According to a profile written by David Rees in 1985 for the American fortnightly ''[[National Review]]'' "the Institute...was the first private think-tank devoted to the study of terrorism and subversion". Under his direction (he left in 1979) the institute specialised in the study of the "peace-time" strategy of the [[Soviet Union]]. Its analyses, including the ''Annual of Power and Conflict'' which it published for ten years, have been used in war colleges throughout [[Western world|the West]].&lt;ref name="NR"/&gt; 

For many years Crozier wrote a regular column, "The Protracted Conflict", in the ''[[National Review]]''. Joseph D'Agostino of ''Human Events'' states: "Crozier has another distinction: in 1988 he appeared in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for having interviewed the most heads of state or government, 58 in all."&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

Crozier provided advice to the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]], to the [[Information Research Department]] (IRD) of the British Foreign Office, and to the CIA. Lecturing to Britain's staff college for army officers during the early 1970s, when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was in power under [[Harold Wilson]], Crozier stated if the government went "too far", it was the armed forces' duty to intervene (he claimed that he was enthusiastically applauded). In 1982 it was revealed from the papers of former Bavarian state security chief [[Hans Langemann]] that Crozier was an attendant of [[Le Cercle]] and headed a secret international group that tried to influence the [[West German federal election, 1980|West German federal election of 1980]] by using secret-service connections and [[cover-up]] financial transactions to make [[Franz Josef Strauß]] [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany|Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Der Spiegel]]: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14351703.html Victory for Strauß].'' 37/1982 ([http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=14351703&amp;aref=image036/2006/06/20/cq-sp198203700280031.pdf&amp;thumb=false PDF]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501075254/http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=14351703&amp;aref=image036%2F2006%2F06%2F20%2Fcq-sp198203700280031.pdf&amp;thumb=false |date=1 May 2013  }})&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[HarperCollins]] published Crozier's autobiography, ''Free Agent: The Unseen War 1941–1991'', in 1993, revised and corrected in paperback edition in 1994.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Crozier was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow on War, Revolution, and Peace of the [[Hoover Institution]].{{fact|date=March 2018}}  He was also a member of the international advisory council of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Cusco''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Cuzco}}, {{IPA-es|ˈkusko|}}; {{lang-qu|Qusqu, Qosqo}}, {{IPA-qu|ˈqɔsqɔ|IPA}}), often spelled '''Cuzco''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|s|k|oʊ}}), is a city in southeastern [[Peru]], near the [[Urubamba Valley]] of the [[Andes]] mountain range. It is the capital of the [[Cusco Region]] and of the [[Cusco Province]]. In 2013, the city had a population of 435,114. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco, its elevation is around {{convert|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The site was the historic capital of the [[Inca Empire]] from the 13th until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983 Cusco was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] with the title "City of Cuzco". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million visitors a year. The [[Constitution of Peru]] designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Peru/per93reforms05.html#titIIcapI |title=Constitución del Perъ de 1993 |publisher=Pdba.georgetown.edu |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spelling and etymology==
The indigenous name of this city is ''Qusqu''. Although the name was used in [[Classical Quechua|Quechua]], its origin is found in the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] language. The word is derived from the phrase ''qusqu wanka'' ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (''Ayar Auca'') acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his ''[[ayllu]]'' ("lineage"):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==History==

===Killke culture===

The [[Killke culture|Killke]] people occupied the region from 900 to 1200, prior to the arrival of the [[Inca]] in the 13th century. [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-14 dating]] of [[Saksaywaman]], the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, [[archaeologist]]s discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] system at Saksaywaman.&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080331-inca-temple.html Kelly Hearn, "Ancient Temple Discovered Among Inca Ruins"], ''National Geographic News'', 31 March 2008, accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The temple covers some {{convert|2,700|sqft|m2|abbr=off}} and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies,&lt;ref name="temple"/&gt; establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&amp;fn=/2008/03/14/911994.html&amp;cookieattempt=1 |title=News|publisher=Comcast.net&lt;! |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sacsayhuamán, Cusco, Perú, 2015-07-31, DD 35.JPG|thumb|[[Sacsayhuamán]] is an Inca ceremonial fortress located two kilometers north from Cusco, is the greatest architectural work done by the Incas during its apogee.]]
Cusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the [[Inca Empire]] (13th century–1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an [[effigy]] in the shape of a [[Cougar|puma]], a [[sacred]] animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusco.net/articulos/cuscoinca.htm#Puma |title=The history of Cusco |publisher=cusco.net&lt;! |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the ''urin'' and ''hanan''. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, [[Chinchasuyu]] (NW), [[Antisuyu]] (NE), [[Kuntisuyu]] (SW) and [[Qullasuyu]] (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.

Each local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of [[Pachacuti]], when an [[Sapa Inca|Inca]] died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives ([[split inheritance]]). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.

According to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by [[Sapa Inca]] [[Pachacuti]], the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of ''[[Tawantinsuyu]]''.&lt;ref name=Gamboa&gt;de Gamboa, P.S., 2015, ''History of the Incas,'' Lexington, {{ISBN|9781463688653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66–69}} Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.

The city fell to the sphere of [[Huáscar]] during the [[Inca Civil War]] after the death of [[Huayna Capac]] in 1527. It was captured by the generals of [[Atahualpa]] in April 1532 in the [[Battle of Quipaipan]]. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city (see [[battle of Cuzco]]) and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.

===After the Spanish invasion===
[[File:Capitulo-XCII.jpg|thumb|The first image of Cusco in Europe. [[Pedro Cieza de León]]. ''[[Crónica del Perú]]'', 1553.|left]]

The first three [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]] arrived in the city in May 1533, after the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], collecting for [[Atahualpa]]'s [[Ransom Room]]. On 15 November 1533 [[Francisco Pizarro]] officially arrived in Cusco. "The capital of the Incas...astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets." The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since "each sovereign built a new palace for himself." "The delicacy of the stone work excelled" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three [[parapets]] and was composed of "heavy masses of rock." "Through the heart of the capital ran a river...faced with stone." "The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco...was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun...studded with gold plates...surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests." "The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices," including the royal mummies in the [[Coricancha]].&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, {{ISBN|9781420941142}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–187, 192–193, 216–219}}

Pizarro ceremoniously gave [[Manco Inca]] the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader.&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|221}} Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out [[repartimiento]]s to do so.&lt;ref name=Pizarro&gt;Pizzaro, P., 1571, Relation of the Discovery and Conquest of the Kingdoms of Peru, Vol. 1–2, New York: Cortes Society, RareBooksClub.com, {{ISBN|9781235937859}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} [[Alcaldes]] were established and [[regidor]]es on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]]. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and then departed for [[Jauja]] with Manco Inca.&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|222, 227}}

[[File:Hatunrumiyoc (7640968366).jpg|thumb|An Inca wall along Hatunrumiyoc, Cusco]]
Pizarro renamed it the "Very noble and great city of Cuzco". Buildings constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence with Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city.

Father [[Vincente de Valverde]] became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He placed a St. Dominic monastery on the ruins of the House of the Sun and a nunnery where the House of the Virgins of the Sun was stood.&lt;ref name=Prescott/&gt;{{rp|222}}

The city was retaken from the Spanish during the [[Siege of Cuzco]] of 1536 by [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]], a leader of the [[Sapa Inca]]. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], the capital of the newly established small [[Neo-Inca State]], which lasted for another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], many Incas died of [[smallpox]].

Cusco stands on layers of cultures, with the Tawantinsuyu (old [[Inca Empire]]) built on [[Killke]] structures and the Spanish replacing [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] temples with Catholic churches and palaces with mansions for the invaders.

Cusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the [[Andes|Andean]] world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and [[convent]]s, as well as a [[Cusco Cathedral|cathedral]], [[National University of Saint Anthony the Abbot in Cuzco|university]] and [[Archbishopric]].

[[File:Cuzco007.jpg|thumb|A view of the Colonial [[Balconies of Cusco]]]]

===Republican era===
After Peru declared its independence in 1821, Cusco maintained its importance within Peru's administrative structure. Upon independence, the government created the [[Cusco Region|Department of Cuzco]], maintaining authority over territory extending to the Brazilian border. Cusco was made capital of the department; subsequently it became the most important city in the south-eastern Andean region.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city's urban sprawl spread to the neighboring districts of [[Santiago District, Cusco|Santiago]] and [[Wanchaq District|Wanchaq]].

In 1911, [[explorer]] [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] used the city as a base for the expedition in which he rediscovered the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]].

===Present===

A major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused the destruction of more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive ''[[Qurikancha]]'' (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the [[granite]] retaining walls of the ''Qurikancha'' were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/peru/cusco-koricancha.htm|title=Koricancha Temple and Santo Domingo Convent – Cusco, Peru|publisher=Sacred-destinations.com|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/2A/97|title=The Cusco, Peru, Earthquake of May 21, 1950 |author =Erickson et al. |volume=44|issue= 2|page= 97 |work=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=Bssa.geoscienceworld.org|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada Pérez, a staunch supporter of the ''[[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua]]'', between 1983 and 1995 the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] name ''Qosqo'' was officially adopted for the city.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Streets of Cusco, Peru (7034974831).jpg|thumb|Colonial houses]]
Cusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around {{convert|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To its north is the [[Vilcabamba mountain range|Vilcabamba]] mountain range with {{convert|4000|-|6000|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} mountains. The highest peak is [[Salcantay]] ({{convert|6,271|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=off}}) about {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=off}} northwest of Cusco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andes.zoom-maps.com/|title=Map Of The Andes|author=|date=|work=zoom-maps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusco has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwb''). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. The dry season lasts from May to August, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coolest month with an average of {{convert|9.7|C|1}}. The wet season lasts from December to March, with night frost less common; November averages {{convert|13.3|C|1}}. Although frost and hail are common, the only snowfall ever recorded was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from {{convert|0.2|to|20.9|C|F}}, but the all-time temperature range is between {{convert|-8.9|and|30|C|F}}. Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the northern hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the northern hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.

Cusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average [[ultraviolet]] light level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614170312/http://www.niwascience.co.nz/rc/atmos/uvconference/2006/Liley_2.pdf Liley, J.

The [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Killke culture]] built the walled complex of [[Sacsayhuamán]] about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] ([[Puquios|Pukyus]]) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.

The Spanish explorer [[Francisco Pizarro|Pizarro]] sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, [[Qurikancha]] (the Temple of the Sun) and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger than the foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the [[Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco]].

The major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, [[Machu Picchu]], which can be reached on foot by the [[Inca Trail to Machu Picchu]] or by train; and the "fortress" at [[Ollantaytambo]].

Less-visited [[ruins]] include: [[Incahuasi (Apurímac)|Incahuasi]], the highest of all Inca sites at {{convert|3980|m|ft|abbr=on}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bylandwaterandair.com/zz_peru04/routes/inca_wasi/s4_main.php |website=bylandwaterandair.com |title=Photo map of the sites in Upper Puncuyoc – Inca Wasi, cave group, reflection pond and abandoned pegs |accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], the capital of the Inca after the capture of Cusco; the [[sculpture garden]] at [[Ñusta Hisp'ana]] (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); [[Tipón]] with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as [[Willkaraqay]], [[Patallaqta]], [[Choquequirao|Chuqik'iraw]], [[Moray (Inca ruin)|Moray]], [[Vitos]] and many others.

The surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including [[maize|corn]], [[barley]], [[quinoa]], tea and coffee.

Cusco's main stadium [[Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega]] was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the [[Copa América]], in [[2004 Copa América|2004]]. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, ''[[Cienciano]]''.

The city is served by [[Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport]].

=== Architectural heritage ===
[[File:Arco de Santa Clara - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Arco de Santa Clara]]
[[File:Cusco Peru Beautiful Building.jpg|thumb|240px|Colonial civil building]]

Because of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] structures, which led to its declaration as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:

==== ''Barrio de San Blas'' ====
This neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.

The Quechua name of this neighborhood is ''Tuq'ukachi'', which means the opening of the salt.

==== ''Hatun Rumiyuq'' ====
This street is the most visited by tourists. On the street ''Hatun Rumiyoq'' ("the one with the big stone") was the palace of [[Inca Roca]], which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.

Along this street that runs from the ''Plaza de Armas'' to the ''Barrio de San Blas'', one can see the [[twelve-angled stone|Stone of Twelve Angles]], which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.

==== Convento e Iglesia de la Merced ====
[[File:Calle-del-medio-Cusco.jpg|thumb|upright|Night view of the bell tower of the Iglesia y Convento de La Merced]]
Its foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.

Its cloisters of [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[Renaissance]] style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.

Also on view is an elaborate [[monstrance]] made of gold and gemstones that weighs {{convert|22|kg|0|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|130|cm|2|abbr=on}} in height.

==== Cathedral ====
{{Main article|Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco}}
The first cathedral built in Cusco is the ''Iglesia del Triunfo'', built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of [[Viracocha (Inca)|Viracocha Inca]]. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the Cathedral.

The main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.

This great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.

The city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the "[[Cuzco School]]" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the [[Last Supper]] depicting [[Jesus]] and the [[twelve apostles]] feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.

The cathedral is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cuzco|Archdiocese of Cuzco]].

==== Plaza de Armas de Cusco ====
{{wide image|82 - Cuzco - Juin 2009.jpg|815px|align-cap=center|Plaza de Armas de Cusco, Peru, at night}}
{{wide image|Plaza de Armas de Cuzco.jpg|815px|align-cap=center|Plaza de Armas de Cusco}}
Known as the "Square of the warrior" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in the conquest of Cuzco.

Similarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of [[Túpac Amaru II]], considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.

The Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compañía both open directly onto the plaza.

==== ''Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús'' ====
[[File:Church of la Compañía, Cuzco.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús, Cusco|Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús]]]]
This church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in 1576 on the foundations of the ''Amarucancha'' or the palace of the Inca ruler [[Huayna Capac|Wayna Qhapaq]], is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.

Its façade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.

==== Qurikancha and Convent of Santo Domingo ====
{{Main article|Qurikancha}}
[[File:Cusco Coricancha view1.jpg|thumb|[[Qurikancha]], Convento de Santo Domingo and Intipanpa]]
The Qurikancha ("golden place") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God ([[Inti]]) at the time of the [[Inca Empire]]. According to ancient chronicles written by [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)]], Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God – Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totallylatinamerica.com/peru-vacations-articles/the-inca-city-of-cusco-a-fascinating-look-at-the-most-important-city-in-the-inca-empire/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130710030039/http://www.totallylatinamerica.com/peru-vacations-articles/the-inca-city-of-cusco-a-fascinating-look-at-the-most-important-city-in-the-inca-empire/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2013 |title=The Inca City of Cusco: A Fascinating Look at the Most Important City in the Inca Empire |publisher=totallylatinamerica.com |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.

With this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo ([[St. Dominic]]) in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.

Inside is a large collection of paintings from the [[Cuzco School]].

==Cuisine==
As capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/news/peru-city-bans-gm-to-protect-native-potatoes.html |title=Cusco, Peru Bans GM Products To Protect Diversity Of Native Potatoes |publisher=scidev.net |accessdate=21 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sazonperu.com/busqueda/ciudad/index.php?idprov=137&amp;flag=1&amp;iddpto=8&amp;idio= |title=Restaurantes |author= |date=20 November 2007 |work=archive.org |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120020007/http://www.sazonperu.com/busqueda/ciudad/index.php?idprov=137&amp;flag=1&amp;iddpto=8&amp;idio= |archivedate=20 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emily Gowers''' is Professor of Latin Literature at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a Fellow of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. She is known in particular for her work on [[Horace]], [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]], and the history of food in the Roman world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/directory/emily-gowers|title=Professor Emily Gowers — Faculty of Classics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.classics.cam.ac.uk|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Gowers studied [[Classics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and was awarded her BA in 1985 followed by her MA in 1990. Gowers remained in Cambridge for her PhD with a dissertation entitled ''The representation of food in Roman literature'' in 1990 for which she was awarded the Hare Prize. She was a Junior Research Fellow at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1988 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Member/Gowers_Emily/CV|title=Academy of Europe: CV|last=Hoffmann|first=Ilire Hasani, Robert|website=www.ae-info.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 to 1993, Gowers was a lecturer in Latin at [[University College London|University College, London]] followed by a period as an honorary research fellow at the same institution. In 1998 Gowers became an Affiliated Lecturer for the Faculty of Classics, [[University of Cambridge]] and then moved to [[Princeton University]] in 2000 as a lecturer in the Department of Classics. She returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in Classics in 2002 and became a Senior Lecturer in 2009. Since 2013 Gowers has been a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Latin Literature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ae-info.org/ae/Member/Gowers_Emily|title=Academy of Europe: Gowers Emily|last=Hoffmann|first=Ilire Hasani, Robert|website=www.ae-info.org|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gowers was made Professor of Latin Literature in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2015-16/weekly/6429/section7.shtml#heading2-22|title=Reports - Cambridge University Reporter 6429|website=www.admin.cam.ac.uk|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gowers's work on the representation of food in Latin literature stemmed from her PhD research into the subject. Her 1993 publication, ''The Loaded Table'', was awarded the ''Premio Langhe Ceretto'' (per la cultura del cibo) in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yPwSuAA4BvEC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;lpg=PA337&amp;dq=%22Premio+Langhe+Ceretto%22+%22emily+gowers%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J4VhbxpApO&amp;sig=WF4GbkG67BfyZpN9yt8Sh0LzPic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9qJC4pfHcAhWLesAKHS7KCbAQ6AEwDHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Premio%20Langhe%20Ceretto%22%20%22emily%20gowers%22&amp;f=false|title=The Loaded Table : Representations of Food in Roman Literature: Representations of Food in Roman Literature|last=Gowers|first=Emily|date=1993-01-21|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780191591655|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and translated into Italian in 1996.

      <comment>Suggestions for simplification, avoiding redundancy. Expertization is often done by individual experts, not just committees. Future tense isn't necessary when describing procedures. An "other mark" isn't really an alternative to a "mark". Cheers!</comment>

'''Expertization''' is the process of [[authentication]] of an object, usually of a sort that is [[collecting|collected]], by an individual [[expert|authority]] or a committee of authorities. The expert, or expert committee, examines the collectible and issues a certificate typically including:

* A statement of:
** Whether or not the item is authentic
** Identification of any damage to the item
** Identification of any repairs to the item
** Identification of any forgery or faked parts of the item
* A photo of the item

Some experts apply a mark or signature to the item attesting its genuineness.

Expertization is particularly common with valuable [[philatelic]] items, some of which are so often forged that they may be unsaleable without it.

'''Floros Konstantinou''' ({{lang-el|Φλώρος Κωνσταντίνου}}; 8 October 1952 – 19 February 2018) was a [[Greece|Greek]] politician, [[historian]] and [[economist]], who served as a [[Hellenic Parliament|Member of the Parliament]] and Deputy Minister of Agriculture with [[PASOK]]. He was a graduate of [[Political Sciences]] and a holder of two doctoral degrees, the first with the [[rural economy]] and the second in history of Hellenism in Romania.

Born in 1952 in [[Kalambaki]], [[Drama (regional unit)|Drama]]. Sixth child of the refugees Fotis and Stergianis Konstantinou, he grew up in Kalambaki where he finished high school. He studied [[political science]] at the [[Panteion University]] between 1972 and 1976 where he participated at the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] against the "[[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|greek military junta]]". After the end of the dictatorship (24 July 1974) and the establishment of the [[Third Hellenic Republic]]  he became a political activist within the university with the political group "Friends of Andreas Papandreou" which, later on, was renamed as "PASP" which was the student political party of the [[PASOK|"Panhellenic Socialistic Movement"]]. Then he graduated and because of his outstanding results (Grade: "Excellent", 10/10) he was awarded a scholarship for a [[doctorate]] in the field of [[agricultural economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.didaktorika.gr/eadd/handle/10442/4926 COOPERATIA AGRICOLA IN GRECIA SI PERSPECTIVELE DEZVOLTARII EI] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]], which he obtained. In 1980-1981, he moved to Brussels and followed a master in political science at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles|Universite Libre de Bruxelles]].

From 1 January 1981 he was a member of YEPEK (PASOK Representation Office in the [[European Parliament]]). He was first elected [[Hellenic Parliament|MP]] for [[PASOK]] for [[Drama (regional unit)|Drama]] in October 1981 and has since been elected until 1996. Since 1984 he has been a member of the Central Committee of the Movement and has also served as a member and secretary of the PASOK Cooperative Guild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livanis.gr/ViewAuthors.aspx?ValueId=600913 Συγγραφέας: "Κωνσταντίνου Φλώρος"] {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 1993 to September 1995, he was Deputy [[Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food (Greece)|Minister of Agriculture]] in the last government of [[Andreas Papandreou]]. He handled Agriculture and Fisheries issues in the [[European Union]], especially in the first half of 1994, when Greece held the presidency of the EU and patented over 150 products as [[Protected Denomination of Origin|PDO]] and [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|PGI]] (oils, cheeses, fruits, legumes, etc.), including the [[Feta|Greek Feta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=1833|title=Greece: Ministerial Decision No. 313025 Concerning the Recognition of Protected Designation of Origin (P.D.O.) for the Cheese FETA|website=www.wipo.int|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the period 1996–1997 he was a consultant at the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and then a counsultant at "SEKAP" industry. He published two books on Greek agriculture within the framework of the European Union ("Greek Agriculture and the International Environment" by Livani's Publishing) and regularly wrote to the Greek Press.

'''''Foundations of Modern Arab Identity''''' (Gainesville, [[Florida]]: University Press of Florida, 2004) is a [[book]] by Arab American scholar [[Stephen Sheehi]].

Published in 2004,  ''Foundations of Modern Arab Identity'' is a pioneering study of the [[Arab Renaissance]] or [[al-Nahda]], critically engaging the  "intellectual struggles that ensued when Arab writers internalized Western ways of defining themselves and their societies a century and a half ago."&lt;ref name=Furani&gt;''Journal of Arabic Literature'' (2005), Vol. 36 Issue 2, [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=3&amp;hid=114&amp;sid=c7aabf13-228b-4dc4-ba90-441d1e903164%40sessionmgr107 pp. 224-234].&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent scholar of the Middle East, Orit Bashkin states that "Sheehi’s work is an innovative and important contribution to the field of Arabic literature, Arab culture, and intellectual history" is noted for its  "imaginative outlook on the ways in which we read the texts that make up the canon of the Arab nahda," otherwise known as the Arabic Renaissance.&lt;ref name=Bashkin&gt;Orit Bashkin, "The Middle East Journal," Vol. 62, No. 2, Spring, 2008, pp. 354-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Bashkin adds that "Sheehi's selection of texts is unique and original. Instead of focusing on either works in social thought or narrative prose, the book studies a variety of texts - pamphlets, newspaper articles, and philosophical tracts as well as maqamat, novels, and sketches - in an attempt to explicate new conversations and ideas, which were articulated in different genres and linguistic modes." &lt;ref name="Bashkin" /&gt;

Among the  first of a wave of scholars to apply post-colonial and post-structural theory, most notably the theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], to modern Arab culture and [[Arabic literature]], the book  discusses major Arab intellectuals of the 19th century including [[Butrus al-Bustani]], Salim al-Bustani, [[Jurji Zaydan]], [[Farah Antun]], [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq]], [[Nasif al-Yaziji]], [[Muhammad al-Muwaylihi]], [[Muhammad Abduh]] and others including [[Jamal ad-din al-Afghani]]. Anthropologist Lucia Volk writes that Sheehi proves that these intellectual "elites actively produced indigenous ideologies of modernity while struggling against the overwhelming powers of Western [[colonialism]]."&lt;ref name=Volk&gt;Lucia Volk, ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' (2006), Volume 38, Issue 01, Feb 2006, pp. 132-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reframing the conception of modern [[Arab]] identity from a confrontation between two undifferentiated cultures, the book closely reads "foundational" Arabic texts from turn of the century
to demonstrate that the ideology  and discourses of Arab subjectivity were internally formed within the [[Ottoman Empire]] at a time of radical transformations in governance and political economy. Sheehi locates the battle for "self" and "other" outside of the "colonial encounter" between Western colonizer and Eastern colonized. Instead, the dialectic between Self and Other
transpired internally—epistemologically and discursively—on a plane of dynamic cultural and social formations within Ottoman Arab society and polity during the [[Tanzimat]]. Sheehi proposes that the concept of cultural "failure" is inherent to the ways modern Arab intellectuals critically reorganized and redefined Arab subjectivity during [[modernity]]. Examining a host of varying sources including Arab fiction and commentary from the [[Arab Press]], Sheehi maps out a "formula" for Arab reform during 19th and 20th century al-nahda, which predicates "progress and civilization" as "proleptic" teleological endpoints. Linguistically and semiotically structuring this formula was an axiomatic "nomenclature of reform" that was found in all Arab reform writing and thought despite the ideological, sectarian, political, or national position of the author. This commonality, Sheehi reveals, is due to that historical and political fact that all reform paradigms during the late Ottoman and Mandate periods arose from a fundamental  [[epistemology]] of Arab modernity; a hybridized but still thorough modern form of modernity that Sheehi states was "autogenetic."

As this epistemology is based on priorities of indigenous and colonialist capitalist development and Western political hegemony, recast in the form of liberalism and Western cultural and superiority, intellectual paradigms, political programs, and visions of new national social order among Arab thinkers inevitably always express "lack" as the core of Arab identity because it is engaged in an endless struggle of authority and "subjective presence" with the [[Western world|West]], who otherwise accuses Arabs as being inherently "backwards". This condition of failure is written into Arab subjectivity by Arabs themselves, internalizing racist notions of Arab otherness that accompany the "modern", humanist, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project. Hence, what is self-diagnosed as "the inherent failure of Arab culture and "identity" is not proof of the inability of the Arab world to enter into modernity but in fact is precisely a condition of it.&lt;ref name="Volk" /&gt; Hence, ''Foundations of Modern Arab Identity'' reveals that a "spectral European presence" is ever present in Arab modernity and its paradigms of Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;Lital Levy, Jewish Writers in the Arab East: Literature, History, and the Politics of Enlightenment, 1863--1914, Ph.D Dissertation, University of California Berkeley, 2007, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Gorodetsky''' (born 13 May 1945) is a Quondam Fellow of [[All Souls College]], Oxford, and emeritus professor of history at [[Tel Aviv University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/99660922.html?dids=99660922:99660922&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+1991&amp;author=Avigail+Gutman&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;desc=HISTORY+AS+POLITICS&amp;pqatl=google|title=History as Politics|last=Avigail|first=Gutman|date=15 March 1991|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|page=12|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorodetsky studied History and Russian Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and went on to obtain his Ph.D degree under the supervision of British historian [[E. H. Carr]] in Oxford. He was the director of the Cummings Center for Russian Studies at Tel Aviv University from 1991–2007. He has been a visiting fellow of [[St. Antony's College]] in Oxford in 1979 and in 1993, of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington in 1986, of All Souls in Oxford in 2006, and a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton. Gorodetsky was also a visiting professor at the universities of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Cologne|Cologne]], and at the [[Central European University]] in Budapest. In 2010 Gorodetsky received an honorary doctorate from the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] in Moscow.

He is married to {{Interlanguage link multi|Ruth Herz|de}}, a jurist from [[Cologne]], judge in the [[RTL Television]] [[court show]] ''[[Das Jugendgericht]]'' (2001–2005), research fellow of the Centre of Criminology at the [[University of Oxford]], author of ''Recht Persönlich'' (Beck, 2006) and ''The Art of Justice: The Judge's Perspective'' (Hart Publishing, Oxford, 2013).

== Research ==
In his major work ''Grand Delusion: Stalin and the German Invasion of Russia'' (Yale University Press, 1999), Gorodetsky, employing rare sources from the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Soviet General Staff, the NKVD, the GRU, as well as from Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British and German archives, unfolds the events leading to the German invasion of the USSR on 22 June 1941.

According to Gorodetsky's version Stalin saw Hitler as his own mirror reflection, committed to realpolitik and eager to improve the Soviet Union's national status which it had lost as a result of the disasters which were inflicted on her during the First World War and the Russian Revolution. Through the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], Stalin believed he could bring about a change in the European balance of power. When he learnt through his intelligence of Hitler's aggressive intentions, in late 1930s, the dismal state of the military, decapitated through the [[Great Purge|purges of the 1930s]], he had no choice but to resort to appeasement hoping he could either delay the war or reach a second agreement with Hitler. Even the suggestion by his Chief of Staff to launch a counter-offensive was discarded by the Soviet dictator, according to Gorodetsky.

Gorodetsky's analysis has been hailed in the West as a breakthrough in the study of Soviet military and diplomatic policies on the eve of the war.

In 2015, Gorodetsky edited an annotated publication for Yale University Press of the unique and extraordinary diaries of Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to London from 1932-1943.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6229">"'''Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis'''" is a 1986 paper by [[Joan Wallach Scott]], originally published in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' (''AHR''), and reprinted as part of Scott's 1989 book ''Gender and the Politics of History''.  It is one of the most cited papers in the history of the ''AHR''.&lt;ref name=Schneider-2008&gt;{{harvnb|Schneider|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the ''AHR'' focused its December issue on the paper, featuring six articles on the paper, including one by Scott herself.&lt;ref name=Schneider-2008/&gt;  At that time, "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis" was the most-visited ''AHR'' article on [[JSTOR]], having been accessed more than 38,000 times since 1997 &amp;ndash; more than 16,000 more views than the next most popular of that journal's articles.

== Argument ==
The paper begins by discussing three existing theoretical approaches to gender.&lt;ref name="Sewell 1990 75"&gt;{{harvnb|Sewell|1990|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott then provides her own definition of gender in two parts: gender is based on the perceived differences between the sexes, but is also a way of signifying power differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1986|p=1067}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This second part of the definition is, according to [[William H. Sewell, Jr.|William Sewell]], "important and contentious", making a claim for the importance of gender in all areas of history.&lt;ref name="Sewell 1990 75"/&gt;  The paper argues that the field of gender history should focus on social and political construction of gender.&lt;ref name="Sewell 1990 71"&gt;{{harvnb|Sewell|1990|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, according to [[Dyan Elliott]], a manifesto for the use of gender as a way of looking at the history of "male institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elliott|2008|p=1392}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper was influenced by the French philosophers [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]],&lt;ref name=Meyerowitz-1347&gt;{{harvnb|Meyerowitz|2008|p=1347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott was influenced by the [[linguistic turn]] in history.&lt;ref name="Sewell 1990 75"/&gt;

== Reception ==
Many of the initial reactions to Scott's paper were highly negative.  She has said that when she first presented it at a seminar in 1985, the audience "were, to a man, appalled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|2008|p=1422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joanne Meyerowitz]] comments that an early critic accused Scott's paper of "nihilism, presentism, ahistoricism, obfuscation, elitism, obeisance to patriarchy, ethnocentrism, irrelevance, and possibly racism".&lt;ref name=Meyerowitz-1347/&gt;  Other critics were more positive.  [[Linda Kerber]] called the paper "dazzling",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kerber|1991|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; while William Sewell called it an "instant classic".&lt;ref name="Sewell 1990 71"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Scott's 1986 paper had a significantly longer-term impact than most.  It was reprinted in 1988 as part of ''Gender and the Politics of History'', a collection of Scott's essays on gender history, which was reissued in 1999 in a revised edition.  Scott herself has published two papers responding to it: "Unanswered Questions" in 2008 and "Gender: Still a Useful Category of Analysis?" in 2010.  Its impact is strong even outside of the English-speaking world; Lola Sanchez called the Spanish translation of the paper "one of the most important texts of the past twenty-five years" for feminist scholars in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanchez|2014|p=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Joanne Meyerowitz wrote that it had "no discernible date of expiration".&lt;ref name=Meyerowitz-1346&gt;{{harvnb|Meyerowitz|2008|p=1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By that time, it was required reading for "dozens of syllabi";&lt;ref name=Meyerowitz-1346/&gt; it was described as "canonical" by the American Historical Review;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Historical Review|2008|p=1344}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the most-accessed article in the history of the American Historical Review on JSTOR.&lt;ref name=Meyerowitz-1346/&gt; Meyerowitz credits the paper with a "significant part in the broader shift from social to cultural history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyerowitz|2008|p=1353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hominization''', also called '''anthropogenesis''', refers to the process of becoming human, and is used in somewhat different contexts in the fields of [[paleontology]] and [[paleoanthropology]], [[archeology]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].

==Paleontology==
{{main|Paleontology|Human evolution}}
{{As of | 2013}}, paleoanthropologists tend to regard the search for a precise point of hominization as somewhat irrelevant, seeing the process as gradual. [[Anatomically modern humans]] (AMH, or AMHS) developed within the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' about 200,000 years ago.  

Many thinkers have attempted to explain hominization - from Classical times through [[Hobbes]], [[Rousseau]], [[Hegel]], and [[Engels]], who wrote an essay on ''[[The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man]]''. The contemporary study of hominization in archeology often looks for signs that mark out human habitations from pre-human forms: for example, the use of [[grave goods]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1876/part-played-labour/index.htm The Part played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch09.htm [[Karl Marx]], ''Dialectics of nature'', Ch. 09]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and theology==
In ancient philosophy, "hominization" referred to the [[ensoulment]] of the human fetus. When the soul is said to enter the fetus at some time later than conception, this is sometimes called "delayed hominization", as in the Aristotelian belief in ensoulment 40 days after conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aquinas on Human Ensoulment, Abortion and the Value of Life|last1=[[John Joseph Haldane|Haldane]]|first1=John|last2=Lee|first2=Patrick|journal=Philosophy|volume=78|year=2003|pages=255–278|url=http://www2.franciscan.edu/plee/aquinas_on_human_ensoulment.htm|doi=10.1017/s0031819103000275|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127174317/http://www2.franciscan.edu/plee/aquinas_on_human_ensoulment.htm|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}. For a refutation of "[[Hominization#Theology|delayed hominization]]", see also [http://forums.catholic.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=9702&amp;d=1296001434 this article] by [[Benedict Ashley]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book2.html On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle, Book II]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of modern [[theistic evolution]], "hominization" refers to the theory that there was a point at which a population of [[hominid]]s who had (or may have) evolved by a process of [[evolution]] acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms.  This group might be restricted to [[Adam and Eve]], or indeed to [[Mitochondrial Eve]], although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which this occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical.  The term "[[special transformism]]" refers to theories of a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rahner|Rahner, Karl]], ''Encyclopedia of Theology: A Concise Sacramentum Mundi'', section "Hominization" by Karl Rahner in entry on "Evolution", pp. 484-488, 1975, Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0860120066}}, 9780860120063, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WtnR-6_PlJAC&amp;pg=PA486&amp;lpg=PA486&amp;dq=%22special+transformism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nFgR8tJhev&amp;sig=xjVcuBdnqeCqLgfL-PHAHJePodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BiC_UZP8C6ia1AXUm4CQDA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22special%20transformism%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the [[Abrahamic religions]], for which the belief that animals do not have souls but humans do is a core teaching.  Scientific accounts of the [[origin of the universe]], [[origin of life]] and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty (helped by the reluctance of science itself to say anything about what preceded the [[Big Bang]]) but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem.  Several 19th-century theologians attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics [[John Augustine Zahm]] and [[St. George Jackson Mivart]], but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps.&lt;ref&gt;The six leading examples are the subject of Artigas's book. Each of these has a chapter in Artigas: Léroy, Zahm, Bonomelli, Mivart, the English Bishop John Hedley, and Raffaello Caverni. All are also covered by Brundell.&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century thinking has tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Kung, 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{See also|Anthropomorphism}}
This term is used to describe the tendency to attribute ''human'' characteristics to entities that are other than human.  Example; "My dog's separation anxiety", etc.

[[File:Huang Binhong.JPG|thumb|Statue of Huang Binhong at the [[West Lake]] in [[Hangzhou]]]]

'''Huáng Bīnhóng''' ({{zh|t=黃賓虹}}; 1865-1955) was a Chinese [[literati painting|literati painter]] and [[art historian]] born in [[Jinhua]], [[Zhejiang]] province. His [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was [[She County, Anhui|She County]], [[Anhui]] province.&lt;ref name="Cihai"&gt;Cihai: Page 2056.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the grandson of artist Huang Fengliu. He would later be associated with [[Shanghai]] and finally [[Hangzhou]]. He is considered one of the last innovators in the literati style of painting and is noted for his freehand landscapes. His painting style showed the influence of the earlier painters Li Liufang (李流芳), [[Cheng Sui]] (程邃), [[Cheng Zhengkui]], and [[Kun Can]].

He also had significance for creating several societies devoted to painting and [[calligraphy]].

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right| The [[storming of the Bastille]], 14 July 1789, during the [[French Revolution]].]] 

This is a '''list of [[revolutions]] and [[rebellion]]s'''.
&lt;!-- It is not meant to include every instance of violent conflict. Do not add battles and wars which are unconnected to a revolution or rebellion. Do not add "revolutions" mandated from above. Do not add every riot and violent demonstration in the history of mankind, and do not accord recent events undue weight. Note: there is a section at the end, "Cultural, intellectual, philosophical and technological revolutions", which does list some significant events, phenomenae or trends which are not violent rebellions or revolutions.  That may be split off later.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3743">'''Memnon of Heraclea''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|m|n|ən}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Mέμνων}}, ''gen''.: Μέμνονος; fl. c. 1st century) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] historical writer, probably a native of [[Heraclea Pontica]]. He described the history of that city in a large work, known only through the '''''Excerpta of '''''[[Photius I of Constantinople|'''''Photius''''' (I of Constantinople)]], and describing especially the various [[tyrant]]s who had at times ruled Heraclea.

Memnon's history encompassed an unknown number of books, but Photius had read the ninth through the sixteenth, and made a tolerably copious abstract of that portion. The first eight books he had not read, and he speaks of other books after the sixteenth. The ninth book begins with an account of the tyrant [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus]], the disciple of [[Plato]] and [[Isocrates]]. The thirteenth book  contains a long account of the rise of Rome.  The last event mentioned in the sixteenth book was the death of Brithagoras, who was sent by the Heracleians as ambassador to [[Julius Caesar]], after the latter had obtained the supreme power (48 BC). 

From this [[Gerardus Vossius]] supposes that the work was written about the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] at the beginning of the 1st century AD; in the judgment of Orelli, not later than the time of [[Hadrian]] or the [[Antonines]], in the middle of the 2nd century; the ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'' thinks the 2nd century AD likely. It is, of course, impossible to fix the date with any precision, as we do not know at all down to what time the entire work was carried. The style of Memnon, according to Photius, was clear and simple, and the words well chosen. The Excerpta of Photius, however, contain numerous examples of rare and poetical expressions, as well as a few which indicate the decline of the Greek language. These Excerpta of Photius were first published separately, together with the remains of [[Ctesias]] and [[Agatharchides]] by [[Henry Estienne]], [[Paris]], 1557. The best edition is that by Johann Conrad Orelli, [[Leipzig]], 1816, containing, together with the remains of Memnon, a few fragments of other writers on Heraclea.

Memnon's history is valuable as a continuous account of nearly all the Hellenistic period, albeit a compressed one from a local vantage point. It is also valuable as the only reasonably complete example of the Greek historical genre of local history.

==Life and career==
Gross was born in [[Zagreb]] to Jewish parents, Mavro and Ella Gross, on 22 May 1922. During [[World War II]] and the occupation of [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Gross and her parents hid out near Zagreb in the village of [[Drenje Brdovečko]] until 1943, when they were arrested by the [[Nazi]]s. She and her mother were deported to the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] where they worked as forced laborers for "[[Siemens &amp; Halske|Siemens &amp; Halske AG]]" producing bombs. Her father was deported to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]. Gross's father and other members of her family perished during [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]; she and her mother, however, survived.&lt;ref&gt;Ruah Hadaša (Glasilo Židovske vjerske zajednice Bet Israel): Jasminka Domaš: ''Mirjam Gross (Zagreb 1922–2012)'': stranica 48, broj 20, godina V, 2012.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Devčić|first=Karmela|title=Grossovi: Bježali su od ustaša, oca su ubili nacisti, a Mirjana je preživjela logor|publisher=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=27 July  2012|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/kronika-obitelji-najvece-hrvatske-povjesnicarke--grossovi-/1043706/?keepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=600&amp;width=800|accessdate=4 March 2013|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SolarEclipse BC 1335-03-13.gif|thumb|right|200px|The eclipse of 1335]]
The [[solar eclipse]] mentioned in a text dating to the reign of [[Mursili II]] could be of great importance for the absolute chronology of the [[Hittite Empire]] within the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. The text records that in the tenth year of Mursili's reign, "the Sun gave a sign" (''{{lang|hit|istanus sakiyahta}}''), just as the king was about to launch a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Azzi-Hayasa]] in north-eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;KUB XIV 4.24: [''ma-a-an I-NA'' KUR ''A'']''zi-ma i-ia-ah-at nu'' &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;[[Shamash|UTU]]''-us sa-ki-ya-ah-ta'' "[When] I marched [to the land of A]zzi, the Sungod gave a sign." Theo P. J. Van Den Hout, ''The Purity of Kingship: An Edition of CTH 569 and Related Hittite Oracle Inquiries of Tutẖaliya'' (1998),  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7DTPyG4VvpcC&amp;pg=PA42  42f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference in the annals was first interpreted as describing an eclipse by [[Emil Forrer]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;E. Forrer,  ''Forschungen II'' 1.1 "Astronomische Festlegung des Soppiluljomas, Morsilis und Amenophis IV." (1926) KUB XIV,4 (= CTH 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Schorr (1928) identified it as the  eclipse the  of 13 March 1335 BC, visible as [[annular eclipse|annular]] in Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomische Abhandlungen''  8-9 (1929), p. 16. ''Mitteilungen des Instituts für Orientforschung  6 (1958), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now more commonly identified as the one of 24 June 1312, which was visible in [[total eclipse|totality]] in northern Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998){{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Åström]] (1993) proposes the alternative date of 13 April 1308, which would have been visible as partial eclipse at sunrise. [[Peter J. Huber]] has suggested a date of 8 January 1339 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Huber, The Solar Omen of Muršili II,  Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 121, no. 4, pp. 640-644, (Oct. - Dec., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1312 eclipse==
The 1312 eclipse occurred over northern Anatolia in the early afternoon, and its effects would have been quite spectacular for Mursili and his men on campaign:
:24 June 1312 BC, total eclipse, maximum at 10:44 UTC, {{coord|38.2|N|13.7|E}} ([[Sicily]]) and lasted 2 min 48 sec, some stated as it occurred inside the [[Ionian Sea]] at 17 E.

Areas that were inside the maximum eclipse included the islands that are now Barlavento in [[Cape Verde]], the Moorish lands (comprising modern day [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]), [[Tunisia]] (then inner Africa), [[Greece]], the [[Caucasus]] region, Persia (now Iran), in the area of the present-day Iranian-Turkmeni border, present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and a part of the north of [[India]].

The eclipse started off in modern-day [[Brazil]] in South America and finished in what is now [[Myanmar]] (also known as [[Burma]]).

The 1312 date would imply that Mursili began his reign in either 1322 or 1321 BC. This date would be roughly that usually proposed for the death of [[Tutankhamun]]. It is known that [[Suppiluliuma I]] was besieging [[Carchemish]] when he received a letter from the widow of a [[Pharaoh]] (who is called [[Dakhamunzu]] in the annals). Suppiluliuma died shortly thereafter and his successor was Mursili II (whose brother would have been Prince [[Zannanza]] sent to Egypt where he died). Thus this appears to be a chronological anchor. However, there are other views, asserting for example that the dead Pharaoh was [[Akhenaten]] or that Tutankhamun died later.

==1308 eclipse==
In contrast, the 1308 eclipse was annular, and began very early in the morning over [[Arabia]] (and only [[penumbral]] over Anatolia and Syria), reaching its height over [[Central Asia]]:
:13 April 1308 BC, annular eclipse (94.8%), maximum at 04:16 UTC, {{coord|44.9|N|85.7|E}} ([[Tian Shan]]) and lasted 4 min 40 sec.

Other areas that had inside the band of the annular eclipse included the [[Indus River|Indus Delta]] and parts of [[Siberia]] including the [[New Siberian Islands]]. The maximum eclipse ended at sunset over the [[Beaufort Sea]] along with the [[Bering Sea]] and the westernmost portion of [[Alaska]] with the west of the [[Aleutian Islands]].  The eclipse covered much of Asia except for the southwesternmost portions and the southeastern islands, one of the islands that was near the edge of the eclipse was [[Honshū]], Japan.

'''Nicolas "Nic" Rasmussen''' (1962—) is a historian of modern [[List of life sciences|life sciences]], and a professor in the School of Humanities and Languages at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/about-us/people/nicolas-rasmussen University of New South Wales: Faculty of Arts And Social Sciences: School of Humanities and Languages: People: Professor Nicolas Rasmussen.]&lt;/ref&gt;

With major interests in the [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines|history of amphetamines]], the [[Substance abuse|history of drug abuse]], and the [[Clinical trial|history of clinical trials]], he has higher degrees in [[history and philosophy of science]], [[developmental biology]], and [[public health]].

== Early life ==
Born in Paris in 1962 of American parents – computer scientist [[Norman L. Rasmussen]] (1928—2003), later director of [[Cambridge Scientific Center|IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center]], and an important contributor to the development of [[History of CP/CMS|time-sharing operating systems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://smartphonestechnologyandbusinessapps.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/rip-ibm-cambridge-scientific-center.html "RIP, IBM Cambridge Scientific Center, 1992; and Founder Norman Rasmussen, 2003", ''Smart Phones: Technology and Business Apps'', (31 July 2011).]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laura Sootin Rasmussen]] (1933—), later an organiser and officer of the [[National Organization for Women]] in New England&lt;ref&gt;She was also the sometime editor and publisher of the monthly women's rights newsletter called ''The New Broom''

(see [https://archive.org/stream/smithcat5455smit#page/n55/mode/1up ''Smith College Bulletin'' (1954–1955), p.55]; [http://saq.smith.edu/i/516927-fall-1954/64 ’54: ''Smith Alumnae Quarterly'', (Fall 1954) p.63]; [http://saq.smith.edu/i/516879-summer-1957/63 ’54: ''Smith Alumnae Quarterly'', (August 1957), p.262]; [http://saq.smith.edu/i/513354-february-1972/54 ’54: ''Smith Alumnae Quarterly'', (February 1972), p.53]; [http://saq.smith.edu/i/513333-november-1973/51 '54: ''Smith Alumnae Quarterly'', (November 1973) p.50]; and [http://saq.smith.edu/i/512517-november-1976/52 '54: ''Smith Alumnae Quarterly'', (November 1976) p.51])&lt;/ref&gt; – he attended the [[Roxbury Latin School]], near Boston, in Massachusetts.

== Education ==
Having worked in biology research labs since his early teens, Rasmussen's undergraduate exposure to art history and theory spurred an interest in history and philosophy of science; and, as a consequence, he enrolled in a PhD program in Philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]] to pursue this field.  He worked there with [[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] for two years; and, after taking a master's degree, he went on to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to study history of biology with [[Nick Jardine]] in the M.Phil. program in History and Philosophy of Science.

Then, in 1987 he took up a PhD scholarship in Biological Sciences at [[Stanford University]]; and, while pursuing doctoral research in plant developmental biology under Paul B. Green, he also continued working in history of science with Tim Lenoir.

In 2007, to allow him to become more involved in health policy scholarship, he took a master's degree in Public Health at University of Sydney Medical School.

== Career ==
After postdoctoral training in history of science at Stanford and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] – and short term teaching positions in the field at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] – he moved to a teaching position in history and philosophy of science at Sydney University (1994—1997) and, then, to the [[University of New South Wales]] in Sydney, where he is now a Professor.

== Research ==
His research has dealt with the role of [[instrumentation]] in shaping scientific knowledge; the [[history of biotechnology]], [[molecular biology]] and its [[History of molecular biology|cultural and intellectual history]]; the history of [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]] and [[Drug development|pharmaceuticals]] in the United States since 1900; and the [[Medical research#The influence of funding on research and the management of conflicts of interests|influence of industry sponsorship on biomedical research]].

He is best known for his focus on the ways in which experimental methods and technology can shape research disciplines, sociologically and intellectually, and on the related role of patronage in shaping scientific fields in the mid-20th century USA.&lt;ref&gt;Whilst Rasmussen's approach is sometimes identified with [[historical materialism]], in his works, Rasmussen stresses that its basis is in the [[pragmatism]] of [[John Dewey]].&lt;/ref&gt; He has been principal investigator on several [[National Science Foundation]] (US) and [[Australian Research Council]] grants.

== Works ==
His first book, ''Picture Control: The Electron Microscope and the Transformation of Biology in America, 1940–1960 (1998)'', won both the ''[[:de:Paul-Bunge-Preis|Paul Bunge Prize for 1999]]'', and the ''Forum for the History of Science in America's Book Prize for 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-sci-med-tech&amp;month=0104&amp;week=b&amp;msg=gQnyyS1mKbNIgWLxW4kMiQ&amp;user=&amp;pw= Reeds, K., ''Forum for the History of Science in America Prize'', (10 April 2001)]; the ''Forum for the History of Science in America'', founded in 1986, was formally acknowledged as an "Interest Group" of the ''[[History of Science Society]]'' in 1988 (see [http://americanscience.blogspot.com.au/p/about-fhsa.html "About the FHSA", AmericanScience].)&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book, ''On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine (2008)'', is a widely cited history of the [[amphetamines]] in medicine and American culture.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Alexander Zaitchik|Zaitichik, A.]], [http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-speed-of-hypocrisy-how-america-got-hooked-on-legal-meth "The Speed of Hypocrisy: How America Got Hooked on Legal Meth", ''Motherboard'', (30 June 2014).]: "Anyone seeking to understand the treachery behind today's medical-industrial ADHD complex should begin with Nicolas Rasmussen's essential history, ''On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine''. Rasmussen, a science historian at the University of South Wales, tells a story that ought to inform every media treatment of the subject, but never does."&lt;/ref&gt;

His third book, ''Gene Jockeys: Life Science and the Rise of Biotech Enterprise (2014)'', was [[Short list|shortlisted]] in the "basis of medicine category" of the 2015 [[British Medical Association]]'s Medical Book Awards, and was highly commended by the judging panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/bma-library/medical-book-awards/medical-book-awards-winners-by-category British Medical Association 2015 Book Awards: List of Medical Book Award Winners by Category (3 September 2015).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607183517/http://bma.org.uk/about-the-bma/bma-library/medical-book-awards/medical-book-awards-winners-by-category |date=7 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The place was once a heavily fortified [[Kāti Māmoe|Ngāti Māmoe]] [[Pā (Māori)|pā]].  Approximately 300 years ago, it was overtaken by Te Rakiwhakaputa of [[Ngāi Tahu]]. After the pā's capture, Manuhiri, son of Te Rakiwhakaputa, resided here, fathering many sons and one daughter after whom the pā is named.&lt;ref name="christchurchcitylibraries.com" /&gt;

===Establishment and early owners===
The first European owner of the land was Christopher Alderson Calvert (1811–1883), a lawyer practicing in Lyttelton and Christchurch who purchased the land in 1852.&lt;ref name=WarrenP9&gt;Warren, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
He had a one-room cottage designed by Benjamin J. Mountfort and built in Lyttelton before it was transported in sections by boat and carried up to the site.&lt;ref name=WarrenP9/&gt;
He named the cottage ''Rosemary Cottage'' after one of [[George Selwyn (Bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]]'s daughters. On consulting local Maori about a name for the property, they suggested and he was delighted to adopt the name, Ohinetahi.&lt;ref name=WarrenP9/&gt;
Four subsequent owners followed in a short period of time before William Sefton Moorhouse purchased the property in the mid-1850s. Moorhouse then built a more substantial building either by adding rooms onto each end of the existing cottage or more likely by replacing it with an entirely new house.&lt;ref name=peoplesnetworknz.info/&gt;&lt;ref name=WarrenP10&gt;Warren, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moorhouse sold the entire 255-acre property to [[Thomas Potts]] in 1858.&lt;ref name=WarrenP10/&gt; Potts proceeded to buy more of the surrounding land until the property covered 572 acres, reaching as far as the seashore at Governors Bay, along the main road as well as Quail island. Between 1863 and 1867 Potts pulled the existing house apart and built a three-story sandstone structure between the two wooden halves.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Vine2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/lifestyle/travel/76751/architect-set-loose-garden?slide=3|title=Architect set loose in garden |last=Vine |first= Gillian |date= 6 October 2009 |work=odt.co.nz |publisher= Otago Daily Times |accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Potts, one of New Zealand's earliest conservationists, established in 1865 a large garden on the property which as well as a vegetable garden and orchard included trees such as araucarias, ashes, blue gums, Lombardy poplars, New World conifers, oaks, sycamores and walnuts.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gardenstovisit.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gardenstovisit.co.nz/garden.aspx?gardenid=40 |title= Ohinetahi |year=2010|publisher=Gardens to Visit |accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="sisley.co.uk" /&gt; The variety of exotic trees and shrubs that Potts selected were on the advice of a friend at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Garden]].&lt;ref name=peoplesnetworknz.info&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chchkete.peoplesnetworknz.info/site/topics/show/22-ohinetahi |title= Topic: Ohinetahi |date=28 April 2008 |work= peoplesnetworknz.info |accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pott's four hectare garden included a quince and variegated elm that still survive.&lt;ref name=Vine2009/&gt; After his death in 1888, the garden was left untended until it was mostly just a lawn around the house. 

The 572-acre property was then sold in 1896 to William Cook, who sold off several acres and the property was once again subdivided when Cook died with a Mr Beckett and a Mr Stewart buying the property which contained the house. They, in turn, sold off parts until in 1946 the house and the surrounding 9 acres was purchased by Basil Quaife. Quaife subsequently sold this property in 1952 to Herbert Ensor.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miles Warren, John and Pauline Trengrove===
Deciding in the mid-1970s that they would like to create a large garden together John and Pauline Trengrove and Pauline's brother Miles Warren began looking for a suitable site. After a number of setbacks, Miles Warren heard that Ohinetahi was for sale by its current owners Mr and Mrs Herbert Ensor, who would be remaining on an adjacent property. They subsequently bought it for $100,000, financing the purchase by selling other properties. During the period between purchase and possession, the three new owners embarked on a six-week tour of gardens in England in a search for ideas to include in their proposed garden. Among the gardens visited were Sissinghurst, Wilton House and Hidcote Manor. 
First they restored the large stone colonial villa.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=  http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/guide/Christchurch+and+Canterbury/Sights/47047|title= Ohinetahi |publisher= [[USA Today]] Travel |accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work commenced on creating the present garden in 1977. 

After about ten years John and Pauline decided to build a new house and create a garden on 10 acres of land at Ohoka. To fund their new project Warren purchased their share of the property to become Ohinetahi's sole owner.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years two small art galleries, as well as a cottage for the housekeeper, were constructed on the property. One gallery contains works by prominent New Zealand artists including Shane Cotton, Julian Dashper, Pat Hanly, Ralph Hotere, Richard McWhannell and Peter Robinson. The other gallery contains 3D models and architectural photographs building projects undertaken by the architectural firm of Warren &amp; Mahoney.

The main house was badly damaged by the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake|4 September 2010 Christchurch earthquake]]&lt;ref name= "NZHerald2010"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10671386 |title= Historic buildings need expert help|date= 6 September 2010|publisher= [[New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone walls of the three storey block were badly cracked and the four gables fell. As a result, it was decided to reduce the central block of the house from three to two stories, while at the same time the house was earthquake strengthened and given a strengthened masonry ground floor and a new timber-framed first floor. While the structure of the art gallery was undamaged the Oamaru stone exterior was badly cracked and had to be rebuilt, only to then be damaged again by the February 2011 earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, pages 110 to 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mrs Esnor died in 2008 Warren was able to purchase from her heirs a 0.76-hectare strip of land which allowed Ohinetahi to be expanded towards the harbour side.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Terraces were constructed on this land using stone removed from the upper storey of the house when it was restored after the earthquake.

In recent times a number of large modern sculptures by renowned New Zealand artists have been installed in both the park and garden.

The housekeeper's cottage has been converted to a tearoom.

In 2012 Miles Warren gifted the homestead and gardens as well as an endowment to the Ohinetahi Charitable Trust to ensure that the property and its contents are preserved for the benefit of the public.&lt;ref name="Listener2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacFie|first=Rebecca|title=The Constant Gardener|journal=Listener|date=15 December 2012|volume=236|issue=3788|pages=22–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In early February 2017 a major [[2017 Port Hills fires|fire]] on the Ports Hills which required the excavation of 107 local residents came within 300 to 400 metres of the house coating the property with falling ash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=  |first=  |title= Christchurch fire nears Ohinetahi homestead, Sir Miles Warren refuses to leave | publisher= Stuff |date= 16 February 2017 |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11801689 |accessdate= 16 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pavelló de la República Library joined what is now the UB’s Learning and Research Resources Centre (CRAI) in 1996. It has since grown to become one of the world’s leading archival libraries on subjects such as the Second Spanish Republic, the [[Spanish Civil War]], exile, the Franco regime and Spain’s transition to democracy. In addition, the library has important materials on the Soviet Bloc and on the international political history of the twentieth history, particularly the [[World War II]].

== Context ==
[[File:Pabelló República.png|thumb|left|Ubication of the building in Paris]]
In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the government of the Republic participated in the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la vie moderne, popularly known as the Paris International Exhibition of 1937. The civil war in Spain was experiencing a change in project conception, incialment even more excitement to the technical developments in different countries, and the Spanish Pavilion becomes an evidence of the tragic political situation country: "the character that owes tener the spanish Section of the Exhibition (...) can and should be accounted the present moment and the wonderful village esfuerzo spanish defender for its independence and the cause of peace in the world."

The exhibition lasted from 25 May until 25 November 1937. The Pavilion was opened but not until July 12. Was located at Avenida del Trocadero near the pavilions of Germany and the Soviet Union.

The project architect was the philosopher Jose Gaos, curator of the flag, the painter Josep Renau and writer Max Aub who organized the contents of the exhibition pavilion and commissioned the construction of the building to [[Josep Maria Sert]] and [[Luis Lacasa]].

Audiovisual production was by [[Luis Buñuel]], appointed coordinator of the Propaganda the Information Service at the Embassy in Paris.

== The building ==
The building of the Pavilion of the Republic, was conceived by its architect Josep Lluis Sert and Luis Lacasa as an empty container, almost three floors and walls. He left the floor open courtyard that communicated with, covered with a tarp, was the role of audience.

On the first floor, devoted to propaganda and information on the situation of the country at war, it was accessed by a stairway and the second aimed at the arts and popular sections, where the large mural by Joan Miró , the Catalan peasant (now disappeared), it was accessed by a ramp, although there was a vertical access to the interior of the structure.

It was built with a limitation of time and materials, many prefabricated panels and plywood, or synthetic, and adapting the plan to build an irregular terrain, slope and with the obligation to respect the trees in allocated land. It had an area of 1,400 square meters.

It took a sober building that followed the lines of rational architecture despite its ephemeral nature. So basically acquired a cultural and propaganda to let the world know the situation unfolding in Spain, precisely define the objectives of government and emphasized the heroic struggle of the Spanish people.

Inside (front and acting as a gigantic panel exhibitor), they exhibited posters, photographs, photomontages, proclamations, information panels, as well as art and craft, sent directly from Spanish central and regional governments and various unions. Much of the exhibits sought to proclaim to the public the situation was before and after the Spanish Republic, and the war situation.

One of its main attractions was the famous Guernica by Pablo Picasso, located in one wall of the central courtyard where the Mercury Fountain, made by Alexander Calder.

=== The building now ===
[[File:Pavelló escales.JPG|thumb|Main entrance]]
With the Olympic Games of 1992, the City Council commended the architects Antonio Ubach, Juan Miguel Hernandez and Miguel Espinet Leon carrying a replica of the Pavilion of the Republic that had been presented at the International Exhibition of Paris of 1937 and was destroyed in the end.

Today, this landmark building, given since 1994, the City Council at the University of Barcelona, is occupied by CRAI Library Hall of the Republic, which has one of the most important collection in the world on Second Republic Civil War, Francoism, Transition and exile in Spain, especially in Catalonia and the International Centre for Historical Studies, founded by Jaume Vicens Vives.

A reproduction of Picasso's famous Guernica can be seen, as was its original location, on a wall of the open courtyard of the pavilion.

Unlike the [[North America]]n or [[Japan]]ese products which have large, globally renowned organisations such as [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] or [[Impact Wrestling]] with several hundred smaller [[professional wrestling promotion|promotions]], Australia only has approximately 30 smaller [[independent circuit]] promotions which exist in all but one of the states and territories, that being the [[Northern Territory]]. Tours from the North American product are regularly sold out in capital cities such as [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Brisbane]].

==History==
Professional wrestling in Australia first gained distinction in the early 1900s, however there were very few shows promoted. Nonetheless, stars such as [[Clarence Weber]], [[Jack Carkeek]], [[Clarence Whistler]] and [[Georg Hackenschmidt]] toured the country. As time went on, the sport's popularity began to grow, particularly in the 1930s as people sought to find relief from [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]].

Throughout the 1940s professional wrestling suffered due to [[World War II]] but in the 1950s it reached new highs as many stars from overseas were imported and created larger crowds and, in turn, a larger market. Established names such as [[Lou Thesz]], [[Dr. Jerry Graham]] and [[Gorgeous George]] toured the country during the decade.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Australia established its only major [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] in [[WCW Australia]]. WCW had a television deal with the [[Nine Network]], the first in Australia to do so and attracted crowds between 2,000 and 9,000 people on a weekly basis. International stars such as [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], [[Dominic Denucci]], [[Mario Milano]], [[Spiros Arion]], [[Karl Gotch]], [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Gorilla Monsoon]] and local stars Ron Miller and [[Larry O'Dea]] were all involved with the promotion which grew steadily through the 1960s and was a well known product in the 1970s. However, with the introduction of [[World Series Cricket]], WCW was left with no television deal and was forced to close down in 1978. This sent the Australian market into a large decline. With no access to any product anywhere in the world, the Australian market was almost dead until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] became a prominent figure in professional wrestling in the mid-1980s.

Australia has depended on the [[North America]]n product since 1985. Hosting tours in 1985 and 1986 kept a solid viewing in the sport through programmes such as ''Superstars of Wrestling'' and ''Saturday Night's Main Event''. Small local promotions have tried to take advantage of the popularity of professional wrestling in more recent times, but there has been nothing of note since the demise of World Championship Wrestling in 1978.

However the local scene has been the subject of controversy.

In September 2002, a promotion called PCW presented a show called ''Carnage'', in which two wrestlers faced off in the first-ever barbed-wire match in [[Australia]]. The event was billed as a "Great Family Night Out", however before the bout an announcer warned parents to take their children from the Rowville arena if they were upset by blood.&lt;ref&gt;From the video of the event - now a collector's item.&lt;/ref&gt;

The match saw real blood, fake glass and one contestant setting fire to a chair. The ring ropes were replaced with barbed wire and a bucket of thumb tacks was dumped on the ring floor. Much of the controversy surrounded rumours about the event, suggesting that the outpour of blood was so intense that it 'splattered' onto members of the crowd. Much of this can be attributed to people who had heard about the match giving their take of it on the Internet.

Despite the fact that this event was publicised as having a gory match and the preceding warning, people complained that the match in question was 'too much'. A concerned mother called Melbourne Talkback radio station [[3AW]], and a wrestler heard this call and also rang in. This resulted in the main media outlets covering the story. For the record, neither of the wrestlers were seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Television coverage by the [[Nine Network]] at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; It also resulted in a police investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Age|Melbourne Age]] newspaper 12 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and a furore within the local [[Knox City Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne [[Herald Sun]] newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian wrestlers overseas==
Individual wrestlers originating in [[Australia]] have struggled for the most part to obtain any international recognition. Perhaps the two biggest names when one mentions Australia are the Fabulous Kangaroos - [[Roy Heffernan]] and [[Al Costello]]. They are the only Australian wrestlers to [[celebrity|make it big]] in the [[United States]] and held the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|Florida]] and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Texas version)|Texas]] versions of the NWA World Tag Team titles as well as the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship|north east version]] of the NWA United States tag team titles in the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (later to become [[WWE]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; on three occasions, as well as being inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwi-online.com/pages/hallofame.html|title=Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame|website=www.pwi-online.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian wrestler [[Peter Stilsbury]] was brought into the WWF in the mid-1980s under the name Outback Jack in response to the mainstream popularity at the time of the Australian film ''[["Crocodile" Dundee|Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=339–340|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|author2=Blade Braxton |isbn=1-55022-762-9|title=The Wrestlecrap Book of Lists!}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in several vignettes hyping his debut by showing Jack in the wilds of the Australian Outback, drinking beer with cows,&lt;ref name=wcrp&gt;{{cite book|page=34|first=R.D.|last=Reynolds|title=WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|isbn=1-55022-584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came down to the ring to the theme song by [[Rolf Harris]], "Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=WWF Television|title=WWF Superstars of Wrestling|episodelink=WWF Superstars of Wrestling|network=[[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]]|location=[[Tampa, Florida]]|airdate=7 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outback Jack started his career touring in [[Canada]] with Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling.

In more recent times [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] made two WWE appearances in 2003 at [[WrestleMania XIX]]&lt;ref&gt;Jones was originally meant to team with [[The Undertaker]] but was ([[kayfabe]]) beaten down by their opponents before the match. Jones appeared later in the match.&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2003/results/|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; later that same year even though he only actually wrestled at the latter event, making him the first Australian wrestler to ever perform on a WWE [[pay-per-view]] event. Jones also performed on two [[World Wrestling All-Stars]] pay-per-views, losing to [[Jeff Jarrett]] at [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Inception|WWA: The Inception]] and to [[Scott Steiner]] at [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Eruption|WWA: The Eruption]].&lt;ref name="Eruption source"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2002/articles/1018738939.php|title=WWA The Eruption results|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230554/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2002/articles/1018738939.php|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, [[WWE]] signed an Australian female wrestler [[Emma (wrestler)|Tenille Dashwood]] to its development territory [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. She was originally from [[Melbourne]]. Dashwood debuted as a clumsy dancer Emma, and in early 2014 was elevated to the main roster. On 6 April 2014 she became only the second Australian wrestler to perform on a WWE pay per view and the first ever woman to do so when she was a part of the Diva's Title match at [[WrestleMania XXX]]. She later appeared at the 2014 [[Survivor Series]] in November. In 2017 she became the first Australian to perform at three WWE pay per view events when she was part of the fatal five way for the [[Raw Women's Championship]] at [[No Mercy (2017)|No Mercy]]. She made it four at [[TLC (2017)|TLC]] in opposition to [[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]].

In early 2013, WWE signed another Australian wrestler [[Buddy Murphy]], known in Australia as Matt Silva to [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. Murphy made his televised debut on NXT 15 May 2014, teaming with Elias Samson in a losing effort against The Ascension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/2014-05-15/results-26304217|title=WWE NXT: May 15, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Murphy began teaming with American Wesley Blake and in January 2015, Murphy and Blake scored an upset victory over the Vaudevillains and the following week defeated the [[Lucha Dragons]] to win the [[NXT Tag Team Championship]], making Murphy the first Australian to hold a championship within the WWE.&lt;ref name=spoilernxttag&gt;{{cite web|title=NXT News: Next live special announced, full spoiler results from Thursday's NXT TV tapings|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_82772.shtml|website=PWTorch.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2018 Murphy joined the Cruiserweight division and participated in the Cruiserweight title tournament losing to [[Mustafa Ali]] in the quarter finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-205-live/2018-03-06/article/mustafa-ali-def-buddy-murphy|title=Mustafa Ali def. Buddy Murphy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon become a top contender to the new champion [[Cedric Alexander]], and he managed to defeat Alexander at [[WWE Super Show-Down]] in his main roster pay-per-view debut in his home town [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]] to win the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-super-show-down/2018-10-06/cedric-alexander-buddy-murphy-results|title=Buddy Murphy lays claim to the WWE Cruiserweight Championship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, WWE signed both [[Billie Kay]] and [[Peyton Royce]] to NXT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/wwe-performance-center-welcomes-new-class-of-recruits|title=WWE Performance Center welcomes new class of recruits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair later formed the team [[The IIconics]] under their original name of The Iconic Duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/iconic-duo-campaign-nxt-year-end-awards-2017-votes?sf179037009=1|title=The Iconic Duo hit the campaign trail in search of NXT Year-End Award votes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They were elevated to the main roster on the SmackDown brand just after [[WrestleMania 34]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/videos/billie-kay-and-peyton-royce-attack-charlotte-flair-smackdown-live-april-10-2018|title=NXT's Billie Kay and Peyton Royce make their debut by attacking SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made their main roster pay per view debut at [[WWE Super Show-Down]] with a victory over the team of [[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-super-show-down/2018-10-06/asuka-naomi-the-iiconics-results|title=The IIconics battle Asuka &amp; Naomi in homecoming clash|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Rhea Ripley]] joined WWE and participated in the [[Mae Young Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/more-sports/rhea-ripley-is-chasing-dreams-in-the-wwe/news-story/270342aea181dc22286f10480119f063|title=Meet Australia’s next WWE star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adelaide based wrestler known locally as Demi Bennett would go on to participate in the second Mae Young Classic in 2018, but at TV tapings in [[Birmingham, England]] Ripley became the first Australian woman to win a WWE controlled title when she defeated fellow Australian [[Toni Storm]] in a tournament final to be the inaugural winner of the WWE UK Women's Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-crowns-first-nxt-uk-womens-champion-tv-tapings-264651|title=WWE crowns first NXT UK Women's Champion at TV tapings|date=26 August 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two other Australian wrestlers have appeared on a worldwide pay-per-view event to date at all. They are Chuck E. Chaos at ''[[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Eruption|WWA: The Eruption]]''&lt;ref name="Eruption source"/&gt; who lost to [[Jerry Lynn]], and [[Mark Mercedes]] at [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Reckoning|WWA: The Reckoning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003/articles/1053920249.php|title=WWA The Reckoning results|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095657/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2003/articles/1053920249.php|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lost to [[Rick Steiner]].

==Foreign tours==
[[File:Triple H Entrance Sequence Melbourne 10.11.2007.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Sequence showing [[Triple H]] performing his ring entrance pose at the [[Rod Laver Arena]] in [[Melbourne]] during the November 2007 [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] tour]]

Shows from North American promotions have been held in Australia as early as 1985 when WWE toured through [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and through Melbourne and Brisbane again in 1986. That was the last Australia saw of a live North American product until [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] did a ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' and ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' taping in Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling.net.au/articles/pages/aussie/article54.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913231435/http://www.wrestling.net.au/articles/pages/aussie/article54.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-09-13|title="TV Nitro to hit town"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' taping in Brisbane and a ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' taping and a house show in Sydney in 2000.

The next time WWE came to Australia was for the ''WWE Global Warning Tour'' in 2002 for what was the first WWE event in Australia in 16 years. The tour drew 56,734 people in [[Docklands Stadium]], Melbourne; it featured nine matches, where in the main event [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] defeated [[Triple H]] and [[Brock Lesnar]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] to retain the [[WWE Championship|WWE Undisputed Championship]].  ''Global Warning'' did not air on [[pay-per-view]], but was released on home video. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/118-daily-updates/42664-thurs-update-more-from-nxt-takeover-samoa-joe-deal-notes-what-tna-talent-has-been-told-white-predicts-2-million-buys-for-rousey-vs-cyborg-lawler-angle-|title=THURS.

WWE's NXT brand made its first tour in 2016. In October 2018, Global Warning was added to the on demand list on [[WWE Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/120741/wwe-network-adds-previous-australian-stadium-event.html?p=1|title=WWE NETWORK ADDS PREVIOUS AUSTRALIAN STADIUM EVENT - PWInsider.com|website=pwinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 WWE announced [[WWE Super Show-Down]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] - the first ever WWE pay per view to be held in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwe-super-show-down|title=WWE Super Show-Down|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[I-Generation Superstars of Wrestling]] held a pay-per-view in Sydney headlined "Rodman Down Under" where Dennis Rodman would lose to [[Curt Hennig]] with the i-Generation Championship being contested.

Australia also hosted shows presented by [[World Wrestling All-Stars]], including two pay per views - [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Inception|Inception]] in Sydney and [[List of WWA pay-per-view events#The Eruption|Eruption]] in Melbourne. In 2016, [[House of Hardcore]] presented House Of Hardcore 15 in Melbourne. Various smaller shows have featured overseas talent, but nothing else of note.

==Television programming==

===History===
Throughout the 1990s, both ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' were broadcast pay television networks with [[WCW Monday Nitro]] on TNT and [[WWE Raw]] on Fox Sports . WWE's major [[pay-per-view]]s [[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[King of the Ring]], [[SummerSlam]] and [[Survivor Series]] began to be shown on pay-per-view by the late 1990s.

In September 2002 negotiations between [[FOX8]] and WWE fell through and ''SmackDown!'' was cancelled. A special [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|NWA-TNA]] package replaced it in early 2003 but only lasted a year. NWA-TNA pay-per-views were shown once a month throughout 2003 during a time when they were being presented weekly in the [[United States]]. WWE pay-per-views were also lost to [[Main Event]] in the same deal that cost Australian fans SmackDown. [[Village Roadshow|Village Cinemas]] showed them for a few months until August 2003 when ''SmackDown!'' returned on Saturday nights as well as the pay-per-views, starting with [[SummerSlam]]. ''RAW'' was moved from [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] to FOX8 and was shown on Friday nights. In order to prevent spoiler hunting on the internet, FOX8 moved WWE programming to timeslots closer to their United States air date.

In February 2005, ''[[WWE Heat]]'', ''[[WWE Velocity]]'' and ''[[The WWE Experience]]'' were added to Fox8 and set up a large wrestling program on Saturdays and Sundays. Despite ''Heat'', ''Velocity'' and ''Experience'' all being cancelled in the [[United States]] the shows continued to be shown in Australia to fulfill contractual obligations. When ''SmackDown!'' was moved to Friday nights in the United States, in Australia it remained on Friday afternoons. ''[[ECW on Syfy|ECW on Sci Fi]] '' began broadcasting in Australia from 2 September 2006 in the place of ''[[WWE Velocity]]'' on Saturdays and the [[WWE Fanatic Series]] began airing in October 2006.

RAW has been airing in Australia on [[Fox8]] since late 2003 on tape delay. But it start airing RAW live on 4 February 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/01/wwe-raw-goes-live-on-fox8.html|title=WWE Raw goes Live on FOX8|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=2014-01-23|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After just over 3 years, TNA made its return. Beginning with ''[[TNA Sacrifice#2006|TNA Sacrifice 2006]]'' on 27 May 2006 on tape delay. This continued for 12 months before events started being broadcast live in May 2007. ''[[TNA Impact!]]'' began airing on 5 April 2008 on [[Fox8]]. [[TNA Impact]] had been airing on Saturday nights on [[Fuel TV (Australia)|Fuel TV]] at 8.30pm AEST from June 2011, but this ceased in November 2014 when Fuel was absorbed by Fox Sports. For the remainder of 2014 and into 2015 it was shown on Main Event free of the usual charges, until 27 June 2015.&lt;ref name="mainevent.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainevent.com.au/news/239/tna-final-episode-airs-on-main-event-27-june-2015.aspx|title=TNA final episode airs on MAIN EVENT - 27 June 2015 - MAIN EVENT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free to air wrestling programming has been scarce on Australian television in recent times. However, with the conversion to Digital Television, several wrestling programs were purchased. In June 2008, [[WWE After Burn]] aired on Channel 9 on Sunday afternoon. However, it later aired at 1am on Tuesday mornings. [[TNA Xplosion]] began airing on [[One HD]] in prime time at 8:30pm on Thursday but by late 2010 it had been replaced in effect by the WWE Experience. 

A cut down, one hour version of WWE Raw and SmackDown Live now air on [[Nine Network]]'s [[9Go!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/worldwide/article/wwe-nine-network-broadcast-agreement-announcement|title=WWE, Nine Network reach broadcast agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay-per-view===
&lt;!--Please do not add lists of dates for pay-per-views in Australia as compared to when they air in North America. Any pay-per-views that are upcoming are listed on the Main Event article.--&gt;
&lt;!--Please do not specify a date for the commencement of WWF/E and/or WCW pay per views without a verifiable source--&gt;
[[Pay-per-view]]s in Australia are shown on [[Main Event]], the only provider in Australia. Main Event has been broadcasting pay-per-views for both [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] starting from the late 1990s until the present time (including the Fanatic Series from 2006) and [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] pay-per-views from around the same time until they were bought out in March 2001. Main Event also began broadcasting [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] pay-per-views in May 2006, starting with [[TNA Sacrifice#2006|Sacrifice]]. One year later, TNA pay per views were lifted from the 13-day tape delay format to a live format. This ceased after the transmission of [[Slammiversary (2015)|Slammiversary]] on 29 June 2015.&lt;ref name="mainevent.com.au"/&gt;

The '''Saltire Society Literary Awards''' are made annually by the [[Saltire Society]]. The awards seek to recognise books which are either by "living authors of Scottish descent or residing in Scotland," or which deal with "the work or life of a Scot or with a Scottish question, event or situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/awards/ |title=Awards |publisher=Saltire Society |accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards have been described as "the premiere prize for writing by Scots or about Scotland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Welsh a surprise contender for Saltire Awards |first=Susan |last=Mansfield |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/welsh-a-surprise-contender-for-saltire-awards-1-627949|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=6 November 2002 |accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Saltire Society Book Award was given in 1937, the year after the Saltire Society was established. No awards were given after 1939 due to the Second World War, and the next award was made 1956. The History Book of the Year award was inaugurated in 1965. In 1982 sponsorship was obtained and since then the awards have been made annually. First books have been recognised since 1988, and in 1998 the award for Scottish Research Book of the Year was established.&lt;ref name=25yrs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottisharts.org.uk/1/artsinscotland/literature/projects/archive/saltiresocietyawards.aspx |title=The Saltire Society Book of the Year Awards: A celebration of twenty five years of literature |publisher=Scottish Arts Council |accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saltire Society currently presents awards in the four following categories:&lt;ref name=boty/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">The '''Scottish Place-Name Society''' (''Comann Ainmean-Áite na h-Alba'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]) is a [[learned society]] in [[Scotland]] concerned with [[toponymy]], the study of place-names. Its scholars aim to explain the origin and history of the place-names they study, taking into account the meaning of the elements out of which they were created; the topography, geology and ecology of the places bearing the names; and the general and local history and culture of Scotland.

The Society was founded in February 1996. The Society's journal, ''The Journal of Scottish Name Studies'' (''JSNS''), has been published since 2007.

{{Events leading to World War II}}

The '''Second Italo-Ethiopian War''', also referred to as the '''Second Italo-Abyssinian War''', was a [[colonial war]] fought from 3 October 1935 until 19 February 1937, although [[Addis Ababa]] was captured on 5 May 1936. The war was fought between the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Kingdom of Italy]] and those of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as Abyssinia). Ethiopia was defeated, annexed and subjected to [[military occupation]]. The [[Ethiopian Empire]] became a part of the Italian colony of [[Italian East Africa]]. Fighting continued until the Italian defeat in East Africa in 1941, during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]].

Italy and Ethiopia were members of the [[League of Nations]] yet the League was unable to control Italy or to protect Ethiopia when Italy violated [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]] of the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. The [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935 is often seen as a clear demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the League.&lt;!--By whom?--&gt;

The Italian victory coincided with the zenith of the popularity of dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] and the [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] regime at home and abroad. Ethiopia was consolidated with [[Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]] into [[Italian East Africa|''Africa Orientale Italiana'']] (Italian East Africa).

==Background==
===Italian dreams of empire in the Horn of Africa===
Ever since the 1880s, Italy had been committed to an imperialist policy in the Horn of Africa with Italy taking Eritrea in 1885, and subsequently parts of [[Somalia]].{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=124}} The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] in which Italy invaded Ethiopia ended with a humiliating defeat for Italy at the last battle, the [[Battle of Adwa]], and caused the downfall of the ultra-imperialist government of Crispi.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} The decisive victory by the Ethiopians over the Italians at Adwa completely destroyed the Italian forces and humiliated their country.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} In 1906, a secret Anglo-Italo-French agreement had consigned Ethiopia to the Italian sphere of influence and the ''Regio Esercito'' had started planning for an invasion of Ethiopia in 1908.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} However, successive Italian governments had more pressing priorities than "avenging Adowa", however great the popular clamor might be, and the strategy favored by the Foreign Ministry was one of "friendship" and "peaceful penetration", bringing Ethiopia into the Italian economic sphere of influence as the prelude to placing it in the political sphere of influence.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} 

In the 1920s, the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini continued the same policies as his predecessors towards Ethiopia, not least because Italy was fully involved in the "pacification of Libya" and could not afford to fight two major colonial wars at once.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125 &amp; 127}} In 1925, Mussolini wrote that he would pursue an "integral violent solution" to the "problem" of Ethiopia when the time was right.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} [[Raffaele Guariglia]], who served as the Director of European Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, wrote in a 1931 memo that Italy had ambitions in Ethiopia that would be achieved "probably with war".{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} In January 1932, the Foreign Minister [[Dino Grandi]] described the policy of "peaceful penetration" as a failure, writing that a policy of ''politica periferica'' was needed, and advised that the ''Regio Esercito'' should start planning for an aggressive war.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} Guariglia in a memo in August 1932 wrote that Italy should invade Ethiopia provided that Britain and France agreed to support the invasion first.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} Later in 1932, Mussolini ordered his Minister of Colonies, [[Emilio De Bono]], to start planning for an invasion of Ethiopia to be launched in the near-future.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} However, the commander of the ''Regio Esercito'', Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]], partly out of jealousy that De Bono was to lead the planned invasion, launched a scathing critique of the De Bono plan, arguing that Italy needed larger forces and a greater logistics basis for an invasion.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} Largely as a response to Badoglio's objections, Mussolini very reluctantly agreed to upgrade the ports, roads and railroads in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to support the 300,000 men force that Badoglio insisted was necessary.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=74}}  On 30 December 1934, Mussolini gave orders for the "whole destruction of the Ethiopian armed forces and the occupation of the whole of Ethiopia".{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125-126}} 
         
Mussoini's reasons for the invasion have been much debated by historians. The Italian historians' Franco Catalano and Giorgio Rochat argue that the invasion was an act of social imperialism, contending that the Great Depression had badly damaged Mussolini's prestige, and that he needed a foreign war to distract public opinion.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=124}} Other historians such as Pietro Pastorelli have seen the invasion as more due to plans that Mussolini had long nurtured for an empire in the Horn of Africa and Arabia.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=124}} Greek historian Aristotle Kallis noted in the early 1930s that Mussolini had seriously considered invading Yemen to give Italy a foothold in the Middle East, and only chose Ethiopia partly in order to "avenge Adowa" and partly because Ethiopia was considered to be the weaker opponent.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=127}} American historian [[MacGregor Knox]] argued that Mussolini launched the war for both domestic and foreign policy reasons, arguing that Mussolini both wanted an empire abroad for its own sake and because he wanted a foreign policy triumph to push the Fascist system in a more radical direction in the face of opposition from the Crown, the Catholic Church, and other vested interests in Italy.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}} 

The decision for war was supported by the traditional elites in Italy. The Italian professional diplomats were loyal to the Fascist regime, but often sought to "moderate" Mussolini's more reckless impulses.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=73}} The ambitions of Adolf Hitler towards Austria, which Mussolini viewed as being in the Italian sphere of influence, made for antagonistic relations between Berlin and Rome, but ''Il Duce'' often stated that were it not for the "Austrian question", Hitler would be an ideal ally, which alarmed the Foreign Ministry.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=73}} Mussolini's hostility to his archenemy, King Alexander of Yugoslavia, led him to periodically consider attacking Yugoslavia all through the 1920s-30s, which gravely worried the traditional elites in both the military and diplomatic corps, who objected that Yugoslavia had an alliance with France, and that any Italo-Yugoslav war would automatically become a Franco-Italian war.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=71-73}} Mussolini's anti-Yugoslav and anti-French inclinations led him, despite the "Austrian question", to consider an alliance with Germany, which was vehemently opposed by the Foreign Ministry, as Fulvio Suvich, the under-secretary at the Foreign Ministry, repeatedly warned that a Europe dominated by Germany would in the long run offer Italy less opportunity than a Europe dominated by France.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=73}}  From the viewpoint of the Foreign Ministry, it was better for Mussolini to have an "adventure" in Ethiopia rather than Yugoslavia, which would cause a war with France that Italy would probably lose; thus, the diplomats did everything to encourage Mussolini to attack Ethiopia as the "lesser evil" compared to attacking Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=73}} The Catholic Church, which was one of the most powerful institutions in Italy, supported war against Ethiopia as a "civilizing mission", seeing a chance to convert millions of followers of the Orthodox church to Catholicism.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=74}} King Victor Emmanuel III wanted to avenge the defeat at Adowa, which was the greatest humiliation of his father's reign, though in the summer of 1935 the king counselled caution when it became clear that Britain was opposed to attacking Ethiopia .{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=73}} Marshal Badoglio was willing to support an invasion of Ethiopia provided that he rather than De Bono would command it.{{sfn|Kallis|2000|p=125}}      

===Wal Wal Incident===

{{Main|Abyssinia Crisis}}

The [[Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928]] stated that the border between [[Italian Somaliland]] and Ethiopia was twenty-one [[league (unit)|leagues]] parallel to the [[Benadir]] coast (approximately {{convert|118.3|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=sqbr}}). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the [[Welwel, Ethiopia|Welwel]] oasis (also ''Walwal'', Italian: ''Ual-Ual'') in the [[Ogaden]] and garrisoned it with Somali [[dubats]] (irregular frontier troops commanded by Italian officers). The fort at Welwel was well beyond the twenty-one league limit and inside Ethiopian territory. On 23 November 1934, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission studying grazing grounds to find a definitive border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia arrived at Wal Wal. The party contained Ethiopian and British technicians and an escort of around 600 Ethiopian soldiers. Both sides knew that the Italians had installed a military post at Wal Wal and were not surprised to see an Italian flag at the wells. The Ethiopian government had notified the Italian authorities in Italian Somaliland that the commission was active in the Ogaden and requested that the Italians co-operate. When the British Commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Esmond Clifford]] asked the Italians for permission to camp nearby, the Italian commander Captain Roberto Cimmaruta rebuffed the request.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=1–6}}

Fitorari Shiferra, the commander of the Ethiopian escort, took no notice of the {{nowrap|150 Italian}} and Somali troops and made camp. To avoid being caught in an Italian–Ethiopian incident, Clifford withdrew the British contingent to Ado, about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north-east, and Italian aircraft began to fly over Wal Wal. The Ethiopian commissioners retired with the British but the escort remained and for ten days both sides exchanged menaces, sometimes no more than {{convert|2|m|yd|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart. Reinforcements increased the Ethiopian contingent to about 1,500 men and the Italians to about 500, and on 5 December shots were fired. The Italians were supported by an armoured car and bomber aircraft; the bombs missed but machine-gun fire from the car caused about 110 Ethiopian casualties.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=6–7}} From 30 to 50 Italians and Somalis were also killed and the incident led to the "[[Abyssinia Crisis]]" at the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|Mockler|2003|p=46}} On 4 September 1935, the League of Nations exonerated both parties for the Wal Wal Incident.{{sfn|Shinn|Ofcansky|2013|p=392}}

===Ethiopian isolation===
Britain and France, preferring Italy as an ally against Germany, did not take strong steps to discourage an Italian military buildup on the borders of Ethiopia in [[Eritrea]] and Italian Somaliland. On 7 January 1935, a [[Franco-Italian Agreement]] was made giving Italy essentially a free hand in Africa in return for Italian co-operation.{{sfn|Stearns|Langer|2002|p=677}} In April, Italy was further emboldened by participation in the [[Stresa Front]], an agreement to curb further German violations of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].{{sfn|Crozier|2004|p=108}} In June, non-interference was further assured by a political rift that had developed between the United Kingdom and France following the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]].{{sfn|Stackelberg|2009|p=164}} A last possible foreign ally of Ethiopia to fall away was [[Ethiopia–Japan relations|Japan]], which had served as a model to some Ethiopian intellectuals; the Japanese ambassador to Italy, Dr. Sugimura Yotaro, on 16 July assured Mussolini that his country held no political interests in Ethiopia and would stay neutral in the coming war. His comments stirred up a furore inside Japan, where there had been popular affinity for the African Empire. Despite popular opinion, when the Ethiopians approached Japan for help on 2 August they were refused, and even a modest request for the Japanese government to officially state its support for Ethiopia in the coming conflict was denied.{{sfn|Clarke|1999|pp=9–20}}

==Prelude==

===Ethiopian army===

{{Main|Ethiopian order of battle in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}
[[File:Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Medical supplies for the front, including bales of cotton.jpg|thumb|Medical supplies for the front in Addis Ababa.]]
With war appearing inevitable, the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Haile Selassie]], ordered a general mobilisation of the [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire]].

{{quote|All men and boys able to carry a spear go to Addis Ababa. Every married man will bring his wife to cook and wash for him. Every unmarried man will bring any unmarried woman he can find to cook and wash for him. Women with babies, the blind, and those too aged and infirm to carry a spear are excused. Anyone found at home after receiving this order will be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selassie's Guard Fights on UN Side|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19510531&amp;id=gCsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6vADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6105,2413707&amp;hl=en|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=2 June 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haile Selassie's Draft Order|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=|work=The Afro American|date=17 April 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Selassie's army consisted of around 500,000 men, some of whom were armed with spears and bows; other soldiers carried more modern weapons, including rifles but many of these were pre-1900 equipments and obsolete.{{sfn|Pankhurst|1968|pp=605–608}} According to Italian estimates,&lt;!--[[Talk:Second Italo-Abyssinian War#1935 Italian intelligence estimate of the Ethiopian provinces and their forces]]--&gt; on the eve of hostilities, the Ethiopians had an army of 350,000–760,000 men. Only about 25 percent of the army had any military training and the men were armed with a motley of 400,000 rifles of every type and in every condition.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=29}} The Ethiopian armies had about 234 antiquated pieces of [[artillery]] mounted on rigid gun carriages, as well as a dozen [[PaK 36|3.7 cm PaK 35/36]] anti-tank guns. The army had about 800 light [[M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun|Colt]] and [[Hotchkiss M1922 machine gun|Hotchkiss]] machine-guns and 250 heavy [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] and [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss]] machine guns, about 100 .303-inch Vickers guns on AA mounts, 48 [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20 mm Oerlikon S]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s and some recently purchased [[Canon de 75 antiaérien mle 1913-1917|Canon de 75 CA modèle 1917 Schneider]] {{nowrap|75 mm}} field guns. The arms embargo imposed on the belligerents by France and Britain disproportionately affected Ethiopia, which lacked the manufacturing industry to produce its own weapons.{{sfn|Stapleton|2013|p=203}} The Ethiopian army had some 300 [[truck]]s, seven [[Ford Model A (1927–31)|Ford A]]-based [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] and four World War I era [[Fiat 3000]] tanks.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=29}}

The best Ethiopian units were the Emperor's "[[Kebur Zabagna]]" (Imperial Guard), who were well-trained and better equipped than the other Ethiopian troops. The Imperial Guard wore a distinctive greenish-khaki uniform of the [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian Army]], which stood out from the white cotton cloak (''shamma'') worn by most Ethiopian fighters and which proved to be an excellent target.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=29}} The skills of the ''[[Ras (title)|Rases]]'', the generals of the Ethiopian armies, were reported to rate from relatively good to incompetent. After Italian objections to an [[Anschluss]] with [[Austria]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] sent three aeroplanes, 10,000 [[Mauser rifles]] and 10 million rounds of ammunition to the Ethiopians.{{sfn|Stapleton|2013|p=203}}

The serviceable portion of the [[Ethiopian Air Force|Imperial Ethiopian Air Force]] under the command of the French Andre Maillet, included three obsolete [[Potez 25]] biplanes.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=57}} A few transport aircraft had been acquired between 1934 and 1935 for ambulance work but the air force consisted of 13 aircraft and four pilots at the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Shinn|Ofcansky|2013|p=19}} [[Airspeed Ltd|Airspeed]] in England had a surplus [[Airspeed Viceroy|Viceroy]] racing plane and director [[Neville Shute]] was delighted with a good offer for the "white elephant" in August 1935. The agent said it was to fly cinema films around Europe. When the client wanted bomb racks to carry the (flammable) films, Shute agreed to fit lugs under the wings to which they could attach "anything they liked".  He was told that the plane was to be used to bomb the Italian oil storage tanks at Massawa, and when the C.I.D. enquired about the alien (ex-German) pilot practising on it Shute got the impression that the Foreign Office did not object. But fuel plus bombs and bomb racks from Finland could not be got to Ethiopia in time, and the (paid-for) Viceroy stayed at their works. The Emperor of Ethiopia had £16,000 to spend on modern aircraft to resist the Italians, and planned to spend £5000 on the Viceroy and the rest on three [[Gloucester Gladiator]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Norway |first= Neville Shute  |title=  [[Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer|Slide Rule]]  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1954 |publisher= William Heinemann  |location= London |isbn= |oclc= |page= |pages= 212-215}} &lt;/ref&gt;   

Fifty foreign mercenaries joined the Ethiopian forces, including French pilots like Pierre Corriger, the Trinidadian pilot [[Hubert Julian]], an official Swedish military mission under Captain [[Viking Tamm]], the White Russian Feodor Konovalov and the Czechoslovak writer Adolf Parlesak. Several Austrian Nazis, a team of Belgian Fascists and Cuban mercenary Alejandro del Valle also fought for Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Othen|2017|pp=238–239}} Many of these individuals were military advisers, pilots, doctors or supporters of the Ethiopian cause; fifty mercenaries fought in the Ethiopian army and another fifty people were active in the Ethiopian Red Cross or non-military activities.{{sfn|Othen|2017|p=238}} The Italians later attributed most of the relative success achieved by the Ethiopians to foreigners or ''ferenghi''.{{sfn|Nicolle|1997|p=18}} (The Italian propaganda machine magnified the number to thousands, to explain away the Ethiopian [[Ethiopian Christmas Offensive|Christmas Offensive]] of late 1935.){{sfn|Barker|1971|p=47}}

===Italian East African forces===
{{Main|Italian Order of Battle Second Italo-Ethiopian War}}

[[File:Soldatietiopia.jpg|thumb|Italian soldiers recruited in 1935 in [[Montevarchi]] to fight the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.]]
There were 400,000 Italian soldiers in Eritrea and 285,000 in Italian Somaliland with 3,300 machine guns, 275 artillery pieces, 200 [[tankette]]s and 205 aircraft. In April 1935, the reinforcement of the [[Royal Italian Army]] (''Regio Esercito'') and the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Royal Air Force) in East Africa (''Africa Orientale'') accelerated. Eight regular, mountain and [[Blackshirts|blackshirt militia]] infantry divisions arrived in Eritrea and four regular infantry divisions arrived in Italian Somaliland, consisting of about 685,000 soldiers and a great number of logistical and support units; the Italian force included 200 journalists.{{sfn|Baer|1976|p=13}} The Italian force had 6,000 machine guns, 2,000 pieces of artillery, 599 tanks and 390 aircraft. The ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Royal Navy) carried tons of ammunition, food and other supplies, with the motor vehicles to move them, while the Ethiopians had only horse-drawn carts.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=20}}

The Italians placed considerable reliance on their Royal Corps of Colonial Troops (''Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali'', RCTC) of indigenous regiments recruited from the Italian colonies of Eritrea, Somalia, and [[Libya]]. The most effective of these Italian commanded units were the Eritrean native infantry (''[[Eritrean Ascari|Ascari]]'') who were often used as advanced troops. The Eritreans also provided cavalry and artillery units; the "Falcon Feathers" (''Penne di Falco'') was one prestigious and colourful Eritrean cavalry unit. Other RCTC units employed in the invasion of Ethiopia were irregular Somali frontier troops (''dubats''), regular Arab-Somali infantry and artillery and infantry from Libya.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=318}} The Italians had a variety of local semi-independent "allies", in the north, the [[Oromo people|Azebu Galla]] were among several groups induced to fight for the Italians. In the south, the Somali Sultan [[Olol Dinle]] commanded a personal army that advanced into the northern Ogaden with the forces of Colonel [[Luigi Frusci]]. The Sultan was motivated by his desire to take back lands that the Ethiopians had taken from him. The Italian colonial forces even included men from [[Yemen]], across the [[Gulf of Aden]].{{sfn|Nicolle|1997|p=41}}

The Italians were reinforced by volunteers from the so-called ''Italiani all'estero'' (Italian emigres from [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]) who formed the 221st Legion in the ''Divisione Tevere'' and a special ''Legione Parini'', that fought under Frusci near Dire Dawa.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=237, 267}} On 28 March 1935, General [[Emilio De Bono]] was named as the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all Italian armed forces in East Africa.{{sfn|Gooch|2007|p=301}} De Bono was also the Commander-in-Chief of the forces invading from Eritrea on the northern front. De Bono commanded nine divisions in the Italian I Corps, the Italian II Corps and the Eritrean Corps. General [[Rodolfo Graziani]] was Commander-in-Chief of forces invading from Italian Somaliland on the southern front. Initially he had two divisions and a variety of smaller units under his command, a mixture of Italians, Somalis, Eritreans, Libyans and others. De Bono regarded Italian Somaliland as a secondary theatre that needed primarily to defend itself and possibly aid the main front with offensive thrusts if the enemy forces there were not too large.{{sfn|Gooch|2007|p=299}} Most foreigners accompanied the Ethiopians but [[Herbert Matthews]],  a reporter, historian and author of ''Eyewitness in Abyssinia: With Marshal Bodoglio's forces to Addis Ababa'' (1937) &lt;!--and [[Pedro del Valle]] an observer for [[United States Marine Corps]] unable to cite--&gt;accompanied the Italian forces.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=222}}

At 5:00&amp;nbsp;am on 3 October 1935, De Bono crossed the [[Mareb River]] and advanced into Ethiopia from Eritrea without a [[declaration of war]].{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=33}} Aircraft of the ''Regia Aeronautica'' scattered leaflets asking the population to rebel against Haile Selassie and support the "true Emperor [[Iyasu V]]". Forty-year-old Iyasu had been deposed many years earlier but was still in custody. In response to the Italian invasion, Ethiopia declared war on Italy.{{sfn|Nicolle|1997|p=11}} At this point in the campaign, the lack of roads represented a serious hindrance for the Italians as they crossed into Ethiopia. On the Italian side, roads had been constructed right up to the border. On the Ethiopian side, these roads often transitioned into vaguely defined paths.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=33}} On 5 October the Italian I Corps took [[Adigrat]], and by 6 October, [[Adwa]] (Adowa) was captured by the Italian II Corps. Haile Selassie had ordered [[Duke]] (''Ras'') [[Seyum Mangasha|Seyoum Mangasha]], the Commander of the Ethiopian [[Tigray Province|Army of Tigre]], to withdraw a day's march away from the Mareb River. Later, the Emperor ordered his son-in-law and Commander of the Gate (''[[Dejazmach]]'') [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]], also in the area, to move back {{convert|55|and|35|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the border.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=33}}

On 11 October, Gugsa surrendered with 1,200 followers at the Italian outpost at Adagamos; Italian propagandists lavishly publicised the surrender but fewer than a tenth of Gugsa's men defected with him.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=35}} On 14 October, De Bono proclaimed the end of [[slavery in Ethiopia]] but this liberated the former slave owners from the obligation to feed their former slaves, in the unsettled conditions caused by the war.{{efn|Ethiopian emperors since [[Tewodros II]] had issued "superficial" proclamations to end slavery but these had made little difference.{{sfn|Clarence-Smith|1989|p=103}}}} Much of the livestock in the area had been moved to the south to feed the Ethiopian army and many of the emancipated people had no choice but to appeal to the Italian authorities for food.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=35}} By 15 October, De Bono's forces had advanced from Adwa and occupied the holy capital of [[Axum]]. De Bono entered the city riding triumphantly on a white horse and then looted the [[Obelisk of Axum]].{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=157}} To Mussolini's dismay, the advance was methodical and on 8 November, the I Corps and the Eritrean Corps captured [[Mek'ele|Makale]]. The Italian advance had added {{convert|56|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the line of supply and De Bono wanted to build a road from Adigrat before continuing.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=170}}{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=36}} On 16 November, De Bono was promoted to the rank of [[Marshal of Italy]] (''Maresciallo d'Italia'') and in December was replaced by Badoglio to speed up the invasion.{{sfn|Nicolle|1997|p=8}}&lt;!--In November the imprisoned former emperor [[Iyasu V]] also died, in undetermined circumstances. unable to cite--&gt;
===Hoare–Laval Pact===
On 14 November 1935, the National government in Britain led by Stanley Baldwin won a general election on a platform of upholding collective security and support for the League of Nations, which at least implied that Britain would support Ethiopia.{{sfn|Holt|2011|p=1384}} However, the British service chiefs led by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Earle Chatfield, all advised against going to war with Italy for the sake of Ethiopia, advice that carried much weight with the cabinet.{{sfn|Holt|2011|p=1392}} During the 1935 election, Baldwin and the rest of the cabinet had repeatedly promised that Britain was committed to upholding collective security, believing this was the best way to neutralise the Labour Party, which likewise had run on a platform emphasising collective security and support for the League of Nations.{{sfn|Holt|2011|p=1394-1395}} To square the circle caused by its election promises vs. its desire not to offend Mussolini too much, the Baldwin cabinet decided upon a plan that would give most of Ethiopia to Italy with the rest in the Italian sphere of influence as the best way of ending the war.{{sfn|Holt|2011|p=1384}} In early December 1935, the [[Hoare–Laval Pact]] was proposed by Britain and France. Under this pact, Italy would gain the best parts of Ogaden, Tigray and economic influence over all the southern part of Abyssinia. Abyssinia would have a guaranteed corridor to the sea at the port of [[Assab]]; the corridor was a poor one and known as a "corridor for camels".{{sfn|Mockler|2003|p=75}} Mussolini was ready to agree but he waited some days to make his opinion public. On 13 December, details of the pact were leaked by a French newspaper and denounced as a sell-out of the Ethiopians. The British government disassociated itself from the pact and the British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare was forced to resign in disgrace.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=187–210}}

===Ethiopian Christmas Offensive===

{{Main article|Ethiopian Christmas Offensive}}
[[File:Mittelholzer-haileselassie.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] of [[Ethiopia]] [[Haile Selassie I]]]]
The Christmas Offensive was intended to split the Italian forces in the north with the Ethiopian centre, crushing the Italian left with the Ethiopian right and to invade Eritrea with the Ethiopian left. ''Ras'' Seyum Mangasha held the area around [[Abiy Addi]] with about 30,000 men. Selassie with about 40,000 men advanced from [[Gojjam]] toward Mai Timket to the left of ''Ras'' Seyoum. ''Ras'' Kassa Haile Darge with around 40,000 men advanced from [[Dessie]] to support ''Ras'' Seyoum in the centre in a push towards Warieu Pass. [[Mulugeta Yeggazu|''Ras'' Mulugeta Yeggazu]], the Minister of War, advanced from Dessie with approximately 80,000 men to take positions on and around [[Amba Aradam]] to the right of ''Ras'' Seyoum. Amba Aradam was a steep sided, flat topped mountain directly in the way of an Italian advance on Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=45}} The four commanders had approximately 190,000 men facing the Italians. ''Ras'' Imru and his [[Shire, Ethiopia|Army of Shire]] were on the Ethiopian left. ''Ras'' Seyoum and his Army of Tigre and ''Ras'' Kassa and his Army of [[Beghemder]] were the Ethiopian centre. ''Ras'' Mulugeta and his "Army of the Center" (''Mahel Sefari'') were on the Ethiopian right.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=45}}

A force of 1,000 Ethiopians crossed the Tekeze river and advanced toward the Dembeguina Pass (Inda Aba Guna or Indabaguna pass). The Italian commander, Major Criniti, commanded a force of 1,000 Eritrean infantry supported by [[L3/35|L3 tanks]]. When the Ethiopians attacked, the Italian force fell back to the pass, only to discover that 2,000 Ethiopian soldiers were already there and Criniti's force was encircled. In the first Ethiopian attack, two Italian officers were killed and Criniti was wounded. The Italians tried to break out using their L3 tanks but the rough terrain immobilised the vehicles. The Ethiopians killed the infantry, then rushed the tanks and killed their two-man crews. Italian forces organised a relief column made up of tanks and infantry to relieve Critini but it was ambushed en route. Ethiopians on the high ground rolled boulders in front of and behind several of the tanks, to immobilise them, picked off the Eritrean infantry and swarmed the tanks. The other tanks were immobilised by the terrain, unable to advance further and two were set on fire. Critini managed to break-out in a bayonet charge and half escaped; Italian casualties were 31 Italians and 370 Askari killed and five Italians taken prisoner; Ethiopian casualties were estimated by the Italians to be 500, which was probably greatly exaggerated.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=219}}

====Black period====
The ambitious Ethiopian plan called for ''Ras'' Kassa and ''Ras'' Seyoum to split the Italian army in two and isolate the Italian I Corps and III Corps in Mekele. ''Ras'' Mulugeta would then descend from Amba Aradam and crush both corps. According to this plan, after ''Ras'' Imru retook Adwa, he was to invade Eritrea. In November, the League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic sanctions. This excluded oil, however, an indispensable raw material for the conduct of any modern military campaign, and this favoured Italy.{{sfn|Palla|2000|p=104}} The Ethiopian offensive was defeated by the Italian superiority in modern weapons like machine guns and heavy artillery. The Ethiopians were very poorly armed, with few machine guns, their troops mainly armed with swords and spears. Having spent a decade accumulating poison gas in East Africa, Mussolini gave Badoglio authority to resort to ''[[Schrecklichkeit]]'' (frightfulness), which included destroying villages and using gas (OC 23/06, 28 December 1935); Mussolini was even prepared to resort to bacteriological warfare as long as these methods could be kept quiet. Some Italians objected when they found out but the practices were kept secret, the government issuing denials or spurious stories blaming the Ethiopians.{{sfn|Mack Smith|1983|pp=231–232}}{{efn|Years later, Badoglio admitted to using gas once and a former government minister said that three gas bombs had been dropped but these admissions came after copious amounts of records had been published showing that gas had been used to a much greater extent.{{sfn|Mack Smith|1983|p=232}}}}&lt;!--After the killing of an Italian pilot [[Tito Minniti]] on 26 December, Badoglio received permission to use [[Chemical warfare|chemical warfare agents]] such as [[mustard gas]]. Mussolini stated that the gas used was not lethal but a mixture of tear gas and mustard gas (this gas was lethal in only about 1 percent of cases; its effectiveness was as a blistering agent).&lt;ref&gt;[ .&lt;/ref&gt; His statement is contradicted however, by the large number of Ethiopian casualties from gas poisoning (over 100,000), and the many tons of mustard gas used by the Italians.--&gt;

===Second Italian advance===

{{Main article|First Battle of Tembien|Battle of Amba Aradam|Second Battle of Tembien|Battle of Shire|Battle of Maychew}}

[[File:Pbadoglio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Pietro Badoglio]]
As the progress of the Christmas Offensive slowed, Italian plans to renew the advance on the northern front began as Mussolini had given permission to use poison gas (but not mustard gas) and Badoglio received the Italian [[3rd Army Corps (Italy)|III Corps]] and the Italian [[COMALP|IV Corps]] in Eritrea during early 1936. On 20 January, the Italians resumed their northern offensive at the First Battle of Tembien (20 to 24 January) in the broken terrain between the Warieu Pass and Makale. The forces of Ras Kassa were defeated, the Italians using phosgene gas and suffering 1,082 casualties against 8,000 Ethiopian casualties according to an Ethiopian wireless message intercepted by the Italians.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=224–225}}

{{quote|[It]...was at the time when the operations for the encircling of Makale were taking place that the Italian command, fearing a rout, followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world. Special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize, over vast areas of territory, a fine, death-dealing rain. Groups of nine, fifteen, eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet. It was thus that, as from the end of January 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain. To systematically kill all living creatures, to more surely poison waters and pastures, the Italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again. That was its chief method of warfare.|Selassie{{sfn|Safire|1997|p=318}}}}

From 10 to 19 February, the Italians captured Amba Aradam and destroyed ''Ras'' Mulugeta's army in the [[Battle of Amba Aradam]] (Battle of Enderta). The Ethiopians suffered massive losses and poison gas destroyed a small part of ''Ras'' Mulugeta's army, according to the Ethiopians. During the slaughter following the attempted withdrawal of his army, both ''Ras'' Mulugeta and his son were killed. The Italians lost 800 killed and wounded while the Ethiopians lost 6,000 killed and 12,000 wounded. From 27 to 29 February, the armies of ''Ras'' Kassa and ''Ras'' Seyoum were destroyed at the [[Second Battle of Tembien]]. Ethiopians again argued that poison gas played a role in the destruction of the withdrawing armies. In early March, the army of ''Ras'' Imru was attacked, bombed and defeated in what was known as the [[Battle of Shire]]. In the battles of Amba Aradam, Tembien and Shire, the Italians suffered about 2,600 casualties and the Ethiopians about 15,000; Italian casualties at the Battle of Shire being 969 men. The Italian victories stripped the Ethiopian defences on the northern front, Tigré province had fallen most of the Ethiopian survivors returned home or took refuge in the countryside and only the army guarding Addis Ababa stood between the Italians and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=237–238}}

On 31 March 1936 at the [[Battle of Maychew]], the Italians defeated an Ethiopian [[counter-offensive]] by the main Ethiopian army commanded by Selassie. The Ethiopians launched near non-stop [[Frontal assault|attacks]] on the Italian and Eritrean defenders but could not overcome the well-prepared Italian defences. When the exhausted Ethiopians withdrew, the Italians counter-attacked. The ''Regia Aeronautica'' attacked the survivors at [[Lake Ashangi]] with mustard gas. The Italian troops had 400 casualties, the Eritreans 874 and the Ethiopians suffered 8,900 casualties from 31,000 men present according to an Italian estimate.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=247–256}} On 4 April, Selassie looked with despair upon the horrific sight of the dead bodies of his army ringing the poisoned lake.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=105}} Following the battle, Ethiopian soldiers began to employ guerrilla tactics against the Italians, initiating a trend of resistance that would transform into the [[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Patriot]]/''Arbegnoch'' movement.{{sfn|Abbink|De Bruijn|Van Walraven|2003|p=94}} They were joined by local residents who operated independently near their own homes. Early activities included stealing war materials, rolling boulders off cliffs at passing convoys, kidnapping messengers, cutting telephone lines, setting fire to administrative offices and fuel and [[ammunition dump]]s, and killing collaborators. As disruption increased, the Italians were forced to redeploy more troops to Tigray, away from the campaign further south.{{sfn|Abbink|De Bruijn|Van Walraven|2003|p=95}}

===Southern front===
{{Main article|Battle of Genale Doria|Battle of the Ogaden}}

On 3 October 1935, Graziani implemented the Milan Plan to remove Ethiopian forces from various frontier posts and to test the reaction to a series of probes all along the southern front. While incessant rains worked to hinder the plan, within three weeks the Somali villages of [[Kelafo]], Dagnerai, Gerlogubi and Gorahai in Ogaden were in Italian hands.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=70}} Late in the year,  ''Ras'' Desta Damtu assembled up his army in the area around [[Negele Borana]], to advance on [[Dolo, Ethiopia|Dolo]] and invade Italian Somaliland. Between 12 and 16 January 1936, the Italians defeated the Ethiopians at the Battle of Genale Doria. The ''Regia Aeronautica'' destroyed the army of ''Ras'' Desta, Ethiopians claiming that poison gas was used.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=76}}

After a lull in February 1936, the Italians in the south prepared an advance towards the city of [[Harar]]. On 22 March, the ''Regia Aeronautica'' bombed Harar and [[Jijiga]], reducing them to ruins even though Harar had been declared an "[[open city]]".{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=112}} On 14 April, Graziani launched his attack against ''Ras'' [[Nasibu Emmanual]] to defeat the last Ethiopian army in the field at the [[Battle of the Ogaden]]. The Ethiopians were drawn up behind a defensive line that was termed the "Hindenburg Wall", designed by the chief of staff of Ras Nasibu, and [[Wehib Pasha]], a seasoned ex-Ottoman commander. After ten days, the last Ethiopian army had disintegrated; 2,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers were killed or wounded.{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=123, 121}}

===Fall of Addis Ababa===
{{Main article|March of the Iron Will}}

[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|[[Benito Mussolini]] inspecting troops during the Second Abyssinian War.]]
On 26 April 1936, Badoglio began the "March of the Iron Will" from Dessie to Addis Ababa, an advance with a mechanised column against slight Ethiopian resistance.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=109}} The column experienced a more serious attack on 4 May when Ethiopian forces under [[Haile Mariam Mammo]] ambushed the formation in Chacha, near [[Debre Berhan]], killing approximately 170 colonial troops.{{sfn|Akyeampong|Gates|2012|p=543}}

Meanwhile, Selassie conducted a disorganized retreat towards the capital. There, government officials operated without leadership, unable to contact the Emperor and unsure of his whereabouts.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|pp=58–59}} Realizing that Addis Ababa would soon fall to the Italians, Ethiopian administrators met to discuss a possible evacuation of the government to the west. After several days, they decided that they should relocate to [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], though actual preparations for their departure were postponed.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|p=59}} Addis Ababa became crowded with retreating soldiers from the front while its foreign residents sought refuge at various European legations.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|p=61}} Selassie reached the capital on 30 April. That day his [[Council of Ministers (Ethiopia)|Council of Ministers]] resolved that the city should be defended and a retreat to Gore conducted only as a last resort.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|p=61}} The following day an ad hoc council of Ethiopian nobles convened to reexamine the decision, where Ras [[Aberra Kassa]] suggested that the Emperor should go to Geneva to appeal to the League of Nations for assistance before returning to lead resistance against the Italians. The view was subsequently adopted by Selassie and preparations were made for his departure.{{sfn|Spencer|2006|p=62}} On 2 May, Selassie boarded a train from [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Djibouti]], with the gold of the Ethiopian Central Bank. From there he fled to the United Kingdom, with the tacit acquiescence of the Italians who could have bombed his train, into exile (Mussolini had refused a request from Graziani to mount such an attack{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=126}}). 

Before he departed, Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore and directed the mayor of Addis Ababa to maintain order in the city until the Italians' arrival. [[Imru Haile Selassie]] was appointed [[Regent|Prince Regent]] during his absence. The city police, under [[Abebe Aregai]] and the remainder of the Imperial Guard did their utmost to restrain a growing crowd but rioters rampaged throughout the city, looting and setting fire to shops owned by Europeans. Most of the violence occurred between looters, fighting over the spoils and by 5 May, much of the city lay in ruins.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=125}} At 04:00 Badoglio drove into the city at the head of 1,600 lorries and patrols of Italian tanks, troops and Carabinieri were sent to occupy tactically valuable areas in the city, as the remaining inhabitants watched sullenly.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=262–263}}

=== Subsequent operations ===

After the occupation of Addis Ababa, nearly half of Ethiopia was still unoccupied and the fighting continued for another three years until nearly 90% was "pacified" just before [[World War II]], although censorship kept this from the Italian public.{{sfn|Mack Smith|1983|pp=232–233}} Ethiopian commanders withdrew to nearby areas to regroup; Abebe Aregai went to [[Ankober]], [[Balcha Safo]] to [[Gurage Zone|Gurage]], Zewdu Asfaw to [[Mulo (woreda)|Mulo]], Blatta Takale Wolde Hawariat to [[Limmu (woreda)|Limmu]] and the Kassa brothers (Aberra, [[Wondosson Kassa|Wondosson]] and [[Asfawossen Kassa|Asfawossen]]) to Selale. Haile Mariam conducted [[hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks around the capital.{{sfn|Abbink|De Bruijn|Van Walraven|2003|p=97}} About 10,000 troops remaining under the command of Aberra Kassa had orders from Selassie to continue resistance. On 21 June Kassa held a meeting with Bishop [[Abune Petros]] and several other Patriot leaders at [[Debre Libanos]], about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Addis Ababa. Plans were made to storm parts of the capital but a lack of transport and radio equipment prevented a co-ordinated attack. The exiled government in Gore was never able to provide any meaningful leadership to the Patriots or remaining military formations but sporadic resistance by independent groups persisted around the capital.{{sfn|Abbink|De Bruijn|Van Walraven|2003|p=97}} On the night 26 June, members of the Black Lions organization destroyed three Italian aircraft in [[Nekemte]] and killed twelve Italian officials, including Air Marshal {{Interlanguage link multi|Vincenzo Magliocco|it}} after the Italians had sent the party to parley with the local populace. Graziani ordered the town to be bombed in retaliation for the killings (Magliocco was his deputy). Local hostility forced out the Patriots and Desta Damtew, commander of the southern Patriots, withdrew his troops to [[Arbegona (woreda)|Arbegona]]. Surrounded by Italian forces, they retreated to [[Butajira]], where they were eventually defeated. An estimated 4,000 Patriots were reportedly killed in both engagements, 1,600 of whom—including Damtew—after being taken prisoner.{{sfn|Abbink|De Bruijn|Van Walraven|2003|p=102}}

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===

In 1968, Colonel A. J. Barker, apparently using statistics from Italy, wrote that from 1 January 1935 to 31 May 1936, the Italian army and Blackshirt units lost {{nowrap|1,148 men}} killed, {{nowrap|125 men}} died of wounds and thirty-one missing; about {{nowrap|1,593 Eritrean}} troops and {{nowrap|453 civilian}} workmen were also killed, a total of {{nowrap|3,319 casualties.}}{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=292–293}} In a 1978 publication, Alberto Sbacchi wrote that these official Italian casualty figures of about {{nowrap|3,000 were}} an underestimate.{{sfn|Sbacchi|1978|p=37}} Sbacchi calculated that by May 1936, {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} soldiers had been killed and {{nowrap|44,000 had}} been wounded; from 1936 to 1940, there an additional {{nowrap|9,555 men}} killed and {{nowrap|144,000 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Sbacchi|1978|pp=43, 36–38}} Total Italian casualties from 1935 to 1940 according to these calculations were about 208,000 killed or wounded. Based on {{nowrap|1,911 Italians}} killed in the first six months of 1940, Ministry of Africa figures for 6 May 1936 to 10 June 1940 are {{nowrap|8,284 men}} killed, which Sbacchi considered to be fairly accurate.{{sfn|Sbacchi|1978|p=43}} In ''Legacy of Bitterness: Ethiopia and Fascist Italy, 1935–1941'' (1997), Sbacchi wrote that the official total of Italian casualties was unreliable, because the regime desired to underestimate Italian losses.{{sfn|Sbacchi|1997|p=xxi}}

There was a lack of reliable statistics because confusion during the invasion made it difficult to keep accurate records and the ''Statistical Bulletin'' had ceased to provide data on fatalities. Field hospital records had been destroyed, inventories dispersed, individual deaths were not reported and bodies were not repatriated to Italy. Unpublished reports listed {{nowrap|3,694 military}} and civilian fatalities among {{nowrap|44,000 casualties}} and from May 1936 to June 1940, there were another {{nowrap|12,248 military}} and civilian fatalities in {{nowrap|144,000 casualties.}}{{sfn|Sbacchi|1997|pp=xxi–xxii}} In a memorandum submitted to the Paris conference in 1946, the Ethiopian government enumerated {{nowrap|275,000 men}} killed in action, {{nowrap|78,500 Patriots}} killed in hostilities during the occupation from 1936–1941, {{nowrap|17,800 women}} and children killed by bombing, {{nowrap|30,000 people}} killed in the massacre of February 1937, {{nowrap|35,000 people}} died in concentration camps, {{nowrap|24,000 Patriots}} killed in obedience to orders from summary courts, {{nowrap|300,000 people}} died after their villages had been destroyed, a total of {{nowrap|760,300 deaths.}}{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=292–293}}

===Public and international reaction===

[[File:Haile Selassie Time cover 1936.jpg|thumb|Haile Selassie's resistance of the Italian invasion, made him [[Time Person of the Year|Time Man of the Year 1935]].]]
[[King-Emperor]] Victor Emmanuel III waited for the crowds in the [[Quirinal Palace]] on [[Quirinal Hill]]. Months earlier, when the Ethiopian adventure first started, he told a friend: "If we win, I shall be King of Abyssinia. If we lose, I shall be King of Italy."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,  [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848561,00.html "Re ed Imperatore"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222022531/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,848561,00.html |date=22 December 2008 }}, 18 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[Imperator]]e! Imperatore! Salute Imperatore!''" ("Emperor! Emperor! Salute the Emperor!") chanted the crowd when Victor Emmanuel, in full Army uniform, showed himself on a balcony. The first Emperor in Rome in hundreds of years raised his withered hand to the visor of his cap and said nothing. [[Elena of Montenegro|Elena]], his [[Queen-Empress]], did not appear. She was in bed with a broken toe from falling off a stepladder in her library while reaching for a book.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', "Re ed Imperatore", 18 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Italian King-Emperor was silent, Mussolini was not; when he announced victory from the balcony of the ''[[Palazzo Venezia]]'' in Rome, the Italian population was jubilant.

From his balcony, Mussolini proclaimed

{{quote|During the thirty centuries of our history, Italy has known many solemn and memorable moments – this is unquestionably one of the most solemn, the most memorable. People of Italy, people of the world, peace has been restored.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=159}}}}

The crowds would not let him go—ten times they recalled Mussolini to the balcony and cheered and waved while the boys of various Fascist youth organisations sang the newly composed "Hymn of the Empire" (''Inno dell'impero'').{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=159}}

Four days later, the same scene was repeated when Mussolini announced

{{quote|"At last Italy has her empire." And he then added: "The Italian people have created an empire with their blood. They will fertilize it with their work. They will defend it against anyone with their weapons. Will you be worthy of it?"|Barker{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=159}}}}

The consequences of the victory in Ethiopia not obvious until later; Mussolini had challenged the nations of the League, had become briefly the centre of world attention and had defied British hegemony. Many sceptics in Italy were relieved and [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]] reached the [[apogee]] of its popularity; the shouts of military victory drowned out grumbles about the economy.{{sfn|Mack Smith|1983|p=234}}{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=131}}

While the Italian people were rejoicing in Rome, Haile Selassie sailed from Djibouti on 4 May, he had sailed from Djibouti in the British cruiser {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|6}}. From [[Mandatory Palestine]] Selassie sailed to [[Gibraltar]] en route for Britain. While in [[Jerusalem]], Haile Selassie sent a [[telegram]] to the League of Nations,

{{quote|We have decided to bring to an end the most unequal, most unjust, most barbarous war of our age, and have chosen the road to exile in order that our people will not be exterminated and in order to consecrate ourselves wholly and in peace to the preservation of our empire's independence... we now demand that the League of Nations should continue its efforts to secure respect for the covenant, and that it should decide not to recognize territorial extensions, or the exercise of an assumed sovereignty, resulting from the illegal recourse to armed force and to numerous other violations of international agreements.{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–132}}}}

The Ethiopian Emperor's telegram caused several nations temporarily to defer recognition of the Italian conquest.{{sfn|Barker|1971|pp=131–132}}

On 30 June, Selassie spoke at the League of Nations and was introduced by the [[Leaders of the League of Nations|President of the Assembly]] as "His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia" ("''Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie''"). A group of jeering Italian journalists began yelling insults and had to be ejected before he could speak. The [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] chairman, [[Nicolae Titulescu]], jumped to his feet and shouted "Show the savages the door!" ("''A la porte les sauvages!''").{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=133}} Selassie denounced Italian aggression and criticised the world community for standing by. At the conclusion of his speech, which appeared on [[newsreel]]s throughout the world, he said "It is us today. It will be you tomorrow".

On 18 November 1936, the [[Italian Empire]] was recognised by the [[Empire of Japan]] and Italy recognised the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]]; The [[Stresa Front]] was over.{{sfn|Lowe|Marzari|2010|p=307}}{{sfn|Selassie|1999|p=20}} Hitler had supplied the Ethiopians with 16,000 rifles and 600 machine guns in the hope that Italy would be weakened when he moved against Austria.{{sfn|Leckie|1987|p=64}} By contrast, France and Britain recognised Italian control over Ethiopia in 1938. [[Mexico]] was the only country to strongly condemn Italy's sovereignty over Ethiopia, respecting Ethiopian independence throughout.

From 1936 to 1939, Mussolini and Hitler joined forces in Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In April 1939, Mussolini launched the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]. In May, Italy and Nazi Germany joined together in the [[Pact of Steel]]. In September 1940, both nations signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] along with the Empire of Japan.

===War crimes===
Ethiopian troops used [[Expanding bullet|Dum-Dum bullets]], which had been banned by declaration IV, 3 of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention (1899)]] and began mutilating captured Eritrean Askari (often with [[castration]]) since the first weeks of war.{{sfn|Antonicelli|1975|p=79}}
[[File:Italian military emasculated Second Italo-Ethiopian War.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Italian soldier emasculated]]
After early December, the Ethiopians began to torture and murder Italians (also civilians and women, like happened later in the "[[Gondrand massacre]]" where nearly 90 Italian workers were killed and mutilated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://italiacoloniale.com/2016/10/15/leccidio-del-cantiere-gondrand-a-mai-lhala/ |title=Gondrand massacre (in Italian), with some photos |access-date=21 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821093802/https://italiacoloniale.com/2016/10/15/leccidio-del-cantiere-gondrand-a-mai-lhala/ |archive-date=21 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who retaliated with the initial use of some [[poison gas]]. The murder of [[Tito Minniti]] -an Italian pilot who was killed after he was captured by Ethiopians in December 1935 near Degehabur- was the atrocity story justifying the first use of mustard gas by Mussolini against the Ethiopians.

Indeed, the murder of Minniti relied on the assertions of an attaché of the Egyptian Red Cross, Abdel Mohsein El Uisci, who later testified to the "League of Nations" and stated that the severed head and feet of Minniti were carried to the towns of Degehabur, [[Jijiga]] and [[Harar]]. El Uisci testified:

{{Quote|''...Ethiopian soldiers cut the fingers of the Italian POW. Then their officer Manghestu undressed him (while the Italian was screaming in pain) and cut his sexual organ with a knife.... he died slowly of blood loss. The body of Minniti finally was cut in pieces and the head was placed on top of a bayonet to be delivered to the local Ras of Dagabur, Harrar....''&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Abdel Mohsein El Uisci in the Dossier "ASD - MAE Etiopia Fondo Guerra, 131/34" given to the League of Nations by the Italian government&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Italian authorities complained with the [[League of nations]] about the barbarian practice of mutilation (of body sections and also of genitals) done by some Ethiopians with their POWs. 
[[File:C-123-M-62-1936-VII EN.pdf|thumb|right|200px|Italian communication of protest to the [[League of Nations]]]]

Some hundreds of colonial [[Eritrean Ascari]] and dozens of Italians suffered these amputations, often done before death as happened with 17 Italian workers emasculated in Gondrand in February 1936&lt;ref&gt; Zamorani, Massimo. ''La strage della "Gondrand"'', in "Storia militare", XXI, nº 236, May 2013, pp. 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Quote|''First reports about the emasculation of Italian soldiers were received in December 1935 and caused alarm in the fighting force - especially after unauthorized photographs were circulated. While commanders in the field were instructed not to let the morale of the troops be affected, Rome decided to use emasculation as crying proof of the enemy's backwardness justifying Italy's civilizing mission. As of mid-January 1936, emasculation became a main focus of the Italian propaganda campaign, not least to off-set the very damaging Ethiopian accusations of Italian bombings of Red Cross hospitals. The League of Nations was repeatedly confronted with the matter and the ICRC was kept constantly informed. In the worst single and well-documented incident — the attack on the Gondrand construction camp — seventeen workers out of eighty killed were mutilated in such a horrific way.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyrevealed.eu/africa-new/ethiopia-eritrea/photos/10864-collection-of-22-photos-of-the-gondrand-massacre-aph228.html |title=Photos of the Gondrand massacre, with article |access-date=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017082145/http://www.historyrevealed.eu/africa-new/ethiopia-eritrea/photos/10864-collection-of-22-photos-of-the-gondrand-massacre-aph228.html |archive-date=17 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Italian military forces disposed of hundreds of tons of gas (from [[WW1]]) which had been transported to East Africa in the decade before the war.{{sfn|Mack Smith|1983|p=231}} The Italian army used {{convert|300|–|500|t|LT|abbr=on}} of mustard gas, despite being a signatory to the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], justified by the deaths of [[Tito Minniti|Minniti]] and his observer in the Ogaden.{{sfn|Baudendistel|2006|p=131}} The use of gas was authorised by Mussolini.

Military and civilian targets were gas bombed and on 30 December, a [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] unit was bombed at Dolo and an Egyptian ambulance was attacked at Bulale; a few days later an Egyptian medical unit was bombed at Daggah Bur. There were more attacks in January and February, then on 4 March 1936, a British Red Cross camp near Quoram appeared to be subject to the most deliberate attack of all, when low-flying Italian aircraft crews could not have missed the big Red Cross signs.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=222}} Mustard gas was also sprayed from above on Ethiopian combatants and villages. The Italians tried to keep their resort to chemical warfare secret but were exposed by the International Red Cross and many foreign observers. The Italians claimed that at least 19 bombardments of Red Cross tents "posted in the areas of military encampment of the Ethiopian resistance", had been "erroneous".

{{Quote|The Italians attempted to justify their use of chemical weapons by citing the exception to the Geneva Protocol restrictions that referenced acceptable use for reprisal against illegal acts of war. They stated that the Ethiopians had tortured or killed their prisoners and wounded soldiers.|Smart{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=1–78}}}}

The Italians delivered poison gas by [[Shell (projectile)|gas shell]] and in bombs dropped by the ''Regia Aeronautica''. Though poorly equipped, the Ethiopians had achieved some success against modern weaponry but had no defence against the "terrible rain that burned and killed".{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=56}} Anthony Mockler wrote that the effect mustard gas in battle was negligible and in 1959, D. K. Clark wrote that the US Major, Norman Fiske,

{{Quote|....thought the Italians were clearly superior and that victory for them was assured no matter what. The use of chemical agents in the war was nothing more than an experiment. He concluded "From my own observations and from talking with [Italian] junior officers and soldiers I have concluded that gas was not used extensively in the African campaign and that its use had little if any effect on the outcome".|D. K. Clark{{sfn|Clark|1959|p=20}}}}

Italians, like the war correspondent [[Indro Montanelli]], noted that the Italian soldiers had no gas masks, that there was no use of gas or it was used in very small amounts if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrierecaraibi.com/FIRME_FGiannini_100630_Dai-parolai-mi-guardi-Iddio-che.htm|title=Dai parolai mi guardi Iddio che dagli intenditori mi guardo io di  Filippo Giannini   - Repubblica Dominicana - Il Corriere d'Italia nel Nuovo Mondo|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210601/http://www.corrierecaraibi.com/FIRME_FGiannini_100630_Dai-parolai-mi-guardi-Iddio-che.htm|archive-date=23 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These claims are disputed by Captain Meade, the US observer with Ethiopian forces who wrote

{{Quote|It is my opinion that of all the superior weapons possessed by the Italians, mustard gas was the most effective. It caused few deaths that I observed, but it temporarily incapacitated very large numbers so frightened the rest that the Ethiopian resistance broke completely.|Smart{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=1–78}}}}

Major General JFC Fuller, assigned to the Italian army, concluded

{{Quote| ..In place of the laborious process of picketing the heights, the heights sprayed with gas were rendered unoccupiable by the enemy, save at the gravest risk. It was an exceedingly cunning use of this chemical.|Smart{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=1–78}}}}

US military analysis concluded

{{Quote|....Chemical weapons were devastating against the unprepared and unprotected Ethiopians.|Smart{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=1–78}}}}

Haile Selassie in his report to the League of Nations described it

{{Quote|....Special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine, death-dealing rain. Groups of 9, 15, or 18 aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet. It was thus that, as from the end of January 1936, soldiers, women, children, cattle, rivers, lakes, and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain. In order more surely to poison the waters and pastures, the Italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again. These fearful tactics succeeded. Men and animals succumbed. The deadly rain that fell from the aircraft made all those whom it touched fly shrieking with pain. All those who drank poisoned water or ate infected food also succumbed in dreadful suffering. In tens of thousands the victims of Italian mustard gas fell.|Smart{{sfn|Smart|1997|pp=1–78}}}}

Historian Del Boca condemned the use of gas, according to P. Tripodi, but noted that it was minimal on the results of the war the effects of the Italian gas (the most used was "iprite", a gas that was not mortal like others used during [[WW1]] in Europe: that is why the Italian troops had no antigas masks, as confirmed by Indro Montanelli). In Tripodi's opinion the gas used was only a kind of punishment against the Ethiopians for their cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Tripodi. "L'eredità coloniale in Somalia" Section: 'Adua vendicata'.

===Italian occupation===

====1936====

{{Main|Italian East Africa|Italian Empire}}

[[File:Italian East Africa (1938–1941).svg|thumb|The six provinces of Italian East Africa.]]
On 10 May 1936, in Ethiopia Italian troops from the northern front and from the southern front met at Dire Dawa.{{sfn|Nicolle|1997|p=12}} The Italians found the recently released Ethiopian Ras, [[Hailu Tekle Haymanot]], who boarded a train back to Addis Ababa and approached the Italian invaders in submission.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=127}} Selassie fell back to Gore in southern Ethiopia to reorganise and continue to resist the Italians. In early June, Rome promulgated a constitution for ''Africa Orientale Italiana'' (AOI, [[Italian East Africa]]) bringing Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland together into an administrative unit of six provinces. Badoglio became the first [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor General]] but on 11 June, he was replaced by Marshal Graziani. In July, Ethiopian forces attacked Addis Ababa and were routed. Numerous members of Ethiopian royalty were taken prisoner and others were executed soon after they surrendered, including three sons of ''Ras'' Kassa. On 19 December, Wondosson Kassa was executed near [[Debre Zebit]] and on 21 December, Aberra Kassa and Asfawossen Kassa were executed in [[Fiche|Fikke]]. In late 1936, after the Italians tracked him down in Gurage, ''Dejazmach'' Balcha Safo was killed resisting to the end.{{sfn|Selassie|1999|p=32}} On 19 December, Selassie surrendered at the Gojeb river.{{sfn|Mockler|2003|p=168}}

After the end of the rainy season, an Italian column left Addis Ababa in September and occupied Gore a month later. The forces of ''Ras'' Imru were trapped between the Italians and the Sudan border and Imru surrendered on 17 December. Imru was flown to Italy and imprisoned on the Island of [[Ponza]], while the rest of the [[Ethiopian POWs during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Ethiopian prisoners]] taken in the war were dispersed in camps in East Africa and Italy. A second column went south-west to attack ''Ras'' Desta and the ''Dejasmatch'' Gabre Mariam who had assembled military forces in the Great Lakes district. The Ethiopians were defeated on 16 December and by January, the Italians had established a measure of control over the provinces of Jimma, Kafa and Arusi. After another two months, the remaining Ethiopians were surrounded and fought on, rather than surrender. Mariam was killed and Desta taken prisoner and killed, his head being displayed in Jimma.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=282}}

Mussolini gave orders that,

{{quote|Rome, June 5, 1936. To His Excellency Graziani. All rebels taken prisoner must be killed.  Mussolini.{{sfn|Candeloro|1981|p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}}}

Most of the repression of the population was carried out by colonial troops (mostly from Eritrea) of the Italians who, according to the Ethiopians, instituted forced labour camps, installed public gallows, killed hostages and mutilated the corpses of their enemies. Many Italian troops had themselves photographed next to cadavers hanging from the gallows or standing with chests full of detached heads.{{sfn|Del Boca|2005|p=}}{{sfn|Mignemi|1982|p=}}{{pages needed|date=October 2017}}

Catholic reaction was mixed to the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Fearing retribution from the [[National Fascist Party]], some [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] gave praise. In 1973, [[Anthony Rhodes]] wrote,

{{quote|In his Pastoral Letter of the 19th October [1935], the Bishop of [[Udine]] [Italy] wrote, 'It is neither timely nor fitting for us to pronounce on the rights and wrongs of the case. Our duty as Italians, and still more as Christians is to contribute to the success of our arms.' The [[Carlo Agostini|Bishop of Padua]] wrote on the 21st October, 'In the difficult hours through which we are passing, we ask you to have faith in our statesmen and armed forces.' On the 24th October, the Bishop of [[Cremona]] consecrated a number of regimental flags and said 'The blessing of God be upon these soldiers who, on African soil, will conquer new and fertile lands for the Italian genius, thereby bringing to them Roman and Christian culture. May Italy stand once again as the Christian mentor to the whole world.'|Italian bishops{{sfn|Rhodes|1973|p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}}}

[[Pope Pius XI]] had condemned totalitarianism in the encyclical ''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'' and made gestures to the Fascist regime, presenting the queen of Italy with the Golden Rose when she was made Empress of Ethiopia but despite great pressure from Mussolini refused to bless Italian armies. Pius may have refused to give absolute support to the regime but also failed to prevent Italian bishops doing it in his stead.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=269–270}} This coincided with Mussolini's increasing [[anti-clericalism#Italy|anti-clericalism]] and he stated that "the Papacy was a malignant tumour in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all', because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and [himself]".{{sfn|Mack Smith|1982|pp=222–223}}

In December, Graziani declared the country to be pacified and under Italian control. Ethiopian [[Resistance movement|resistance]] continued and the Italian [[Military occupation|occupation]] was marked by guerilla campaigns against the Italians and Italian reprisals, including mustard gas attacks against rebels and the summary execution of prisoners. On 19 February 1937, during a public ceremony at the Viceregal Palace in Addis Ababa (the former Imperial residence), [[Abraha Deboch]] and [[Moges Asgedom]] attempted to kill Graziani with hand grenades. Italian security guard fired indiscriminately into the crowd and killed about {{nowrap|300 civilian}} onlookers; during the night, Blackshirts went through the Ethiopian quarter and murdered people with swords, knives, rifles and bombs. When the massacre ended on 22 February, thousands of Ethiopians had been killed. Over the next few weeks, the Italian colonial authorities executed about 30,000 civilians in reprisal. About half of the younger, educated Ethiopian population were killed in what became known as [[Yekatit 12]] (the [[Ethiopian calendar]] equivalent of 19 February).{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=281–283}}{{sfn|Del Boca|Rochat|1996|p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}} In December, ''Ras'' Desta Damtew had been forced out of his base of operations in [[Irgalem]] and was executed on 24 February; ''Dejazmach'' [[Beyene Merid]] who had just joined forces with him was also killed.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1937, the [[Ministry of the Colonies (Italy)|Italian ministry of colonies]] was renamed ''Ministry of Italian Africa''.
====1938–1940====

[[File:Amadeo Aosta3rd 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Duke of Aosta]]
On 21 December 1937, Rome appointed [[Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta]], as the new Viceroy and Governor General of AOI with instructions to take a more conciliatory line. Aosta instituted public works projects including {{convert|2000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of new paved roadways, 25 hospitals, 14 hotels, dozens of post offices, telephone exchanges, aqueducts, schools and shops. The Italians decreed [[miscegenation]] to be illegal. Racial separation, including residential segregation, was enforced as thoroughly as possible and the Italians showed favouritism to non-Christian groups. To isolate the dominant [[Amhara people|Amhara]] rulers of Ethiopia, who supported Selassie, the Italians granted the Oromos, the [[Somali people|Somalis]] and other Muslims, many of whom had supported the invasion, autonomy and rights. The Italians also definitively abolished [[Abolition of slavery timeline|slavery]] and abrogated [[Feudalism|feudal laws]] that had been upheld by the Amharas. Early in 1938, a revolt broke out in Gojjam, led by the [[Committee of Unity and Collaboration]], made up of some of the young, educated elite who had escaped reprisals after the assassination attempt on Graziani. The general oversaw another wave of reprisals and had all Ethiopians in administrative jobs murdered, some by being thrown from aircraft, after being taken on board under the pretext of visiting the King in Rome, leading to the saying "He went to Rome".{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=281}}

The army of occupation had 150,000 men but was spread thinly; by 1941 the garrison had been increased to 250,000 soldiers, including 75,000 [[Italians of Ethiopia|Italian civilians]]. The former police chief of Addis Ababa, Abebe Aregai, was the most successful leader of the Ethiopian guerrilla movement after 1937, using units of fifty men. On 11 December, the League of Nations voted to condemn Italy and Mussolini withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Barker|1968|p=272}} Along with world condemnation, the occupation was expensive, the budget for AOI from 1936 to 1937 required 19,136 billion [[Lira|lire]] for infrastructure, when the annual revenue of Italy was only 18,581 billion lire.{{sfn|Cannistraro|1982|p=5}} In 1939 ''Ras'' Sejum Mangascià, ''Ras'' Ghetacciù Abaté and ''Ras'' Kebbedé Guebret submitted to the Italian Empire and guerilla warfare petered out. In early 1940, the last area of guerilla activity was around [[lake Tana]] and the southern Gojjam, under the leadership of the degiac Mangascià Giamberè and Belay Zelleke.{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=281, 300}}

[[File:The West African Frontier Force in East Africa, 1941 E2003.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the West African Frontier Force removing Italian frontier markers from the Kenya–Italian Somaliland border, 1941]]
While in exile in England, Haile Selassie had sought the support of the Western democracies for his cause but had little success until the Second World War began. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain and attacked British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces in [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], Kenya and [[British Somaliland]]. In August 1940, the [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] was completed. The British and Selassie incited Ethiopian and other local forces to join a campaign to dislodge the Italians from Ethiopia. Selassie went to [[Khartoum]] to establish closer liaison with the British and resistance forces within Ethiopia. On 18 January 1941, Selassie crossed the border into Ethiopia near the village of Um Iddla and two days later rendezvoused with [[Gideon Force]]. on 5 May, Selassie and an army of Ethiopian Free Forces entered Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Barker|1971|p=156}} After the Italian defeat, the [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] was carried out by remnants of Italian troops and their allies, which lasted until the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces]] in September 1943.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|p=74}}

====Peace treaty, 1947====

{{main|Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947}}

The treaty signed in Paris by the [[Italian Republic]] (''Repubblica Italiana'') and the [[allies of World War II|victorious powers]] of World War II on 10 February 1947, included formal Italian recognition of Ethiopian independence and an agreement to pay $25,000,000 in reparations. Since the League of Nations and most of its members had never officially recognized Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, Haile Selassie had been recognized as the restored emperor of Ethiopia following his formal entry into Addis Ababa in May 1941. Ethiopia presented a bill to the Economic Commission for Italy of £184,746,023 for damages inflicted during the course of the Italian occupation. The list included the destruction of {{nowrap|2,000 churches,}} {{nowrap|535,000 houses,}} the slaughter or theft of {{nowrap|5,000,000 cattle,}} {{nowrap|7,000,000 sheep}} and goats, {{nowrap|1,000,000 horses}} and mules and {{nowrap|700,000 camels.}}{{sfn|Barker|1968|pp=292–293}}

The '''Slovak National Museum''' ({{lang-sk|Slovenské národné múzeum}}) is the most important institution focusing on [[scientific research]] and cultural [[education]] in the field of [[museology]] in [[Slovakia]]. Its beginnings "are connected with the endeavour of the [[Slovaks|Slovak nation]] for national emancipation and self-determination".&lt;ref name = "SNM"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = City of Bratislava | url = http://www.snm.sk/?lang=eng&amp;org=0&amp;section=home&amp;show | title = Slovak national museum - Museum | date = n.d. |accessdate = April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is headquartered in [[Bratislava]], however, the Slovak National Museum governs 18 specialized museums, most of which are located outside the city.

==History==
The Slovak National Museum (SNM) was established in 1961. Its origins lie in the [[Matica slovenská|Matica Slovenská]] Museum and the Museum of the National House in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]], which developed the Slovak Museology Society. The first permanent exposition funded from a national collection was opened in Martin in 1908. The museum was building [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Ethnography|ethnographic]], historical, [[numismatics|numismatic]], art historical, creative art and natural science collections. The Slovak National Geographic and History Museum was established in Bratislava in 1924 by the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum Society. The [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] Museum, a department of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Agricultural Museum in [[Prague]], was established in Bratislava the same year. In 1940, the Slovak National Geographic and History Museum and the Agricultural Museum were merged into the Slovak Museum. In 1961, the Slovak Museum and the [[Slovak National Museum in Martin]] were merged into the Slovak National Museum, based in Bratislava.&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

On March 11, 2012, the Krásna Hôrka Castle (part of the SNM), was damaged by a fire started when two children were lighting cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2113802/Kosice-Slovakia-Children-burn-14th-century-castle-cigarette.html |title=14th century castle gutted in blaze sparked by two young boys who had sneaked into grounds to smoke their first cigarette |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=12 March 2012 |author=Tom Gardner |accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire destroyed the roof but most of the historic collections were undamaged.

The Slovak National Museum is the most important scientific research and cultural education institution, with the largest and best collections in the museological field in Slovakia. The museum is also dedicated to scientific research tasks and [[publishing]] activities. Moreover, the SNM is "a coordination, methodological, professional advisory, statistical, educational and information centre for the whole field of museology in the Slovak Republic."&lt;ref name = "SNM"/&gt;

===Building===
The Slovak National Museum's headquarters are located on Vajanské nábrežie (a river front street in [[Old Town, Bratislava|Bratislava's Old Town]]), along with the Natural History Museum. The construction of the building, designed by architect M. M. Harminec, began in July 1925 and was completed in 1928. The museum opened on May 4, 1930.

The '''South-West Brabant Museum''' (Dutch: ''Zuidwestbrabants Museum'') is a [[local museum]] in [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], [[Flemish Brabant]], [[Belgium]]. From 1981 the museum was housed for decades in a former college of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] from the 17th century. After a closure of half a year in 2014, it was reopened in Den Ast.&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad"&gt;Het Nieuwsblad, [https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20140912_01265187 Hals museum sluit zondagavond de deuren], 13 september 2014 {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
It maintains and conserves around 20,000 pieces and is centered around archeology,&lt;ref name="ExpCentr"&gt;Expertisecentrum voor Technisch, Wetenschappelijk en Industrieel Erfgoed, [http://www.etwie.be/database/actor/zuidwestbrabants-museum Zuidwestbrabants Museum] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; music and the local histories of Halle, the [[Pajottenland]], [[Zenne]] and [[Sonian Forest|Sonian]].&lt;ref name="OKV"&gt;Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen, [http://www.tento.be/musea/zuidwestbrabants-museum Zuidwestbrabants Museum] {{nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a great part the way of living of humans from earlier times is told. The museum rebuilt a workers home from the 19th century. A detailed look is given at [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[braid]]ing [[basket]]s, [[city guard]]s, [[forge|forging]] [[noble metal]]s, [[painting]] art, [[glass art]], [[agriculture]], and [[pilgrimage]].&lt;ref name="ExpCentr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OKV" /&gt;

Another selection pays attention to local musicians, like cellist [[Adrien-François Servais]] (1807-1866) and various family members, like his musical sons Franz and Joseph, grand daughter [[Misia Sert]] and sons in law [[Ernest Van Dyck]] and [[Cyprien Godebski]].&lt;ref name="OKV" /&gt;

In Den Ast it is located at the former establishment of the [[malt house]] Van Roye. The ground floor pays attention to eight hundred years of history of the city, among which the pilgrimage. The first floor is focused on the music culture in the city and [[carnival]]. There is also an experience trail through the old malt house. The exhibited collection is smaller than in the former Jesuits college, however is will be changed every four to five years. There are also digital presentations.&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExpCentr" /&gt;

[[File:Cairo Castle GardenTaiz,Yemen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Cairo Castle]]'s garden]]'''Taiz''' ({{lang-ar|تعز}}, ''Taʿizz'') is a city in southwestern [[Yemen]]. It is located in the Yemeni Highlands, near the port city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] on the [[Red Sea]], lying at an elevation of about {{convert|1,400|m}} above sea level. It is the capital of [[Taiz Governorate]]. With a population of over 600,000 in 2005, it is the third largest city in Yemen after the capital [[Sana'a]] and the southern port city of [[Aden]]. Taiz is considered to be the cultural capital of Yemen.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==History==

In 130 CE the [[Jewish Sharab|Jewish quarter]] was established in the city.
One of the famous and most accepted traveler in Taiz was Ibn Battuta. In his travels he describes this city as "one of the most beautiful and extensive cities of Yemen." Ibn was invited to a banquet with the king and received a warm and inviting welcome. &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Battuta, The Travels of Ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Islamic era===

Taiz was ruled by [[Turan-Shah]], the older brother of [[Saladin]], after he had conquered Yemen in 1173 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VYRtAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|title=A History of Egypt: Volume 6, In the Middle Ages|last=Lane-Poole|first=Stanley|date=2013-10-03|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781108065696|location=|pages=197|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city.&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. Caton: ''Yemen''. ABC-CLIO, 2013, p.52 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] by Turan-Shah.

The second [[Rasulid]] King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), established Taiz as the second capital of the Rasulid Dynasty after [[Zabid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=m2QjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT305|title=Yemen: The Unknown Arabia|last=Mackintosh-Smith|first=Tim|date=2014-06-03|publisher=The Overlook Press|year=|isbn=9781468309980|location=|pages=305|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1332 [[Ibn Battutah]] visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ro--tXw_hxMC&amp;pg=PA626|title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|last=|first=|date=1993|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004097961|location=|pages=626|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1500, the capital is moved to [[Sana'a]] by the ruler of the [[Tahirid dynasty|Taharid dynasty]]. In 1516 Taiz comes under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control.

===20th century===

In 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the new [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|independent Yemen]].

Taiz remained a walled city until 1948 when Imam Ahmed made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4uYpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=rasulid+ta'izz+OR+taiz&amp;dq=rasulid+ta'izz+OR+taiz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik_YzIkJbUAhUPOsAKHYpPAUoQ6AEIKDAA|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: TAHRIR-TARDJAMA|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|date=1998|publisher=Brill|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=118|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen is opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations move back to Sana'a.

===2011 Yemeni uprising===
During the [[Yemeni Revolution]] [[Battle of Taiz (2011)|fighting]] in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]].

As part of the [[Yemeni civil war (2015–present)|2015 Yemeni Civil War]], on 22 March 2015, the [[Houthis]] and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the [[Aftermath of the 2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|aftermath]] of their [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|coup d'état]] in [[Sana'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/middleeast/houthi-rebels-taiz-yemen.html?_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Rebels Seize Key Parts of Yemen’s Third-Largest City, Taiz|date=22 March 2015|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the city endured [[Battle of Taiz (2015–2016)|a military confrontation]] between [[Houthis]] and the forces loyal to [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]].

==Life==
Theodore Dwight was born March 3, 1796 in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].
His father was [[Theodore Dwight (elder)|Theodore Dwight]] (1764–1846) of the [[New England Dwight family]].  His mother was Abigail Alsop (1765–1846), the sister of [[Richard Alsop]] (1761–1815).&lt;ref name="dwight1"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Benjamin Woodbridge Dwight]] |title= The history of the descendants of John Dwight, of Dedham, Mass |volume= 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLfMU4yd1FYC&amp;pg=PA265 |pages= 231–234 |year=1874 |publisher=J.

'''Tsiang Tingfu''' ({{zh|c=蔣廷黻|p=Jiǎng Tíngfú|y=Jyang Tingfu}}; 17 February 1895 – 9 October 1965) who publish in English under the name '''T.F. Tsiang''', was a historian and diplomat of the Republic of China.

==Early life and education==
Tsiang was born in [[Shaoyang]] in [[Hunan Province]]. Tsiang's education from his teenage years had been Western and largely Christian, and he converted to Christianity at the age of 11. Having been urged to study in the U.S. by his teacher from a missionary school, in 1911, he was sent to study in the United States, where he attended the Park Academy, [[Oberlin College]] and [[Columbia University]]. His dissertation, "Labor and Empire: A Study of the Reaction of British Labor, Mainly as Represented in Parliament, to British Imperialism Since 1880," led him into issues in the relation of foreign relations and domestic politics which would structure his scholarship after he returned to China. After obtaining a Ph.D., he returned to China in 1923, where he first took up a position at [[Nankai University]] and then at [[Tsinghua University]].{{sfnb|Boorman|1967| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=khJL1MRLYfoC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=T.F.+Tsiang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fw5QTLof8u&amp;sig=O4M_mbmR_PvS2s1_p43B9wSLNQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjymuf_t_zbAhUl4YMKHbhaBJwQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=T.F.%20Tsiang&amp;f=false 354]}}
==Academic career==
[[File:Hu Shih and Tsiang Tingfu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hu Shih]] (right)  and Tsiang (left)]]At Tsinghua, Tsiang became the head of the History Department, where he edited and published a number of works on Chinese history and edited the English-language journal ''Chinese Social and Political Science Review''. Using newly opened Qing dynasty archives and diplomatic publications, Tsiang argued that China should adopt Western approaches if it wanted to score diplomatic victories. Tsiang blamed China's unequal treatment by Western powers after the [[First Opium War]] (1839–42) on the Chinese unequal treatment of Western powers before the war. During his tenure at Tsinghua, he mentored a number of historians in the study of [[Qing]] history, including [[John K. Fairbank]].&lt;ref&gt;"T.F. Tsiang and Modernization," John King Fairbank, ''China Bound: A Fifty Year Memoir'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1982), 85-93&lt;/ref&gt;
==Diplomatic career==
Following mounting tensions in China's relations with [[Japan]], Tsiang left academia in 1935 and joined the [[Chinese Nationalist]] government, which he served in many different capacities throughout the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. In 1945, Tsiang became the [[Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations]], and he subsequently also served as the ambassador of China to the United States. Following the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] on the Chinese mainland, Tsiang defended the exclusive right of the Taipei-based Republic of China to represent [[China and the United Nations|China in the United Nations]] and in the [[Security Council]]. He died of cancer in [[New York City]] on 9 October 1965, aged 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Events From Day to Day|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,4,29,31,31,45&amp;post=7081|accessdate=5 April 2018|work=Taiwan Today|date=1 November 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whitbread Engine''' preserved in the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], built in 1785, is one of the first rotative [[steam engine]]s ever built, and is the oldest surviving.&lt;ref name="travel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of Sydney|first=Arthur|last=Emerson|publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2001 |page=294 |isbn=0-8108-3999-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[rotative beam engine|rotative engine]] is a type of [[beam engine]] where the [[reciprocating motion]] of the beam is converted to [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotary motion]], producing a continuous power source suitable for driving machinery.

This engine was designed by the mechanical engineer [[James Watt]], manufactured for the firm [[Boulton and Watt]] and originally installed in the [[Whitbread]] [[brewery]] in [[London]], [[England]]. On decommissioning in 1887 it was sent to Australia's Powerhouse Museum (then known as the [[Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum]]) and has since been restored to full working order.

==History==

The engine was ordered by [[Samuel Whitbread (1720–1796)|Samuel Whitbread]] in 1784 to replace a [[horse mill|horse wheel]] at the [[Chiswell Street]] premises of his London brewery.&lt;ref &gt;{{coord|51|31|14.7|N|0|5|23.8|W|display=inline|name=Whitbread brewery}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was installed in 1785, the second steam engine to be installed in a brewery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London and the Thames Valley|page=232|first=Denis|last=Smith|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=2001|isbn=0-7277-2876-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enabled Whitbread to become the largest brewer in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUwhitbread.htm|title=Samuel Whitbread|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horse wheel was retained for many years, serving as a backup in case the steam engine broke down.&lt;ref name=phdatabase /&gt;
The [[drive gear]] of the engine, still evident today, was connected to a series of wooden [[line shaft]]s which drove machinery within the [[brewery]]. Connected machinery included rollers to crush [[malt]]; an [[Archimedes' screw]], that lifted the crushed malt into a [[chute (gravity)|hopper]]; a [[hoist (device)|hoist]], for lifting items into the building; a three-piston [[pump]], for pumping beer; and a stirrer within a vat. There was also a reciprocating pump connected to the engine's beam, used to pump water from a [[water well|well]] to a tank on the roof of the brewery.&lt;ref name=phdatabase /&gt;&lt;ref name=powerhouse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&amp;watt.asp|title=The Boulton and Watt engine – Powerhouse Museum description|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a marketing coup for both the brewer and the engine's manufacturer, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] visited the brewery on 24 May 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontourist.org/city%20walk%20one.html|title=The City Walk 1: Diamonds to Dungeons|publisher=The London Guide|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine remained in service for 102 years, until 1887.

The engine made its way to the Powerhouse Museum (then known as the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum) through [[Archibald Liversidge]], an English-born chemist, scientist and academic at the University of Sydney, who was a trustee of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050110b.htm|title=Liversidge, Archibald (1846–1927)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liversidge was in London in 1887, at the time of the engine's decommissioning, and when he heard that the engine was to be scrapped he asked whether it could be donated to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robotics|first=Joseph A.|last=Angelo|page=389|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2007|isbn=1-57356-337-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitbread &amp; Co agreed on condition that the engine be set up and used for educational purposes.&lt;ref name=phdatabase&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=7177|title=Object: Boulton and Watt steam engine, 1785|work=Powerhouse Museum Collection Search 2.4|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the engine was dismantled and shipped to Sydney on the sailing ship ''Patriarch''. For shipping purposes, the large flywheel was divided into two halves. While the flywheel's rim could be unbolted, the hub with attached spokes had to be drilled through and rejoined after shipping. A shortage of funds meant the engine was kept in storage for several years. Eventually the engine was erected in its own engine house, behind the main building at the museum's old Harris Street premises. During the 1920s or 1930s, an electric motor was added so that people could see the engine in motion. During the 1980s the Technology Restoration Society was formed in order to raise funds for the engine's restoration. Restoration took place at the Museum's Castle Hill site. During the restoration, some parts – including the piston – were replaced to preserve the original parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&amp;watt_teachers.php|title=Boulton and Watt engine – For Teachers|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A dynamic object", "The 'original' piston", Information displayed at the Powerhouse Museum, 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The engine, restored to steaming condition, was installed in the new Powerhouse Museum in 1988.&lt;ref name=phdatabase /&gt; Today the engine is sometimes operated as part of the Museum's Steam Revolution exhibition,&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Travellers in Time |first=George |last=Gunton |page=85|publisher=Oceans Enterprises|year=1996|isbn=0-9586657-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; steam being provided by the Museum's central [[boiler]].

==Technical specifications==
The engine has a {{convert|0.64|m|in}} diameter [[piston]] with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|sigfig=1}} long [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]], driven by a [[mean effective pressure]] of {{convert|70|kPa|psi|sigfig=1}}. Its top speed is 20 [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) of the flywheel. In the engine's youth, it had a maximum power output of approximately {{convert|26|kW|hp|lk=out}}.&lt;ref name=asme&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/Boulton_Watt_Rotative_Steam.cfm|title=Boulton &amp; Watt Rotative Steam Engine (1785)|publisher=asme.org|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It underwent a series of alterations in 1795, converting it from [[single-acting cylinder|single-acting]] to double-acting; it was alleged at the time that this conversion improved its power to {{convert|52|kW|hp}}, but the Powerhouse Museum claims this is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=320558|title=P1306 Photograph of drawing of beam engine made in 1785 by Boulton and Watt for Whitbread's brewery, London, England, 1880s – Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[centrifugal governor]], which moderates the level of steam provided if the engine begins to overload was added some years after this, and beam and main driving rod, both originally of wood, were replaced in sand-cast iron.&lt;ref name=asme/&gt;

Apart from its age, the engine is notable in that it embodies the four innovations which made Boulton &amp; Watt's engines a significant driver of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The first is a [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|separate condenser]], which increases the efficiency of the engine by allowing the main cylinder to remain hot at all times. The second is the [[parallel motion]], which converts the up-and-down motion of the piston into the arcing motion of the beam, whilst maintaining a rigid connection. The rigid connection allowed the engine to be double-acting, meaning the piston could push as well as pull the beam. Third is the [[centrifugal governor]], used to automatically regulate the speed of the engine. Finally the [[sun and planet gear]] convert the reciprocating motion of the beam into a rotating motion, which can be used to drive rotating machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Debbie|last=Rudder|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&amp;watt_transcript.asp|title=Transcript – Boulton and Watt|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy and society|first=Harold H.|last=Schobert|page=121|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|isbn=1-56032-767-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wide Area Tracking System''' (WATS) is a prototype [[wireless sensor network]] for detecting a ground-based nuclear device [http://www.llnl.gov/str/Imbro.html] such as a nuclear "briefcase bomb." WATS is being developed at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL).

==Theory==

WATS would be made up of wireless gamma and neutron sensors connected through a communications network. Data picked up by the sensors undergoes [[Sensor fusion|"data fusion"]], which converts the information into easily interpreted forms; this data fusion is the most important aspect of the system [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1997_h/has274010_1.htm#79]. 

The data fusion process occurs ''within'' the sensor network rather than at a centralized computer and is performed by a specially developed algorithm based on [[Bayesian statistics]][http://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug01/Hills.html].  WATS would not use a centralized computer for analysis because researchers found that factors such as latency and available bandwidth tended to create significant bottlenecks. Data processed in the field by the network itself (by transferring small amounts of data between neighboring sensors) is faster and makes the network more scalable [http://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug01/Hills.html]. 

An important factor in WATS development is ''ease of deployment'', since more sensors both improves the detection rate and reduces false alarms [http://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug01/Hills.html]. WATS sensors could be deployed in permanent positions or mounted in vehicles for mobile protection of specific locations.

One barrier to the implementation of WATS is the size, weight, energy requirements and cost of currently available wireless sensors [http://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug01/Hills.html]. The development of improved sensors is a major component of current research at the Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and International Security (NAI) Directorate at LLNL.

==History==

WATS was profiled to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives']] Military Research and Development Subcommittee on October 1, 1997 during a hearing on nuclear terrorism and countermeasures [http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/congress/1997_h/has274010_1.htm#79]. On August 4, 1998 in a subsequent meeting of that subcommittee, Chairman [[Curt Weldon]] stated that research funding for WATS had been cut by the Clinton administration to a subsistence level and that the program had been poorly re-organized [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/security/has216010.000/has216010_1.HTM#12].

The '''Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club''' (or simply the '''Woolhope Club''') is a [[learned society|society]] devoted to the [[natural history]], geology, [[archaeology]], and history of [[Herefordshire]], England.  Founded in 1851, it has had many notable members and played an important early role in the history of [[mycology]] in Britain.

==Foundation==
The Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club was founded in 1851 "for the practical study, in all its branches, of the Natural History of Herefordshire and the districts immediately adjacent". The club was and still is based in the city of [[Hereford]], but took its name from the Woolhope Dome, an outcrop of [[Silurian]] rocks around the village of [[Woolhope]] to the south-east of the city. The club's first field meeting was held in the Woolhope area.&lt;ref name=Trans&gt;Anon. (1856). ''Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club's ''Transactions'' have been published regularly since 1856, and early issues suggest that the membership took an interest not only in geology, but in [[fossils]], [[botany]], [[meteorology]], [[ichthyology]], and [[entomology]]. In 1856, the botanist [[George Bentham]] (who lived at [[Pontrilas]]) was an honorary member, as were the geologists the Rev. [[Peter Bellinger Brodie]], [[William Henry Fitton]], [[Leonard Horner]], Sir [[Charles Lyell]], Sir [[Roderick Murchison]], Prof. [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]], and the Rev. Prof. [[Adam Sedgwick]], the botanist [[John Lindley]], the naturalist [[Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet|Sir William Jardine]], and the zoologist Prof. [[Robert Edmond Grant|Robert E. Grant]]. The geologist the Rev. [[William Samuel Symonds]] was a founder member and president of the club in 1855.&lt;ref name = Trans/&gt;

In 1871, [[Sir James Rankin, 1st Baronet|Sir James Rankin]], a wealthy member of the club, offered to pay for a "Public Library and Museum in connection with the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club". This building, with natural history carvings and [[gargoyles]] on its frontage and a purpose-built meeting room for the club, was duly erected in Hereford in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, W. (1900). ''A Short History of Hereford'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the city's main public library, museum &amp; art gallery and the club's headquarters.

==The ''Herefordshire Pomona''==
Since Herefordshire was and is renowned for its [[cider]] and [[perry]], an early project of the club was to document and conserve local apple and pear [[cultivar]]s. To this end, the club held annual exhibitions of local fruit, inviting leading [[pomology|pomologists]] to help identify samples collected or submitted from local orchards. Under the enthusiastic direction of founder and past president of the club, Dr [[Henry Graves Bull]], two local artists, his daughter Edith Elizabeth Bull and Alice Blanche Ellis, were engaged to paint watercolours of the fruit, whilst an honorary member, Dr [[Robert Hogg (biologist)|Robert Hogg]], vice-president of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], wrote text to accompany the paintings. The result was the ''[[Herefordshire Pomona]]'', a major publication for the club, issued in parts between 1878 and 1884, with over 400 paintings reproduced as hand-coloured [[lithograph]]s.&lt;ref name=pomona&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcherapple.net/pomona.htm |title=The Herefordshire Pomona: A Brief History |publisher=Marcher Apple Network |work=Marcher Apple Network Rhwydwaith Afalau'r Gororau |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Herefordshire Pomona'' was an expensive work – and is now even more so, a copy being offered for $19,500 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquariatbotanicum.com/shop/botanicum/0000212 |title=The Herefordshire Pomona, Robert &amp; Bull Hogg, Henry Graves – Botany, Gardening, Color Plate, Herbals, Science, Exploration, Mathematics, Medicine |publisher=Antiquariat Botanicum |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the club wished the book to be of practical use, a revised but inexpensive version of the text, called ''The Apple and Pear as Vintage Fruits'', was published in 1886. The ''Pomona'' itself is now available on CD.&lt;ref name = pomona/&gt;

=="A foray among the funguses"==
Dr Henry Graves Bull also had an enthusiasm for fungi and in 1867 read a paper at a club meeting on some local, [[edible mushroom|edible]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bull |first=H. G. |year=1868 |title=Illustrations of the edible funguses of Herefordshire |journal=Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=149–169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have stimulated the interest of the club and in 1868, the October field meeting – announced as "a foray among the funguses" – was devoted to collecting fungi. The foray, led by the noted mycologist [[Worthington George Smith|Worthington G. Smith]] and local expert Edwin Lees, was followed by a special fungus dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anon |title=A foray among the funguses |journal=Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club |year=1868 |pages=184–192 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44662#page/254/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event proved popular and the "foray" was repeated annually till 1892.

These Woolhope fungus events became so well known that the word "foray" was widely adopted for mycological field meetings and remains the standard term today, not only in Britain but in North America and elsewhere. For a time, the club functioned as a precursor to the [[British Mycological Society]], bringing together a number of contemporary British mycologists, many of whom attended the forays and contributed papers to the ''Transactions''. By 1882, honorary members included the mycologists Rev. [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], [[Christopher Edmund Broome|C. E. Broome]], [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]], [[William Phillips (mycologist)|William Phillips]], [[Charles Bagge Plowright|C. B. Plowright]], Worthington G. Smith, and Rev. [[John Edward Vize|J. E. Vize]]. Ordinary members included Rev. [[William Leigh Williamson Eyre|W. L. W. Eyre]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (1888). ''Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club'' 1881–82: ix–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Old Straight Track''==
An attendee at the 1891 fungus foray was [[Alfred Watkins]], subsequently to become a president of the club. Watkins was a keen photographer and [[archaeologist]]. In June 1921, whilst mapping old sites near [[Blackwardine]], Watkins noticed some surprising alignments which suggested to him a series of prehistoric trackways marked by ancient [[landmarks]] some of which were still visible. Later that year, he delivered a talk to the club on "Early British Trackways" and after further researches published his thesis and his findings in ''[[The Old Straight Track]]'' (1925). His book was not well received by academics, but Watkins' theory of [[ley lines]] gained followers and a resurgence of interest in the 1970s, when it acquired a mystic dimension which would have surprised Watkins himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alfred Watkins: a Herefordshire Man |last=Shoesmith |first=Ron |year=1990 |publisher=Logaston Press |location=Woonton Almeley |isbn=978-0-9510242-7-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current activities==
The Woolhope Club still organises a series of field meetings each year, with special interest groups for archaeological research, geology, and natural history. To mark the 150th anniversary of the club a book, ''A Herefordshire Miscellany'', was published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Herefordshire Miscellany: Commemorating 150 Years of the Woolhope Club |editor1-last=Whitehead |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Eisel |editor2-first=John |year=2000 |publisher=Lapridge Publications |location=Hereford |isbn=978-1-899290-08-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dang Thuy Tram.jpg|thumb|Memorial statute to '''Đặng Thùy Trâm.''']]
'''Đặng Thùy Trâm''' (born November 26, 1942, in [[Huế]], [[Vietnam]]; died on June 22, 1970, in Đức Phổ, [[Quảng Ngãi Province]], Vietnam) was a Vietnamese doctor. She worked as a battlefield [[surgeon]] for the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] and [[Vietcong]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. At age 27, she and another colleague were killed by a patrol from the US 4th Battalion, [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]] in a [[Free-fire zone]] while traveling on a trail in the ''Ba Tơ'' jungle in [[Quảng Ngãi Province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=Max|title=Vietnam: An Epic Tragedy, 1945-1975|publisher=Harper|year=2018|isbn=9780062405661|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her wartime diaries, which chronicle the last two years of her life, attracted international attention following their publication in 2005.

== Diaries ==
One of Trâm's handwritten diaries was captured by US forces in December 1969. Following her death in a gun battle on June 22, 1970, a second diary was taken by [[Frederic Whitehurst|Frederic (Fred) Whitehurst]], a then 22-year-old military [[intelligence specialist]]. Whitehurst defied an order to burn the diaries, instead following the advice of a [[South Vietnam]]ese translator not to destroy them. He kept them for 35 years, with the intention of eventually returning them to Trâm's family.

After returning to the [[United States]], Whitehurst's search for Trâm's family initially proved unsuccessful. After earning a Ph.D. in [[chemistry]] he joined the [[FBI]], but was unable to reach anyone from the Vietnamese [[embassy]]. In March 2005, he and his brother Robert - another Vietnam veteran - brought the diaries to a conference at [[Texas Tech University]]. There, they met photographer Ted Engelmann (also a Vietnam veteran), who offered to look for the family during his trip to Vietnam. With the assistance of Do Xuan Anh, a staff member in the [[Hanoi]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] office, Engelmann was able to locate Trâm's mother, Doan Ngoc Tram, and subsequently reached the rest of her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vir.com.vn/Client/TimeOut/index.asp?url%3Dcontent.asp%26doc%3D7080 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627210351/http://www.vir.com.vn/Client/TimeOut/index.asp?url=content.asp&amp;doc=7080 |archivedate=June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Trâm's diaries were published in Vietnam under the title ''Nhật ký Đặng Thùy Trâm'' (''Đặng Thùy Trâm's Diary'' (''Last Night I Dreamed Of Peace'')), which quickly became a bestseller.
