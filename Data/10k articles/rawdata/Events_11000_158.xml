      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">The '''Alpha Monocerotids''' is a [[meteor shower]] with the international acronym '''AMO''' active in November, not to be confused with the [[Monocerotids|December Monocerotids]], international acronym '''MON'''. The swarm is visible every year from 15 to 25 November; its peak occurs on 21 or 22 November. The speed of its meteors is 65&amp;nbsp;km/s. Normally it has a low [[Zenithal Hourly Rate]] (ZHR), but occasionally it produces remarkable meteor storms that last less than an hour: such outbursts were observed in 1925, 1935, 1985, and 1995. [[Peter Jenniskens]] predicted the 1995 return based on the hypothesis that these outbursts were caused by the dust trail of a long period comet occasionally wandering in Earth's path due to planetary perturbations. During observations in southern Spain, assisted by a team of observers of the [[Dutch Meteor Society]], Jenniskens confirmed that the meteoroids were moving in a long-period comet orbit. The outburst of 1995 allowed researchers to determine the exact [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of the swarm and the [[solar longitude]] of its peak as well as to confirm the brevity of Alpha Monocerotids outbursts as less than one hour. The parent body, probably a long-period [[comet]], is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenniskens|first1=P.|last2=Betlem|first2=H.|last3=De Lignie|first3=M.|last4=Langbroek|first4=M.|year=1997|bibcode=1997ApJ...479..441J |title= The Detection of a Dust Trail in the Orbit of an Earth-threatening Long-Period Comet |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=479 |pages=441|doi = 10.1086/303853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
'''Antibiotic misuse''', sometimes called '''antibiotic abuse''' or '''antibiotic overuse''', refers to the misuse or overuse of [[antibiotic]]s, with potentially serious effects on health. It is a contributing factor to the development of [[antibiotic resistance]], including the creation of [[Antibiotic resistance|multidrug-resistant bacteria]], informally called "super bugs": relatively harmless bacteria (such as [[staphylococcus]], [[enterococcus]] and [[acinetobacter]]) can develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and cause life-threatening infections.&lt;ref name="pmid9643260"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1998|title=The beginning of the end of the antibiotic era? Part II. Proposed solutions to antibiotic abuse|journal=[[Quintessence International]]|volume=29|issue=4|pages=223–9|pmid=9643260|vauthors=Harrison JW, Svec TA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of antibiotic regulation==
Antibiotics have been around since 1928 when penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming. In the 1980s, antibiotics that were determined medically important for treatment of animals could be approved under veterinary oversight. In 1996, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) was established.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Food Insight | year = 2016 | title = FDA Antibiotic Regulation Through the Decades | url = http://www.foodinsight.org/fda-antibiotics-regulations-fact-sheet }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2010, publications regarding antimicrobial drugs in food become an annual report. Starting in 2012, there was publicly solicited input on how data is to be collected and reported for matters relating to the use of antimicrobials for food-producing animals. Resulting from this, the FDA revised its sampling structure within NARMS with the goal of obtaining more representative livestock data for the key organisms under surveillance.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"/&gt;  “NARMS partners at CDC and USDA have published over 150 peer-reviewed research articles examining the nature and magnitude of antimicrobial resistance hazards associated with antibiotic use in food-producing animals.” In 2014, the FDA began working with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  to explore additional mechanisms to obtain data that is representative of antibiotic use in food-producing animals. In 2015, the FDA issues the [[Veterinary Feed Directive]] (VFD) final rule. Under this rule veterinarians must authorize the use of antimicrobials within feed for the animals they serve.&lt;ref name="Food Insight 2016"/&gt;

===Antibiotics in livestock===
{{main|Antibiotic use in livestock}}
There has been massive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. The most abundant use of antimicrobials worldwide is in livestock; they are typically distributed in animal feed or water for purposes such as disease prevention and growth promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Industrial food animal production, antimicrobial resistance, and human health|year=2008|last1=Silbergeld|last2=Graham|last3=Price|first1=E.K.|first2=J.|first3=L.B.|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=29|pages=151–169|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090904|pmid=18348709}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Debates have arisen surrounding the extent of the impact of these antibiotics, particularly antimicrobial growth promoters, on human antibiotic resistance. Although some sources assert that there remains a lack of knowledge on which antibiotic use generates the most risk to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A review of antibiotic use in food animals: Perspective, policy, and potential|year=2012|last1=Landers|last2=Cohen|last3=Wittum|last4=Larson|first1=T.F.|first2=B.|first3=T.E.|first4=E.L.|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=127|issue=1|pages=4–22|doi=|pmc=3234384|pmid=22298919}}&lt;/ref&gt; policies and regulations have been placed to limit any harmful effects, such as the potential of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance within livestock, and that bacteria transferring resistance genes to human pathogens &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/09/are-antibiotics-turning-livestock-superbug-factories&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 1, 2017, the FDA enacted legislation to require that all human medically important feed-grade antibiotics (many prior over-the-counter-drugs) become classified as Veterinary Feed Directive drugs (VFD).  This action requires that farmers establish and work with veterinaries to receive a written VFD order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Beth Ferry, Madonna Benjamin, Michigan State University Extension and Megan Sprague, MDARD | year = 2016 | title = Don’t wait, be ready!

Through this relationship, farmers will receive an increased education in the form of advice and guidance from their veterinarian.

'''April in Paris Ball''' was an annual US gala event whose mission was to serve charity and Franco-American relations.{{sfn|Time Inc|1957|p=201}} Established in 1952 at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]] in [[New York City]], it was the idea of [[Claude Philippe]], the hotel's banquet manager, who enlisted [[Elsa Maxwell]] to help organize it.

The first event was a celebration of the 2,000th birthday of the city of Paris and was held in 1951.  When it was decided to make the ball an annual event, the name was changed to the April in Paris Ball.

==Organization==
[[File:Maxwell, Elsie - by Carl van Vechten.jpg|thumb|upright|Organizer [[Elsa Maxwell]]]]
The April in Paris Ball was the brainchild of [[Claude Philippe]], the banquet manager of the prestigious Waldorf Astoria, with the chief goal being to improve Franco-American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide assistance to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. The first ball was called the Paris Birthday Ball and was held on May 7, 1951.  When the ball became an annual event, its name became the April in Paris Ball.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|pp=225-226}} While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by [[socialites]].{{sfn|Time Inc|1960|p=90}} [[Elsa Maxwell]] was given the primary responsibility in organizing it.{{sfn|Avery|2010|p=50}} Mrs. William C. T. Gaynor served as general chairman of the ball in 1954-57.{{sfn|Time Inc|1957|p=201}}

It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October because "Mr. Philippe decided that because there are so many balls in the spring he would make it in October".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=225}} After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the [[Hotel Astor]] in 1960, the [[Seventh Regiment Armory]] in 1961, and other venues.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=235}}

The ball was designed to cater for "very, very high-class people" according to Vaccaro.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} In the 1960 event, prizes given included a [[Ford Thunderbird]] car, a [[Chinchilla]] coat, a [[Renault Dauphine]], a TV [[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]] system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags and a pedigree poodle, with gift boxes given to guests which included gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver bottle openers, hats and scarves, and flowers.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=235}} Every guest was said to have gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes were given out.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}} Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from tax, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the [[American Cancer Society]], with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people were paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated "We charge the most, give the most, and make the most — it's a success formula".{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=226}} Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=227}}

A spectacular of six tableaux were put on, consisting of ''Le Moyen Age'', with costumes by [[Marcel Rochas]], ''Le Cardinal aux Chats'', with costumes by [[Jacques Fath]], ''Dans les Jardins de Marly'', with costumes by [[Jeanne Lanvin]], ''Les Chinois a Versailles'', with costumes by [[Nina Ricci (designer)|Nina Ricci]] and [[Arturo López Willshaw]], ''Cendrillon de Paris'', a fashion show featuring gowns by [[Balenciaga]], Balmain, Desses, [[Diro]], Fath, Givenchy, [[Gres]], [[Jeanne Lanvin|Lanvin]], [[Patou]] and [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]] and hats by [[Gilbert Orcel]], [[Legroux Soeurs]], [[Paulette (name)|Paulette]] and [[Caroline Reboux]], and finally a ''François Rabelais'' play, starring [[Walter Slezak]] as Rabelais, [[Tom Ewell]] as Panurge, [[Betsy von Furstenberg]] as Lady Dantern, [[Albert Hecht]] as Friar John, and [[John Cromwell (actor)|John Cromwell]] as Bird.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=228}}  The [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] provided a gymnast, dwarf, a juggler, a gargantua and animals. [[Roger Dunn]], [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Reginald Gardiner]] were invited to conduct the master of ceremonies, with special mention to French actress [[Suzy Delair]].{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|pp=228-9}} Furniture, tapestries and banners from 17th and 18th century France were provided by French &amp; Co., Lace and Tulle by the Federation Nationale Francaise de Dentelles Tulles Broderies et Passementeries, and jewels by [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]].

The 1959 ball, the final one to be held at the Waldorf on 10 April 1959, centred around the theme of the Parisian circus of the 18th century. 1000 people attended, paying $150 per ticket.&lt;ref name="NH"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dietrich Makes Singing Debut at Society Circus|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1591418/marlene_dietrich_at_april_in_paris_ball/|newspaper=[[The News-Herald (Franklin, Pennsylvania)|The News-Herald]]|date=11 April 1959|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|location=Franklin, Pennsylvania }}

Cecil Beaton designed a big top of ruby velvet with a "hedge of colored fountains" and thousands of purple flowers.&lt;ref name="NH"/&gt;

===1960===
Due to conflict between Philippe and the Waldorf-Astoria staff, he was exiled from the Waldorf in 1960, and the ball was moved to the Hotel Astor that year, where the likes of Dietrich, [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Joan Crawford]] and organizer Elsa Maxwell helped transform it into the [[Paris Opera House]].{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=231}}  A photomural of the Paris Opera House was "mounted on plywood and superimposed in front of Astor Hotel creating the illusion of [the] actual opera house", and photomurals of the interior completed the transformation.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=235}} Held on 9 April 1960 under the title of ''Un Bal Masque a l'Opéra de Paris'', the show featured a series of tableaux entitled ''L'Elegance de Paris'', with costumes by [[Revillon]], ''La Couture'', with designs by [[Pierre Cardin]], Jean Desses, [[Christian Dior]], Gres, [[Jacques Heim]], [[Hermès]], [[Guy LaRoche]], Nina Ricci and Jean Patou, ''La Couleur Opera'', featuring "La Cabaret de l'Aurore" and the [[Lester Lanin]] orchestra and the US premiere of the 1735 [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] French opera-ballet "[[Les Indes Galantes]]", starring [[Mony Dalmes]], [[Jean-Pierre Aumont]] and [[Jean Jacques Strauss]], ''Les Fleurs'', with Parisian and European opera and ballet stars such as [[Claude Besny]], [[Pierre LaCotte]], [[George Zoritch]], [[Judith Raskin]], and [[Madeleine Rizzo]], and finally ''Les Savages &amp; La Chaconne'', featuring [[Cathryn Damon]], [[Dorothy Straiger]], [[Constance Carpenter]], [[Gretchen Wyler]], [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Myles Easton]].{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|pp=232-3}}

===Later balls===
Several ball committee members felt that the name of the ball should be changed, since it was no longer held in April, but in the fall.  In 1968, the ball's name was changed to Bal de l'Amitie.  The new name lasted only one year and it once more became known as the April in Paris ball in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/06/04/archives/its-the-april-in-paris-ball-again-after-a-year-as-bal-de-lamitie.html|title=It's the April in Paris Ball Again After a Year as Bal de l'Amitie|date=4 June 1969|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=27 January 2014}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moune de Rival]] was invited to the 1970 event,{{sfn|Johnson Publishing Company|1970|p=44}} while in 1973, [[Josephine Baker]] was its star.{{sfn|Baker|Chase|2001|p=460}} [[Russell Edwards]] of ''The New York Times'' stated that even in 1974 the Paris Ball "remains the most prestigious, with its national and international guest list, but not necessarily the most social".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charity Balls|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55910079/?terms=Waldorf+Astoria|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=10 February 1974|page=76|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|location=Kansas City, Missouri}}

'''Benjamin Franklin Dillingham''' (September 4, 1844 – April 7, 1918) was a businessman and industrialist during the late [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] era, throughout the period of the [[Republic of Hawaii]], and during the first two decades of the [[Territory of Hawaii]].

==Early life==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Dillingham (1844–1918).jpg|thumb]]
Dillingham was born on September 4, 1844 into an old [[New England]] family in Brewster, on [[Cape Cod]] in [[Massachusetts]]. His father was Benjamin C. Dillingham and mother was Lydia Sears Howes. At the age of fourteen he became a sailor on the Yankee [[clipper]] ''Southern Cross'' which was captured and destroyed by the Confederate steamer ''Florida'' in 1863 during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1865 he became first mate of a [[barque]] named ''Whistler'' that did a regular run between [[San Francisco]] and [[Honolulu]]. On his third trip to the island kingdom, Dillingham broke his leg after falling from a horse and was forced to convalesce in Hawaii.

==Later life==
He decided to stay in Honolulu and by the end of 1865 was a clerk at Diamond Hardware, which he bought out for $28,000 in 1869. On April 26, 1869 he married Emma Louise Smith (1844–1920), of a prominent missionary family. She was the daughter of Reverend Lowell Smith and Abigail Willis Tenney.&lt;ref name="Tenney"&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Tenney |title=The Tenney family, or, the descendants of Thomas Tenney, of Rowley, Massachusetts, 1638-1890 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0y9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=321 |origyear=1891 |year=1904 |publisher=Rumford Press |pages=321–322 |location=Concord, NH |oclc=3548663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillingham turned out to be an astute businessman, and more importantly, was always willing to take risks. In 1879 he started a dairy farm in upper Honolulu, and during the 1880s became increasingly successful. He founded the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] (OR&amp;L) that began service in November 1889. Dillingham was well liked among Honolulu's various communities, and he included [[Kalakaua|King Kalākaua]] and [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] as his friends. Although he disapproved of the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1893, he looked favorably on the American annexation in 1898, which he believed would bring long-term stability to the islands. Dillingham spent the rest of his life in Hawaii.

Apart from the OR&amp;L, Dillingham was especially active in sugarcane plantations, including the Ola{{okina}}a Sugar Company on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]], and the Ewa and Kahuku sugarcane plantations on Oahu. While the OR&amp;L and these sugar companies were profitable, Dillingham's Big Island railroad, the [[Hawaii Consolidated Railway]] (Hilo Railroad) was a financial drain until its destruction by a tsunami in 1946. His Hawaiian Fiber Company, which operated a sisal plantation on the Ewa coral plain in southwestern Oahu, was ultimately also a failure. Nevertheless, Dillingham was one of the major business people in the early years of Hawaii's economic and industrial development.

He died on April 7, 1918 and was buried in [[Oahu Cemetery]]. Two days before, [[James Bicknell Castle]], a distant cousin of his wife and a partner in sugarcane plantation ventures, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Correspondence from Hawaii: Death of Three Prominent Sugar Men |newspaper=Sugar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MnmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 |date=May 1918 |pages=197–198 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Beet Sugar Gazette Company |id={{OCLC|564763518|6392606}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Walter F.

His wife Emma Louise Smith Dillingham wrote a book of poetry on [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diamond Head |first= Emma Louise Smith |last=Dillingham |location=Honolulu? |oclc=647051940 |url=https://archive.org/details/diamondhead00dilliala |year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Mary Emma (known as May) Dillingham married [[Walter Francis Frear]] (1863–1948) who became Governor of the [[Territory of Hawaii]] 1907–1913.&lt;ref name="Frear1934"&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Emma Dillingham |last=Frear |title=Lowell and Abigail: A Realistic Idyll  |page=307 |year=1934 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher= Yale University Press |oclc=4970978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The next governor from 1913 to 1918, [[Lucius Pinkham]], was a Democrat, although he had worked for Dillingham at OR&amp;L 1892–1894 and as manager of his hardware company 1898–1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/373 |title= The Controversial Appointment of Lucius Eugene Pinkham, Hawaii's First Democratic Governor |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 17 |authorlink=H.

Two sons died young, Charles Augustus Dillingham (1872–1874) and Alfred Hubbard Dillingham (1880–1880).
Youngest son Harold Garfield Dillingham (October 9, 1881 – December 19, 1971) married Margaret Bayard Hyde-Smith in 1908 and had 5 children.

[[File:Money_supply_during_the_great_depression_era.png|thumb|right| Money supply decreased significantly between [[Black Tuesday]], October 24, 1929, and the [[Emergency Banking Act|Bank Holiday in March 1933]] when there were massive [[bank runs]] across the United States.]]
The '''causes of the Great Depression''' in the early 20th century have been extensively discussed by economists and remain a matter of active debate. They are part of the larger debate about [[economic crises]]. The specific economic events that took place during the [[Great Depression]] are well established. There was an initial stock market crash that triggered a "panic sell-off" of assets. This was followed by a [[deflation]] in asset and [[commodity]] prices, dramatic drops in demand and credit, and disruption of trade, ultimately resulting in widespread unemployment (over 13 million people were unemployed by 1932) and impoverishment. However, economists and historians have not reached a consensus on the [[causal relationship]]s between various events and government economic policies in causing or ameliorating the Depression.

Current [[mainstream economics|mainstream]] theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view. The first are the demand-driven theories, from [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[institutional economics|institutional economists]] who argue that the depression was caused by a widespread loss of confidence that led to [[underconsumption]]. The demand-driven theories argue that the [[financial crisis]] following the 1929 crash led to a sudden and persistent reduction in consumption and investment spending.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money therefore became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand.

Second, there are the [[Monetarism|monetarists]], who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the [[Federal Reserve]]) caused a shrinking of the [[money supply]] which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this explanation are those who point to [[debt deflation]] causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms.

There are also several various [[heterodox economics|heterodox theories]] that reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. Some [[New classical macroeconomics|new classical macroeconomists]] have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression. The [[Austrian School|Austrian school of economics]] focuses on the [[macroeconomic]] effects of [[money supply]] and how [[central bank]]ing decisions can lead to [[malinvestment]]. [[Marxian economics|Marxist economists]] view the Great Depression, [[Crisis theory|with all other economic crises]], as a symptom of the cyclical nature of capitalism and the instability  that is inherent in the capitalist model.

==General theoretical reasoning==
The two classical competing theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian (demand-driven) and the monetarist explanation. There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists.

Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;Robert Whaples, [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions"], ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 150 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of [[Milton Friedman]] and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.

There is consensus that the [[Federal Reserve System]] should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse. If the Fed had done that, the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf  "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions"], ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 143 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream theories===

====Keynesian====
In his book ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936), British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] introduced concepts that were intended to help explain the Great Depression. He argued that there are reasons why the self-correcting mechanisms that many economists claimed should work during a downturn might not work.

One argument for a non-interventionist policy during a [[recession]] was that if consumption fell due to savings, the savings would cause the rate of interest to fall. According to the classical economists, lower interest rates would lead to increased investment spending and demand would remain constant. However, Keynes argues that there are good reasons why investment does not necessarily increase in response to a fall in the interest rate. Businesses make investments based on expectations of profit. Therefore, if a fall in consumption appears to be long-term, businesses analyzing trends will lower expectations of future sales. Therefore, the last thing they are interested in doing is investing in increasing future production, even if lower interest rates make capital inexpensive. In that case, the economy can be thrown into a general slump due to a decline in consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Keen 2000, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keynes, this self-reinforcing dynamic is what occurred to an extreme degree during the Depression, where [[bankruptcy|bankruptcies]] were common and investment, which requires a degree of optimism, was very unlikely to occur. This view is often characterized by economists as being in opposition to [[Say's Law]].

The idea that reduced capital investment was a cause of the depression is a central theme in [[secular stagnation theory]].

Keynes argued that if the national government spent more money to help the economy to recover the money normally spent by consumers and business firms, then unemployment rates would fall. The solution was for the Federal Reserve System to "create new money for the national government to borrow and spend" and to cut taxes rather than raising them, in order for consumers to spend more, and other beneficial factors.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Caldwell, J., &amp; O'Driscoll, T. G. (2007). What Caused the Great Depression?. Social Education, 71(2), 70-74&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover chose to do the opposite of what Keynes thought to be the solution and allowed the federal government to raise taxes exceedingly to reduce the budget shortage brought upon by the depression. Keynes proclaimed that more workers could be employed by decreasing interest rates, encouraging firms to borrow more money and make more products. Employment would prevent the government from having to spend any more money by increasing the amount at which consumers would spend. Keynes' theory was then confirmed by the length of the Great Depression within the United States and the constant unemployment rate. Employment rates began to rise in preparation for World War II by increasing government spending. "In light of these developments, the Keynesian explanation of the Great Depression was increasingly accepted by economists, historians, and politicians".&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt;

====Monetarist====
[[File:Great Depression monetary policy.png|thumb|The Great Depression in a monetary view.]]
In their 1963 book ''[[A Monetary History of the United States|A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960]]'', [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] laid out their case for a different explanation of the Great Depression. Essentially, the Great Depression, in their view, was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz write: "From the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third." The result was what Friedman and Schwartz called "The [[Great Contraction]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted money supply. Friedman and Schwartz argue that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. As a result, people hoarded money by consuming less. This caused a contraction in employment and production since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. The Fed's failure was in not realizing what was happening and not taking corrective action.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman (Feb. 3, 2007), [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19857 "Who Was Milton Friedman?"], ''New York Review of Books''&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, [[Ben Bernanke]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Bernanke (Nov. 8, 2002), [http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm FederalReserve.gov: "Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke"], Conference to Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Regarding%20the%20Great%20Depression%20You're%20right%20We%20did%20it%22|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
— Ben S. Bernanke&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Depression, the primary explanations of it tended to ignore the importance of the money supply. However, in the monetarist view, the Depression was "in fact a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz|title=The Great Contraction, 1929–1933 (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lCArZfazBkC&amp;q=%22The%20contraction%20is%20in%20fact%20a%20tragic%20testimonial%20to%20the%20importance%20of%20monetary%20forces.%22|year=2008|pages=xviii, 13|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the failure of the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to deal with the Depression was not a sign that monetary policy was impotent, but that the Federal Reserve implemented the wrong policies. They did not claim the Fed ''caused'' the depression, only that it failed to use policies that might have stopped a recession from turning into a depression.

The U.S. economy during this period went through a number of cycles of boom and bust. The depressions often seemed to be set off by bank panics, the most significant occurring in 1873, 1893, 1901, 1907, and 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://butnowyouknow.wordpress.com/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/history-of-economic-downturns-in-the-us/ "The History of Economic Downturns in the U.S."], But Now You Know.net&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Federal Reserve Act|1913 establishment of the Federal Reserve]], the banking system had dealt with these crises in the U.S. (such as in the [[Panic of 1907]]) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. Starting in 1893, there were growing efforts by financial institutions and business men to intervene during these crises, providing liquidity to banks that were suffering runs. During the banking panic of 1907, an ad-hoc coalition assembled by [[J. P. Morgan]] successfully intervened in this way, thereby cutting off the panic, which was likely the reason why the depression that would normally have followed a banking panic did not happen this time.  A call by some for a government version of this solution resulted in the establishment of the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Cite book | title = The Panic of 1907: Lessons Learned from the Market's Perfect Storm | last = Bruner | first = Robert F. | last2 = Carr | first2 = Sean D. | year = 2007 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, New Jersey | isbn = 978-0-470-15263-8 | ref = harv | url= https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Panic_of_1907.html?id=dOMpE4zDZJIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But in 1928–32, the Federal Reserve did not act to provide liquidity to banks suffering [[bank run]]s. In fact, its policy contributed to the banking crisis by permitting a sudden contraction of the money supply. During the [[Roaring Twenties]], the central bank had set as its primary goal "price stability", in part because the governor of the New York Federal Reserve, [[Benjamin Strong]], was a disciple of [[Irving Fisher]], a tremendously popular economist who popularized stable prices as a monetary goal. It had kept the number of dollars at such an amount that prices of goods in society appeared stable. In 1928, Strong died, and with his death this policy ended, to be replaced with a [[real bills doctrine]] requiring that all currency or securities have material goods backing them. This policy permitted the U.S. [[money supply]] to fall by over a third from 1929 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Timberlake (August 2005), [http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/TimberlakeIntellectualTyrannyAugust2005.pdf "Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy"], ''Econ Journal Watch'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910125855/http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/TimberlakeIntellectualTyrannyAugust2005.pdf |date=2005-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When this money shortage caused runs on banks, the Fed maintained its true bills policy, refusing to lend money to the banks in the way that had cut short the 1907 panic, instead allowing each to suffer a catastrophic run and fail entirely. This policy resulted in a series of bank failures in which one-third of all banks vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker (2003), [https://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections_on_the_Great_Depression.html?id=0X64AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=one-third ''Reflections on the Great Depression''], Elgar Publishing {{ISBN|978-1843763352}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ben Bernanke]], the subsequent credit crunches led to waves of bankruptcies.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Bernanke (1983), [http://www.nber.org/papers/w1054 "Non-monetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great Depression"], ''American Economic Review'' . Am 73#3 257–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman said that if a policy similar to 1907 had been followed during the banking panic at the end of 1930, perhaps this would have stopped the vicious circle of the forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices. Consequently, the banking panics of 1931, 1932, and 1933 might not have happened, just as suspension of convertibility in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the liquidity crises at the time."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman 2007, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monetarist explanations had been rejected in Samuelson's work ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', writing "Today few economists regard Federal Reserve monetary policy as a panacea for controlling the business cycle. Purely monetary factors are considered to be as much symptoms as causes, albeit symptoms with aggravating effects that should not be completely neglected."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Samuelson|1948|loc=p. 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keynesian economist [[Paul Krugman]], the work of Friedman and Schwartz became dominant among [[mainstream economists]] by the 1980s but should be reconsidered in light of Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]] of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, blog (Dec. 14, 2009), [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/samuelson-friedman-and-monetary-policy/ "Samuelson, Friedman, and monetary policy"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The role of monetary policy in financial crises is in active debate regarding the [[2007–12 global financial crisis]]; see [[Causes of the 2007–12 global financial crisis]].

====Additional modern nonmonetary explanations====
The monetary explanation has two weaknesses. First, it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, [http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/jolson/ECON315/Whaples2123771.pdf "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions"], ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (March 1995), p. 150, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Second, it is not able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the Money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.

=====Debt deflation=====

[[File:Crowd outside nyse.jpg|thumb|Crowd gathering on [[Wall Street]] after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 crash]].]]
{{main|Debt deflation}}

Total debt to GDP levels in the U.S. reached a high of just under 300% by the time of the Depression. This level of debt was not exceeded again until near the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnmauldin.com/images/uploads/pdf/mwo071811.pdf] Several graphs of total debt to GDP can be found on the Internet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome (1934) gives an unattributed quote about finance conditions that allowed the great industrial expansion of the post WW I period:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Probably never before in this country had such a volume of funds been available at such low rates for such a long period.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Jerome says that the volume of new capital issues increased at a 7.7% compounded annual rate from 1922–29 at a time when the Standard Statistics Co.'s index of 60 high grade bonds yielded from 4.98% in 1923 to 4.47% in 1927.

There was also a real estate and housing bubble in the 1920s, especially in Florida, which burst in 1925. [[Alvin Hansen]] stated that housing construction during the 1920s decade exceeded population growth by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Irving Fisher]] argued the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was over-indebtedness and deflation. Fisher tied loose credit to over-indebtedness, which fueled speculation and asset bubbles.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Irving|date= October 1933|title=The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions|journal=Econometrica|volume=1| pages=337–357|doi=10.2307/1907327|issue=4|publisher=The Econometric Society|jstor=1907327|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off
# A fall in the level of asset prices
# A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies
# A fall in profits
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment.
# Pessimism and loss of confidence
# Hoarding of money
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates.''&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt;

During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.&lt;ref name="Margin Requirements"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fortune|first=Peter|date=Sep–Oct 2000|title= Margin Requirements, Margin Loans, and Margin Rates: Practice and Principles – analysis of history of margin credit regulations – Statistical Data Included|journal=New England Economic Review|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3937/is_2000_Sept-Oct/ai_80855422/pg_3/?tag=content;col1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $90 for every $10 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple [[bank run]]s. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-22|url=http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/money_08.html|title=Bank Failures|publisher=Living History Farm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090219185825/http://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe30s/money_08.html|archive-date=2009-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s.) By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the [[Emergency Banking Act|March Bank Holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman and Schwartz, ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', p.352&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans, which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, [[Investment|capital investment]] and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.&lt;ref name="lhf-30s"/&gt; Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious cycle]] developed and the downward spiral accelerated.

The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.&lt;ref name="Fisher33"/&gt; This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.

Fisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.

Building on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, [[Ben Bernanke]] developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered [[aggregate demand]], a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Randall E. Parker (2003), [https://books.google.com/books/about/Reflections_on_the_Great_Depression.html?id=0X64AAAAIAAJ ''Reflections on the Great Depression''], Edward Elgar Publishing {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernanke83"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernanke|first=Ben S|date=June 1983|title=Non-Monetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great Depression|journal=The American Economic Review|publisher=The American Economic Association|volume=73|issue=3|pages=257–276|ref=harv|jstor=1808111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishkin78"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0022050700087167|last=Mishkin|first= Fredric|date=December 1978|title=The Household Balance and the Great Depression|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=38|issue=4|pages=918–37|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Expectations hypothesis =====
Expectations have been a central element of macroeconomic models since the economic mainstream accepted the [[new neoclassical synthesis]]. While not rejecting that it was inadequate demand that sustained the depression, according to [[Peter Temin]], Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and [[Christina Romer]] the key to recovery and the end of the Great Depression was the successful management of public expectations. This thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession, important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933, just as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment as planned. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.&lt;ref name="aeaweb.org"&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1476 ''Great Expectations and the End of the Depression''], American Economic Review 2008, 98:4, 1476–1516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;The New York Times, Christina Romer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/business/how-the-fiscal-stimulus-helped-and-could-have-done-more.html The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable], October 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, ''Lessons from the Great Depression'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|97802620261197}}, p. 87-101&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recession of 1937–38]], which slowed down economic recovery from the great depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 would be first steps to a restoration of the pre March 1933 policy regime.&lt;ref&gt;Gauti B. Eggertsson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29730131 Great Expectations and the End of the Depression], The American Economic Review, Vol. 98, No. 4 (Sep., 2008), S. 1476-1516, p. 1480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterodox theories===

====Austrian School====
Austrian economists argue that the Great Depression was the inevitable outcome of the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve during the 1920s. In their opinion, the central bank's policy was an "easy credit policy" which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom. In the Austrian view, the inflation of the money supply during this period led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and [[capital goods]]. By the time the Federal Reserve belatedly tightened monetary policy in 1928, it was too late to avoid a significant economic contraction.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2000), pp. 159–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that government intervention after the crash of 1929 delayed the market's adjustment and made the road to complete recovery more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, ''America's Great Depression'', pp. 19–21"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mises| first =Ludwig von | title =The Causes of the Economic Crisis; and Other Essays Before and After the Great Depression| publisher = [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]| date =2006| pages =207| url =https://mises.org/library/causes-economic-crisis-and-other-essays-and-after-great-depression| isbn =978-1933550039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acceptance of the Austrian explanation of what primarily caused the Great Depression is compatible with either acceptance or denial of the Monetarist explanation. Austrian economist [[Murray Rothbard]], who wrote ''[[America's Great Depression]]'' (1963), rejected the Monetarist explanation. He criticized Milton Friedman's assertion that the central bank failed to sufficiently increase the supply of money, claiming instead that the Federal Reserve did pursue an inflationary policy when, in 1932, it purchased $1.1 billion of government securities, which raised its total holding to $1.8 billion. Rothbard says that despite the central bank's policies, "total bank reserves only rose by $212 million, while the total money supply fell by $3 billion". The reason for this, he argues, is that the American populace lost faith in the banking system and began hoarding more cash, a factor very much beyond the control of the Central Bank. The potential for a run on the banks caused local bankers to be more conservative in lending out their reserves, which, according to Rothbard's argument, was the cause of the Federal Reserve's inability to inflate.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, ''[[A History of Money and Banking in the United States (book)|A History of Money and Banking in the United States]]'', pp. 293–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] had criticised the FED and the Bank of England in the 1930s for not taking a more contractionary stance.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cunningham Wood]], Robert D. Wood, ''Friedrich A. Hayek'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004, {{ISBN|9780415310574}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1975, Hayek admitted that he made a mistake in the 1930s in not opposing the Central Bank's deflationary policy and stated the reason why he had been ambivalent: "At that time I believed that a process of deflation of some short duration might break the rigidity of wages which I thought was incompatible with a functioning economy.&lt;ref name="WhiteClash"&gt;White, ''Clash of Economic Ideas, p. 94.  See also{{Cite journal|first=Lawrence|last=White|title=Did Hayek and Robbins Deepen the Great Depression?|journal=Journal of Money, Credit and Banking |volume=40|issue=40|pages=751–768|year=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00134.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he made it clear that he agreed with the point of view of the Monetarists, saying, "I agree with Milton Friedman that once the Crash had occurred, the Federal Reserve System pursued a silly deflationary policy", and that he was as opposed to deflation as he was to inflation.&lt;ref name="A. Hayek 2009"&gt;F. A. Hayek, interviewed by Diego Pizano July, 1979 published in: Diego Pizano, ''Conversations with Great Economists:  Friedrich A. Hayek, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, Leonid V. Kantorovich, Joan Robinson, Paul A.Samuelson, Jan Tinbergen'' (Jorge Pinto Books, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Concordantly, economist [[Lawrence H. White|Lawrence White]] argues that the [[Austrian business cycle theory|business cycle theory]] of Hayek is inconsistent with a monetary policy which permits a severe contraction of the money supply.

[[Hans Sennholz]] argued that most boom and busts that plagued the American economy in 1819–20, 1839–43, 1857–60, 1873–78, 1893–97, and 1920–21, were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit, which was soon followed by the inevitable bust. The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge Administration]]. The passing of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]], the passage of [[The Federal Reserve Act]], rising government deficits, the  passage of the [[Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act]], and the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], exacerbated the crisis, prolonging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fee.org/articles/the-great-depression/|title=The Great Depression|accessdate=October 23, 2016|work=[[Foundation for Economic Education]]|first=Hans|last=Sennholz|date=October 1, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific theories of cause==

===Non-debt deflation===
In addition to the debt deflation there was a component of productivity deflation that had been occurring since [[The Great Deflation]] of the last quarter of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Bell 1940"/&gt; There may have also been a continuation of the correction to the sharp inflation caused by WW I.

Oil prices reached their all-time low in the early 1930s as production began from the [[East Texas Oil Field]], the largest field ever found in the lower 48 states. With the oil market oversupplied prices locally fell to below ten cents per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Productivity or technology shock===
In the first three decades of the 20th century productivity and economic output surged due in part to [[electrification]], [[mass production]] and the increasing motorization of transportation and farm machinery. [[Electrification]] and [[mass production]] techniques such as [[Fordism]] permanently lowered the demand for labor relative to economic output.&lt;ref name="Beaudreau 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vatter_et_al"/&gt;  By the late 1920s the resultant rapid growth in productivity and investment in manufacturing meant there was a considerable excess production capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudreau (1996) cites capacity utilization at 84-86%, which would be a decent number today; however, there were some industrial leaders who complained of overcapacity, as did Senator Smoot.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after the peak of the business cycle in 1923, more workers were displaced by productivity improvements than growth in the employment market could meet, causing unemployment to slowly rise after 1925.&lt;ref name="Beaudreau 1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression |last=Beaudreau |first=Bernard C. |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Authors Choice Press|location=New York, Lincoln, Shanghi |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wages did not keep up with productivity growth, which led to the problem of [[underconsumption]].&lt;ref name="Beaudreau 1996"/&gt;

[[Henry Ford]] and [[Edward A. Filene]] were among prominent businessmen who were concerned with [[overproduction]] and [[underconsumption]]. Ford doubled wages of his workers in 1914. The over-production problem was also discussed in Congress, with Senator [[Reed Smoot]] proposing an import tariff, which became the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]]. The Smoot–Hawley Tariff was enacted in June, 1930.  The tariff was misguided because the U.S. had been running a trade account surplus during the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Beaudreau 1996"/&gt;

Another effect of rapid technological change was that after 1910 the rate of capital investment slowed, primarily due to reduced investment in business structures.&lt;ref name="Vatter_et_al"&gt;{{ Cite journal

In the book ''Mechanization in Industry'', whose publication was sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Jerome (1934) noted that whether mechanization tends to increase output or displace labor depends on the elasticity of demand for the product.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt; In addition, reduced costs of production were not always passed on to consumers. It was further noted that agriculture was adversely affected by the reduced need for animal feed as horses and mules were displaced by inanimate sources of power following WW I. As a related point, Jerome also notes that the term "[[technological unemployment]]" was being used to describe the labor situation during the depression.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;

The prices of agricultural products began to decline after WW I and eventually many farmers were forced out of business, causing the failure of hundreds of small rural banks. Agricultural productivity resulting from tractors, fertilizers and hybrid corn was only part of the problem; the other problem was the change over from horses and mules to internal combustion transportation. The horse and mule population began declining after WW 1, freeing up enormous quantities of land previously used for animal feed.&lt;ref name="Jerome 1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres-War 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Disparities in wealth and income===
Economists such as [[Waddill Catchings]], [[William Trufant Foster]], [[Rexford Tugwell]], [[Adolph Berle]] (and later [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]), popularized a theory that had some influence on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David M. |last=Kennedy |title=Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929–1945 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-503834-7 |pages=122, 123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory held that the economy produced more goods than consumers could purchase, because the consumers did not have enough income.&lt;ref&gt;Dorfman,1959&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title=Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

Most of the benefit of the increased productivity went into profits, which went into the [[stock market bubble]] rather than into consumer purchases. Thus workers did not have enough income to absorb the large amount of capacity that had been added.&lt;ref name="Beaudreau 1996"/&gt;

According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global overinvestment while the level of wages and earnings from independent businesses fell short of creating enough purchasing power. It was argued that government should intervene by an increased taxation of the rich to help make income more equal. With the increased revenue the government could create public works to increase employment and 'kick start' the economy. In the USA the economic policies had been quite the opposite until 1932. The [[Revenue Act of 1932]] and public works programmes introduced in Hoover's last year as president and taken up by Roosevelt, created some redistribution of purchasing power.&lt;ref name="Peter Clemens 1954, p. 108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Plenty'' (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The stock market crash made it evident that banking systems Americans were relying on were not dependable. Americans looked towards insubstantial banking units for their own liquidity supply. As the economy began to fail, these banks were no longer able to support those who depended on their assets – they did not hold as much power as the larger banks. During the depression, "three waves of bank failures shook the economy."&lt;ref name="Chapter"&gt;Chapter 15: The Great Depression. (1999). Growth of the International Economy 1820–2000 (pp. 226–34). Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd / Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave came just when the economy was heading in the direction of recovery at the end of 1930 and the beginning of 1931. The second wave of bank failures occurred "after the Federal Reserve System raised the rediscount rate to staunch an outflow of gold"&lt;ref name="Chapter"/&gt; around the end of 1931. The last wave, which began in the middle of 1932, was the worst and most devastating, continuing "almost to the point of a total breakdown of the banking system in the winter of 1932–1933."&lt;ref name="Chapter"/&gt; The reserve banks led the United States into an even deeper depression between 1931 and 1933, due to their failure to appreciate and put to use the powers they withheld – capable of creating money – as well as the "inappropriate monetary policies pursued by them during these years".&lt;ref name="Chapter"/&gt;

===Gold Standard system===
According to the gold standard theory of the Depression, the Depression was largely caused by the decision of most western nations after World War I to return to the gold standard at the pre-war gold price.  Monetary policy, according to this view, was thereby put into a deflationary setting that would over the next decade slowly grind away at the health of many European economies.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Bernanke, ''Studies on the Great Depression'', Princeton University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This post-war policy was preceded by an inflationary policy during World War I, when many European nations abandoned the gold standard, forced{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} by the enormous costs of the war. This resulted in inflation because the supply of new money that was created was spent on war, not on investments in productivity to increase demand that would have neutralized inflation. The view is that the quantity of new money introduced largely determines the inflation rate, and therefore, the cure to inflation is to reduce the amount of new currency created for purposes that are destructive or wasteful, and do not lead to economic growth.

After the war, when America and the nations of Europe went back on the gold standard, most nations decided to return to the gold standard at the pre-war price. When Britain, for example, passed the Gold Standard Act of 1925, thereby returning Britain to the gold standard, the critical decision was made to set the new price of the [[Pound Sterling]] at parity with the pre-war price even though the pound was then trading on the [[foreign exchange market]] at a much lower price. At the time, this action was criticized by [[John Maynard Keynes]] and others, who argued that in so doing, they were forcing a revaluation of wages without any tendency to equilibrium. Keynes' criticism of [[Winston Churchill]]'s form of the return to the gold standard implicitly compared it to the consequences of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

One of the reasons for setting the currencies at parity with the pre-war price was the prevailing opinion at that time that deflation was not a danger, while inflation, particularly the inflation in the Weimar Republic, was an unbearable danger. Another reason was that those who had loaned in nominal amounts hoped to recover the same value in gold that they had lent.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because of the reparations that [[Germany]] had to pay [[France]], Germany began a credit-fueled period of growth in order to export and sell enough goods abroad to gain gold to pay the reparations. The U.S., as the world's gold sink, loaned money to Germany to industrialize, which was then the basis for Germany paying back France, and France paying back loans to the U.K. and the U.S. This arrangement was codified in the [[Dawes Plan]].

In some cases, deflation can be hard on sectors of the economy such as agriculture, if they are deeply in debt at high interest rates and are unable to refinance, or that are dependent upon loans to finance capital goods when low interest rates are not available. Deflation erodes the price of commodities while increasing the real liability of debt. Deflation is beneficial to those with assets in cash, and to those who wish to invest or purchase assets or loan money.

More recent research, by economists such as Temin, [[Ben Bernanke]], and [[Barry Eichengreen]], has focused on the constraints policy makers were under at the time of the Depression. In this view, the constraints of the inter-war [[gold standard]] magnified the initial economic shock and were a significant obstacle to any actions that would ameliorate the growing Depression. According to them, the initial destabilizing shock may have originated with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] in the U.S., but it was the gold standard system that transmitted the problem to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen 1992, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their conclusions, during a time of crisis, policy makers may have wanted to loosen [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[fiscal policy]], but such action would threaten the countries' ability to maintain their obligation to exchange gold at its contractual rate. The gold standard required countries to maintain high interest rates to attract international investors who bought foreign assets with gold. Therefore, governments had their hands tied as the economies collapsed, unless they abandoned their currency's link to gold. Fixing the exchange rate of all countries on the gold standard ensured that the market for foreign exchange can only equilibrate through interest rates. As the Depression worsened, many countries started to abandon the gold standard, and those that abandoned it earlier suffered less from deflation and tended to recover more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Bernanke 2002, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Timberlake]], economist of the [[free banking]] school and protégé of Milton Friedman, specifically addressed this stance in his paper ''Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy'', wherein he argued that the Federal Reserve actually had plenty of lee-way under the gold standard, as had been demonstrated by the [[price stability]] policy of [[New York Fed]] governor [[Benjamin Strong]], between 1923 and 1928. But when Strong died in late 1928, the faction that took over dominance of the Fed advocated a [[real bills]] doctrine, where all money had to be represented by physical goods. This policy, forcing a 30% deflation of the dollar that inevitably damaged the US economy, is stated by Timberlake as being arbitrary and avoidable, the existing gold standard having been capable of continuing without it:

:This shift in control was decisive. In accordance with the precedent Strong had set in promoting a stable price level policy without heed to any golden fetters, real bills proponents could proceed equally unconstrained in implementing their policy ideal. System policy in 1928–29 consequently shifted from price level stabilization to passive real bills. "The" gold standard remained where it had been—nothing but formal window dressing waiting for an opportune time to reappear.&lt;ref&gt;Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy, RICHARD H. TIMBERLAKE http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/TimberlakeIntellectualTyrannyAugust2005.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910125855/http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/TimberlakeIntellectualTyrannyAugust2005.pdf |date=2005-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial institution structures===
[[File:Stocks29.jpg|thumb|400px|New York stock market index]]

Economic historians (especially Friedman and Schwartz) emphasize the importance of numerous bank failures. The failures were mostly in rural America. Structural weaknesses in the rural economy made local banks highly vulnerable. Farmers, already deeply in debt, saw farm prices plummet in the late 1920s and their implicit real interest rates on loans skyrocket.

Their land was already over-mortgaged (as a result of the 1919 bubble in land prices), and crop prices were too low to allow them to pay off what they owed. Small banks, especially those tied to the agricultural economy, were in constant crisis in the 1920s with their customers defaulting on loans because of the sudden rise in real interest rates; there was a steady stream of failures among these smaller banks throughout the decade.

The city banks also suffered from structural weaknesses that made them vulnerable to a shock. Some of the nation's largest banks were failing to maintain adequate reserves and were investing heavily in the stock market or making risky loans. Loans to [[Germany]] and [[Latin America]] by [[New York City]] banks were especially risky. In other words, the banking system was not well prepared to absorb the shock of a major recession.

Economists have argued that a [[liquidity trap]] might have contributed to bank failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Macroeconomics|last=Blanchard|first=Olivier|publisher=Pearson|year=2006|isbn=0131860267|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and historians debate how much responsibility to assign the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The timing was right; the magnitude of the shock to expectations of future prosperity was high. Most analysts believe the market in 1928–29 was a "bubble" with prices far higher than justified by fundamentals. Economists agree that somehow it shared some blame, but how much no one has estimated. Milton Friedman concluded, "I don't doubt for a moment that the collapse of the stock market in 1929 played a role in the initial recession".&lt;ref&gt;Parker, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of owning government bonds initially became ideal to investors when Liberty Loan drives encouraged this possession in America during World War I. This strive for dominion persisted into the 1920s. After World War I, the United States became the world's creditor and was depended upon by many foreign nations. "Governments from around the globe looked to Wall Street for loans".&lt;ref name="Chernow"/&gt; Investors then started to depend on these loans for further investments. Chief counsel of the Senate Bank Committee, Ferdinand Pecora, disclosed that National City executives were also dependent on loans from a special bank fund as a safety net for their stock losses while American banker, Albert Wiggin, "made millions selling short his own bank shares".&lt;ref name="Chernow"/&gt;

Economist David Hume stated that the economy became imbalanced as the recession spread on an international scale. The cost of goods remained too high for too long during a time where there was less international trade. Policies set in selected countries to "maintain the value of their currency" resulted in an outcome of bank failures.&lt;ref name="Tenim"/&gt; Governments that continued to follow the gold standard were led into bank failure, meaning that it was the governments and central bankers that contributed as a stepping stool into the depression.

The debate has three sides: one group says the crash caused the depression by drastically lowering expectations about the future and by removing large sums of investment capital; a second group says the economy was slipping since summer 1929 and the crash ratified it; the third group says that in either scenario the crash could not have caused more than a recession. There was a brief recovery in the market into April 1930, but prices then started falling steadily again from there, not reaching a final bottom until July 1932. This was the largest long-term U.S. market decline by any measure. To move from a recession in 1930 to a deep depression in 1931–32, entirely different factors had to be in play.&lt;ref&gt;White, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protectionism===
[[Protectionism]], such as the American [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]], is often indicated as a cause of the Great Depression, with countries enacting protectionist policies yielding a [[beggar thy neighbor]] result.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/protectionism-and-the-great-depression/ Protectionism and the Great Depression],'' [[Paul Krugman]], ''The New York Times,'' November 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eichenirwin"&gt;''[http://voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/3280 The protectionist temptation: Lessons from the Great Depression for today],'' VOX, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas Irwin, 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was especially harmful to agriculture because it caused farmers to default on their loans. This event may have worsened or even caused the ensuing bank runs in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and [[Western United States|West]] that caused the collapse of the banking system. A petition signed by over 1,000 economists was presented to the U.S. government warning that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act would bring disastrous economic repercussions; however, this did not stop the act from being signed into law.

Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: "imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls". These restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations, causing a major deduction during the depression. Not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries condensed "trade and exchange restrictions only marginally":&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*"Countries that remained on the gold standard, keeping currencies fixed, were more likely to restrict foreign trade." These countries "resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses." They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt; 
*Countries that abandoned the gold standard, allowed their currencies to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciate]] which caused their [[Balance of payments]] to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;
*"The length and depth of a country's economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the [[gold standard]]. Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries. In contrast, countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps."&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"/&gt;

In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act at least worsened the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Robert Whaples, "Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians? The Results of a Survey on Forty Propositions", ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 55, No. 1 (Mar., 1995), pp. 139–54 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2123771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many economists believe that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act was not a major contributor to the great depression. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] holds that, "Where protectionism really mattered was in preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered". He cites a report by Barry Eichengreen and Douglas Irwin: Figure 1 in that report shows trade and production dropping together from 1929 to 1932, but production increasing faster than trade from 1932 to 1937. The authors argue that adherence to the gold standard forced many countries to resort to tariffs, when instead they should have devalued their currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/protectionism-and-the-great-depression/|title=Protectionism and the Great Depression|newspaper=Paul Krugman Blog|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Temin]] argues that contrary the popular argument, the contractionary effect of the tariff was small. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff.&lt;ref&gt;Temin, P. 1989.

===International debt structure===
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}

When the war came to an end in 1918, all European nations that had been allied with the U.S. owed large sums of money to American banks, sums much too large to be repaid out of their shattered treasuries. This is one reason why the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had insisted (to the consternation of Woodrow Wilson) on reparation payments from Germany and [[Austria–Hungary]]. Reparations, they believed, would provide them with a way to pay off their own debts. However, Germany and Austria-Hungary were themselves in deep economic trouble after the war; they were no more able to pay the reparations than the Allies to pay their debts.

The debtor nations put strong pressure on the U.S. in the 1920s to forgive the debts, or at least reduce them. The American government refused. Instead, U.S. banks began making large loans to the nations of Europe. Thus, debts (and reparations) were being paid only by augmenting old debts and piling up new ones. In the late 1920s, and particularly after the American economy began to weaken after 1929, the European nations found it much more difficult to borrow money from the U.S. At the same time, high U.S. tariffs were making it much more difficult for them to sell their goods in U.S. markets. Without any source of revenue from foreign exchange to repay their loans, they began to default.

Beginning late in the 1920s, European demand for U.S. goods began to decline. That was partly because European industry and agriculture were becoming more productive, and partly because some European nations (most notably [[Weimar Germany]]) were suffering serious financial crises and could not afford to buy goods overseas. However, the central issue causing the destabilization of the European economy in the late 1920s was the international debt structure that had emerged in the aftermath of World War I.

The high tariff walls such as the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] critically impeded the payment of war debts. As a result of high U.S. tariffs, only a sort of cycle kept the reparations and war-debt payments going. During the 1920s, the former allies paid the war-debt installments to the U.S. chiefly with funds obtained from German reparations payments, and Germany was able to make those payments only because of large private loans from the U.S. and Britain. Similarly, U.S. investments abroad provided the dollars, which alone made it possible for foreign nations to buy U.S. exports.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was instituted by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, and signed into law by President Hoover, to raise taxes on American imports by about 20 percent during June 1930. This tax, which added to already shrinking income and overproduction in the U.S., only benefitted Americans in having to spend less on foreign goods. In contrast, European trading nations frowned upon this tax increase, particularly since the "United States was an international creditor and exports to the U.S. market were already declining".&lt;ref name="Eichengreen"&gt;EICHENGREEN, B., &amp; IRWIN, D. A. (2010). The Slide to Protectionism in the Great Depression: Who Succumbed and Why?. Journal of Economic History, 70(4), 871–97.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, some of America's primary producers and largest trading partner, Canada, chose to seek retribution by increasing the financial value of imported goods favoured by the Americans.

In the scramble for liquidity that followed the 1929 stock market crash, funds flowed back from Europe to America, and Europe's fragile economies crumbled.

By 1931, the world was reeling from the worst depression of recent memory, and the entire structure of reparations and war debts collapsed.

===Population dynamics===
In 1939, prominent economist [[Alvin Hansen]] discussed the decline in population growth in relation to the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

The same idea was discussed in a 1978 journal article by [[Clarence Barber]], an economist at the [[University of Manitoba]].  Using "a form of the [[Roy Harrod|Harrod model]]" to analyze the Depression, Barber states:

{{Quote|In such a model, one would look for the origins of a serious depression in conditions which produced a decline in Harrod's natural rate of growth, more specifically, in a decline in the rate of population and labour force growth and in the rate of growth of productivity or technical progress, to a level below the warranted rate of growth.&lt;ref name="Clarence Barber"&gt;Barber, Clarence L. "On the Origins of the Great Depression", ''Southern Economic Journal'', January, 1978, 44(3), pp. 432–56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Barber says, while there is "no clear evidence" of a decline in "the rate of growth of productivity" during the 1920s, there is "clear evidence" the population growth rate began to decline&lt;!--as a result of what?--&gt; during that same period. He argues the decline in population growth rate may have caused a decline in "the natural rate of growth" which was significant enough to cause a serious depression.&lt;ref name="Clarence Barber" /&gt;

Barber says a decline in the population growth rate is likely to affect the demand for housing, and claims this is apparently what happened during the 1920s. He concludes:

{{Quote|the rapid and very large decline in the rate of growth of non-farm households was clearly the major reason for the decline that occurred in residential construction in the United States from 1926 on.  And this decline, as Bolch and Pilgrim have claimed, may well have been the most important single factor in turning the 1929 downturn into a major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Clarence L. "On the Origins of the Great Depression", ''Southern Economic Journal'', January 1978, 44(3), pp. 432–56.  See also Bolch, B. W. and J. D. Pilgrim, "A Reappraisal of Some Factors Associated with Fluctuations in the United States in the Interwar Period."  ''Southern Economic Journal'', January 1973, pp. 327–44.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decline in housing construction that can be attributed to demographics has been estimated to range from 28% in 1933 to 38% in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;

Among the causes of the decline in the population growth rate during the 1920s were a declining birth rate after 1910&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced immigration. The decline in immigration was largely the result of legislation in the 1920s placing greater restrictions on immigration. In 1921, Congress passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]], followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]].

Factors that majorly contributed to the failing of the economy since 1925, was a decrease in both residential and non-residential buildings being constructed. It was the debt as a result of the war, less families being formed, and an imbalance of mortgage payments and loans in 1928–29 that mainly contributed to the decline in the number of houses being built. This (What?) caused the population growth rate to decelerate(How?). Though non-residential units continued to be built "at a high rate throughout the decade", the demand for such units was actually very low&lt;ref name="Chapter"/&gt;

==Role of economic policy==

===Calvin Coolidge (1923–29)===
There is an ongoing debate between historians as to what extent President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s [[laissez-faire]] hands-off attitude has contributed to the Great Depression. Despite a growing rate of bank failures he did not heed voices that predicted the lack of banking regulation as potentially dangerous. He did not listen to members of Congress warning that stock speculation had gone too far and he ignored criticisms that workers did not participate sufficiently in the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Melvin I. |last=Urofsky |title=The American Presidents: Critical Essays |isbn=0-8153-2184-8 |page=391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leave-it-alone liquidationism (1929–33)===

====Overview====
[[File:Graph charting income per capita throughout the Great Depression.svg|thumb|450px|The Great Depression in an international context.]]
From the point of view of today's mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep some broad nominal aggregate on a stable growth path (for proponents of [[new classical macroeconomics]] and [[monetarism]], the measure is the nominal [[money supply]]; for [[Keynesian economists]] it is the nominal [[aggregate demand]] itself). During a depression the [[central bank]] should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing.&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite paper |first=J. Bradford |last=De Long |title='Liquidation' Cycles: Old Fashioned Real Business Cycle Theory and the Great Depression |work=NBER Working Paper No. 3546 |date=December 1990 |doi=10.3386/w3546 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government and the [[Federal Reserve]] did not do that during the 1929‑32 slide into the Great Depression&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt; The existence of "[[Liquidationism (economics)|liquidationism]]" played a key part in motivating public policy decisions not to fight the gathering Great Depression. An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Lawrence|last=White|title=Did Hayek and Robbins Deepen the Great Depression?|journal=Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking |volume=40|issue=40|pages=751–768|year=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00134.x|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists [[Barry Eichengreen]] and [[J.

Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Elgar publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1843763352}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover wrote in his memoirs he did not side with the liquidationists, but took the side of those in his cabinet with "economic responsibility", his Secretary of Commerce [[Robert P. Lamont]] and Secretary of Agriculture [[Arthur M. Hyde]], who advised the President to "use the powers of government to cushion the situation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/ebooks/pdf/FULL/B1V3_Full.pdf Hoover, Herbert. ''The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover'', p. 31] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217233238/http://www.ecommcode.com/hoover/ebooks/pdf/FULL/B1V3_Full.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time he kept Andrew Mellon as Secretary of the Treasury until February 1932. It was during 1932 that Hoover began to support more aggressive measures to combat the Depression.&lt;ref name="delong.typepad.com"&gt;Bradford DeLong, [http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/07/what-was-herbert-hoovers-fiscal-policy.html What Was Herbert Hoover's Fiscal Policy?]&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, President Hoover wrote bitterly about members of his Cabinet who had advised inaction during the downslide into the Great Depression:

{{quote|The leave-it-alone liquidationists headed by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon ... felt that government must keep its hands off and let the slump liquidate itself. Mr. Mellon had only one formula: "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate ... It will purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people."&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt;}}

Before the ''[[Keynesian Revolution]]'', such a liquidationist theory was a common position for economists to take and was held and advanced by economists like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Lionel Robbins]] [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Seymour Harris]] and others.&lt;ref name="Randall E. Parker 2003, p. 9"/&gt; According to the liquidationists a depression is good medicine. The function of a depression is to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses. These can then be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They asserted that deflationary policy minimized the duration of the [[Depression of 1920–21]] by tolerating liquidation which subsequently created economic growth later in the decade. They pushed for deflationary policies (which were already executed in 1921) which – in their opinion – would assist the release of capital and labor from unproductive activities to lay the groundwork for a new economic boom. The liquidationists argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, then so be it.&lt;ref name="Randall E. Parker 2003, p. 9"/&gt; Postponing the liquidation process would only magnify the social costs. Schumpeter wrote that it&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt;

{{quote|... leads us to believe that recovery is sound only if it does come of itself. For any revival which is merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone and adds, to an undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in turn, thus threatening business with another (worse) crisis ahead.}}

Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed and vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by [[Olivier Blanchard]] and [[Lawrence Summers]], the recession caused a drop of net [[capital accumulation]] to pre-1924 levels by 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |first=J. Bradford |last=De Long |title='Liquidation' Cycles: Old Fashioned Real Business Cycle Theory and the Great Depression |work=NBER Working Paper No. 3546 |date=December 1990 |doi=10.3386/w3546 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
Economists such as [[John Maynard Keynes]] and [[Milton Friedman]] suggested that the do-nothing policy prescription which resulted from the liquidationist theory contributed to deepening the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="WhiteLawrence" /&gt; With the rhetoric of ridicule Keynes tried to discredit the liquidationist view in presenting Hayek, Robbins and Schumpeter as

{{quote|...austere and puritanical souls [who] regard [the Great Depression] ... as an inevitable and a desirable nemesis on so much "overexpansion" as they call it ... It would, they feel, be a victory for the mammon of unrighteousness if so much prosperity was not subsequently balanced by universal bankruptcy. We need, they say, what they politely call a 'prolonged liquidation' to put us right. The liquidation, they tell us, is not yet complete. But in time it will be. And when sufficient time has elapsed for the completion of the liquidation, all will be well with us again...}}

Milton Friedman stated that at the University of Chicago such "dangerous nonsense" was never taught and that he understood why at Harvard —where such nonsense was taught— bright young economists rejected their teachers' macroeconomics, and become Keynesians.&lt;ref name="nber.org"/&gt; He wrote:

{{quote|I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm. If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world. You've just got to let it cure itself. You can't do anything about it. You will only make it worse [...] I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.&lt;ref name="WhiteLawrence" /&gt;}}

Economist [[Lawrence H. White|Lawrence White]], while acknowledging that Hayek and Robbins did not actively oppose the deflationary policy of the early 1930s, nevertheless challenges the argument of Milton Friedman, [[J.&amp;nbsp;Bradford DeLong]] et al. that Hayek was a proponent of liquidationism. White argues that the business cycle theory of Hayek and Robbins (which later developed into [[Austrian business cycle theory]] in its present-day form) was actually not consistent with a monetary policy which permitted a severe contraction of the money supply. Nevertheless, White says that at the time of the Great Depression Hayek "expressed ambivalence about the shrinking nomimal income and sharp deflation in 1929–32".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence White, ''The Clash of Economic Ideas: The Great Policy Debates and Experiments of the 20th Century'' (Cambridge University Press), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; In a talk in 1975, Hayek admitted the mistake he made over forty years earlier in not opposing the Central Bank's deflationary policy and stated the reason why he had been "ambivalent": "At that time I believed that a process of deflation of some short duration might break the rigidity of wages which I thought was incompatible with a functioning economy."&lt;ref name="WhiteClash" /&gt; 1979 Hayek strongly criticized the Fed's contractionary monetary policy early in the Depression and its failure to offer banks liquidity:

{{quote|I agree with Milton Friedman that once the Crash had occurred, the Federal Reserve System pursued a silly deflationary policy. I am not only against inflation but I am also against deflation. So, once again, a badly programmed monetary policy prolonged the depression.&lt;ref name="A. Hayek 2009"/&gt;}}

===Herbert Hoover (1929–33)===
[[File:US Unemployment 1910-1960.gif|thumb|350px|Unemployment rate in the US 1910–60, with the years of the Great Depression (1929–39) highlighted; accurate data begins in 1939.]]

====Economic policy====
Historians gave Hoover credit for working tirelessly to combat the depression and noted that he left government prematurely aged. But his policies are rated as simply not far-reaching enough to address the Great Depression. He was prepared to do something, but nowhere near enough.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clemens, ''Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954'', Hodder Education, 4. Auflage, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-340-965887}}, pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover was no exponent of laissez-faire. But his principal philosophies were [[voluntaryism|voluntarism]], self-help, and rugged individualism. He refused direct federal intervention. He believed that government should do more than his immediate predecessors ([[Warren G. Harding]], [[Calvin Coolidge]]) believed. But he was not willing to go as far as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] later did. Therefore, he is described as the "first of the new presidents" and "the last of the old".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954, Hodder Education, 4. Auflage, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-340-965887}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover's first measures were based on voluntarism by businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages. But businesses had little choice and wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and investments postponed. The Hoover administration extended over $100 million in emergency farm loans and some $915 million in public works projects between 1930 and 1932. Hoover urged bankers to set up the [[National Credit Corporation]] so that big banks could help failing banks survive. But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks, and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clemens, ''Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954'', Hodder Education, 4. Auflage, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-340-965887}}, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/butkiewicz.finance.corp.reconstruction |title=Reconstruction Finance Corporation|work=EH.net Encyclopedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205418/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/butkiewicz.finance.corp.reconstruction |archive-date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Hoover reluctantly established the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2&amp;nbsp;billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2&amp;nbsp;billion was not enough to save all the banks, and [[bank run]]s and bank failures continued.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954, Hodder Education, 4. Auflage, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-340-965887}}, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal spending====
[[File:Federal Spending.png|thumb|350px|Federal spending in millions of dollars (1910–60). The time period of the Hoover administration, the New Deal and World War&amp;nbsp;II are highlighted.]]
[[J.&amp;nbsp;Bradford DeLong]] explained that Hoover would have been a budget cutter in normal times and continuously wanted to balance the budget. Hoover held the line against powerful political forces that sought to increase government spending after the Depression began for fully two and a half years. During the first two years of the Depression (1929 and 1930) Hoover actually achieved budget surpluses of about 0.8% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). In 1931, when the recession significantly worsened and GDP declined by 15%, the federal budget had only a small deficit of 0.6% of GDP. It was not until 1932 (when GDP declined by 27% compared to 1929-level) that Hoover pushed for measures ([[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], [[Federal Home Loan Bank Act]], direct loans to fund state Depression relief programs) that increased spending. But at the same time he pushed for the [[Revenue Act of 1932]] that massively increased taxes in order to balance the budget again.&lt;ref name="delong.typepad.com"/&gt;

Uncertainty was a major factor, argued by several economists, that contributed to the worsening and length of the depression. It was also said to be responsible "for the initial decline in consumption that marks the" beginning of the Great Depression by economists Paul R. Flacco and Randall E. Parker. Economist Ludwig Lachmann argues that it was pessimism that prevented the recovery and worsening of the depression&lt;ref name="Houck"&gt;Houck, D. W. (2000). RHETORIC AS CURRENCY: HERBERT HOOVER AND THE 1929 STOCK MARKET CRASH. Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs, 3(2), 155–81.&lt;/ref&gt; President Hoover is said to have been blinded from what was right in front of him.

Economist [[James Deusenberry]] argues economic imbalance was not only a result of World War I, but also of the structural changes made during the first quarter of the Twentieth Century. He also states the branches of the nation's economy became smaller, there was not much demand for housing, and the stock market crash "had a more direct impact on consumption than any previous financial panic"&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;Barber, C. L. (1978). "On the Origins of the Great Depression". ''Southern Economic Journal'', 44(3), 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist William A. Lewis describes the conflict between America and its primary producers:

{{quote|Misfortunes [of the 1930s] were due principally to the fact that the production of primary commodities after the war was somewhat in excess of demand. It was this which, by keeping the terms of trade unfavourable to primary producers, kept the trade in manufactures so low, to the detriment of some countries as the United Kingdom, even in the twenties, and it was this which pulled the world economy down in the early thirties....If primary commodity markets had not been so insecure the crisis of 1929 would not have become a great depression....It was the violent fall of prices that was deflationary.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W. A. ''Economic Survey, 1919–1929''. London: Allen and Unwin, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2013}}}}

The stock market crash was not the first sign of the Great Depression. "Long before the crash, community banks were failing at the rate of one per day".&lt;ref name="Chernow"&gt;Chernow, R. (2009, Oct 23). Everyman's financial meltdown. New York Times (1923-Current File).
Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1030683641&lt;/ref&gt; It was the development of the Federal Reserve System that misled investors in the 1920s into relying on federal banks as a safety net. They were encouraged to continue buying stocks and to overlook any of the fluctuations. Economist Roger Babson tried to warn the investors of the deficiency to come, but was ridiculed even as the economy began to deteriorate during the summer of 1929. While England and Germany struggled under the strain on gold currencies after the war, economists were blinded by an unsustainable 'new economy' they sought to be considerably stable and successful.&lt;ref name="Chernow"/&gt;

Since the United States decided to no longer comply with the gold standard, "the value of the dollar could change freely from day to day".&lt;ref name="Tenim"&gt;Temin, P. (2010). The Great Recession &amp; the Great Depression. Daedalus, 139(4), 115–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this imbalance on an international scale led to crisis, the economy within the nation remained stable.

The depression then affected all nations on an international scale. "The German mark collapsed when the chancellor put domestic politics ahead of sensible finance; the bank of England abandoned the gold standard after a subsequent speculative attack; and the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its discount rate dramatically in October 1931 to preserve the value of the dollar".&lt;ref name="Tenim"/&gt; The Federal Reserve drove the American economy into an even deeper depression.

====Tax policy====
In 1929 the Hoover administration responded to the economic crises by temporarily lowering income tax rates and the corporate tax rate.&lt;ref name="Roy G. Blakey 2006, p. 301"&gt;Roy G. Blakey, Gladys C. Blakey, ''The Federal Income Tax'', 2006, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1931, tax returns showed a tremendous decline in income due to the economic downturn. Income tax receipts were 40% less than in 1930. At the same time government spending proved to be a lot greater than estimated.&lt;ref name="Roy G. Blakey 2006, p. 301"/&gt; As a result, the budget deficit increased tremendously. While Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon urged to increase taxes, Hoover had no desire to do so since 1932 was an election year.&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Blakey, Gladys C. Blakey, ''The Federal Income Tax'', 2006, pp. 302–03&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1931, hopes that the economic downturn would come to an end vanished since all economic indicators pointed to a continuing downward trend.&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Blakey, Gladys C. Blakey, ''The Federal Income Tax'', 2006, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 1932, Andrew Mellon announced that the Hoover administration would end a further increase in public debt by raising taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Roy G. Blakey, Gladys C. Blakey, ''The Federal Income Tax'', 2006, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1932, the [[Revenue Act of 1932]] was signed into law.

===Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–45)===
[[File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|lang=en|thumb|350px|USA GDP annual pattern and long-term trend, 1920–40, in billions of constant dollars.]]

Roosevelt won the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]] promising to promote recovery with a [[New Deal]] for the American people.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Kenneth T. (September 10, 2008) [https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/09/10/the-most-consequential-elections-in-history-franklin-delano-roosevelt-and-the-election-of-1932 The Most Consequential Elections in History: Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Election of 1932 – US News and World Report]. Usnews.com. Retrieved on July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
He enacted a series of programs, including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], banking reform, and suspension of the [[gold standard]]. The majority of historians and economists argue that the New Deal was  beneficial to recovery, however some argue that it prolonged the Great Depression.

In a survey of economic historians conducted by Robert Whaples, Professor of Economics at [[Wake Forest University]], anonymous questionnaires were sent to members of the ''Economic History Association''. Members were asked to either ''disagree'', ''agree'', or ''agree with provisos'' with the statement that read: "Taken as a whole, government policies of the New Deal served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression." While only 6% of economic historians who worked in the history department of their universities agreed with the statement, 27% of those that work in the economics department agreed. Almost an identical percent of the two groups (21% and 22%) agreed with the statement "with provisos" (a conditional stipulation), while 74% of those who worked in the history department, and 51% in the economic department disagreed with the statement outright.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

====Arguments for key to recovery====
According to [[Peter Temin]], Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and [[Christina Romer]] the biggest primary impact of the [[New Deal]] on the economy and the key to recovery and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. Before the first New Deal measures people expected a contractionary economic situation (recession, deflation) to persist. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. Expectations changed towards an expansionary development (economic growth, inflation). The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, balanced budget and small government led to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change would not have happened and the Hoover policy would have continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.&lt;ref name="aeaweb.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

====Arguments for prolongation of the Great Depression====
In the [[new classical macroeconomics]] view of the Great Depression large negative shocks caused the 1929–33 downturn – including monetary shocks, productivity shocks, and banking shocks – but those developments become positive after 1933 due to monetary and banking reform policies. According to the model Cole-Ohanian impose, the main culprits for the prolonged depression were labor frictions and productivity/efficiency frictions (perhaps, to a lesser extent). Financial frictions are unlikely to have caused the prolonged slump.&lt;ref name="minneapolisfed"&gt;Cole, Harold L., and Lee E. Ohanian. "The Great Depression from a Neoclassical Perspective." N.p., n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2311.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minneapolisfed_a"&gt;Chari, V. V., Patrick J. Kehoe, and Ellen R. McGrattan. "Accounting for the Great Depression." N.p., n.d. Web. &lt;https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr2721.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cole-Ohanian model there is a slower than normal recovery which they explain by New Deal policies which they evaluated as tending towards monopoly and distribution of wealth. The key economic paper looking at these diagnostic sources in relation to the Great Depression is Cole and Ohanian's work. Cole-Ohanian point at two policies of New Deal: the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] and [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), the latter strengthening NIRA's labor provision. According to Cole-Ohanian New Deal policies created cartelization, high wages, and high prices in at least manufacturing and some energy and mining industries. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelts]] policies against the severity of the Depression like the NIRA, a "code of fair competition" for each industry were aimed to reduce cutthroat competition in a period of severe [[deflation]], which was seen as the cause for lowered demand and employment. The NIRA suspended antitrust laws and permitted collusion in some sectors provided that industry raised wages above clearing level and accepted collective bargaining with labor unions. The effects of [[cartel]]ization can be seen as the basic effect of [[monopoly]]. The given corporation produces too little, charges too high of a price, and under-employs labor. Likewise, an increase in the power of unions creates a situation similar to monopoly. Wages are too high for the union members, so the corporation employs fewer people and, produces less output. Cole-Ohanian show that 60% of the difference between the trend and realized output is due to cartelization and unions.&lt;ref name="minneapolisfed" /&gt; Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan also present a nice exposition that's in line with Cole-Ohanian. .&lt;ref name="minneapolisfed_a" /&gt;

This type of analysis has numerous counterarguments including the applicability of the equilibrium business cycle to the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;De Vroey, Michel R. "Real Business Cycle Theory and the Great Depression: The Abandonment of the Abstentionist Viewpoint." N.p., n.d.

'''General elections''' were held in [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) in 1956. They were a watershed in the country's political history, and was the first elections fought to challenge the ruling United National Party. The former Leader of the House, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who was passed over after the death of the first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake, crossed over to the opposition to form the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to launch his bid for Prime Minister.

==Background==
The [[United National Party|UNP]] government of [[John Kotelawala]] had been rapidly losing steam.  It faced widespread criticism over Ceylon's poor economic performance.  Meanwhile, the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] now championed a popular socialist platform, calling for [[English language|English]] to be replaced by [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] as the island's official language.

The UNP resisted this out of deference to Ceylon's [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Tamil]] minority, but changed its position in early 1956.  This only served to cost the UNP its Tamil support while gaining it little among the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]].

The [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|Communist Party]] campaigned for parity of status between Sinhala and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], with both to jointly replace English as the official language.

The Tamil parties campaigned to keep English as the official language.

SLFP leader [[Solomon Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]] assembled a coalition with a group of small [[Marxist]] parties to form the [[Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (1956)|Mahajana Eksath Peramuna]].

==Results==
Bandaranaike's coalition obtained a solid majority government and he became [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|prime minister]].

{{Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1956}}

==Legacy==
The SLFP campaign of 1956 was the first in Ceylon's history where communal feelings against the minority Tamil community were deliberately stirred up by Sinhalese politicians for electoral gain.  The SLFP tried to blame the high unemployment Sinhalese youth faced, on the Tamils, and in effect promised not to correct injustices but to openly discriminate against Tamils via a policy of official '''unilingualism'''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The hard feelings from this campaign contributed towards the eruption, nearly three decades later, of the [[Origins of the Sri Lankan civil war|path to civil war]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

However, it also changed the character of politics in the country from the elitism that had characterised it hitherto. [[Members of Parliament]] from other parties than the Left were [[middle class]], [[working class]] or [[farmer]]s. Henceforth electorates were addressed in their mother tongue at election meetings (as the LSSP and CP had done from inception) instead of English.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The '''curse of 39''' is the belief, in some parts of [[Afghanistan]], that the number 39 is cursed or a badge of shame as it is purportedly linked with [[prostitution]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303654804576347201745546630|title=A Symbol of Paid Companionship, No. 39 Is Afghans' Loneliest Number|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{See|Prostitution in Afghanistan}}

The number 39 has somehow become lodged in the Afghan popular imagination as a sign of pimping and prostitution, but it has widely been claimed to have been associated with a pimp, allegedly living in the western city of [[Herat]], who was nicknamed "39" after the registration plate of his expensive car and the number of his apartment.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The number is said to translate into ''morda-gow'', literally meaning "dead cow" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. Others have blamed corrupt police officials for spreading the rumour in order to  charge between $200–$500 to change a "39" plate.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Officials have, in turn, blamed car dealers and "those who work for the mafia [who] started the rumours about 39 so they could buy cars with 39 plates cheaper and sell them back for higher prices after changing the plates", according to Abdul Qader Samoonwal of Kabul's Traffic and License Registration department.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; The problem is made worse by the fact that Afghanistan is a largely illiterate country in which rumours and superstitions thrive.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

== Perception ==
=== Vehicles ===
[[File:Street scene in Kabul-2012.jpg|thumb|300px|Vehicles in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]]]

[[Vehicle registration plate]]s incorporating the number are seen as so undesirable that vehicles and apartments bearing the numerals are said to be virtually unsellable in the capital, [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/uk-afghanistan-number-idUSLNE75E01T20110615|title=Cursed number "39" haunts Afghan car owners|last=Shalizi|first=Hamid|agency=Reuters|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drivers of such vehicles have reported receiving abuse and derision from pedestrians and other drivers, and some have had their registration plates altered to disguise the numbers. One such driver, Zalmay Ahmadi, told ''[[The Guardian]]'': "[W]hen I drive around all the other cars flash their lights, beep their horns and people point at me. All my classmates now call me Colonel 39."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/15/afghanistan-curse-of-number-39|title=The curse of number 39 and the steps Afghans take to avoid it|last=Boone|first=Jon|work=The Guardian|date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taxi driver, Ahmad Ghafor, said that he found that "it gets worse when I have women customers in the car. Other drivers signal to me or blow their horn saying 'shall we pay you to drop these ladies to my place?'"&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/13815417|title=Count me out|last=Qadiry|first=Tahir|publisher=BBC News|date=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue caused particular problems in Kabul after the [[Iranian calendars#Modern calendar (Solar Hejri)|Persian New Year]] of March 2011, as the government started to issue registration plates beginning with 39. (To compound the problem, this happened to be 1390 in the [[Iranian calendar]]).{{Update after|2012|04|reason=Please change to past tense, as the current Iranian calendar year will have finished.}} Despite the threat of penalties, many drivers refused to register their cars while the number 39 still appeared on them.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/05/21/136496527/forget-unlucky-13-in-afghanistan-beware-39|title=Forget Unlucky 13. In Afghanistan, Beware 39|author=Shafi, Ahmad|author2=Sharifi, Najib|publisher=NPR|date=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellphone numbers ===
Cellphone owners have encountered similar problems, forcing them to hide their caller ID or switch their numbers altogether. One man with "39" in his [[Telephone number|phone number]] told the BBC: "I receive lots of anonymous calls asking if I have got prostitutes. I am known as Mr 39 amongst my friends."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

=== Other appearances of 39 ===
Some 39-year-old Afghans are said to refer to themselves as being "one less than 40" or "one year to 40." During the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]], one candidate, Mullah Tarakhil, had the misfortune to be listed 39th on the ballot; two people were killed when his guards opened fire on civilians after a traffic accident, said to have been in reaction to people taunting the candidate over his number.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
Afghan government officials and numerologists have tried to scotch the claims about 39, though with little success. Gen. Assadullah, the head of the traffic department in Kabul, described the problem as "nonsense" as 39 is "just a number." He noted that there is no religious prohibition against the number and his department has sought to reassure the public by noting where Muslims can find the number 39 in the [[Quran]] and even publishing a formula by which the number can be derived from the name "[[Allah]]."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Sediq Afghan, a famous numerologist, has likewise complained that people "only see the negative side" of the number and has called it "a sickness for Afghans". He told television viewers that associating the number with pimps "is a sin because 57 [[Sura]]s from our Quran contain the number 39."&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; The popular television satire show ''Danger Bell'' highlighted the issue but only succeeded in publicising it even further.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

Some car dealers have been able to profit from it, as the problem exists mainly in Kabul; one dealer told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that he "could knock several thousand dollars off the purchase price of a car in Kabul with 39 on its plate and then turn around to sell it for a profit in the surrounding provinces."&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;

Owners of vehicles with "39" in their registration plates have sought to fix the problem themselves. Many have "edited" their own plates by painting or taping over the offending digits, or altering them to make the number 3 look like an 8, or even covering over the entire plate. One driver told [[NPR]]: "I have no choice but to drive this car since I earn my living working here. But I have to cover the 39 plate with a blue sheet. I do this to protect the dignity of this organization and also of myself."&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

'''David Melech Friedman''' (born August 8, 1958) is an American bankruptcy lawyer and the [[United States Ambassador to Israel]]. He joined the law firm [[Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman]] (then known as Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson &amp; Torres) in 1994, where he met and represented [[Donald Trump]], then chairman and president of [[The Trump Organization]]. He served as an advisor to Trump during his successful [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]]. In December 2016, President-elect Trump's [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] announced that Friedman was Trump's nominee for ambassador. His nomination was met with support from conservative Israeli and Jewish American activist groups, and opposition from liberal advocacy organizations, particularly [[J Street]]. He was confirmed by the full [[United States Senate|Senate]] on March 23, 2017, with a 52–46 vote, officially sworn in by Vice President [[Mike Pence]] on March 29 and presented his credentials on May 15.

==Nomination for U.S. Ambassador to Israel==

On December 15, 2016, the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] of President-elect Donald Trump announced that Friedman had been selected to be the nominee as the [[United States Ambassador to Israel]].&lt;ref name="greatagaindavidfriedman" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4604739/david-friedman-jerusalem-jewish-israel/|title=Why Jerusalem Isn't Recognized as Israel's Capital|last=Samuelson|first=Kate|date=December 16, 2016|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thetimesofisraelcortellessa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-taps-adviser-david-friedman-to-be-us-ambassador-to-israel/|title=Trump taps adviser Friedman to be US ambassador to Israel|date=December 16, 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last1=Cortellessa|first1=Eric|access-date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman's nomination was controversial; some [[American Jews|American Jewish]], [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israeli]], and [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] individuals and advocacy groups argued against his nomination. [[Saeb Erekat]], chief negotiator for the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]], said that moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and annexing West Bank settlements would lead to the "destruction of the peace process" and send the region down a path of "chaos, lawlessness, and extremism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/erekat-moving-us-embassy-to-jerusalem-will-destroy-peace-process/|title=Erekat: Moving US Embassy to Jerusalem will 'destroy peace process'|date=December 16, 2016|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman had said in an interview for ''[[Haaretz]]'' during the campaign that Trump would be open to [[Israel]] annexing parts of the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="supporter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.726779|title=David Friedman: Trump Would Support Israeli Annexation of Parts of West Bank|last=Ravid|first=Barak|date=June 23, 2016|work=[[Haaretz]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=y|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has opposed [[Israeli settlement]]s in the West Bank since 1967.&lt;ref name="undiplomatic2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/12/undiplomatic-choice|title=An undiplomatic choice: Donald Trump picks a hardliner as ambassador to Israel|date=December 17, 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|author1=V.V.B.|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liberal advocacy organization [[J Street]] "vehemently opposed" Friedman's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jstreet.org/press-releases/j-street-vehemently-opposes-nomination-david-friedman-us-ambassador-israel/ |title=J Street Vehemently Opposes Nomination of David Friedman as US Ambassador to Israel |work=[[J Street]] |date=December 16, 2016 |accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidential campaign, Friedman had attacked J Street supporters, writing in ''Arutz Sheva'' in May 2016:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Are J Street supporters really as bad as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]]? The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos—Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps. The kapos faced extraordinary cruelty and who knows what any of us would have done under those circumstances to save a loved one? But J Street? They are just smug advocates of Israel's destruction delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas—it's hard to imagine anyone worse.&lt;ref name="read"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/18828|title=Read Peter Beinart and you'll vote Donald Trump|last=Friedman|first=David|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Arutz Sheva]]|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

When asked about his comments on J Street at the [[Center for Middle East Policy|Saban Forum]] in early December, Friedman had stood by his statements, saying that J Street supporters were "not Jewish, and they're not pro-Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/us/politics/donald-trump-david-friedman-israel-ambassador.html|title=Trump Chooses Hard-Liner as Ambassador to Israel|last=Rosenberg|first=Matthew|date=December 15, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/liberal-jewish-orgs-rage-against-trumps-israel-ambassador-pick/|title=Liberal Jewish groups rage against Trump's Israel ambassador pick|date=December 16, 2016|last1=Cortellessa|first1=Eric|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy organizations [[Americans for Peace Now]], [[Ameinu]], the [[Israel Policy Forum]], and the [[New Israel Fund]] also opposed the nomination.&lt;ref name="hawkshail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jta.org/2016/12/16/news-opinion/united-states/trumps-pick-for-israel-envoy-elates-hawks-worries-doves |title=Hawks hail Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, doves vow a fight |work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |date=December 16, 2016 |accessdate=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], including Jewish representatives [[Jan Schakowsky]], [[Jerrold Nadler]], [[John Yarmuth]], and [[Steve Cohen]], urged their colleagues in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to vote against Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/news/national/357547/chuck-schumer-not-taking-sides-on-david-friedman-as-ambassador-to-israel/ |title=Chuck Schumer Not Taking Sides on David Friedman as Ambassador to Israel |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |work=[[The Forward]] |date=December 19, 2016 |access-date=December 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/fast-forward/357688/rep-steve-cohen-rejects-david-friedman-says-hes-no-fiddler/ |title=Rep.

Five former United States Ambassadors to Israel – [[Thomas R. Pickering|Thomas Pickering]], [[William Caldwell Harrop|William Harrop]], [[Edward S.

Other Jewish and Israeli groups and individuals supported Friedman's nomination. Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy at the [[Orthodox Union]], commended Trump for the nomination as a change in the [[Israel–United States relations|relationship between Israel and the United States]] from the relationship under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-israel-ambassador-david-friedman-232717 |title= Trump picks hard-line attorney as Israel envoy, angering Jewish left  |last=Toosi  |first= Nahal  |work= [[Politico]]  |date=December 15, 2016  |access-date= December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton Klein]], president of the [[Zionist Organization of America]], said Friedman "has the potential to be the greatest US Ambassador to Israel ever".&lt;ref name="hawkshail" /&gt; The [[Republican Jewish Coalition]] and Rabbi [[Yechiel Eckstein]], founder and president of the [[International Fellowship of Christians and Jews]], both supported the nomination.&lt;ref name="hawkshail" /&gt; Israeli politicians [[Tzipi Hotovely]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Dani Dayan]], the [[Consul (representative)|Consul General]] of Israel in New York, and [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Minister of Education]] [[Naftali Bennett]] all praised Friedman and welcomed his nomination.&lt;ref name="hawkshail" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-trumps-pick-for-ambassador-to-israel-right-wing-israelis-see-a-friend/2016/12/16/3cbe690b-04db-4587-bea5-1f75fffb0e67_story.html|title=Israel says there's never been a more right-wing U.S. ambassador than Trump's pick|last=Booth|first=William|date=December 16, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=March 21, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Eglash|first2=Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yesha Council]], the umbrella organization governing West Bank settlements, also supported the nomination, saying Friedman had a "deep love for all of the land and people of Israel, including those in [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]]," the Biblical names of the area of land which is referred to internationally as the West Bank.&lt;ref name="hawkshail" /&gt;

==Background==

Fontaine was raised by her great-aunt for most of her life; they lived on the [[Sagkeeng First Nation]], 121&amp;nbsp;km northeast [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba.

Her father, Eugene, had been beaten to death in 2011. His two assailants received manslaughter convictions. Fontaine's aunt recalled that her father's violent death deeply affected the girl. "She was very hurt, very lost. That's when she drifted away."&lt;ref name="Nationalpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/after-her-father-was-beaten-to-death-tina-fontaine-went-astray-she-only-lasted-two-months-in-winnipeg |title= After her father was beaten to death, Tina Fontaine went astray: 'She only lasted two months in Winnipeg' |author=Lambert, Stephen |work= National Post |date= 16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went to Winnipeg.

==Disappearances and body discovery==

Fontaine was in the care of Manitoba [[Child and Family Services|Child and Family Services (CFS)]] when she was reported missing to [[Winnipeg Police Service]] on July 31, 2014.&lt;ref name="Timeline 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawkins|first1=Glen|title=Party-house acquaintance, 53, arrested in murder of Tina Fontaine|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2015/12/11/arrest-in-tina-fontaine-homicide|accessdate=September 8, 2016|date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timeline 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Some events leading up to the arrest of a man in the death of Tina Fontaine|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/some-events-leading-up-to-the-arrest-of-a-man-in-the-death-of-tina-fontaine--361603241.html|accessdate=September 8, 2016|work=The Canadian Press|date=December 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213212547/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/some-events-leading-up-to-the-arrest-of-a-man-in-the-death-of-tina-fontaine--361603241.html|archivedate=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her aunt, Lana, later said that Fontaine had stayed with her during the [[Public holidays in Canada|August long weekend]] (August 1–3).&lt;ref name="Timeline 1"/&gt; On August 5, Fontaine telephoned her CFS worker and was subsequently picked up by members of CFS and Winnipeg Police Service.&lt;ref name="Timeline 1"/&gt; What happened to Fontaine between August 5 and August 8 is unclear, but she remained a missing youth.&lt;ref name="Timeline 1"/&gt; At 3 a.m. on August 8, police Constables Brock Jansen and Craig Houle encountered her in a truck with an allegedly drunk driver, but did not take her into custody, even though she was known to be missing.&lt;ref name="Timeline 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tina Fontaine died because police, CFS failed her, family says|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/tina-fontaine-died-because-police-cfs-failed-her-family-says-1.2777606|accessdate=September 8, 2016|work=cbc.ca|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4 a.m., she was found passed out in an alleyway near Ellice Avenue and was escorted to hospital and treated before being checked into the Best Western Charterhouse hotel, which she soon left.&lt;ref name="Timeline 1" /&gt; She was reported missing again on August 9.&lt;ref name="CBC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/tina-fontaine-homicide-arrest-winnipeg-1.3361103|title=Raymond Cormier, 53, charged with murder in Tina Fontaine death|date=11 December 2015|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A young woman who claimed to have been with Fontaine shortly before she disappeared told [[CBC News]] of events that happened in the hours leading up to her disappearance. Identified by CBC News as "Katrina", she said that after she met Fontaine between 10 and 11 p.m. on August 7, they went to eat at the Macdonald Youth Services emergency shelter at around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/tina-fontaine-last-seen-leaving-with-man-in-west-end-says-friend-1.2778160|title=Tina Fontaine last seen leaving with man in West End, says friend|last=|first=|date=September 25, 2014|work=cbc.ca|access-date=September 8, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing Fontaine was drunk, Katrina requested the shelter staff keep her overnight, but Fontaine refused to stay, and refused to give her name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After seeing her get into the truck and the encounter with the police, Katrina lost contact with Fontaine until around 8 p.m., after Fontaine left the hotel where she was staying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At around 3 a.m. the following morning, the two young women were approached on Ellice Avenue by a man who offered Fontaine money to perform a sex act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She accepted and left with the man. Katrina followed them but lost sight of the two in the dark.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

In response to Fontaine's death, the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] requested a full inquiry into the number of [[missing and murdered Indigenous women]] in Canada. The RCMP already had such a study underway, which was completed in 2014. Acting chief commissioner David Langtry wrote, "Once again our hearts are filled with grief and sadness as we mourn the brutal and senseless murder of an Aboriginal girl. Tina must not disappear into the oblivion of statistics."&lt;ref name="APTN1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aptn.ca/news/2014/08/19/tina-fontaines-murder-renews-call-inquiry-missing-murdered-indigenous-women/ |title= Tina Fontaine’s murder renews call for inquiry into missing, murdered Indigenous women |publisher=APTN |date= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the death, a volunteer group known as Drag the Red was formed. They have begun to regularly drag portions of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], in order to find bodies or evidence.&lt;ref name="Vice1"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.vice.com/video/drag-the-red |title= Drag the Red |publisher= Vice Media |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a local Inuit woman, Holly Jarrett, has started social media campaigns: the [[AmINext|#AmINext]] hashtag and a [[Change.org]] petition in response to Fontaine's death. The hashtag campaign called for a national inquiry and allowed Indigenous women to express their feelings about the issue of [[missing and murdered Indigenous women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burman|first=Jenny|date=2016-04-28|title=Multicultural Feeling, Feminist Rage, Indigenous Refusal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1532708616638693|journal=Cultural Studies ↔ Critical Methodologies|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=361–372|doi=10.1177/1532708616638693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fontaine was buried on [[Sagkeeng First Nation]] next to her father. A memorial was placed at the site on the first anniversary of the discovery of her body at the Red River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/memorial-for-tina-fontaine-unveiled-one-year-after-teen-s-body-pulled-from-red-river-1.2520010|title=Memorial for Tina Fontaine unveiled one year after teen's body pulled from Red River|date=August 17, 2015|work=CTV Winnipeg|last1=Miljure|first1=Ben|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Joseph Cormier was charged with Fontaine's murder in December 2015.&lt;ref name="CBC1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/murder-charge-laid-in-death-of-tina-fontaine-1.2696774|title=Murder charge laid in death of Tina Fontaine|date=11 December 2015|publisher=CTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the change in government, in December 2016 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that a national inquiry titled "Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls" would be undertaken. Five independent commissioners were appointed, and commissioners and staff began to consult with families, activist organizations, and others about how to structure the inquiry.

Constables Jansen and Houle were suspended for their actions and left the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/security-video-of-tina-fontaine-captured-days-before-she-was-killed-shown-in-court/article37872202/|title=Security video of Tina Fontaine captured days before she was killed shown in court|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2018, the [[Justice for our Stolen Children Camp]] was set up on Wascana Park in Regina in response to the death of Tina Fontaine and [[Death of Colten Boushie|Colten Boushie]].&lt;ref name=ReginaPost15June2018&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/after-108-days-justice-for-our-stolen-children-camp-comes-down|title=After 108 days, Justice For Our Stolen Children camp comes down|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|date=15 June 2018|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, political activist Indygo Arscott held a rally outside [[Toronto City Hall]] to voice outrage in memory of Fontaine due to Cormier being found not guilty of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thevarsity.ca/2018/03/05/justice-for-tina-fontaine-rally-held-at-nathan-phillips-square/|title="Justice for Tina Fontaine" rally held at Nathan Phillips Square|last=Banares |first=Ilya |date=March 5, 2018 |access-date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/thousands-gather-in-memory-of-tina-fontaine-in-toronto-1.4561309|title=Thousands gather in memory of Tina Fontaine in Toronto|last=Johnson |first=Rhiannon |date=March 3, 2018 |access-date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falstaff International Film Festival''' (FIFF) was a film festival that took place in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 2009. During its inaugural year it was the largest [[film festival]] for rising talent and new cinema in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] region of [[England]]. The festival supported [[Major film studios|commercial]] films, [[independent film|independent]] films, [[short films|short]] films, as well as [[feature films]]. The director of the festival was [[Rowan M. Ashe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1383922|Rowan M. Ashe}}, 24 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.withoutabox.com/03film/03t_fin/03t_fin_fest_01over.php?festival_id=7718|title=Withoutabox|work=withoutabox.com|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The festival was launched to reinvigorate the local filmmaking community following the short success of two previous international film festivals in the town. The festival also recognised the importance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s influence on film and in entertainment, with [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] being his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.covfilmmakers.org/2009/11/falstaff-international-film-festival.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival 2009==
The first festival took place from November 14 to 20 of 2009 with entries from all over the world. The festival also relaunched the Midlands Short Filmmaking Competition that celebrated achievements from regional filmmakers. An awards ceremony concluded the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fest21.com/en/festival/falstaff_international_film_festival Fest21.com: films, festivals and digital community&lt;/ref&gt;

Although film festivals in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] have taken place consistently every two years no announcement has been made for a 2011 festival. The town is home to many types of festivals due to the popularity of the town and its tourist attractions. A suggestion has been made that the Stratford-upon-Avon Fringe Festival that was launched in 2010 may adopt the visual arts as part of its mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordfringe.co.uk/ |title=MICHAEL Michael Kors Satchels,Air Jordan IV 4,Mizuno Footwear |work=stratfordfringe.co.uk |accessdate=25 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117071116/http://www.stratfordfringe.co.uk/ |archivedate=17 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederick Lincoln '''"'''Dick'''"''' Ashworth''' (24 January 1912 – 3 December  2005) was a [[United States Navy]] officer who served as the weaponeer on the [[B-29]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' that dropped a [[Fat Man]] [[atomic bomb]]  on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]] on 9 August 1945 during [[World War II]].

A 1933 graduate of the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], Ashworth commanded [[VFA-115|Torpedo Squadron Eleven (VT-11)]], a [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] unit based on [[Guadalcanal]] that flew patrol, search, spotting, strike, and night mine-laying missions in support of the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for heroism while carrying out these missions. He then participated in the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] as aviation officer on the staff of [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]]'s V Amphibious Force.

Rotated back to the United States in June 1944, Ashworth became senior naval aviator at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]]. In November 1944 he was assigned to the [[Manhattan Project]], and supervised the  testing of [[atomic bomb]] components at [[Wendover Air Force Base|Wendover]]. In February 1945, he travelled to [[Guam]], where he met [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]], and selected [[Tinian]] as a base of operations for the [[509th Composite Group]]. After the war he selected [[Bikini Atoll]] as the site for [[Operation Crossroads]].

Remaining in the navy after the war, Ashworth rose to the rank of vice admiral in May 1966. He was [[Commandant of Midshipmen]] at the United States Naval Academy in 1958, and served as commander of the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] from September 1966 to April 1967. He retired from the navy in 1968, and died in 2005.

==Early life==
Frederick Lincoln "Dick" Ashworth was born in  [[Beverly, Massachusetts]] on 24 January 1912, the third child of Fred Ashworth, who worked as a draughtsman and tool designer for the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, and his wife Minnie. He had two older brothers, Phil and Bentley. Phil graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], in 1931, but died in a 1938 seaplane crash off [[Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php?fuseaction=home.story&amp;story_id=7619 |title=Naval aviator Ashworth dies in Santa Fe |author=Steve Sandoval |date=7 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605233450/http://www.lanl.gov/news/index.php?fuseaction=home.story&amp;story_id=7619 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/beverly/news/opinions/x21534932 |title=From Beverly to Nagasaki: The "Dick" Ashworth story |author=Stephen P.

The family moved to a farmhouse in [[Wenham, Massachusetts]], in 1918. Ashworth attended Center School in Wenham, and then, as Wenham had no high school of its own, [[Beverly High School]], where he was president of the Student Council. Too young and small for football, he participated in track and cross country running. He graduated in 1928, and then entered [[Dartmouth College]].&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beverley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salemnews.com/local/x2064744057/Beverly-natives-role-in-atomic-bomb-overlooked |title=Beverly native's role in atomic bomb overlooked  |author=Paul Leighton  |date=9 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashworth decided that he wanted to go to Annapolis like his brother. He sat and passed the examinations for an appointment from his local Congressman, but did not secure one of the Congressman's two appointments. However, in August 1929, he was informed that one of the Congressman's appointments had been rejected for defective teeth. Ashworth then entered Annapolis. He graduated 134th in the class of 1933, and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beverley"/&gt;

==Naval career==

===Solomon Islands===
[[File:TBF-1 VT-11 Guadalcanal May1943.jpg|thumb|right|Ashworth (right) with VT-11 in the Solomon Islands]]
Ashworth's first posting was to the [[battleship]] {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|6}}. He married Nathalie Louise (Nan) Bliss from [[Peabody, Massachusetts]] in June 1935.&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt; They had three sons: Frederick Jr., David and Stephen.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; In 1936, he was accepted for aviator training, and reported to the [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]]. He then held various positions including air photography officer for the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. In 1939, he volunteered for postgraduate study at Annapolis as an aviation ordinance engineer.&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt;

By the time Ashworth graduated in June 1942, the United States had entered [[World War II]]. He became commander of [[VFA-115|Torpedo Squadron Eleven (VT-11)]], a [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] unit based on [[Guadalcanal]].  VT-11 pilots flew patrol, search, spotting, strike, and night mine-laying missions in support of the [[New Georgia Campaign]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Ashworth was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Bronze Star Medal]].&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyraider.org/skyassn/skysqdhist/va115.pdf |accessdate=14 December 2013 |title=Dictionary of American naval aviation squadrons |first=Roy A. |last=Grossnick |publisher=Naval Historical Center |location=Washington, D.C.|year=1995 |pp=181–183 |isbn= 9780160452963 |oclc=31242871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Distinguished Flying Cross citation read: {{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to Lieutenant Commander Frederick Lincoln Ashworth (NSN: 0-72354), United States Navy, for heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight in aerial attacks as the commanding officer of a Torpedo Bomber Squadron against Japanese shore installations and shipping in the Solomon Islands area during the period from 26 April to 12 July 1943. During the nights of 18, 20 and 23 May, Lieutenant Commander Ashworth led his squadron in mine laying missions in the Kahili-Shortland area, South Bougainville. It was necessary that level flight at one thousand feet, constant speed and steady course be maintained for periods of time up to one and one-half minutes duration approximately one thousand yards from heavily-fortified Japanese positions. His plane made the longest run on each mission and despite illumination by a concentration of enemy searchlights and heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire these extremely hazardous missions were carried out effectively. He led two night anti-shipping missions in the same area on the nights of 15 and 28 May 1943. On the night of 15 May, he personally by aggressive, daring, and exceptionally well planned attack scored a confirmed hit on an enemy cargo ship. Lieutenant Commander Ashworth also participated in a daylight shipping raid in the same area which was pressed home despite considerable enemy aircraft opposition. He led his squadron in seven successful and highly effective bombing raids against Munda, two against Rekata Bay, and one against Vila, all of which were strongly defended enemy positions. His conduct was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="Valor"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Military Times |title=Valor awards for Frederick Lincoln Ashworth |accessdate=14 December 2013 |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=55199 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214121313/http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=55199 |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 1943, Ashworth was posted to the staff of [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]]'s V Amphibious Force as aviation officer. In this capacity he served in the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Amphibians Came to Conquer: the Story of Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner |first=George C. |last=Dyer |location=Washington, DC |publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Navy |year=1972 |oclc=476880 |pp=606, 863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Alberta===
In June 1944, Ashworth was rotated back to the United States, where he became senior naval aviator at the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Naval Proving Ground]] in [[Dahlgren, Virginia]]. In November he was assigned to the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt; He later recalled that {{quote|My job at [[Los Alamos laboratory|Los Alamos]] was to supervise and coordinate the work of engineers in the testing at [[Wendover Air Force Base|Wendover]] of bomb components then being developed at Los Alamos. I don't know who though that the Los Alamos people needed supervising and coordinating by a young commander, US Navy. But I was able to run interference for them with the base commander, Colonel Heflin, and I think in useful ways. That wasn't difficult either because Colonel Heflin was one fine Air Force officer.&lt;ref name="509th"&gt;{{cite book | last = Krauss | first=Robert | last2 = Krauss | first2 = Amelia | title=The 509th Remembered: A History of the 509th Composite Group as Told by the Veterans Themselves | publisher=509th Press | location = Buchanan, Michigan | isbn= 0-923568-66-2 | oclc = 59148135 | year=2005 |pp=15–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Holding the rank of commander, he became Director of Operations for [[Project Alberta]], the portion of the [[Manhattan Project]] tasked with dropping of the weapons on [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. In February 1945, Ashworth was sent to [[Guam]] to deliver a letter to [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] from Fleet Admiral [[Ernest King]] ordering him to provide whatever support the Manhattan Project required. Ashworth's first task was to select a suitable base area for the [[509th Composite Group]]. After looking at Guam and [[Saipan]], he decided that [[Tinian]] would be more suitable, as it was closer to Japan than Guam, and had better facilities than Saipan. At the suggestion of island commander, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Frederick V. H. Kimble]], Ashworth selected an area at the northern end of the island.&lt;ref name="509th"/&gt;

The Director of the Manhattan Project,  [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted each nuclear strike mission to be commanded by a "weaponeer", a [[Project Alberta]] service academy graduate who would fly on the bomb-carrying aircraft and make such tactical decisions as were required. Only two officers met this requirement: Ashworth and his commanding officer, [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]]. The two therefore agreed that they would flying alternating missions. Parsons therefore commanded the [[Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] mission, while Ashworth commanded the Nagasaki mission.&lt;ref name="509th"/&gt; For this mission, Ashworth was awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]]. His citation read:{{quote|The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star (Army Award) to Commander Frederick Lincoln Ashworth (NSN: 0-72354), United States Navy, for gallantry in action while engaged in aerial flight against the Japanese Empire on 9 August 1945, from a base in the Marianas Islands. Commander Ashworth was Senior Military Technical Observer on a B-29 aircraft carrying the second atomic bomb to be employed in the history of warfare. After the Superfort was well away from its island base, Commander Ashworth personally entered the bomb bay to fuze the atomic bomb. Following a circuitous course to the Japanese Empire in order to avoid heavy weather, they arrived over the primary target with low reserves of gasoline. Despite this and the possibility of damage from anti-aircraft fire or enemy fighters, he advised that an effort be made to bomb the primary target and the big plane remained over the city for nearly one hour, making three attempts to drop the new bomb, all failing because smoke obscured the target. Little more than enough fuel remained for Superfort to reach the nearest emergency landing field but they set a course directly across the Empire, disregarding the dangers of flak and enemy fighter attacks, and under Commander Ashworth's direction released the bomb on the secondary target, the important industrial city of Nagasaki. The tremendous blast which followed destroyed a square mile of the city and played an important part in bringing forth an offer of surrender from the Japanese within 24 hours. Although the B-29 was shaken by the detonation, they proceeded to the emergency field and landed with fuel tanks virtually empty. Commander Ashworth distinguished himself by his high degree of skill in directing work with the atomic bomb, the great personal risk he took in placing the powder charge in the bomb during flight and attack despite unfavorable conditions. His actions reflect great credit on himself and the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="Valor"/&gt;}}

He was also awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. His citation read: {{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Commander Frederick Lincoln Ashworth (NSN: 0-72354), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States in connection with the development of the greatest military weapon of all time, the atomic bomb. Joining the Atomic Bomb Project in November 1944, Commander Ashworth was assigned the duties of supervising and coordinating field tests in which facsimiles of the weapon were dropped from B-29 aircraft. Thoroughly understanding the principles and functions of intricate and complicated mechanisms, he was able to make sure that no time was wasted and the maximum information gained, both as to the components and as to the technique of delivery. Serving with intelligence, resourcefulness and devotion to duty, Commander Ashworth inspired the full confidence of all of the organizations and individuals concerned in the tests and insured the complete cooperation which was essential to achieve results in the time available. As a result of his successful fulfillment of this exacting and important assignment, he acted as representative of General Groves in the historic deliver of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, 9 August 1945. Commander Ashworth's leadership, professional skill and distinctive performance of duty throughout the test and development of this project were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="Valor"/&gt;}}

Ashworth was awarded a second [[Legion of Merit]] for [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946. His citation read:  {{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure  in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Legion of Merit  to Captain Frederick Lincoln Ashworth (NSN: 0-72354), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Chief of Staff to Commander Task Group 1.1, Joint Task Force ONE, during the period 7 February 1946 to 31 October 1946. With outstanding initiative, vision and professional ability, Captain Ashworth participated in the organization of both the military and technical staff of Joint Task Force ONE from its inception. He also made major contributions to the basic planning of the operation including the selection of Bikini Atoll as the site of the tests. As the operations proceeded Captain Ashworth's knowledge, background, initiative and good judgment enabled him to make major contributions to the effective coordination of the work of diverse military and civilian groups, particularly those involved in the preparation and air and underwater deliver of the atomic bombs. His outstanding service and performance of duty were at all times in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="Valor"/&gt;}}

===Post-war career===
Ashworth remained in the navy after the war. He served on the staff of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s Division of Military Applications from 1952 to 1954.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt; He was [[Commandant of Midshipmen]] at the United States Naval Academy in 1958,&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt; and headed the Atomic Energy Division for the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] from 1958 to 1960.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;

Promoted to [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in May 1966, Ashworth served as commander of the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] from September 1966 to April 1967, for which he was awarded a [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. From April 1967 to September 1968, he was Deputy Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and as chief of staff to the Commander in Chief Atlantic, Commander in Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet and Commander in Chief Western Atlantic Area, for which he was awarded a second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]. He retired in September 1968 with the rank of vice admiral.&lt;ref name="From Beverly to Nagasaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valor"/&gt;

==Retirement==
Frederick L. Ashworth lived for over three decades in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. He divorced his first wife in 1990, and remarried.&lt;ref name="Beverley"/&gt; He died on  3 December 2005 at Arizona Heart Hospital in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], while undergoing heart surgery,&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;  and was buried in the [[Santa Fe National Cemetery]]. He was survived by his second wife, Ercie Bell Ashworth, and his sons Frederick Jr., David and Stephen.&lt;ref name="LANL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/06/AR2005120601834.html |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |title=Frederick Ashworth; Helped Drop Atom Bomb |date=7 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''global recession''' is [[recession]] that affects many countries around the world—that is, a period of global economic slowdown or declining economic output.

== Definitions ==
The [[International Monetary Fund]] defines a global recession as "a decline in annual per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP ([[purchasing power parity]] weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, per{{nbhyph}}capita investment, and per{{nbhyph}}capita consumption".&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/04/22/whats-a-global-recession/|title=What’s a Global Recession?|publisher=The Walstreet Journal|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/text.pdf|title=World Economic Outlook - April 2009: Crisis and Recovery|format=PDF|work=Box 1.1 (page 11-14)|publisher=IMF|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this definition, since [[World War II]] there were only four global recessions (in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009), all of them only lasting a year (although the 1991 recession would have lasted until 1993 if the IMF had used normal exchange rate weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP rather than the [[purchasing power parity]] weighted per{{nbhyph}}capita real World GDP).&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt; The 2009 global recession, also known as the [[Great Recession]], was by far the worst of the four postwar recessions, both in terms of the number of countries affected and the decline in real World GDP per capita.&lt;ref name="New IMF Global Recession definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF WEO 2009" /&gt;

Before April 2009, the IMF argued that a global annual [[real GDP]] growth rate of 3.0 percent or less was "equivalent to a global recession".&lt;ref name="economist-12381879"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12381879 |title=The world economy Bad, or worse |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lall, Subir.

== Overview ==
Informally, a national [[recession]] is a period of declining economic output. In a 1974 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, [[Julius Shiskin]] suggested several [[rules of thumb]] to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), a measure of the nation's output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Achuthan |first=Lakshman |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/05/news/economy/recession/index.htm |title=The risk of redefining recession, Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, Economic Cycle Research Institute, May 7, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but not the United States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUUg6ckAsM5U&amp;refer=hom Japan's Economy Shrinks 0.4%, Confirming Recession]
By Jason Clenfield&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas a national recession is identified by two quarters of decline, defining a '''global recession''' is more difficult, because a [[Developing country]] is expected to have a higher GDP growth than a [[Developed country]].&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/update/03/index.htm |title=IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update - Rapidly Weakening Prospects Call for New Policy Stimulus - November 2008 |publisher=Imf.org |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IMF, the real GDP growth of the emerging and developing countries is on an uptrend and that of advanced economies is on a downtrend since late 1980s. The world growth is projected to slow from 5% in 2007 to 3.75% in 2008 and to just over 2% in 2009. Downward revisions in GDP growth vary across regions. Among the most affected are commodity exporters, and countries with acute external financing and [[Liquidity risk|liquidity problems]]. Countries in [[East Asia]] (including [[China]]) have suffered smaller declines because their financial situations are more robust. They have benefited from falling commodity prices and they have initiated a shift toward macroeconomic policy easing.&lt;ref name="imf-weo-2008-03" /&gt;

The IMF estimates that global recessions occur over a cycle lasting between eight and ten years. During what the IMF terms the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=arlKrFbn3pfY&amp;refer=home|title=Global Recession Risk Grows as U.S. `Damage' Spreads.

[[File:Grand-Hotel-1908.jpg|right|thumb|Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat at the beginning of the 20th century]]
The '''Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, A Four Seasons Hotel''' is a famous five star luxury resort hotel, situated in [[Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat]] in the [[French Riviera]]. The hotel obtained the "Palace de France" distinction, granted by the French government for its excellence in service in 2011. The highest ranking of all the many “palaces” that sprang up all over the [[French Riviera]], the Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat overlooks the sea from the furthermost tip of the peninsula from which it takes its name.

==History==
At the turn of the 20th century, Cap-Ferrat was little more than a wilderness of rocks and dense scrubland, vegetation that only changed as real estate began to develop there. At the end of the 19th century, piece by piece, [[King Leopold II]] of Belgium purchased the peninsula’s only wooded area, and then proceeded to expand his estate by buying up most of the vacant land around.

Shortly before 1900, Leopold sold part of his property to a company founded by a Mr. Péretmère, the son of a coachman from the north who had some savings of his own. He reserved six and a half hectares of the land for the hotel, whose construction began in 1908 with the two wings built at an open angle to each other, then the following year a loggia dining room and the large, central Rotonde were added. By then, the building had its final, distinctive silhouette, remarkably simple for the time. A little later, the Grand-Hôtel was bought by Madame Ferras, a widow and the grandmother of famous violinist [[Christian Ferras]].

==Twentieth century==
The First World War broke out shortly after the new owner’s arrival and the hotel became a hospital. In 1922, two professional hoteliers, Messrs Henri Dehouve and André Voyenne, acquired a majority shareholding and took over the running of
the company. They were to remain in charge for over twenty years, a period marked not only by the Great Depression and the Second World War, but also by a complete revolution in holidaying habits.

===When the sun was the enemy===
Since it first became known in the second half of the 19th century, and up until the 1930s, the French Riviera remained almost exclusively a luxury destination. Most visitors were either wealthy individuals of independent means or royalty from northern countries, in particular England and Russia. They came only in winter and for long visits. [[Queen Victoria]] and her court, numerous aristocratic families, Princess Louise, the Duke of Connaught, President Paul Deschanel and many other politicians of the French 3rd Republic, the pianist Marguerite Long, the violinist Jacques Thibaud, and movie stars such as Charles Boyer, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and many others were to follow.

===The summer season emerges===
Not until 1930 did a few unconventional visitors venture down to the Riviera in summertime, mostly avant-garde writers and artists. They all came in search of solitude, since practically nobody came then, and relished a certain snobbery surrounding their alternative style of travelling. In Cap-Ferrat itself, these new habits arrived purely by chance. During the summer of 1933, the German filmmaker [[G.W. Pabst]] persuaded [[Chaliapine]] to star in his version of Don Quixote. Since he did not have the funds to film in Spain, the director decided that Cap-Ferrat’s landscape would be perfectly suitable. One day, the film crew appeared at the hotel, which was closed at the time but nevertheless offered them improvised accommodation for a few weeks. The actors and film crew were so delighted with their stay in this heavenly location that many of them asked to return the following year for a private visit. Little by little, the summer season emerged, attracting a whole new generation of holidaymakers, younger and more athletic than their predecessors and seeking sun and sea above all else. Since the hotel’s rocky coastline made it difficult to reach the sea, a cove was blasted from the rock.

===Postwar===
A few weeks after the beginning of the war, the Grand-Hôtel was boarded up and plunged into darkness for six long years. On March 5, 1944, in preparation for an allied landing, the entire peninsula was evacuated and riddled with mines. Local inhabitants were given only a few hours to grab some of their belongings and flee. Thankfully, the hotel and swimming pool survived entirely unscathed by nearby shelling and the explosion that destroyed the lighthouse.

Upon reopening at the end of the war, the procession of the great, rich and famous continued; the European royal houses, lords and barons from England; the great entrepreneurs of finance and industry, glittering literary and artistic celebrities. Other illustrious guests included the novelist [[Somerset Maugham]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Aristote Onassis]]. The legendary swimming instructor, [[Pierre Gruneberg]], has given lessons to [[Picasso]], as well to both [[Paul McCartney]]’s and [[Frank Sinatra]]’s children.

==21st century==
An extension was built in two phases, while the hotel was closed each year, from October to April 2007 – 2008 and again in 2008–2009, and opened in May 2009. The project was designed by architect Luc Svetchine and comprised 16 rooms, 8 suites with private plunge pools, a 7500sq.feet spa with indoor swimming pool and the creation of two new suites on the garden level of the main building. The grounds are the work of landscape gardener Jean Mus. A new underground car park replaced the old above-ground parking areas.

Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts took over management of the hotel on May 8, 2015 and the name was changed to Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat, A Four Seasons Hotel.

==Rooms and suites==
As of May 1, 2009, the Grand Hotel du Cap Ferrat contains 74 rooms (including 24 suites and the Penthouse), a {{convert|7500|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} spa &amp; fitness center and a {{convert|5500|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} presidential suite, the Villa Rose-Pierre with its sea-view and pine grove.

==Restaurants==
[[File:Restaurant-Le-Cap.jpg|right|thumb|Restaurant at the hotel]]
The Grand-Hôtel serves food from three locations: at the Le Cap Gastronomic Restaurant, on its terrace overlooking the Mediterranean and shaded by Aleppo pines, or at the Club Dauphin Restaurant next to the pool.

==Vintage wines==
The Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat maintains a collection of well-known vintage wines:
* 140 vintage bottles of [[Château d'Yquem]] dating from 1854 to 2003
*  38 vintage bottles of [[Château Lafite Rothschild]] dating from 1799 to 2003

==Music Festival==
The Grand-Hotel du Cap-Ferrat Music Festival
Artistic director : Michael Desjardins

The Festival is an up-to-date version of the tradition of salon music, which dates back to centuries past, and of the jazz clubs and Parisian café-theatres where audiences would rub shoulders with the artists. The Rotonde, designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]], is a comfortable venue with outstanding acoustics.
The programme spans every genre of vocal and instrumental music from all eras: opera, classical music, baroque music, film soundtracks, international variety, jazz, traditional music, and first performances of original works of contemporary
music.

'''Guðríður Símonardóttir''' (1598 – December 18, 1682) was an Icelandic woman who was one of 242 people abducted from the [[Westman Islands]], [[Iceland]] in 1627 in a raid by [[Barbary pirates]].&lt;ref name="saurbaer"&gt;[http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/plofin_saurbaer.htm "Saurbaer"], Nordic Adventure Travel, Iceland&lt;/ref&gt;  These raids came to be known as [[the Turkish abductions]] and Guðríður became known as '''''Tyrkja-Gudda'''''. After being held as a slave and concubine for nearly a decade, she was one of a few captives ransomed by the Danish king. She returned to Iceland, marrying the young pastor [[Hallgrímur Pétursson]], who became known for his poetry and hymns. 

==Life==
Guðríður was the young wife of a fisherman and a mother.  After her abduction in 1627 from the Westman Islands, she was sold by the pirates as a [[slave]] and [[concubine]] in [[Algeria]]. She was among the few who were ransomed nearly a decade later by King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], and she returned to Iceland.

She was sent to Denmark along with some other former slaves to be re-educated. They were taught by [[Hallgrímur Pétursson]], then a theology student. They fell in love and she became pregnant by him. They returned to Iceland where she learned that her husband had died. She and Hallgrímur married. He later was called as the pastor of a church at [[Saurbær]], [[Iceland]] (1651–1669).  He became well known for his poetry and especially what are known as ''[[Passion Hymns]]'' (''Passíusálmar''), recounting the life and death (The Passion) of Christ.&lt;ref name="saurbaer"/&gt; 

Other Icelanders looked down on Guðríður and considered her a whore and heathen, blaming her for her time in Algeria. She was 16 years older than Hallgrímur, which in itself was considered a disgrace.

==Representation in other media==
Jakob Jónsson wrote an epic play about Tyrkja-Gudda in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leikskald.is/gamla/leikrit/enska/jajtyrkj.html Tyrkja-Gudda] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710044721/http://leikskald.is/gamla/leikrit/enska/jajtyrkj.html |date=2012-07-10 }}, The Icelandic Dramatists Union&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinunn Jóhannesdóttir wrote a historical novel about Tyrkja-Gudda called ''Reisubók Guðríðar Símonardóttur'' (''Gudridur's Journey,'' 2001). The book was on the bestseller list in Iceland for months, and it has been reprinted every year since first being published. Rights have been sold to Germany and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islit.is/media/pdf/Forlagidfictionlow.pdf ''Fiction''], p. 44, Forlagid Rights Agency, Iceland&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel López made a documentary about Tyrkja-Gudda in 2017, "From Miguel de Cervantes to Guðríður Símonardóttir, an Icelandic woman in Algiers" (in Spanish and subtitled in English). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6OvTrs6gqc

'''Shree Baba Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan''' is a [[festival]] of [[Indian classical music]], held every year on the last weekend in December, in [[Jalandhar|Jalandhar City]]. 

The festival, which was first held in 1875 at the ''Sidh Peeth Shri Devi Talab Mandir'', in Jalandhar, is named after [[Baba Harballabh]] who is considered a [[saint]] and an exponent of [[Hindustani classical music]] in [[North India|northern India]]. 

The 3 day long festival hosts 15-20 artists every year. Prominent artists of Hindustani Classical Music from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have performed at the festival at one time or the other during the history of the festival, which attracts thousands of music lovers from all over India and other countries.

There is no admission fee.  The money for organizing the festival comes from various [[donation]]s and [[Grant (money)|grant]]s, both public and private. 

==Shree Baba Harballabh Sangeet Pratiyogita==
To encourage the young to appreciate and improve themselves in the field of Hindustani classical music and to bring out the best amongst the competitors, an open competition in Hindustani Classical Music is organized by the Mahasabha every year for 3 days prior to the annual [[Sangeet Sammelan]]. 

There are three categories for competition, namely: [[Singing|Vocal]], [[Instrumental]] (Non-Percussion) and Instrumental ([[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]) with two age groups in each category: Juniors (''Yuva Varg'' - between 13 and 19 years) and Seniors (''Varishth Varg'' - 19 to 25 years) and three prizes in each category: First, Second and Third. 

The winners from the Senior age group are [[Initiation|initiated]] and given an opportunity to perform as 'Performing Artists' during the next Sammelan.

==Shree Baba Harballabh Sangeet Utsavs==
Vasant Utsav, Malhar Utsav and Hemant Utsav are organized in the months of February, August and October every year. 
Two to three artists are invited during these Utsavs to give their performance during a 4-5 hour program on the scheduled evenings. 

During the Utsavs, preference is given to the upcoming [[artist]]s in the field of Hindustani classical music so as to give them appropriate exposure in [[music]] circles.

'''Henry Pearlman''' (1895–1974) was a Brooklyn-born, self-made businessman who discovered in midlife a passion for [[impressionist]] and [[post-impressionist]] art. Over three postwar decades, he assembled a "deeply personal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Willis F.|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|location=Detroit|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;  collection centered on thirty-three works by [[Paul Cézanne]] and more than forty by [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaïm Soutine]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and a dozen other European modernists. His eye for quality was "rarely matched in a private collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=The Pearlman Collection|journal=Arts|date=February 1959|volume=33|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business career==
Pearlman started his career in the cork insulation business, forming his own company, Eastern Cold Storage Insulation Corporation, at the age of twenty-four and becoming a major player in marine refrigeration. He married Rose Fried in 1925; they raised two daughters in [[Croton-on-Hudson]], eventually living both there and in Manhattan and traveling frequently in pursuit of art.

==Art Collector==

[[File:1921, Soutine, View of Céret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaïm Soutine]], ''View of Céret'', ca. 1921-22]]

While Pearlman initially decorated his Croton home with Old Master and American Realist paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|location=Princeton and New Haven|isbn=978-0300174403|page=60|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including those found at local flea markets, his passion for art, and the stories behind each work, found full expression with the purchase at auction in 1945 of an expressionist painting by [[Chaïm Soutine]] – ''View of Céret'' (formerly ''Village Square, Céret''). As one observer put it, "his first foray into Parisian modernism revealed an acute eye, an instinct for the historical moment and a deeply felt connection to an artist who opened up a new world for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pearlman quickly made connections in the New York art world; he spent time in museums and archives; and he soon traded his decorative collection for carefully selected examples of modern works by impressionist, post-impressionist and expressionist European artists. Pearlman found himself captivated by the details of the lives of and associations among these artists, and his acquisitions often followed such discoveries; he "liked connections and contexts, but as they arose within the framework of his vividly personal taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman was invigorated by the pursuit of quality as well as the challenges of finding, authenticating and negotiating the ownership of increasingly rare masterpieces.

In the years after World War II, Pearlman began traveling to Europe. During an early trip to London he met Austrian expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=61|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in a lifelong friendship for Pearlman with one of the few living artists whose work he collected. On this same trip he also visited the places where Soutine had painted, trying to identify the landscapes he already knew well from their expressionist representation – an activity he would repeat with other artists and works as he built his collection. In his hunt for new works, he looked first to Soutine’s close associates, including [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]. Ultimately the collection would include seven paintings by Soutine, and four works by Modigliani, including a rare limestone head and two oil portraits (''[[Léon Indenbaum]]'' and ''[[Jean Cocteau]]'').

Although successful in business, Pearlman was never able to match the resources of his contemporaries. Instead, "he was both lucky and clever: lucky in that, when he first started, the art he was interested in…could be secured for thousands rather than millions of dollars…and clever in that he continuously honed his eye and then applied his skills… to obtain the objects of his passion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=B. B.|title=A rare feast|journal=The Economist|date=3 April 2014|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2014/04/masterpieces-19th-and-20th-century-european-art|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1950 Pearlman learned from a dealer that [[Van Gogh]]’s ''Tarascon Diligence'' was available from the heirs of the artist Milo Beretta. He quickly offered a combination of paintings and cash to make what is perhaps his most fabled acquisition – the last time a "lost" Van Gogh will reappear for the next sixty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genauer|first=Emily|title=Art and Artists: A Van Gogh, New to America, Acquired by Private Collector,|journal=The New York Herald Tribune|date=3 September 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a reviewer described, this Van Gogh was "a typical Pearlman picture: assertive, pushing a characteristic manner to an extreme that is slightly unusual in the artist’s oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 1950, with the advice of noted [[Cézanne]] specialist [[John Rewald]], Pearlman made his first purchase of a Cézanne watercolor, ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir''. Over the following two decades, he would acquire more than thirty works by Cézanne and assemble the most distinguished collection of watercolors by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong, Carol and|first=Laura Giles, eds.|title=Cézanne in Focus: Watercolors from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum|location=Princeton|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cezanne-Focus-Watercolors-Pearlman-Collection/dp/B000JWDTRA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397143393&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=%22cezanne+in+focus%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new fascination with Cézanne did not distract Pearlman from his expanding interest in the works of other artists who lived and worked in France, many of whom knew, were influenced by and competed with one another. In addition to Modigliani, he added works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Degas, Renoir and Gauguin as well as several significant oil paintings by Cézanne, including the only known vertical-format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rewald|first=John|title=The Paintings of Paul Cézanne: A Catalogue Raisonné|date=1996|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|pages=535–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the artist’s favorite subject, [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]].  Pearlman continued to build his collection - buying, selling and trading works – for the three remaining decades of his life. His last two purchases were Cézanne watercolors: a late masterpiece (''Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit'') and ''Rocks at Bibémus'', which he had come to know when it appeared alongside works from his collection in a number of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=68|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and Legacy==

[[File:1895, Cézanne, Cistern in the Park of Château Noir.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir'', 1895-1900]]

Beginning in the 1950s, Henry and Rose Pearlman began lending individual works to major museums, initially for retrospectives of Soutine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Monroe|title=Soutine|date=1950|publisher=Museum of Modern Art, New York in collaboration with the Cleveland Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Modigliani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soby|first=James Thrall|title=Modigliani: Paintings, Drawings, Sculpture.|date=1951|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As their collection took shape, loans and exhibitions of the collection became important to them and eventually occupied as much of Henry’s time and attention as acquisitions did. Although he never tired of the hunt, works that met his eye for quality and expressiveness were soon available only to those with the funds, not just a passion.

Pearlman’s generosity extended beyond the loans of works from his collection. He lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and [[Jacques Lipchitz]], whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacques Lipchitz studio fund invoice, 1952? (Digital ID: 14010), Jacques Lipchitz papers and Bruce Bassett papers concerning Jacques Lipchitz, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/jacques-lipchitz-studio-fund-invoice-14010|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[http://www.pearlmancollection.org The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation] was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958: twenty-seven selected works, lent anonymously, to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baltimore Museum of Art|title=Anonymous Collection Exhibition|date=July–September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at [[Knoedler &amp; Company]] in New York in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fogg Museum]] in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fogg Museum|title=Drawings, Watercolors and Oils by Paul Cézanne Lent by an Anonymous Collector|date=Exhibition, 1 July–1 September  1959|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=An Exhibition of 19th &amp; 20th Century Painting and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 29 June–5 September  1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 22 May–15 October 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1986;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=Art of Cézanne from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 2 May–14 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in 1967;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in 1970;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Impressionism, Post-impressionism, Expressionism: The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection of Works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Degas, Toulouse Lautrec, Manet, Modigliani, Soutine, and Others|date=1970|publisher=Wadsworth Atheneum|location=Hartford, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.|title=Cézanne Watercolors from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 14 April–30 September  1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|title=Paul Cézanne: Works from the Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 26 June–29 August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1960 article in ''Connoisseur'' magazine describes Pearlman’s "unflagging fascination of the hunt … [He] trusts a stubborn faith in his own taste and has no interest in assembling an anthology of the standard names of modern art, but only those artists who have a special appeal to his individual taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chanin|first=A. L.|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|journal=Connoisseur|date=June 1960|volume=145|issue=586|pages=230–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]’s "Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. (When not on loan, the collection was divided between their Park Avenue apartment and Henry’s office in midtown Manhattan.)

[[File:1904, Cézanne, Mont Sainte-Victoire.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Cézanne, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire'', ca. 1904-6]]

Henry Pearlman spent much of the last year of his life organizing an exhibition of the collection at the Brooklyn Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which toured after his death to Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Art Museum, Princeton University|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 8 December 1974–14 March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utica (NY),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 13 April–31August 1974|location=Utica, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamstown (MA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francine and Sterling Clark Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 26 September  1975–22 February 1976|location=Williamstown, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnegie Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 6 April–30 May 1976|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection returned to the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] in 1976, when Rose Pearlman, as head of the foundation, initiated a series of longer-term loans that continue to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shirey|first=David L.|title=Princeton Gets Pearlman Art for 2 Years|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1976|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A world-class university-based museum, Princeton offers the collection security, conservation, curatorial expertise and management of loan requests from museums around the world.

In 2014, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation and the [http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/cézanne-and-modern-masterpieces-european-art-pearlman-foundation Princeton University Art Museum] initiated a tour of the collection, including its first exhibitions outside the United States. With the aim of expanding the audience for these works and artists, the tour (''Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection'') opened at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, England, in March 2014. Reviewers noted: "A collection of truly stunning art works" (''Oxford Times'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Theresa|title=A collection of truly stunning art works|journal=The Oxford Times|date=20 March 2014|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/art/11090159.A_collection_of_truly_stunning_art_works/|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Cézanne and the Modern''… makes you think about modern art – where it began, and what it is" (''The Guardian'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Cézanne and the Modern review – 'puts Ashmolean in the big league|journal=The Guardian|date=10 March 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/10/cezanne-modern-exhibition-review-ashmolean-museum-oxford|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The finest, best preserved collection of Cézanne watercolours in the world" (''Financial Times'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2014, it traveled to the [[Musée Granet]] in Aix-en-Provence, France, where many of the Cézanne works were originally created. The collection then returned to North America with three exhibitions: The [[High Museum]] in Atlanta, the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] and at [[Princeton University Art Museum|Princeton]] for the fall semester of 2015.

In September, 2018, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation launched a redesigned [http://www.pearlmancollection.org website] for the collection. Featuring high-quality, shareable images of the entire collection, it also offers details about where the works were created. Some of these include photographs of the same view today and many include Google Map locations. The site also has excerpts from Henry Pearlman’s "Reminiscences of a Collector," with anecdotes about collecting, forgeries, negotiations, dealers and competing collectors. The paper archives of Pearlman’s correspondence and files, held at the Smithsonian Institution’s [http://www.aaa.si.edu Archives of American Art], are also linked as well as other external resources, such as the letters of Van Gogh, X-rays of hidden works and connections among the artists represented in the collection.

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) invited broadcasters to bid for the rights to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010. Belarus broadcaster [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus]] (BRTC) won the rights to organise the contest over bids from Russia and Malta.&lt;ref name="esckaz"&gt;{{cite news|title=News on JESC 2010 organization|url=http://jesc.esckaz.com/|publisher=ESCKAZ.com|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under construction through 2009, the 15,000-spectator [[Minsk-Arena]] hosted the event. Belarus has twice previously won the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, which is, according to EBU Executive Supervisor Svante Stockselius, "one of Belarus' most popular television shows."&lt;ref name="2010 hosts"/&gt;

==Visual design==
The theme art for the contest was revealed on 8 April 2010, consisting of multi-coloured circles, symbolising "different people, cultures and countries," that form the shape of wings, that symbolise "freedom, ease of flying, creative inspiration and rising above."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=11393&amp;_t=Exclusive%3A+Presenting+logo+of+Junior+2010|title=Exclusive: Presenting logo of Junior 2010|date=2010-04-09|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 8 September, the mascots of the show were presented, being a bear and a [[wisent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=20133&amp;_t=Mascots+introduced+in+Minsk|title=Mascots introduced in Minsk|date=2010-09-21|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage, by [[Sweden|Swedish]] stage designer [[Ulf Mårtensson]], was unveiled on 15 July 2010, featuring five constructions in the shapes of wings. The hosts were also involved with each performance on their own dedicated section of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=19373&amp;_t=Presenting%3A+This+is+the+stage+of+this+year%27s+contest%21|title=Presenting: This is the stage of this year's contest!|date=2010-07-26|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theme art was also incorporated in the promotional billboards and posters featuring 11 "faces of Junior Eurovision" selected through casting procedure. Results of castings were revealed on 20 July 2010 and the 11 chosen ones were Belarus TV personalities [[Denis Kourian]], [[Olga Barabanschikova]], Irina Kazantseva, Andrey Bibikov, former JESC entrants [[Alexey Zhigalkovich]], [[Ksenia Sitnik]], [[Yuriy Demidovich]], [[Alina Molosh]], [[Daria Nadina]] as well as non-professionals Yulia Brazhinskaya and Ilya Ilmursky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=19353&amp;_t=Who+are+the+faces+of+Junior+2010%3F|title=Who are the faces of Junior 2010?|date=2010-07-21|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
On 28 July 2010, the EBU announced the competing countries for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010. A total of 14 countries competed, with [[Moldova]] making its début and [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] returning. [[Cyprus]] and [[Romania]] withdrew from the contest. [[Sweden]] returned to the contest through [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) after [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] withdrew.&lt;ref name="2010 countries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talents from 14 nations to gather at Junior Eurovision 2011|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=19403&amp;_t=Talents+from+14+nations+to+gather+at+Junior+Eurovision+2011|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=28 July 2010|date=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EBU's coordinator of the contest, [[Svante Stockselius]], labelled [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]'s return to the contest as a big achievement in terms of negotiations with possible participants and expressed hope that other Scandinavian broadcasters may also return to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mikheev|first=Andy|title=Exclusive interview with Svante Stockselius|url=http://esckaz.com/jesc/2010/event.htm#Svante|publisher=ESCKAZ.com|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show also featured all winners of [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest]] 2003-2009 [[Dino Jelusić]], [[María Isabel]], [[Ksenia Sitnik]], [[The Tolmachevy Twins]], [[Alexey Zhigalkovich]], [[Bzikebi]] and [[Ralf Mackenbach]], who performed remix-medley of their winning entries and presented the trophy to the winner of 2010 edition. Also, a special documentary "Kids of Eurovision" was filmed by [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|BTRC]] about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junioreurovision.tv/page/blog?id=20143&amp;_t=Past+Junior+winners+become+movie+stars|title=Past winners become movie stars|date=2010-10-05|publisher=JuniorEurovision.tv|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final==
Each country gave their votes through a 50% jury and 50% televoting system, which decided their top ten songs using the points 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

This is a '''list of people who disappeared mysteriously: pre-1970''' and of people whose current whereabouts are unknown or whose deaths are not substantiated. Many people who disappear are eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']]. Some of these people were possibly subjected to [[forced disappearance]], but there is insufficient information on their subsequent fates.

&lt;!--By consensus, entries must be those of people or disappearances that are notable because an article about them already exists. Do not add an entry if you cannot link to such an article. Also, fugitives from justice including most wanted criminals or those who disappear that are suspects of a crime, and whose disappearance is related to that particular crime, should not be included unless there are special circumstances regarding the case.--&gt;

Their plane, a Piper Apache piloted by John D. Watson (52) of Airplane Charters Inc., was last heard from when the pilot radioed at 7:30 pm for permission to overfly the US Naval base at [[Isla Culebra]], which was denied. The plane was never seen or heard from again. Because the pilot had failed to file a flight plan, the search for the plane did not commence until 5 a.m., 9 hours after it failed to arrive in St. Thomas. Despite an extensive air-sea search by the US Coast Guard, no trace of the plane or its passengers was ever found. Audrey Currier was a granddaughter of the financier [[Andrew Mellon]] and the daughter of senior US diplomat [[David K. E. Bruce]], while her husband Stephen was the son of socialite [[Mary Warburg]]. The Curriers had for the past ten years provided millions of dollars in financial support to the [[civil rights movement]] in the US through the Taconic Foundation and an umbrella group they founded, the [[Council for United Civil Rights Leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;"Mellon Heiress, Husband Lost at Sea", ''Washington Post'', 19 Jan. 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Lloyd, "Child of Fortune, Take 2" ''Washington Post'', 8 July 1998.

The '''[[Live Earth]] concert for [[South America]]''' was held at [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on July 7, 2007.  It is one of two free Live Earth concerts, the other being held in [[Live Earth concert, Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] It was the last concert to start during the day-long event. However, that didn't make it the last to finish, for the [[Live Earth concert, New York City|New York]] concert was still going on when things wrapped up in Rio. [[Lenny Kravitz]] was the headliner, playing a free gig there for the second time.

A few days before the event, a State prosecutor tried to cancel it, due to an alleged lack of police personnel to take care of security. However, the day after that, the concert was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20070706/ten-uk-concert-rio-3334b85.html Rio Live Earth to go on after ban revoked] Yahoo News&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance was of about 400,000 people,&lt;ref name="attendance"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL136671-9097,00.html | title = 400 mil contra o aquecimento | publisher = ''[[Rede Globo|RJTV]]'' | date = 2007-07-09 | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; much less than the crowd drawn to [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] by the [[A Bigger Bang Tour|Rolling Stones free concert]] on February 18, 2006, which exceeded a million people.&lt;ref name="stones"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://rjtv.globo.com/Jornalismo/RJTV/0,,MUL126590-9097,00.html | publisher = ''[[Rede Globo|RJTV]]'' | language = Portuguese | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | date = 2006-02-20 | title = Noite no Rio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audience numbers were closer to those of the other [[Lenny Kravitz]] performance there, on March 21, 2005.

'''Mary Elizabeth Sutherland Carpenter''' (September 1, 1920 – March 20, 2010) was a writer, [[feminism|feminist]], reporter, [[media advisor]], [[speechwriter]], political humorist, and [[public relations]] expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/us/politics/21carpenter.html | title = Liz Carpenter, journalist, Feminist and Johnson Aide, Dies at 89 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 21, 2010 | page = A22 | accessdate = 2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Liz Carpenter dies at 89; writer was press secretary to Lady Bird Johnson | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/21/local/la-me-liz-carpenter21-2010mar21 | journal = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 21, 2010 | page = A39 | accessdate = 2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | journal = [[The Washington Post]] | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/20/AR2010032002909.html | title = Liz Carpenter dies; former aide to LBJ, Lady Bird Johnson | date = March 21, 2010 | accessdate = 2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carpenter was born in historic [[Salado, Texas|Salado]] in southern [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], Texas. In 1936, her 24-room residence there was declared a state historic monument. In 1967, a plaque was unveiled to indicate that Carpenter had once lived there. At the age of seven, she moved with her family to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name=lizc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlibrary.org/carpenter/biography/ |title=The Life and Legacy of Liz Carpenter |publisher=lbjlibrary.org |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328230949/http://www.lbjlibrary.org/carpenter/biography/ |archivedate=March 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter stood in the forefront of the [[feminist movement|Women's Movement]] when it began and never wavered from her platform. Her projects and causes ranged from supporting high tech to fighting cancer. Often called the "funniest woman in politics", she was in demand as a public speaker until her death.

==Early life==
Carpenter launched her journalism career at [[Austin High School (Austin, Texas)|Austin High School]] in Austin as the editor of the school paper, ''The Austin Maroon''. Another aspiring journalist, Leslie E. "Les" Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;The A. N. Marquis Company: ''Who's Who in the South and Southwest'', Chicago, Ill., 1952, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1921–1974) of Austin, was business manager of the newspaper. The two became best friends, majored in journalism at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and worked together on the university newspaper, ''The Daily Texan''. Liz Carpenter was a member of Texas [[Orange Jackets]], the University's oldest women's honorary service organization. Les firmly supported Liz when she was elected vice president of the student body, the first woman to have held that position.&lt;ref name=lizc/&gt;

==Media and political career==
In 1942, Carpenter began covering the [[White House]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. For the next eighteen years, she reported on presidents from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to [[John F. Kennedy]] as a [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] reporter.

Les and Liz Carpenter were married on June 17, 1944, after he was discharged from the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]]. They launched the Carpenter News Bureau in the National Press Building in Washington, D.C. For the next sixteen years Carpenter covered Congress and the White House for various newspapers in Texas. She missed work only briefly when their two children, Scott and Christy, were born.&lt;ref name=lizc/&gt;

She was still a working reporter at the time of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] in Los Angeles, California. She soon joined the staff of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in his campaign for Vice President in 1960 and traveled on his foreign missions as a press spokeswoman. After Kennedy's election, she became the first woman executive assistant to the vice-president.

Carpenter was in [[Dallas]] on November 22, 1963, at the time of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. She drafted the fifty-eight words that Johnson used on his return to Washington:

:''This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy. I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help and God's.''

Following Johnson's succession to the presidency, Carpenter became the first professional newswoman to be press secretary to a first lady for [[Lady Bird Johnson]] (1963–1969), for whom she also served as staff director. Carpenter also contributed to the speeches of President Johnson, particularly in the field of humor by creating the White House Humor Group.

After the Johnson Administration ended in 1969, she wrote ''Ruffles and Flourishes'', her account of her White House experiences.

She was a vice president of Hill and Knowlton in Washington after leaving the White House. In 1971, she was one of the founders of the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] and co-chair of ERAmerica, traveling the country to push for passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

She was appointed by President [[Gerald Ford]] to the International Women's Year Commission, by President [[Jimmy Carter]] to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Public Affairs, and by President [[Bill Clinton]] to serve on the White House Conference on Aging.

Carpenter was a member of the [[Peabody Award]]s Board of Jurors from 1977 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/george-foster-peabody-awards-board-members|title=George Foster Peabody Awards Board Members|website=www.peabodyawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
In 1974, Les Carpenter died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-two, just a year after the death of Lyndon Johnson. In 1976, Carpenter returned to Austin: "Family roots, the love for Texas and the University of Texas and the [[LBJ Library]] brought me back home." She purchased a house, which she named "Grass Roots", located in the West Lake Hills overlooking the Austin skyline and the [[Colorado River of Texas|Colorado River]]&lt;ref name=lizc/&gt;

Her books include: ''Unplanned Parenthood'', Random House 1994; ''Getting Better All the Time'', Simon and Schuster 1986, as well as countless articles and forays on the lecture circuit. ''Start With a Laugh'', gives humorous advice on [http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-09-15/boa_feature3.html speech writing], was published by Eakin Press and launched at the opening of the National Women's Museum: An Institute for the Future in Dallas. Her most recent book, ''Presidential Humor'', Bright Sky Press 2006, is a compilation of quips and quotes from "George the First to George the Worst."

==Awards and recognition==
Carpenter was named a Distinguished Alumna of the University of Texas in 1975, and in 1990 was named distinguished alumnae of the Department of Communications. She was named by Governor Mark White to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Red Boots and Attitude: The Spirit of Texas Women Writers|last = |first = |publisher = Eakin Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781571686213|location = Austin|pages = 3|editor-last = Fanning|editor-first = Diane|editor-last2 = Flatau|editor-first2 = Susie Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given the ProBene Award of the College of Liberal Arts.

The Liz Carpenter Lectureship was established in 1984 by a group of her friends, including [[Erma Bombeck]] and Mark Russell, who gave a performance at the Paramount Theater to raise funds for it.
In the last several years, Mrs. Carpenter's lectureship in the College of Liberal Arts has brought President [[Bill Clinton]], President [[Gerald Ford]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Jehan Sadat]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Bill Moyers]], [[Jane Goodall]], and writers such as [[Betty Friedan]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Shana Alexander]], and [[Jean Auel]] and nationally known humorists such as [[Fannie Flagg]] and [[Carol Channing]].

The Liz Carpenter Award is given annually for the best scholarly book on the history of women and Texas published during the calendar year.  The Award was established in 1992 by an anonymous donor who is committed to the publication of scholarly research on the history of women and Texas. The award honors Liz Carpenter, a sixth-generation Texan, for her commitment to the pursuit of the history of women in Texas and for a lifetime of achievements that qualify her as a maker of that history.

She is the recipient of [[Alpha Phi]]'s [[Frances E. Willard]] Award in 1980. She died in Austin, Texas in March 2010.

==Quotes about Liz Carpenter==
"Liz Carpenter is much more than an American original: she is an American and a Texas original. Her inside stories of our nation's political life over the last half-century are priceless." —[[Walter Cronkite]]

"No one remains the same person after meeting Liz ...(she) makes Auntie Mame look like a shut-in." —[[Erma Bombeck]]

"Her combination of wit and wisdom is infectious, encouraging, enlightening. Texas never had a truer daughter. Her zest for life is an example to us all." —[[James Michener]]

"(Liz is) the tilt-a-whirl at the State Fair with all the lights on and the music. The only difference between Liz and a tilt-a-whirl is that, with Liz, the ride never comes to an end." —[[Ann Richards]]

"...a human dynamo, P.T. Barnum. She could sell anyone the proverbial Brooklyn Bridge or the Washington Monument." —[[Helen Thomas]]

"She manages to phrase issues the way people experience them, rather than using all those words that end in t-i-o-n and deaden your brain." —[[Gloria Steinem]]

{{About||the [[alternative medicine]] concept|Myofascial release}}

{{Infobox symptom
| Name = Trigger point
| Field = [[Rheumatology]]
| ICD10 = {{ICD10|M|62|8}}
}}
'''Myofascial trigger points''', also known as '''trigger points''', are described as [[irritability|hyperirritable]] spots in the [[fascia]] surrounding [[skeletal muscle]]. They are associated with palpable [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]] in taut bands of [[muscle fiber]]s.&lt;ref name="travell"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Travell  | first = Janet  | authorlink =Janet Travell |author2=Simons David |author3=Simons Lois  | title = Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual (2 vol. set, 2nd Ed.)  | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Williams  | year = 1999  | location = USA  | isbn = 9780683083637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon.  Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial "knots" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]ers, [[physical therapists]], [[chiropractors]], and [[osteopathic]] [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|practitioners]].  Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.

The trigger point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant from the trigger point itself.  Practitioners claim to have identified reliable [[referred pain]] patterns which associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere.  There is variation in the methodology for [[diagnosis]] of trigger points and a dearth of theory to explain how they arise and why they produce specific patterns of referred pain.&lt;ref name="variability"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Variability of criteria used to diagnose myofascial trigger point pain syndrome—evidence from a review of the literature| journal = [[Clin J Pain]]|vauthors=Tough EA, White AR, Richards S, Campbell J |date=March–April 2007| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 278–86| pmid=17314589| doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31802fda7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compression of a trigger point may elicit local tenderness, referred pain, or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same as a [[muscle spasm]]. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle contracting whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small twitch, no contraction.

Among [[physician]]s, various specialists might use trigger point therapy. These include [[physiatrist]]s (physicians specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation), family medicine, and orthopedics.  [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Osteopathic]] as well as chiropractic schools also include trigger points in their training.&lt;ref name="McPartland JM, 2004 244–49"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McPartland JM |title=Travell trigger points--molecular and osteopathic perspectives |journal=Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=104 |issue=6 |pages=244–49 |date=June 2004 |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/content/full/104/6/244 |pmid=15233331}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other health professionals, such as [[athletic trainer]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[acupuncturist]]s, [[massage therapist]]s and [[Rolfing|structural integrators]] are also aware of these ideas and many of them make use of trigger points in their clinical work as well.&lt;ref name="Alvarez DJ, Rockwell PG 2002 653–60"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarez DJ, Rockwell PG |title=Trigger points: diagnosis and management |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=653–60 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11871683 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020215/653.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentation ==
The term "trigger point" was coined in 1942 by [[Janet G. Travell|Dr. Janet Travell]] to describe a clinical finding with the following characteristics:

* Pain related to a discrete, irritable point in skeletal muscle or [[fascia]], not caused by acute local [[physical trauma|trauma]], [[inflammation]], [[degeneration (medical)|degeneration]], [[neoplasm]] or [[infection]].
* The painful point can be felt as a nodule or band in the muscle, and a twitch response can be elicited on stimulation of the trigger point.
* [[Palpation]] of the trigger point reproduces the patient's complaint of pain, and the pain radiates in a distribution typical of the specific muscle harboring the trigger point.

== Pathophysiology ==
Activation of trigger points may be caused by a number of factors, including acute or chronic muscle overload, activation by other trigger points (key/satellite, primary/secondary), disease, psychological distress (via systemic [[inflammation]]), [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] imbalances, direct trauma to the region, collision trauma (such as a car crash which stresses many muscles and causes instant trigger points) [[radiculopathy]], infections and health issues such as [[smoking]].

Trigger points form only in muscles.  They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle.  These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of [[acetylcholine]] which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed, the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah JP, Gilliams EA | title=Uncovering the biochemical milieu of myofascial trigger points using in vivo microdialysis: an application of muscle pain concepts to myofascial pain syndrome. | journal=J Bodyw Mov Ther | year=2008 | volume=12 | issue=4 | pages=371–84 | pmid=19083696 | doi=10.1016/j.jbmt.2008.06.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region.  This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive (pain) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction (Travell and Simons 1999).
When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor. Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap, and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them.
== Diagnosis ==
Practitioners do not agree on what constitutes a trigger point, but the assessment typically considers symptoms, pain patterns and manual palpation.  Usually there is a taut band in muscles containing trigger points, and a hard nodule can be felt. Often a twitch response can be felt in the muscle by running your finger perpendicular to the muscle's direction; this twitch response often activates the "all or nothing" response in a muscle that causes it to contract. Pressing on an affected muscle can often refer pain. Clusters of trigger points are not uncommon in some of the larger muscles, such as the gluteus group ([[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]], [[gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]], and [[gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]). Often there is a heat differential in the local area of a trigger point.{{Citation needed|date = October 2014}}

A 2007 review of diagnostic criteria used in studies of trigger points concluded that
: "there is as yet limited consensus on case definition in respect of MTrP pain syndrome. Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of diagnostic criteria. Until reliable diagnostic criteria have been established, there is a need for greater transparency in research papers on how a case of MTrP pain syndrome is defined, and claims for effective interventions in treating the condition should be viewed with caution."&lt;ref name="variability" /&gt;
A 2009 review of nine studies examining the reliability of trigger point diagnosis found that physical examination could not be recommended as reliable for the diagnosis of trigger points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Imaging ===
A 2008 review in ''Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation'' of two recent studies concludes they present findings that can reduce some of the controversy surrounding the cause and identification of myofascial trigger points (MTPs).&lt;ref name="PubMed.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myburgh|first=C|author2=Larsen AH |author3=Hartvigsen J. |title=A systematic, critical review of manual palpation for identifying myofascial trigger points: evidence and clinical significance|journal=[[Arch Phys Med Rehabil]]|year=2008|volume=89|issue=6|pages=1169–76|pmid=18503816|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=2008%20review%20Archives%20of%20Physical%20Medicine%20and%20Rehabilitation%20myofascial%20trigger%20point|accessdate=2012-07-23|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.12.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study by Chen on the use of [[magnetic resonance elastography]] (MRE) imaging of the taut band of an MTP in an upper [[trapezius muscle]] may present a convincing demonstration of the cause of MTP symptoms. MRE is a modification of existing [[magnetic resonance imaging]] equipment to image stress produced by adjacent tissues with different degrees of tension. This report presents an MRE image of the taut band that shows the V-shaped signature of the increased tension compared with surrounding tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid18164347"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simons DG |title=New views of myofascial trigger points: etiology and diagnosis |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=157–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18164347 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results were all consistent with the concept that taut bands are detectable and quantifiable with MRE imaging. The findings in the subjects suggest that the stiffness of the taut bands in patients with myofascial pain may be 50% greater than that of the surrounding muscle tissue. The findings suggest that MRE can quantitate asymmetries in muscle tone that could previously only be identified subjectively by examination.&lt;ref name="pmid18047882"&gt;{{cite journal

In the study by Shah and associates, they have shown the feasibility of continuous, [[in vivo]] recovery of small molecules from soft tissue without harmful effects. With this technique, they have been able to investigate the biochemistry of muscle in subjects with myofascial trigger points and to contrast this with that of the noninvolved muscle.&lt;ref name="pmid18164325"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Shah JP, Danoff JV, Desai MJ, etal |title=Biochemicals associated with pain and inflammation are elevated in sites near to and remote from active myofascial trigger points |journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |year=2008 |pmid=18164325 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myofascial pain syndrome ===
The main innovation of Travell's work was the introduction of the [[myofascial pain syndrome]] concept (''myofascial'' referring to the [[fascia]]  that surrounds and permeates [[muscle]]). This is described as a focal hyperirritability in muscle that can strongly modulate [[central nervous system]] functions.  Travell and followers distinguish this from [[fibromyalgia]], which is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness and is described as a central augmentation of [[nociception]] giving rise to deep tissue tenderness that includes muscles.
Studies estimate that in 75–95 percent of cases, myofascial pain is a primary cause of regional pain. Myofascial pain is associated with muscle tenderness that arises from trigger points, focal points of tenderness, a few millimeters in diameter, found at multiple sites in a muscle and the fascia of muscle tissue. Biopsy tests found that trigger points were hyperirritable and electrically active [[muscle spindle]]s in general muscle tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pelviperineology.org/practical/chronic_pelvic_pain.html|title=Understanding chronic pelvic pain|author=Jantos M|journal=Pelviperineology|volume=26|issue=2|date=June 2007|issn=1973-4913|oclc=263367710|pmid=&lt;!-- Journal not indexed in NLM --&gt;|doi=}} Full open-access article&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misdiagnosis of pain ===
The misdiagnosis of pain is the most important issue taken up by Travell and Simons. Referred pain from trigger points mimics the symptoms of a very long list of common maladies, but physicians, in weighing all the possible causes for a given condition, rarely consider a myofascial source. The study of trigger points has not historically been part of medical education. Travell and Simons hold that most of the common everyday pain is caused by myofascial trigger points and that ignorance of that basic concept could inevitably lead to false diagnoses and the ultimate failure to deal effectively with pain.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book

==Treatment==

===Physical muscle treatment===
Therapists may use [[myotherapy]] (deep pressure as in [[Bonnie Prudden]]'s approach, [[massage]] or [[tapotement]] as in Dr. Griner's approach), mechanical [[vibration]], pulsed [[ultrasound]], [[electrostimulation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.amjphysmedrehab.com/pt/re/ajpmr/abstract.00002060-199711000-00007.htm |title=The immediate effectiveness of electrical nerve stimulation and electrical muscle stimulation on myofascial trigger points |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=471–6 |date=November–December 1997 |pmid=9431265 |vauthors=Hsueh TC, Cheng PT, Kuan TS, Hong CZ |doi=10.1097/00002060-199711000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ischemic compression]], trigger-point-injection (see below), [[Dry needling|dry-needling]], "spray-and-stretch" using a [[freeze spray|cooling spray]] (vapocoolant), [[low-level laser therapy]] and [[stretching]] techniques that invoke reciprocal inhibition within the musculoskeletal system. Practitioners may use elbows, feet or various tools to direct pressure directly upon the trigger point, to avoid overuse of their hands.

A successful treatment protocol relies on identifying trigger points, resolving them and, if all trigger points have been deactivated, elongating the structures affected along their natural range of motion and length. In the case of muscles, which is where most treatment occurs, this involves stretching the muscle using combinations of passive, active, [[Active Isolated Stretching|active isolated]] (AIS), [[muscle energy technique]]s (MET), and [[PNF stretching|proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation]] (PNF) stretching to be effective. [[Fascia]] surrounding muscles should also be treated to elongate and resolve strain patterns, otherwise muscles will simply be returned to positions where trigger points are likely to re-develop.

The results of manual therapy are related to the skill level of the therapist. If trigger points are pressed too short a time, they may activate or remain active; if pressed too long or hard, they may be irritated or the muscle may be bruised, resulting in pain in the area treated. This bruising may last for a 1–3 days after treatment, and may feel like, but is not similar to, [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS){{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, the pain felt days after overexerting muscles. Pain is also common after a massage if the practitioner uses pressure on unnoticed latent or active trigger points, or is not skilled in myofascial trigger point therapy.

Researchers of [[evidence-based medicine]] concluded as of 2001 that evidence for the usefulness of trigger points in the diagnosis of [[fibromyalgia]] is thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/band90/b90-2.html |title=Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and treatment |journal=Bandolier |issue=90 |date=August 2001 |issn=1353-9906}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, an association has been made between fibromyalgia [[tender points]] and active trigger points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ge HY, Nie H, Madeleine P, Danneskiold-Samsøe B, Graven-Nielsen T, Arendt-Nielsen L | title=Contribution of the local and referred pain from active myofascial trigger points in fibromyalgia syndrome| journal=Pain| date=2009-12-15| volume=147| issue=1–3| pages=233–40| pmid=19819074| doi=10.1016/j.pain.2009.09.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brezinschek HP| title=Mechanismen des Muskelschmerzes |trans-title=Mechanisms of muscle pain : significance of trigger points and tender points| language=German| journal=Zeitschrift für Rheumatologie |date=December 2008| volume=67| issue=8| pages=653–4, 656–7| pmid=19015861| doi=10.1007/s00393-008-0353-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trigger-point-injection===
Injections without anesthetics, or [[dry needling]], and injections including saline, [[local anesthetic]]s such as [[procaine hydrochloride]] (Novocain) or [[articaine]] without vasoconstrictors like epinephrine,&lt;ref&gt;Raab D: Craniomandibular disorders simulating odontalgia and Eustachian tube -disorders – a case report. [Durch craniomandibuläre Dysfunktionen vorgetäuschte Zahnschmerzen und Tubenfunktionsstörungen – ein Fallbericht.] Wehrmedizinische Monatsschrift 2015: 59(12); 396-401. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wehrmed.de/article/2738-durch-craniomandibulaere-dysfunktionen-vorgetaeuschte-zahnschmerzen-tubenfunktionsstoerungen-ein-fallbericht.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[steroids]], and [[botulinum toxin]] provide more immediate relief and can be effective when other methods fail. In regards to injections with anesthetics, a low concentration, short acting local anesthetic such as procaine 0.5% without steroids or [[Epinephrine (medication)|epinephrine]] is recommended. High concentrations or long acting local anesthetics as well as epinephrine can cause muscle [[necrosis]], while use of steroids can cause tissue damage.

Despite the concerns about long acting agents,&lt;ref name="travell"/&gt; a mixture of lidocaine and marcaine is often used.&lt;ref name="lowback"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of 1 part 2% [[lidocaine]] with 3 parts 0.5% [[bupivacaine]] (trade name:Marcaine) provides 0.5% lidocaine and 0.375% bupivacaine. This has the advantages of immediate anesthesia with lidocaine during injection to minimize injection pain while providing a longer duration of action with a lowered concentration of bupivacaine.

In 1979, a study by Czech physician Karl Lewit reported that dry needling had the same success rate as anesthetic injections for the treatment of trigger points. He dubbed this the 'needle effect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pain |author=Lewit K |title=The needle effect in the relief of myofascial pain |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=83–90 |pmid=424236 |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90142-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, studies relevant to trigger points were done by J. H. Kellgren at [[University College Hospital]], London, in the 1930s and, independently, by Michael Gutstein in Berlin and Michael Kelly in Australia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |year=2003 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=8–12 |pmc=152828 |pmid=12638664 |title=Janet G. Travell, MD: A Daughter's Recollection |author=Wilson VP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health insurance companies in the US such as [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]], Medica, and [[HealthPartners]] began covering trigger point injections in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus247.com/who-administers-trigger-point-injections/|title=Who Administers Trigger Point Injections?|date=2017-11-07|work=Med Line Plus|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks===
Treatment, whether by self or by a professional, has some inherent dangers.  It may lead to damage of soft tissue and other organs. The trigger points in the upper [[quadratus lumborum]], for instance, are very close to the [[kidney]]s and poorly administered treatment (particularly injections) may lead to kidney damage. Likewise, treating the [[masseter muscle]] may damage the [[salivary glands]] [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]] to this muscle. Furthermore, some experts believe trigger points may develop as a protective measure against unstable [[joint]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Efficacy===
Studies to date on the efficacy of dry needling for MTrPs and pain have been too small to be conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=European Journal of Pain |vauthors=Tough EA, White AR, Cummings TM, Richards SH, Campbell JL |title=Acupuncture and dry needling in the management of myofascial trigger point pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials |date=January 2009 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.02.006 |pmid=18395479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ni{{okina}}ihau incident''' occurred on December 7–13, 1941, when [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] pilot Shigenori Nishikaichi (西開地 重徳 ''Nishikaichi Shigenori'') crash-landed his [[A6M Zero|Zero]] on the [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii]]an island of [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]] after participating in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He was killed in a struggle with people on the island.

The island's [[Native Hawaiian]] residents were initially unaware of the attack, but apprehended Nishikaichi when the gravity of the situation became apparent. Nishikaichi then sought and received the assistance of the three Hawaiian locals of Japanese descent on the island in overcoming his captors, finding weapons, and taking several hostages. Eventually, Nishikaichi was killed by Niihauans Benehakaka "Ben" Kanahele and Kealoha "Ella" Kanahele;&lt;ref name=Reporter&gt;[http://www.hawaiireporter.com/niihau-incident-benehakaka-ben-kanahele-wwii-medal-for-merit-purple-heart-1891-1962/123 NI'IHAU INCIDENT – Benehakaka "Ben" Kanahele – WWII, Medal for Merit, Purple Heart (1891–1962)], by Duane Vachon, The Hawaii Reporter; published June 30, 2013; retrieved July 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Kanahele was wounded in the process, and one of Nishikaichi's supporters, Yoshio Harada, committed suicide.

Ben Kanahele was decorated for his part in stopping the takeover, but Ella Kanahele received no official recognition.&lt;ref name=Reporter/&gt;

== Background ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2016}}
[[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], the westernmost and second smallest of the primary [[Hawaiian Islands]], has been privately owned by the Robinsons, a white ''[[Kama'aina|kama{{okina}}aina]]'' family, since 1864. At the time of the incident, it had 136 inhabitants, almost all of whom were [[Native Hawaiian]]s whose first language was [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. In 1941 the owner was [[Aylmer Robinson]], a [[Harvard University]] graduate who was fluent in Hawaiian. Robinson ran the island without interference from any government authority, and although he lived on the nearby island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], he made weekly visits by boat to Ni{{okina}}ihau. The island was only accessible with permission from Robinson, which was almost never given except to friends or relatives of Niihauans. The handful of non-native residents included three of Japanese ancestry: ''[[issei]]'' Ishimatsu Shintani and Hawaiian-born ''[[nisei]]'' Yoshio and Irene Harada, all of whom were involved in the incident.

Prior to the Pearl Harbor attack, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had designated Ni{{okina}}ihau, mistakenly believed to be uninhabited, as a location for aircraft damaged in the attack to land. Pilots were told they could wait on the island until they were rescued by submarine.

doi = | isbn =0-8050-6803-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaleohano was unaware of the attack at [[Pearl Harbor]], but knew from newspapers that the relationship between the U.S. and Japan was poor due to Japanese expansionism and the U.S. oil embargo on Japan. Recognizing Nishikaichi and his plane as Japanese, Kaleohano thought it prudent to relieve the pilot of his pistol and papers before the dazed airman could react. He and the other Hawaiians who gathered about treated the pilot with courtesy and the traditional Hawaiian hospitality, even throwing a party for him later that Sunday afternoon. However, the Hawaiians could not understand Nishikaichi, who spoke only Japanese with a limited amount of English. They sent for Japanese-born Ishimatsu Shintani (an ''[[issei]]''), who was married to a native Hawaiian, to translate.

Having been briefed on the situation beforehand and approaching the task with evident distaste, Shintani exchanged just a few words with the pilot and departed without explanation. The puzzled Hawaiians then sent for Yoshio Harada, who was born in Hawai{{okina}}i of Japanese ancestry, and his wife Irene (Irene was ''[[issei]]''), both of whom constituted the remainder of the Ni{{okina}}ihau population of Japanese ancestry. Nishikaichi informed Harada of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a revelation Harada thought prudent not to share with the non-Japanese natives. Nishikaichi desperately wanted his papers returned, which he had been told should by no means fall into American hands, but Kaleohano refused to return them. The Haradas decided to assist Nishikaichi in retrieving his papers and escaping.

=== News of the Pearl Harbor attack ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero.jpg|thumb|[[A6M Zero]] in the markings of the aircraft flown by Nishikaichi on display at the [[Pacific Aviation Museum]]&lt;ref name="Pacific Aviation Museum -Mistubishi A6M2 Zero - R.Costick"&gt;{{citation|title = Pacific Aviation Museum – Mistubishi A6M2 Zero&amp;nbsp;– R.Costick|url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/pacificaviationmuseum/3272857740/|publisher = Pacific Aviation Museum|date = 5 Mar 2007|accessdate = 7 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ni{{okina}}ihau had neither electricity nor telephones, but later that night, the Hawaiians heard a radio report about the Pearl Harbor attack on a battery-operated radio. The Hawaiians confronted the pilot, and this time Harada translated what was said about the attack. The owner of the island, Aylmer Robinson, was scheduled to arrive on his regular weekly trip from Kaua{{okina}}i, a much larger island just {{convert|17|mi}} away, the next morning. It was decided that the pilot would return to Kaua{{okina}}i with Robinson.

Robinson did not arrive on Monday because the U.S. military had instituted a ban on boat traffic in the islands within hours of the attack. Nor did he arrive in the following days. The Niʻihauans, knowing nothing of the ban, were puzzled and very uneasy that the normally dependable Robinson had not been seen since the attack. The Haradas’ request to have the pilot stay with them was agreed to, but with a contingent of four guards. There was now ample opportunity for the Haradas to converse with Nishikaichi.

At four o’clock on December 12, Shintani approached Kaleohano in private with about $200 in cash, which was a huge sum for the Niʻihauans. He tried to buy the pilot's papers, but Kaleohano again refused. Shintani unhappily departed, saying there would be trouble if the papers were not returned, that it was a matter of life and death. Harada and Nishikaichi, not waiting for Shintani's return, attacked the lone guard who had been posted outside the Harada residence, while Irene Harada, Yoshio's wife, played music on a phonograph to cover up the sounds of the struggle. Three other guards were stationed to watch the Harada residence, but were not present at the time of the attack. The guard was locked in a warehouse, where Harada acquired a shotgun and the pilot's pistol that had previously been stored there. Thus armed, they proceeded to Kaleohano's house.
Having parted from Shintani only five or ten minutes before, Kaleohano was in his [[outhouse]] when he saw Harada and Nishikaichi coming, together with a 16-year-old captive that they prodded along with a gun. Kaleohano stayed hidden in the outhouse, and the conspirators, unable to find him, turned their attention to the nearby plane. Seeing his opportunity, Kaleohano burst out of the outhouse. He heard "Stop! Stop!" and the boom of a shotgun as he ran for his life. Kaleohano alerted the residents of the nearby village, warning them to evacuate. Many could not believe that their good friend and neighbor, Harada, whom they knew so well and who had been living among them for almost three years, could do the things that Kaleohano related. When the captive guard escaped and reached the village, the residents fled&amp;nbsp;– the women and children to caves, thickets and distant beaches.

=== Kaleohano's midnight run ===
[[File:Nishikaichi's Zero BII-120.jpg|thumb|Remains of Nishikaichi's Zero on December 17, 1941]]
Robinson had come to know that there was trouble on Ni{{okina}}ihau because the Niihauans had flashed signals toward Kaua{{okina}}i with kerosene lanterns and reflectors. Meanwhile, Nishikaichi unsuccessfully attempted to make contact with the Japanese military using the downed aircraft's radio. With the help of Harada and one of their Hawaiian captives, they removed at least one of the two 7.7&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns on board the Japanese fighter plane with some ammunition, torched the plane, and proceeded to Kaleohano's house, which they set ablaze at about 3 a.m. in a final effort to destroy Nishikaichi's papers, which included maps, radio codes, and Pearl Harbor attack plans.&lt;ref name="j-aircraft.com"&gt;http://www.j-aircraft.com/research/jimlansdale/ph_crashsite/ph_crash_5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
During the night, another Ni’ihau resident, Kaahakila Kalimahuluhulu, known as Kalima, had also been taken captive. He was released to help search for Kaleohano, who had escaped with Nishikaichi's papers. Instead, Kalima enlisted his friend Benehakaka "Ben" Kanahele to sneak back in the darkness to steal the machine guns and ammunition. That morning, Saturday, December 13, Harada and Nishikaichi captured Kanahele&lt;ref&gt;The surname "kanahele" is composed of "ka," the definite article, and "nahele," meaning "forest." ([https://archive.is/20120719054958/http://wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?q=nahele Dictionary translation].) Kanahele is a common surname for many families who trace their ancestry to Ni{{okina}}ihau.&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, Kealoha "Ella" Kanahele (1907–1974), also natives of the island.&lt;ref name="lord" /&gt; They ordered Kanahele to find Kaleohano, keeping Ella as a hostage. Kanahele knew that Kaleohano was rowing toward Kaua{{okina}}i but made a pretense of looking for him. He soon became concerned about Ella and returned to her. Nishikaichi realized he was being deceived. Harada told Kanahele that the pilot would kill him and everyone in the village if Kaleohano was not found.&lt;ref name="j-aircraft.com"/&gt;

Kanahele and his wife, taking advantage of the fatigue and discouragement of his two captors, leapt at them as the pilot handed the shotgun to Harada. When Nishikaichi pulled his pistol out of his boot, Ella Kanahele grabbed his arm and brought it down. Harada pulled her off the pilot, who then shot Ben Kanahele three times: in the groin, stomach, and upper leg. However, Kanahele was still able to pick up Nishikaichi, in the same manner that he hoisted the sheep that were commercially raised on the island, and hurl the pilot into a stone wall. Ella Kanahele then bashed him in the head with a rock, and Ben slit his throat with his hunting knife. Harada then turned the shotgun on himself, committing [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malkin |first=Michele |authorlink=Michele Malkin |title=In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvsIQNwYvSwC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=W2UQp_6LFN&amp;dq=Ben%20Kanahele&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=Ben%20Kanahele&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 December 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=Regnery Publishing |isbn=9780895260512 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident, Ella Kanahele went for help, dropping the shotgun and the pistol on the way. (About five years later, a flood washed the shotgun into a wall where it was found by islanders. The pistol and one of the machine guns were never found.) Ben Kanahele was taken to Waimea Hospital on Kaua{{okina}}i to recuperate;{{sfn|Beekman|1998|p=89}} he was awarded the [[Medal for Merit]] and the [[Purple Heart]], but his wife did not receive any official recognition.&lt;ref name="TPM1990" /&gt;

The next afternoon, December 14, the military authorities, the six Hawaiians who had rowed to Kaua{{okina}}i, and Robinson arrived together.

=== Post-incident ===
The grieving Irene Harada and Ishimatsu Shintani were taken into custody. Shintani was sent to an internment camp and later rejoined his family on Ni{{okina}}ihau, where he attained [[U.S. citizenship]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="TPM1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Slackman |first=Michael |title=Target Pearl Harbor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BEHS5DAB2cC&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;ots=gVdDTozhHs&amp;dq=Ben%20Kanahele&amp;pg=PA231#v=onepage&amp;q=Ben%20Kanahele&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=1990 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=9780824813789 |page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irene Harada was imprisoned for 31 months, being released in June 1944. She was never charged with treason, nor any other crime resulting from the incident. She maintained her innocence, but added in a 1992 interview with Japanese television that she felt sorry for the pilot and wanted to help him.&lt;ref&gt;TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) interview of Irene Harada on Broadcaster, approximately 1992&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the island of Kauai. [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], a naval commander during the attack on Pearl Harbor and later a Christian evangelist who settled in the U.S., visited her after his short trip to Ni'ihau Island.&lt;ref&gt;Shinsato, Douglas T. and Tadanori Urabe, "For That One Day:  The Memoirs of Mitsuo Fuchida, Commander of the Attack on Pearl Harbor," eXperience, inc., Kamuela, Hawaii, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-0-9846745-0-3}}, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Composer [[Robert Alexander Anderson (composer)|R. Alex Anderson]] was inspired by the incident to compose "They Couldn't Take Niihau, Nohow!" It was played on August 15, 1945, when Kanahele was decorated for the part he played in defending his country by Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson at Army Headquarters, Fort Shafter, Honolulu.{{sfn|Beekman|1998|p=105}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huapala.org/T/They_Couldnt_Take_Niihau.html | title=They Couldn't Take Niihau No-how | publisher=HUAPALA Hawaiian Music and Hula Archives | accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repercussions ==
Historian [[Gordon Prange]] notes that it was "the rapidity with which the three resident Japanese went over to the pilot's cause" which troubled the Hawaiians. "The more pessimistic among them cited the Ni{{okina}}ihau incident as proof that no one could trust any Japanese, even if an American citizen, not to go over to Japan if it appeared expedient."{{sfn|Prange|1962|pp=375–77}}

Novelist William Hallstead argues that the Ni{{okina}}ihau incident had an influence on decisions leading to the [[Japanese American internment]]. According to Hallstead, the behavior of Shintani and the Haradas were included in an official Navy report dated January 26, 1942. Its author, Navy Lieutenant C. B. Baldwin, wrote, "The fact that the two Ni{{okina}}ihau Japanese who had previously shown no anti-American tendencies went to the aid of the pilot when Japanese domination of the island seemed possible, indicate[s] [the] likelihood that Japanese residents previously believed loyal to the United States may aid Japan if further Japanese attacks appear successful."{{sfn|Beekman|1998|p=112}}

===Memorial===
[[File:Rusted wreckage of a Zero fighter, part of the Niihau Incident.jpg|thumb|Rusted parts of the Niihau Zero as displayed at the [[Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor]]]]
The coastal town of [[Hashihama]], [[Imabari, Ehime|Imabari]], [[Ehime, Japan]], erected a 12-foot granite cenotaph in their native son's honor when it was still believed that he had perished the day of the attack, December 7, 1941. For many years Nishikaichi's remains were that of an unknown Japanese soldier, and it was not until 1956 that the circumstances of his death were revealed to his family and his ashes claimed by them. Engraved on the column is what was believed at the time: "Having expended every effort, he achieved the greatest honor of all by dying a soldier's death in battle, destroying both himself and his beloved plane... His meritorious deed will live forever."{{sfn|Beekman|1998|p=96}} In June, 2017 the pilot's nafuda, a set of seven wooden sticks that carried the names of Airman 1st Class Nishikaichi’s colleagues, the identifying markings of his Zero, and his administrative command, were returned to his family in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/military/veterans/sd-me-japanese-relics-20170703-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum exhibit and controversy===
Both the remains of Nishikaichi's Zero and those of the old tractor he used to travel to the boat landing are on permanent display at the [[Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor]] on [[Ford Island]] in [[Pearl Harbor]]. A Japanese-American group in Hawaii criticized the original design of the museum display. Threatening to have federal funds withheld, they demanded that the museum remove mention of the Haradas from the display. The Robinson family was very unhappy with the censorship of the information about the Haradas, especially since they had donated the aircraft and tractor pieces based on what they were told about how the display would read. The exhibit does state that Yoshio Harada committed suicide after the incident but does not mention his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Syd, ''Niihau Zero:  The Unlikely Drama of Hawaii's Forbidden Island Prior to, During, and After the Pearl Harbor Attack'', JBJ Delta Charlie LC/Signum Ops, Merritt Island, Florida, 2014{{pn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PALME Middle East [[DJ]] Competition, founded in 2003, is an annual open competition which takes the form of several live heats in the weeks preceding the PALME Middle East exhibition, with the live finals taking place during the show itself.  The competition is judged by a panel of local DJs and industry experts. DJ Pete Martin was responsible for the competition from its launch in 2003 to 2008 respectively. 2013 will see the competition in its 10th year.

Alongside the exhibition, PALME Middle East runs a series of technically focussed educational seminars and workshops. In previous years, the PALME educational programme has taken the form of a paid for conference, but from 2012 the seminars are free to attend. In 2011, the conference was split into three streams: [[lighting]], projection technology and [[home automation]]

The '''Red Dog Saloon''' is a bar and live music venue located in the isolated, old-time mining town of [[Virginia City, Nevada]] which played an important role in the history of the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] music scene. 

Folk music enthusiast Mark Unobsky bought the old [[Henry Comstock]] house in Virginia City, and decided to open a folk club together with Chandler A. Laughlin III (1937-2012), a one-time folk club owner, and Don Works in the early 1960s.

In April 1963, Chandler established a kind of family identity among approximately fifty people who attended the traditional, all-night [[Native American Church|Native American peyote]] ceremony. This ceremony combined a psychedelic experience with traditional Native American spiritual values{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}; these people went on to sponsor a new genre of musical expression at the venue.&lt;ref name="Works" /&gt;

During the summer of 1965, Laughlin (better known in media as ''Travus T. Hipp'', a disc jockey and news commentator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://santacruz.patch.com/groups/arts-and-entertainment/p/kpig-s-alternative-newsman-travus-t-hipp-died-friday-morning The Santa Cruz Patch] "controversial newsman Travis T.

For decades, he has contributed free-wheeling sometimes caustic opinions on the maddening state of the human animal to radio stations all over California and Nevada, but KPIG remained...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevadalabor.com/barbwire/barb12/travusadios.html%20 NevadaLabor.com] "His longtime associates credit him with originating the word "hippy" —&gt; "According to Duke Stroud, a member of the original improv group [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]], the term 'hippy' evolved from fans of Travus T.

"Most of what you heard about the Red Dog was not only true, it was understated," he told the Appeal.

There was no clear delineation between "performers" and "audience" in "The Red Dog Experience," during which music, psychedelic experimentation and [[Bill Ham]]'s first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community. Laughlin and George Hunter of the Charlatans were termed [[hippy|"proto-hippies"]], with their long hair, boots and clothing of a distinctly Native American heritage.&lt;ref name="Works"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkexist.com/quotes/chandler_laughlin/, retrieved 6 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The poster for the first six-week stint of performances from The Charlatans beginning in June 1965 is a rare psychedelic poster. It is known as "The Seed".{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] manufacturer [[Owsley Stanley]] lived in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] during 1965 and provided much of the LSD that became a part of the "Red Dog Experience".

The '''Six-Day War''' (language-french|Guerre des Six Jours) was a series of armed confrontations between Ugandan and Rwandan Army Rwandan forces around the city of Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 5th to the 10th of June 2000. The war formed part of the wider Second Congo War (1998–2003).

Kisangani was also a scene of violence between Rwandan and Ugandan troops in August 1999 and 5 May 2000. However, the conflicts of June 2000 were the most lethal and seriously damaged a large part of the city, with more than 6,600 rounds fired.

According to ''Justice et Libération'', a human rights organisation based in Kisangani, the violence resulted in around 1,000 deaths and wounded many civilians.

'''Solifugae''' is an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[animals]] in the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Arachnid]]a known variously as '''camel spiders''', '''wind scorpions''', '''sun spiders''', or '''solifuges'''. The order includes more than 1,000 described [[species]] in about 153 [[genus|genera]]. Despite the common names, they are neither true [[scorpion]]s (order Scorpiones) nor true [[spider]]s (order [[Araneae]]). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: an [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen) behind the [[prosoma]] (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two [[chelicerae]] that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for [[stridulation]]. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a "tail". Most species of Solifugae live in [[dry climate]]s and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling [[arthropod]]s and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, including legs. A number of urban legends exaggerate the size and speed of the Solifugae, and their potential danger to humans, which is negligible.

==Anatomy==
[[File:Solifugae Ventral aspect of respiratory slots 2012 01 24 0985s.JPG|thumb|Ventral aspect of a solifugid, showing respiratory slots]]
Solifugae are moderately small to large arachnids (a few millimeters to several centimeters in body length), with the larger species reaching {{convert|12|-|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, including legs.&lt;ref name="geographic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/egyptian-giant-solpugid/ |title=Egyptian giant solpugid (camel spider) ''Galeodes arabs'' |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt; In practice, the respective lengths of the legs of various species differ drastically, so the resulting figures are often misleading. More practical measurements refer primarily to the body length, quoting leg lengths separately, if at all. The body length is up to {{convert|7|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=" Pech"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pechenik | first = Jan | title = Biology of the Invertebrates | publisher = Wm. C. Brown Publishers | location = Dubuque | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-697-13712-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mullen | first = Gary R. | title = Medical and Veterinary Entomology | publisher = Academic Press | location = Burlington, Massachusetts | edition = 2 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-12-372500-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species are closer to {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|0}} long, and some small species are under {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|1}} in head-plus-body length when mature.&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;

Like that of the spider order, the Araneae, the body plan of the Solifugae has two main [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: the [[prosoma]], or [[cephalothorax]], is the [[Anatomical terms of location|anterior]] tagma, and the 10-segmented [[abdomen]], or [[opisthosoma]], is the [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] tagma. As shown in the illustrations, the solifugid prosoma and opisthosoma are not separated by nearly as clear a constriction and connecting tube or "[[Pedicel (spider)|pedicel]]" as occurs in "true spiders", the order Araneae. The lack of the pedicel reflects another difference between the Solifugae and spiders, namely that solifugids lack both spinnerets and [[Spider silk|silk]], and do not spin [[Spiderweb|webs]]. Spiders need considerable mobility of their abdomens in their spinning activities, and the Solifugae have no need for any such adaptation.

The prosoma comprises the head, the mouthparts, and the [[somite]]s that bear the legs and the [[pedipalps]]. The alternative name "cephalothorax" reflects the fact that the prosoma includes the parts that in insects form the head plus the thorax. Though it is not split into two clear tagmata, the prosoma does have a large, relatively well-defined anterior carapace, bearing the animal's eyes and chelicerae, while a smaller posterior section bears the legs.&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{Cite book|author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 613–614|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[pseudoscorpion]]s and [[harvestmen]], the Solifugae lack [[book lung]]s, having instead a well-developed [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]] that inhales and exhales air through three pairs of slits on the animal's underside.

===Chelicerae===
[[File:Solifugae Chelicera lateral aspect 2012 01 24 0999s.JPG|thumb|Lateral aspect of chelicera, showing teeth and cutting edge]]
Among the most distinctive features of the Solifugae are their large [[chelicerae]], which in many species are longer than the prosoma. Each of the two chelicerae has two [[wikt:article|articles]] (segments, parts connected by a joint),&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a powerful pincer, much like that of a crab; each article bears a variable number of teeth, largely depending on the species.&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; The chelicerae of many species are surprisingly strong; they are capable of shearing hair or feathers from vertebrate prey or carrion, and of cutting through skin and thin bones such as those of small birds.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holm|first1=Erik|last2=Dippenaar-Schoeman|first2=Ansie|title=Goggo Guide: The arthropods of southern Africa|date=2010|publisher=LAPA Publishers|location=Pretoria|isbn=0799346896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Solifugae [[stridulation|stridulate]] with their chelicerae, producing a rattling noise.&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt;

===Legs and pedipalps===
[[File:Solfugid in veld near Uniondale (Western Cape) 1600.jpg|thumb|Male solifugid in South African veld: Its flagella are visible near the tips of the chelicerae, looking like large, backward-curling bristles. As in most species, it holds its pedipalps clear of the ground; its front legs serve as tactile sensors, barely touching the ground with their setae.]]
Like most other arachnids, although Solifugae appear to have five pairs of legs, only the hind four pairs actually are "true" legs. Each true leg has seven segments: [[Arthropod leg|coxa]], [[Arthropod leg|trochanter]], [[Arthropod leg|femur]], [[Arthropod leg|patella]], [[Arthropod leg|tibia]], [[Arthropod leg|metatarsus]], and [[Arthropod leg|tarsus]].&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filmer"&gt;{{cite book | last = Filmer | first = Martin | title = Southern African Spiders | publisher = BHB International / Struik | location = City | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-86825-188-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first, or anterior, of the five pairs of leg-like appendages are not "actual" legs, but [[pedipalp]]s, and they have only five segments each. The pedipalps of the Solifugae function partly as sense organs similar to insects' [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], and partly in locomotion, feeding, and fighting. In normal locomotion, they do not quite touch the ground, but are held out to detect obstacles and prey; in that attitude, they look particularly like an extra pair of legs or perhaps arms. Reflecting the great dependence of the Solifugae on their tactile senses, their [[anterior]] true legs commonly are smaller and thinner than the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] three pairs. That smaller anterior pair acts largely in a sensory role as a supplement to the pedipalps, and in many species they accordingly lack tarsi. At the tips of their pedipalps, Solifugae bear [[:wikt:evert|eversible]] adhesive organs, which they may use to capture flying prey, and which at least some species certainly use for climbing smooth surfaces.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNH"&gt;Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 4, Crustacea, Trilobites, Arachnida, Tardigrada, Pentastomida etc. Macmillan Company 1895&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Solifugae Solpugidae showing malleoli 2012 01 24 0964s.JPG|thumb|A female of a species in the family Solpugidae showing the malleoli beneath the posterior pair of legs]]

For the most part, only the posterior three pairs of legs are used for running.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt; On the undersides of the coxae and trochanters of the last pair of legs, Solifugae have fan-shaped sensory organs called [[malleolus (arthropod)|malleoli]] or racquet (or racket) organs. Sometimes, the blades of the malleoli are directed forward, sometimes not. They have been suspected to be sensory organs for the detection of vibrations in the soil, perhaps to detect threats and potential prey or mates.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt; These structures may be chemoreceptors.&lt;ref name=Punzo1998&gt;{{cite book|last1=Punzo|first1=Fred|title=The Biology of Camel-Spiders: Arachnida, Solifugae|date=1998|publisher=Springer US|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781461557272|page=66|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=PbTSBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP7&amp;ots=I2zVuma5R6&amp;dq=solifugae%20malleolar&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=malleoli%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are usually smaller than females, with relatively longer legs.&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt; Unlike females, the males bear a pair of [[flagella]], one on each chelicera. In the accompanying photograph of a male solifugid, one flagellum is just visible near the tip of each chelicera. The flagella, which bend back over the chelicerae, are sometimes called horns and are believed to have some sexual connection, but their function has not yet been clearly explained.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-7993-4689-3"/&gt;

===Eyes===
[[File:Solpugidae showing eyes with presumably protective bristles 2012 01 24 1019s.JPG|thumb|Solifugid eyes with presumably protective bristles]]
Some species have very large central eyes. They look like [[Simple eye in invertebrates|simple eyes]] or [[Simple eye in invertebrates|ocelli]], and are surprisingly sophisticated. They can recognise forms, and are used in hunting and avoiding enemies. These eyes are remarkable in their internal anatomy; {{clarify span|they may represent the last step in the integration of the aggregate of simple ocelli into a [[compound eye]], and of further integration of a compound eye into a simple eye|date=July 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beklemishev | first = Vladimir | title = Principles of Comparative Anatomy of Invertebrates | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1969 | isbn = 0226041751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, lateral eyes are absent in many species, and where they are present at all, they are only rudimentary.

==Classification==
The Solifugae are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of their own, though are sometimes confused with spiders, which form a completely distinct order, the [[Araneae]]. The order comprises over 1000 [[Species description|described]] species in 153 genera assigned to the following 12 families:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of biodiversity, Volume 1 |last=Levin |first=Simon A. |year=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=2001 |isbn=978-0-12-226866-3 |page=943 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9IIVBBmbrsC&amp;dq=Solifuge&amp;q=species+of+solifuge#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}}

==Ecology==
[[File:Gluvia4.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Gluvia dorsalis]]'' eating a cabbage bug (''[[Eurydema oleracea]]'')]]
Although the Solifugae are considered to be endemic indicators of [[desert]] [[biomes]],&lt;ref name="Punzo"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biology of Camel-Spiders |author=Fred Punzo |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=0-7923-8155-6 |year=1998 |accessdate=January 25, 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cUnt7bAEcMAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} they occur widely in semidesert and [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub|scrub]]. Some species also live in grassland or forest habitats. Solifugae generally inhabit warm and arid habitats, including virtually all warm deserts and scrublands in all continents except [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=schmidt93&gt;{{Cite book|author=G. Schmidt |year=1993 |title=Giftige und gefährliche Spinnentiere |language=German |publisher=Westarp Wissenschaften |isbn=3-89432-405-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solifugae are [[carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[omnivore|omnivorous]], with most species feeding on [[termite]]s, [[darkling beetle]]s, and other small, ground-dwelling [[arthropod]]s. Solifuges are aggressive hunters and voracious opportunistic feeders and have been recorded as feeding on [[snakes]], small [[lizards]], and [[rodents]].&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt; Prey is located with the pedipalps and killed and cut into pieces by the chelicerae. The prey is then liquefied and the liquid ingested through the [[pharynx]]. Although they do not normally attack humans, their chelicerae can penetrate human skin, and painful bites have been reported.&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt;

Various other predators, such as the [[large slit-faced bat]], scorpions, toads, and [[insectivore]]s, may prey on Solifugae.

==Life cycle==
Solifugae are typically [[univoltine]].&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Reproduction can involve direct or indirect [[sperm]] transfer; when indirect, the male emits a [[spermatophore]] on the ground and then inserts it with his chelicerae in the female's genital pore. To do this, he flings the female on her back.

The female then digs a burrow, into which she lays 50 to 200 eggs – some species then guard them until they hatch. Because the female does not feed during this time, she will try to fatten herself beforehand, and a species of {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} has been observed to eat more than 100 flies during that time in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt; Solifugae undergo a number of stages including, egg, postembryo, 9–10 nymphal instars, and adults.&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Solifugae derives from [[Latin]], and means "those that flee from the sun". The order is also known by the names Solpugida, Solpugides, Solpugae, Galeodea, and Mycetophorae. Their [[common name]]s include camel spider, wind scorpion, scorpion carrier, jerrymunglum,&lt;ref&gt;Skaife, Sydney Harold; South African Nature Notes, Second edition. Pub: Maskew Miller: Cape Town, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; sun scorpion, and sun spider. In [[southern Africa]], they are known by a host of names, including red romans, ''{{lang|af|haarskeerders}}'' ("hair cutters") and ''{{lang|af|baardskeerders}}'' ("beard cutters"), the latter two relating to the belief they use their formidable jaws to clip hair from humans and animals to line their subterranean nests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Ross Piper]] |year=2007 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solifugids and humans==
[[File:Solifugo XIX.jpg|thumb|right|A [[scorpion]] (left) fighting a solifugid (right)]]
Solifugids have been recognised as distinct taxa from ancient times. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] recognized that they were distinct from [[spider]]s; spiders were called {{lang|el|ἀράχνη}} (''arachne'') while Solifugae were named {{lang|el|φαλάνγιον}} (''phalangion''). In [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s ''De natura animalium'', they are mistakenly mentioned, along with [[scorpion]]s, as responsible for the abandoning of a country in [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]]. [[Anton August Heinrich Lichtenstein]] theorised in 1797 that the "mice" that plagued the [[Philistines]] in the [[Old Testament]] were Solifugae. During [[World War I]], troops {{Clarify|reason=Egyptian troops? German troops?|date=September 2016}} stationed in [[Abu Qir|Abū Qīr]], [[Egypt]], would stage fights between captive "jerrymanders," as they referred to them, and placed bets on the outcome. Similarly, British troops stationed in [[Libya]] in [[World War II]] would stage fights between solifugids and scorpions.&lt;ref name="Punzo"/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

===Urban legends===
Solifugae are the subject of many legends and exaggerations about their size, speed, behaviour, appetite, and lethality. They are not especially large, the biggest having a leg span of about {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=schmidt93/&gt; They are fast on land compared to other invertebrates, with their top speed estimated to be {{convert|16|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="geographic" /&gt; close to one-half as fast as the fastest human sprinter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf |title=IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) Biomechanical Research Project: Berlin 2009. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514050117/http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/document/competitions/competition/05/30/83/20090817081546_httppostedfile_wch09_m100_final_13529.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solifugae apparently have neither [[venom (poison)|venom]] glands nor any venom-delivery apparatus such as the fangs of spiders, stings of wasps, or venomous [[seta]]e of caterpillars (e.g., ''[[Lonomia]]'' or ''[[Saddleback caterpillar|Acharia]]'' species).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} One 1978 study is frequently quoted, in which the authors report detection of an exception to this rule in [[India]], in that ''Rhagodes nigrocinctus'' had venom glands, and that injection of the secretion into mice was frequently fatal. However, no supporting studies have confirmed either statement, such as by independent detection of the glands as claimed, or the relevance of the observations, if correct. Even the authors of the original account denied having found any means of delivery of the putative venom by the animal, and the only means of administering the material to the mice was by [[Route of administration#Parenteral|parenteral]] injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Aruchami &amp; G. Sundara Rajulu |year=1978 |title=An investigation on the poison glands and the nature of the venom of ''Rhagodes nigrocinctus'' (Solifugae: Arachnida) |journal=Natl. Acad. Sci. Lett. |volume=1 |pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many non-venoms such as saliva, blood and glandular secretions can be lethal if injected, and that no venomous function was even speculated upon in this study, there is still no evidence for even one venomous species of solifugid.&lt;ref&gt;Klann, Anja Elisabeth. Histology and ultrastructure of solifuges comparative studies of organ systems of solifuges (Arachnida, Solifugae) with special focus on functional analyses and phylogenetic interpretations Dissertation: Greifswald, Univ., Diss., 2009 Edition/Format:Thesis/dissertation Manuscript: eBook Archival Material: English View all editions and formats Database:WorldCat.

Because of their unfamiliar spider-like appearance and rapid movements, Solifugae have startled or even frightened many people. This fear was sufficient to drive a family from their home when one was discovered in a soldier's house in [[Colchester|Colchester, England]], and caused the family to blame the solifugid for the death of their pet [[dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| date = August 28, 2008 | title = Stowaway Afghan spider kills family dog | publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/28/uk.dangerous.spider/index.html |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Arizona resident developed painful lesions due to a claimed solifugid bite, but could not produce a specimen for confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| date = July 27, 2017 | title = Mystery bug bite leaves Arizona man covered in bruises, ‘excruciating pain’ | publisher=Global News | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3629567/mystery-bug-bite-leaves-arizonas-man-covered-in-bruises-excruciating-pain/ | accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they are not venomous, the powerful [[chelicerae]] of a large specimen may inflict a painful nip, but nothing medically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Penney |year=2009 |title=Common Spiders and Other Arachnids of The Gambia, West Africa |publisher=Siri Scientific Press |isbn=978-0-9558636-3-9 |chapter=Solifugae (camel spiders) |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjVGuc76_RkC&amp;pg=PA71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elections to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]''' were held in the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 March 1984.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1642 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the last in the Soviet Union to be held before [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[perestroika]] and [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|demokratizatsiya]] resulted in partially free elections in [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|1989]]. They were also the last direct elections to the Supreme Soviet, as in 1989 deputies were elected to the Congress of People's Deputies, who then elected the Supreme Soviet.

==Electoral system==
Candidates had to be nominated by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) or by a public organisation.&lt;ref name=N&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1630&lt;/ref&gt; However, all public organisations were controlled by the party and were subservient to a 1931 law that required them to accept party rule.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; The CPSU itself remained the only legal one in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1654&lt;/ref&gt; 

Voters could vote against the CPSU candidate, but could only do so by using polling booths, whereas votes for the party could be cast simply by submitting a blank ballot.&lt;ref name=N/&gt; Turnout was required to be over 50% for the election to be valid.&lt;ref name=N/&gt;

==Candidates==
CPSU candidates accounted for around three quarters of the nominees, whilst many of the others were members of [[Komsomol]].&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1631&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
With over 184 million [[Soviet]] citizens voting in the election, over 99% of the votes went to a deputy to the [[Supreme Soviet]], with over 100,000 votes against Party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Party, State, and Citizen in the Soviet Union: A Collection of Documents'', edited by Mervyn Matthews, London: M.E. Sharpe, Inc., 1989, p. 5-6, 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Navy]]'s '''Submarine Parachute Assistance Group''' is a team who provide a rescue support capability to [[submarine]] sinking incidents worldwide, available at short notice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/Careers/Role-finder/Roles/~/media/Files/CNR-PDFs/Sub-Service_spreads.pdf Your career guide], mod.uk.

Retrieved 19 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Submarine Parachute Assistance Group was originally formed from staff of the RN [[Submarine escape training facility#Royal Navy SETT|Submarine Escape Training Tank]] at [[HMS Dolphin (shore establishment)|HMS Dolphin]] in [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]].  The SETT was part of the RN Submarine School, providing wet training in submarine escape drills for both new submariners and those requiring periodic requalification.  With the move of the school to  [[HMS Raleigh (shore establishment)|HMS Raleigh]] in [[Cornwall]], in 1999, the SPAG remained at the SETT until the cessation of wet training in 2009.  At that point the SPAG was moved to HMS Raleigh.

On 19 November 2017, the SPAG were deployed to [[HMS Protector (A173)|HMS ''Protector'']] in aid of international search efforts for the missing Argentinian submarine {{ship|ARA|San Juan|S-42|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farmer|first1=Ben|title=Elite Royal Navy rescue team sent as possible calls detected from missing Argentine submarine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/19/bad-weather-hinders-search-missing-argentine-submarine/|work=The Telegraph|date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==

The team is made up of instructor personnel from the Royal Navy Submarine School.  Members of the group are trained submariners or medical staff posted to the school, subsequently trained in water entry [[parachute]] skills.  Prior to the cessation of training in the SETT some members of SPAG were trained in [[Scuba Diving|diving]] skills.

==Deployment and role==

The SPAG can be activated at 6 hours notice, to fly to a submarine sinking incident, regardless of the operator of the vessel.  The team may work in conjunction with the [[NATO Submarine Rescue System]].

The team is configured to enter the water at the location of the incident, using a static line from the rear ramp of the aircraft.  Equipment pods  dropped with the team contain [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat]]s, life rafts, food, water and medical supplies.  This equipment allows the team to establish an afloat reception package for submariners evacuating the sunken vessel, in order to provide medical and life support.

==Regalia==

Members of the SPAG are trained in basic parachuting and entitled to wear the [[Parachutist Badge (United Kingdom)|Parachute Badge]].

'''''The Elephant Man''''' is a play by [[Bernard Pomerance]]. It premiered at the [[Hampstead Theatre]] in London on 7 November 1977. It later played in repertory at the &lt;!-- Did not acquire 'Royal' prefix until 1988. --&gt;[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bernard Pomeranc, Playwright | url = http://www.alleytheatre.org/Alley/Playwright_Bernard_Pomerance_of_The_Elephant_Man.asp | publisher = Alley Theatre | location = [[Houston Texas]] | accessdate= 22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran [[Off-Broadway]] from 14 January to 18 March 1979, at The Theatre at St. Peter's.&lt;ref name=offbroadwaydb&gt;{{iobdb title| 2490}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production's [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1979 at the [[Booth Theatre]] was produced by Richmond Crinkley and [[Nelle Nugent]], and directed by [[Jack Hofsiss]]. The play closed in 1981 after eight previews and 916 regular performances.
 
The story is based on the life of [[Joseph Merrick]], referred to in the script as John Merrick, who lived in the [[Victorian era]] and is known for the extreme deformity of his body. The lead role of Merrick was originated by [[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=David Schofield| url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/320849| publisher=Filmbug| accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfinishedhistories.com/hidden/the-elephant-man/ UNFINISHED HISTORIES]: Recording the History of Alternative Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; in a definitive performance. Subsequent productions starred actors including [[Philip Anglim]], [[David Bowie]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Bruce Davison]], and [[Bradley Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Steve| last=Edelson| title=David Bowie in ''The Elephant Man''| url=http://www.up-to-date.com/bowie/elephantman | publisher= | date=18 February 2002 | accessdate=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play calls for no prosthetic makeup on the actor portraying Merrick; the actor portrays Merrick's deformity through physicality, letting the audience imagine Merrick's appearance.

==Plot==
''The Elephant Man'' opens with [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], an up-and-coming surgeon, meeting his new employer Francis Carr-Gomm, the administrator of the London Hospital.

Ross, the manager of a [[freak show]], invites a crowd on [[Whitechapel Road]] to come view John Merrick, the Elephant Man.  Treves happens upon the freak show and is intrigued by Merrick's disorder.  He insists that he must study Merrick further; Ross agrees, for a fee. Ross then gives a lecture on Merrick's anatomy, making Merrick stand on display while Treves describes his condition to the audience.

The freak show travels to [[Brussels]] after being driven out of London by the police.  Merrick tries to converse with three freak show "pinheads", or people suffering from [[microcephaly]] and [[mental retardation]].  The "pinheads" go onstage to sing "We Are the Queens of the Congo", but the police will not allow Merrick to perform, because they consider his condition "indecent".  Ross decides that Merrick is more trouble than he is worth, steals his savings, and sends him back to London.

When Merrick arrives in London, his appearance incites a crowd to riot. The train's conductor and a policeman are able to fetch Treves to calm the situation. Treves takes Merrick to the London Hospital and interviews a woman, Nurse Sandwich, for the position of Merrick's caretaker.  Sandwich assures Treves that she has cared for [[lepers]] in [[Africa]] and is quite prepared for anything.  However, when she sees Merrick taking a bath, she bolts from the room and refuses to take the job.

Bishop How visits Merrick and declares him a "true [[Christian]] in the rough". He tells Treves he would like to educate Merrick in religion. Carr-Gomm argues with Bishop How about the importance of science versus the importance of religion. Carr-Gomm announces that, due to a letter he had printed in ''[[The Times]]'', the people of London have donated enough money to allow Merrick to live at the hospital for life. Treves tells Gomm that he is glad Merrick now has a place where he can stay without being stared at, and is determined that Merrick should lead a normal life.

When two attendants, Will and Snork, are caught peeking into Merrick's room, Will is fired and Snork is given a severe warning. Treves believes that it is important to enforce these rules, but Merrick worries what will happen to Will and his family. Merrick grew up in the [[workhouses]], and wishes that no one had to suffer that fate. Treves says that it is just the way things are.

John Merrick has a visitor by the name of [[Madge Kendal]], an actress who came across Carr-Gromm's section in the newspaper. When Mrs. Kendal meets Merrick, she requires all of her self-control in order to disguise her horror at Merrick’s appearance. After several minutes of strained conversation. Mrs. Kendal mentions ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Merrick amazes Mrs. Kendal with his thoughtful and sensitive views on [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] and the nature of love. Mrs. Kendal says that she will bring some of her friends to meet Merrick, then shakes his hand and tells him how truly pleased she is to meet him.  Merrick dissolves into tears as Treves tells Mrs. Kendal that it is the first time a woman has ever shaken his hand.

Mrs. Kendal's [[High society (social class)|high society]] friends visit Merrick and bring him gifts while he builds a model of St. Phillip's church, having to work with his one good hand. He tells Mrs. Kendal that St. Phillip’s Church is an imitation of grace, and his model is therefore an imitation of an imitation. When Treves comments that all of humanity is a mere illusion of [[heaven]], Merrick says that God should have used both hands.  Merrick's new friends&amp;mdash;Bishop How, Gomm, the Duchess, Princess Alexandra, Treves, and Mrs. Kendal&amp;mdash;all comment upon how, in different ways, they see themselves reflected in him.  However, Treves notes that Merrick’s condition is worsening with time.

Merrick tells Mrs. Kendal that he needs a mistress and suggests that he would like her to do that for him.  Mrs. Kendal listens compassionately, but she tells Merrick that it is unlikely that he will ever have a mistress. Merrick admits that he has never even seen a naked woman. Mrs. Kendal is flattered by his show of trust in her, and she realizes that she has come to trust him. She undresses and allows him to see her naked body. Treves enters and is shocked, sending Mrs. Kendal away.

Ross comes to the hospital to ask Merrick to rejoin the freak show.  Ross's health has drastically worsened, and he tells Merrick that without help he is doomed to a painful death.  He tries to convince Merrick to charge the society members who visit him. Merrick refuses to help Ross, finally standing up to him after suffering years of abuse at his hands. Ross makes one final pathetic plea to Merrick, who refuses him, saying that's just the way things are.

Merrick asks Treves what he believes about God and heaven.  Then he confronts Treves, criticizing what he did to Mrs. Kendal and the rigid standards by which he judges everybody.  Treves realizes that he has been too harsh with Merrick and tells him that although he will write to Mrs. Kendal, he does not believe she will return. After Merrick leaves the room, Treves says that it is because he does not want her to see Merrick die.

Treves has a nightmare that he has been put on display while Merrick delivers a lecture about his terrifying normality, his rigidity, and the acts of cruelty he can commit upon others "for their own good".

Carr-Gomm and Treves discuss Merrick's impending death. Treves displays frustration at the fact that the more normal Merrick pretends to be, the worse his condition becomes. He confronts Bishop How, telling him that he believes Merrick’s faith is merely another attempt to emulate others. It comes out that the real source of his frustrations is the chaos of the world around him, with his patients seemingly doing everything they can to shorten their own lives. No matter how hard he tries he cannot help them, just as he cannot help Merrick. He finally begs for the bishop to help him.

Merrick finishes his model of the church. As usual, he goes to sleep while sitting, a posture which he must adopt due to the weight of his head. As he sleeps he sees visions of the pinheads, now singing that they are the Queens of the Cosmos. They lay him down to sleep normally, and he dies. Snork discovers his body and runs out screaming that the Elephant Man is dead.

In the final scene, Carr-Gomm reads a letter he has written to ''The Times'', outlining Merrick’s stay at the hospital, his death and his plans for the remaining funds donated for Merrick's care. When he asks Treves if he has anything else to add, a distressed Treves says he does not and leaves. As Carr-Gomm finishes the letter Treves rushes back in, saying that he’s thought of something. Carr-Gomm tells the doctor that it is too late: it is done.

'''The Sydney Fringe''' is an alternative arts and culture festival held for the first time in September 2010 in the [[Inner West|inner west]] of [[Sydney]], Australia. 

The Fringe is an initiative of the [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] Entertainment Precinct Association.&lt;ref name=NEPA&gt;[http://thesydneyfringe.com.au/about The Sydney Fringe - About Us], Accessed 15/2/10&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest alternative visual and [[performing arts]] event in NSW. It encompasses genres such as [[stand-up comedy]], [[Concert|music]], [[theatre]], [[cabaret]], [[visual arts]], and [[burlesque]], though shows and events that are not easily labelled in that manner are highly encouraged; evidence of this in past years has included [[podcast]] recordings&lt;ref&gt;http://2012.sydneyfringe.com/event/comedy/minutes-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://2012.sydneyfringe.com/event/comedy/seizure-kaiser-film-chat-podcast&lt;/ref&gt; and [[indie video game]] events.&lt;ref&gt;http://2012.sydneyfringe.com/event/special-events/brain-soup-indie-video-game-showcase&lt;/ref&gt; It is billed as "a time for risk, discovery and adventure [...] a three week celebration of the strange and the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnsw.com/2012/03/richard-hull-sydney-fringe-festival-director/|title=Richard Hull-Sydney Fringe Festival 2012|date=21 March 2012|website=musicnsw.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sydney Fringe, began as a curated festival (like the [[New York International Fringe Festival]]) as opposed to an open access "unjuried" festival (the model used by the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]).&lt;ref name=SMH-2009-12-19&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/newtown-gets-a-cuttingedge-fringe/2009/12/17/1260639252913.html?page=-1 Sydney Morning Herald 19/12/09 "Newtown gets a cutting-edge fringe"], Accessed 15/2/10&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, festival director Richard Hull implemented the open access festival model, whereby the visual arts is now the only curated element.&lt;ref&gt;http://2012.sydneyfringe.com/news/prepare-unleash-yourself&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sydney Fringe typically operates in a festival precinct encompassing a number of venues in the [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]]/[[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]/[[Enmore, New South Wales|Enmore]] area, with a few other venues in the wider Sydney area, including Leichhardt, Parramatta, Oxford Street and the City.&lt;ref name=SydneyFringeVenues&gt;[http://2012.sydneyfringe.com/FAQ The Sydney Fringe - FAQs], Accessed 15/2/10&lt;/ref&gt; In a departure from previous years, where venues registered with the Fringe in the same manner as artists, the Fringe 2013 team have selected a list of over 60 Sydney venues, for artists to then communicate and draw up contracts with.

==Previous Sydney Fringe Festivals==
A Sydney Fringe Festival ran from 1994 to 2002 in [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]], founded by producer Megan Donnelly and [[Katrina Sedgwick]]. The Live Bait Festival, a successor to the Sydney Fringe Festival, also operated out of Bondi from 2003–2004 and was co-produced by Michael Cohen and Glenn Wright.&lt;ref name=SMH-2006-01-24&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/somethings-missing-on-the-edge-of-the-stage/2006/01/24/1138066794633.html Sydney Morning Herald 24/1/06 "Something's missing on the edge of the stage"], Accessed 15/2/10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 546''', adopted on 6 January 1984, after hearing representations from the [[People's Republic of Angola]], the Council recalled resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 387|387]] (1976), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 428|428]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 447|447]] (1979), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 454|454]] (1979), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 475|475]] (1980) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 545|545]] (1983), and expressed its concern at the continuing attacks on the country by South Africa through occupied [[South West Africa]].

The Council demanded South Africa cease the attacks and respect Angola's sovereignty and territorial integrity, noting that Angola is entitled to the [[right of self-defense]] and to compensation for the attacks. It also called upon South Africa to cease the occupation of southern Angola and withdraw its forces. The resolution urged Member States to provide economic assistance to Angola, as well as enforce [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 418|Resolution 418]] (1977) on the [[arms embargo]] against South Africa. It also requested the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] continue to monitor the situation and report back to the Council as appropriate.

The resolution was approved by 13 votes to none against, while the United Kingdom and United States [[abstention|abstained]] from voting.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}}
The '''War of the Flemish Succession''' was a series of [[feudal]] conflicts in the mid-thirteenth century between the children of [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders]]. They concerned the succession to the countship of two counties, one a fief of the [[King of France]] (Flanders) and one a fief of the [[King of Germany]] (Hainault).

==Origins==
When [[Baldwin I of Constantinople|Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]] and [[Count of Hainault|Hainault]], left on the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1202, he left his western domains under his eldest daughter [[Jeanne, Countess of Flanders|Joanna]]. Joanna inherited the counties on Baldwin's death and, despite two marriages, died without heirs in 1244. She was succeeded by her younger sister, the aforementioned Margaret.

Margaret's first marriage, to [[Bouchard of Avesnes]], was annulled in 1221 on orders from Joanna and the excommunication of Bouchard. By Bouchard, however, Margaret had already had three children, including [[John I of Avesnes]]. Nevertheless, in 1223, she remarried. With her second husband, [[William II of Dampierre]] (d.1231), she also had three children, including [[William III of Dampierre|William III]] and [[Guy of Dampierre]].

The contested division of the rights to Margaret's inheritance between the sons of Avesnes and those of Dampierre were the cause of the conflicts known as the "war of the succession of Flanders and Hainault."

==First conflict==
The first conflict opened with Margaret's succession in 1244. John I of Avesnes and William of Dampierre, half brothers, fought between themselves until [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]] intervened in 1246. Louis gave Hainault (technically not his to give) to John I of Avesnes and Flanders (indeed his vassal) to William of Dampierre. Margaret, in light of this judgement, gave the government of Flanders over to William of Dampierre in 1247. She did not however relinquish her governance of Hainault to John I of Avesnes.

In 1251, William III of Dampierre died and Flanders passed to his brother Guy of Dampierre.

==Second conflict==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[William II of Holland]] --&gt;
In 1248, Louis had left on the [[Seventh Crusade]] and remained abroad for six years. John I of Avesnes quickly apprehended that his mother did not intend to give him the government of Hainault as she had that of Flanders to her other sons. John I of Avesnes revolted against his mother and attacked his half-brother Guy of Dampierre, who had just become count of Flanders.

John I of Avesnes persuaded the [[King of Germany|German anti-king]] [[William II, Count of Holland|William of Holland]] to seize Hainault and Flemish territory within the empire. The fighting continued until the [[Battle of West-Capelle]] on 4 July 1253, when John I of Avesnes gained a brilliant victory over Guy of Dampierre and forced him and his mother to respect the division of Louis and grant him Hainault.

==Third conflict==
Margaret did not rest in her defeat and did not recognise herself as overcome. She instead granted Hainault to [[Charles of Anjou]], the brother of King Louis, who had recently returned from the crusade. Charles took up her cause and warred with John I of Avesnes, but failed to take [[Valenciennes]] and just missed being killed in a skirmish. When Louis returned in 1254, he reaffirmed his earlier arbitration and ordered his brother to get out of the conflict. Charles returned to [[Provence]]. With this second arbitration of the holy king, the conflict closed and John I of Avesnes was secure in Hainault.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-M0804-0734, Berlin, 10. Weltfestspiel, Demonstration.jpg|thumb|The [[10th World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1972]]
The '''World Festival of Youth and Students''' is an international event, organized by the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]] (WFDY), a [[United Nations]]-[[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|recognized]] international youth [[non-governmental organization]], jointly with the [[International Union of Students]] since 1947.

The festival has been held regularly since 1947 as an event of global youth solidarity for democracy and against war and imperialism. The largest festival was the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students|6th]], held in 1957 in [[Moscow]], when 34,000 young people from 131 countries attended the event.  This festival also marked the international debut of the song "[[Moscow Nights]]", which subsequently went on to become perhaps the most widely recognized Russian song in the world. Until the 19th festival in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]] in 2017 (with 185 countries participating),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia2017.com/en |title=#WFYS2017 |work=russia2017.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest festival by number of countries with participants was the 13th, held in 1989 in [[Pyongyang]] when 177 countries attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/world/asia/north-korea-olympics.html |title=North Korea’s Would-Be Olympics: A Tale of a Cold War Boondoggle |work=nytimes.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Federation of Democratic Youth was founded to bring together young people of both the socialist and capitalist countries to promote peaceful cooperation and mutual rejection of war. However, with the onset of the [[Cold War]] soon after, the organization and the festivals became a matter of contention within the rivalry. Because of the enormous expenditure and coordination required to support a youth festival, most of the early festivals were held in cities in the socialist countries of Europe. However, many festivals, both then and more so since, have been held in non-socialist countries, affirming the commitment to peaceful coexistence between the peoples living under the different systems.

The most recent festival took place in Sochi, Russia, from 13 to 22 October 2017.
