'''Acharya Chatursen Shastri ({{lang-hi|आचार्य चतुरसेन शास्त्री}})''' (26 August 1891 – 2 February 1960) was an eminent [[writer]] of [[Hindi literature|Hindi]], and he wrote many [[historical fiction]]s, including ''[[Vaishali ki Nagarvadhu]]'' adapted into a feature film (1948), ''Vayam Rakshamah'' (1951), ''Somnath'' (1954) and ''Dharamputra'', which was adapted into (feature film| [[Dharmputra]]) (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blast From The Past: Dharmputra 1961|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2010/02/06/stories/2010020652121100.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=6 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Acharya Chatursen Shastri was born in a small village [[Aurangabad Chandok ]](near [[Anupshahr]]) in the [[Bulandshahr]] district of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state in India on 26 August 1891. His father was Punditt Kewal Ram Thakur and mother was Nanhee Devi. His birth name was Chaturbhuj.

Chaturbhuj finished his primary education in a school in Sikandrabad. Then he got admitted to Sanskrit College, [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]]. From here he received the degrees of Ayurvedacharya in [[Ayurveda]] and Shastri in [[Sanskrit]] in the year 1915. He also received the degree of Ayurvedacharya from Ayurveda Vidyapeetha.

After finishing his education he came to [[Delhi]] to start his practice as an [[ayurvedic]] physician. He opened his own ayurvedic dispensary in Delhi but it did not run well and he had to close it down. He joined a rich man's charitable dispensary at the salary of Rupees 25 per month. Later in 1917, he joined DAV college, [[Lahore]] (now in Pakistan) as senior professor of Ayurveda. The management at the DAV college, Lahore was insulting to him, therefore, he resigned and went to [[Ajmer]] to help his father-in-law in his dispensary. Working at this dispensary, he started to write and soon became famous as a story writer and novelist.

His first novel Hridaya-Ki-Parakh (Trial of the Heart) was published in 1918. It did not bring him any recognition. His second book, [[Satyagraha]] Aur Asahyoga (Civil Resistance and Non-cooperation) was published in 1921. Contrary to the title, this book collided with the ideas of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who was a prominent political figure in India in those days. This brought immense attention to Acharya Chatursen Shastri. These were followed by many historical novels, stories and ayurvedic books.

Acharya Chatursen Shastri took his last breath on 2 February 1960.

==Career==
His books present an idealistic view of Ancient period as can be seen clearly in his famous book Purnahuti. In this book he gives a eulogical account of Prithiviraj Chauhan's life and the battles fought. They are not historical but give details of life in [[History of India|ancient India]]. These books can be seen as a logical binding of [[history]] and [[philosophy]] and are  worth recommending to anyone who is looking to know more about India before the advent of [[Islam]]. In his foreword to his book,'Vaishali ki Nagarvadhu', he declares this is his first book and the ones prior to this one were worthless; the book lives up to this declaration. It is hard to imagine a more readable description of society and politics in India around sixth century BC.

He was a friend of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], but he opposed Nehru's proposition of [[secular]] India. Nehru tried to ban his books after [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] came to power and accused Acharya Chatursen of fuelling tensions between Hindus and Muslims.
He was also a [[hindutva|nationalist]].

==Writings==
The bulk of his literary output is almost unparalleled in Hindi. In all, he wrote 72 published books including 8 [[historical novels]], 10 dramas, 4 historical non-fictions, 15 collections of essays on political subjects and an equal number on the subjects of health and medicine. He also published over 250 short stories in various Hindi periodicals over time. His novel Dharamputra was adapted into Hindi film, ''[[Dharmputra]]'' (1961) by [[Yash Chopra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1587103}}&lt;/ref&gt; it won the [[9th National Film Awards|National Film Award]] for [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi|Best Feature Film in Hindi]].&lt;ref name="9thaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm9thNFAAward.aspx|title=9th National Film Awards|publisher=[[International Film Festival of India]]|access-date=28 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202115652/http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm9thNFAAward.aspx|archive-date=2 December 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Spanish|Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea|date=August 2011}}
'''Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea''' (1602–1685) was a Spanish writer and poet born in [[Zaragoza (comarca)|Zaragoza]] on 19 April 1602 and died in [[Casbas de Huesca|Casbas]] (Huesca) around 1685.

==Career==
Born into a family of noble lineage, Bolea (one of whose descendants would become the [[Count of Aranda]]), was the daughter of Martin Abarca de Bolea y Castro, a humanist, and Ana de Mur. After being baptized in the Zaragozan Parish of San Felipe,&lt;ref&gt;Campo Guiral, María Angeles: ''Devoción y fiesta en la pluma barroca de Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea: estudio de la vigilia y octavario de San Juan Bautista'' ({{en icon}}: Devotion and feast in the Baroque writings of Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea: study into the vigil and octave of San Juan Bautista), Huesca, Instituto de Estudios Altoaragoneses, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; she lived from three years of age in the Real Monastery of Santa Maria de la villa in Casbas, from which she was unable to leave and where she developed a deep religious and humanistic background.

Within the enclosures of the monastery Bolea was enriched with many different readings to the point where she was able to learn classical Latin. She was professed as religious on 4 June 1624. In 1655 she was mistress of novices and came to hold the office of [[abbess]] in 1672. She corresponded with leading scholars and writers within the Aragonese literary circles, she particularly enjoyed the patronage of Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa, as well as the Count of Salinas, Juan Francisco Andrés de Uztarroz and most likely, with Gracián, who praised her and collected her poems in his ''Agudeza y arte de ingenio''.

Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea's poetry is found within a miscellaneous book titled ''Vigilia y Octaverio de San Juan Bautista'' ([[Zaragoza]], 1679), which also combines a short novel, or apologue (''La ventura en la desdicha''), and a novel (''El fin bueno en mal principio'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abarca de Bolea, Ana Francisca|url=http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=71|website=Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa|publisher=DiCom Medios SL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deals with the miscellaneous genre—very well known at the time—where in the framework of a dialogue inherited from humanism, literature of various genres are interspersed. In this case, the framework resembles that of a pastoral novel, perhaps the last Spanish pastoral novel of the time, in which a group of rich and refined pastors meet in an area of [[Moncayo Massif|Moncayo]], where a hermitage dedicated to San Juan stands to celebrate the [[vigil]] and Octave of the feast of the Saint.  Over a period of nine days, they amuse themselves with various entertainments and banquets, engaging in debates, the telling of anecdotes, and reciting romances and songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez de Cano|first1=J.R.|title=Abarca de Bolea, Ana Francisca|website=La Web de las Biografías|publisher=MCNBiografías}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The themes of her poetry in large part possess a sacred and popular character. In some of them she uses the [[Aragonese language]]—in fact, her works are some of the few examples of literature with linguistic features of [[Aragonese-language literature|seventeenth-century Aragonese]].  An example is the "birth Albada" which is composed of twenty Christmas-themed romantic couplets and reveals folklore customs (sung by Ginés and Pascual to the custom of their village and sound of the [[bagpipes]]).  The author's commentary--"the lyrics gave remarkable pleasure and they admired the ingenuity, and may that ancient tongue that was used in Spain be conserved"—indicates that the use of the Aragonese language was not conscious.  These poems were studied by [[Philology|Philologists]]  [[Manuel Alvar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alvar|first1=Manual|title=Estudios sobre el 'Octavario' de doña Ana Abarca de Bolea|date=1945|publisher=Instituto "Fernando el Católico"|location=Zaragoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francho Nagore]], [[M.ª Ángeles Campo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo Guiral|first1=M.A.|title=Estudio y edición de 'Vigilia y Octavario de San Juan Bautista' de Doña Ana Abarca de Bolea|date=1990|location=Zaragoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[José Manuel Blecua Teijeiro|José Manuel Blecua]].  Here is an example of her "Albada de nacimiento" ("birth Albada"):

[[File:ArieDeJong.png|thumb|Doctor Arie de Jong]]
'''Arie de Jong''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːri də ˈjɔŋ|lang}}; October 18, 1865, [[Jakarta]], [[Dutch East Indies]] – October 12, 1957, [[Putten]], [[Netherlands]]) was a Dutch enthusiast and reformer of the constructed language [[Volapük]] by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]], with whose help the Volapük movement gained new strength in the Netherlands. He not only revised Volapük, but also (together with other Volapükist contemporaries) began Volapükaklub Valemik Nedänik (Dutch Universal Volapük Club) and founded Diläd valemik Feda Volapükaklubas. He also founded and edited ''Volapükagased pro Nedänapükans'', an independent newspaper in Volapük, which ran for thirty-one years (1932–1963). He wrote [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Gramat_Volap%C3%BCka Gramat Volapüka], a grammar of the language completely in Volapük, and a German-Volapük dictionary, ''Wörterbuch der Weltsprache'' (''World Language Dictionary''). He translated the [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Diatek_Nulik New Testament] into Volapük from Greek, as well as many other pieces of literature. Arie de Jong is justly considered the most important Volapükist of a new age of Volapük history.

== Early life and medical career==
Arie de Jong was born on October 18, 1865 to happy parents in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) in then [[Dutch East Indies]]. In 1873, his family moved to [[Leiden]], Netherlands, where he attended grammar-school (1873-1883) and studied [[medicine]] (1883-1891) at [[Leiden University]]. In February 1891, he received his Doctorate diploma; in March, he became a military medical officer (stationed in East India); briefly afterward, on September 8, he became a university medical doctor in [[Freiburg]] by means of his dissertation: "Über Diuretin" (On [[:wikt:diuresis|Diuresis]]).

On February 18, 1892, de Jong married Maria Elisabeth Wilhelmina Clarkson in [[Ginneken]], and the couple left by a ship by the name of ''Princess Sophie'' after only one month, on March 22, towards Dutch East Indies. Maria, however, died aboard ship on the [[Red Sea]], on the first day of April. Nineteen days later, Arie reached the city of Batavia alone, and on the 25th, he decided to depart to his workshop in [[Makassar]].

In 1893, he was relocated to Bonthain (now [[Bantaeng]] in [[South Sulawesi]]); in 1896, to [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]] and also to [[Aceh]]; in 1898, to [[Sintang]], where he married for the second time, to Elise Marie Wilhelmine Gerardine Chavannes. In 1900, he became a first-class medical officer; in 1902, below he was relocated, first to [[Semarang]] and later to [[Ungaran]]; in 1904 he returned to Semarang. By that time he had already lost his two children: Marie Eugène, who was born in 1900 and died the following year, and another child who was stillborn.

In 1904 he enjoyed leisure for a year, during which he spent time in [[Europe]]. Having returned in 1905 to East Indies, he was sent to Pelantoengan, in 1908 to [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], and in 1911 to [[Magelang]], where for in eight years he would become a second-class medical officer. In 1912 he was relocated to [[Banjarmasin]]; the following year, he had leisure in Europe for nine months. When he returned to East Indies, he was sent to [[Surabaya]] where, at the end of 1914 he became a higher-ranked first-class medical officer. He was sent in 1915 to Malano, where his second wife, Elise Marie, died.

At that time Dutch East Indies still much needed to be organized and improved. Arie de Jong had an important role for these years in the struggle against many [[tropical disease]]s, considering that new treatments and previously denied methods appeared at the turn of the century. He helped lepers by providing certain contents for their lives, he allowed them to play instruments and made it possible for them to do simple jobs; and at this time, when these types of actions were not yet popular.

After the death of his wife in 1919, Arie de Jong returned to the Netherlands. In the following year he made [[The Hague]] his home, at the age of 54. In 1921, he married his third wife, Louise van Dissel. They had three children: Louisa Cornelia (born in 1922), Arie de Jong, Jr. (1924), and Gijsbertus Hendrienus (1926).

==Association with Volapük==
During his studies in Leiden, de Jong came across Volapük and began to learn it. On March 20, 1891 (a week after he became a military officer), at the age of 25, he received his Volapük teacher's diploma, and after ten months, his Volapük instructor diploma. After only a year, on May 15, 1893, he became a Volapük professor (reported in the newspaper "Nuns blefik se Volapükavol" (''Brief News in the World of Volapük'') the following year).

During his stay in the East Indies, de Jong's interest in Volapük remained, as seen in his correspondence with various Volapükists and Volapük newspapers. On June 5, 1901, he became a Volapük academian.

The '''Bassa language''' is a [[Kru language]] spoken by about 350,000 people in [[Liberia]] and 5,000 in [[Sierra Leone]] by [[Bassa (Liberia)|Bassa people]].

[[File:Escritura bassa vah.png|thumb|300px|The Bassa Vah alphabet.]]
It has an indigenous script, [[Bassa Vah|Vah]], it was first popularized by Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis, who has instigated publishing of limited materials in the language from the mid-1900s through the 1930s, with its height in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omniglot.com/writing/bassa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The script has been described as one which, "like the system long in use among the [[Vai people|Vai]], consists of a series of phonetic characters standing for syllables."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Frederick. Liberia: Description, history, problems. Chicago, 1913. P.246&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, however, the Vah script is alphabetic. It includes 30 consonants, seven vowels, and five tones that are indicated by dots and lines inside of each vowel.

In the 1970s the [[United Bible Societies]] (UBS) published a translation of the New Testament. June Hobley, of Liberia Inland Mission, was primarily responsible for the translation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) was used for this translation rather than the Vah script, mostly for practical reasons related to printing. Because the Bassa people had a tradition of writing, they quickly adapted to the new script, and thousands learned to read.

In 2005, UBS published the entire Bible in Bassa. The translation was sponsored by the Christian Education Foundation of Liberia, [[Christian Reformed]] World Missions, and UBS. Don Slager headed a team of translators that included Seokin Payne, Robert Glaybo, and William Boen.

The IPA has largely replaced the Vah script in publications. However, the Vah script is still highly respected and  is still in use by some older men, primarily for record keeping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10145">Although [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christianity]] became the [[state religion]] of Ethiopia in the 4th century, and the [[Bible]] was first translated into [[Ge'ez]] at about that time, only in the last two centuries have there appeared translations of the Bible into Amharic.

== Abu Rumi translation ==
The first translation of the Bible into [[Amharic language|Amharic]] was by [[Abu Rumi]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jowett]], ''Christian Researches in the Mediterranean from MDCCCXV to MDCCCXX in Furtherance of the Objects of the Church Missionary Society'' (London, 1822), pp. 171-229.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of [[Edward Ullendorff]], "The history of the first translation of the Bible into Amharic is a romantic and exciting story which deserves to be better known among ''éthiopisants''.&lt;ref&gt;Ullendorff, ''Ethiopia and the Bible: The Schweich Lectures'' (Oxford: British Academy, 1968), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The French Consul in [[Cairo]], a language scholar named [[Jean-Louis Asselin de Cherville]], possessed a manuscript containing a complete translation of the Bible into Amharic, created by the mutual efforts of the Consul and Abu Rumi. As Ullendorff relates, for ten years "every Tuesday and Saturday his de Cherville's door was shut to all visitors when he read with 'my Abyssinian, slowly and with the utmost attention, every verse of the Sacred Volume, in the Arabic Version which we were able to translate.' But we are not told from which Arabic version the rendering was made."&lt;ref&gt;Ullendorff, ''Ethiopian and the Bible'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Where the Arabic words were "abstruse, difficult, or foreign", de Cherville then consulted "the Hebrew Original, the Syriac Version, or the Septuagint" for clarification.

William Jowett purchased de Cherville's manuscript, consisting of 9,539 pages written in "the fine hand" of Abu Rumi for £1,250, which he then presented for review to Professor [[Samuel Lee (linguist)|Samuel Lee]], and the final manuscript was printed by [[Thomas Pell Platt]]&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Platt,_Thomas_Pell_(DNB00)&lt;/ref&gt; in increasing portions: the four Gospels in 1824, the entire New Testament in 1829, and the complete Bible in 1840. This translation, "with some changes and amendments, held sway until the Emperor Haile Selassie I ordered a new translation", which was published in 1960/61.&lt;ref&gt;Ullendorff, ''Ethiopia and the Bible'', pp. 65f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.good-amharic-books.com/library?id=116 Electronic access to the Abu Rumi version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Haile Selassie I Bible (1935)==
A new translation was underway, under the Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]'s patronage, when the Italian army invaded. This manuscript was later sent to Britain and printed, but most of the copies were destroyed in a fire during the bombing of London.&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Matthew. 1956. The Revision of the Amharic Bible. ''The Bible Translator'' 7.2: 72-76 [http://www.ubs-translations.org/tbt/1956/02/TBT195602.html?seq=26 online version]&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is sometimes known as the "Buxton" translation, because a British missionary named [[Alfred Buxton]] (1891–1940)&lt;ref&gt;Buxton died in the London bombing in 1940. ''Alfred Buxton of Abyssinia and Congo'' by Norman Grubb, with a foreword by the Rt. Hon. Viscount Caldecote. Published 1942 by Lutterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in sending the manuscript from occupied Ethiopia to Britain. This same basic translation, with some changes, was later printed in the USA, with funds raised by Rev. [[Donald Barnhouse]]. After it was printed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=81 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315081852/http://www.good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=81 |archive-date=2012-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; this translation (sometimes referred to as the "Barnhouse New Testament") was found to contain a serious error in Rev. 19:10 &amp; 22:9 (an angel commanding John to worship him, rather than prohibiting John to worship him), so most copies were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Fargher, ''The Origins of the New Churches Movement in Southern Ethiopia, 1927-1944; Studies of Religion in Africa, 16'' (Leiden: Brill, 1966), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Haile Selassie I Bible (1962)==
In 1962, a new Amharic translation from Ge'ez was printed, again with the patronage of the Emperor. The preface by Emperor Haile Selassie I is dated "1955" ([[Ethiopian Calendar|E.C.]]), and the 31st year of his reign (i.e. AD 1962 in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/foreign/amharic/ Bible.org: The Haile Selassie Amharic Bible], [http://ethiobible.org/ Lapsley/Brooks Digitalization project]. Ullendorf misreads this as AD 1955 (''Ethiopia and the Bible'', p. 66)&lt;/ref&gt; and states that it was translated by the Bible Committee he convened between AD 1947 and 1952, "realizing that there ought to be a revision from the original Hebrew and Greek of the existing translation of the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Statement on the Revised Amharic Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ullendorff comments "I have not made a systematic comparative study of the Abu Rumi and Emperor translations, but from desultory reading of both versions the following picture seems to emerge: I can find no evidence that the new recension has been subjected to any perceptible collation with the Hebrew and Greek originals. The Amharic has certainly been modernized and updated; the order of words in particular has been brought into conformity with contemporary stylistic tastes in Amharic. The use of Abu Rumi's text can clearly be discerned, even where the changes that have been introduced are by no means negligible." (''Ethiopia and the Bible'', p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; It included the 66 books of the [[protocanon]] (i.e. those held canonical in common with Protestant and Catholic Christians), as the 5 narrow canon [[deuterocanonical]] books were published separately. The five narrow canon Ethiopian deuterocanonical books comprise [[1 Enoch]] (''Henok''; different from the standard editions of Ge'ez manuscripts A~Q by foreign academics), [[Jubilees]] ([[Ge'ez]]: ''Mets'hafe Kufale'') and [[Meqabyan|I, II, and III Meqabyan]] (substantially different from [[1 Maccabees|I]], [[2 Maccabees|II]], and [[3 Maccabees|III Maccabees]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=81 |title=1962 Amharic Bible at Good Amharic Books |access-date=2008-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110904/http://www.good-amharic-books.com/onebook.php?bookID=81 |archive-date=2011-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 81 book [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] Bible, including the deuterocanonicals, 46 books of the Old Testament and 35 books of the New Testament, was published in 1986. This version incorporates a few minor changes or corrections to the 1962 Amharic text of the New Testament, but the text of the Old Testament and Deuterocanon are identical to those previously published under Haile Selassie I.

==UBS Versions (1987, 2005)==
Under the Bible Society of Ethiopia (a member of the [[United Bible Societies]]), a new translation was printed in 1987, translated directly from [[Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. A revised version of this appeared in 2005. These versions contain only the 66 books of the Protestant canon, and they have not been widely embraced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

==IBS Version (2001)==
[[Living Bibles International]] produced a New Testament in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.good-amharic-books.com/library?id=84 Electronic version of 1985 New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1992 merger of LBI with IBS, the [[International Bible Society]] produced a complete Bible in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibs.org/bibles/amharic/index.php Amharic Bible (c) International Bible Society, Amharic (2001) Index]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a translation from the English NIV, or is at least very heavily reliant upon it.

==New World Translation of Holy Scriptures==
In 2008, the [[Watch Tower Society]] produced an Amharic translation of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/?contentLanguageFilter=am Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Millennium Amharic Bible==
For the millennium celebration on the [[Julian calendar|Ethiopian calendar]], the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Bible Society produced a new translation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruk A. Asale. 2014. A millenium translation based on the Ge'ez and LXX: A new Bible translation in the Ethiopian church and its controversy. ''The Bible Translator'' 65(1): 49-73.&lt;/ref&gt; This translation differed from recent Amharic translations in that the translators generally followed the Greek [[Septuagint]] (LXX) translation for the Old Testament and the Ge'ez for both the Old and the New. It was warmly welcomed by the Orthodox, but not by Protestants, both sides misunderstanding some points of history and the Biblical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Bruk A. Asale. 2014. A millenium translation based on the Ge'ez and LXX: A new Bible translation in the Ethiopian church and its controversy. ''The Bible Translator'' 65(1): 49-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbuster]] mentality''' refers to the pressure faced by the small number of conglomerates who run much of the movie industry to create formulaic productions with a high budget.&lt;ref name=Baran&gt;{{cite book|last=Baran|first=S. J.|year=2010|work=Introduction to Mass Communication|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The focus on creating blockbusters can undermine the artistry of films, since everything in the production process becomes focused on concerns about fiduciary duty and shareholder value.&lt;ref name=Baran/&gt;

{{quote|The Big Bucks Strategy-The ''blockbuster mentality'' has always been around but big budgets don't always mean mega-profits. ''[[Terminator 2]]'' cost more than $70 million, but it's made more than $200 million so far. ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', while making money, isn't pulling it in as fast and has a ways to go before a profit is seen. The Little Bucks Strategy-The well-made modestly budgeted movie can turn a quick profit in tough times.

A '''Combined Anti-Armor Team''' is a highly effective special operational quick mobility heavy weapons team in the [[United States Marine Corps]] where a platoon in a [[weapons company]] is employed to combat ground armored vehicles and air defense vehicles with heavy  guns.   The team uses .50 caliber machine guns, mk-19 automatic 40mm grenade launcher, and a tube-launched optically tracked wire guided missile system ([[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missiles]]).

Members of the CAAT Team require aptitude battery and specific training beyond basic infantry and also cross level training on the global inventory of mobile weapon systems.

In addition to providing security for convoys, Diplomatic buildings, airfields in urban and rural environment, CAAT Teams are a vehicle-mounted form of quick reaction employment for heavy weapons in an infantry unit.

== Personnel ==
A CAAT platoon is composed of machine gunners and anti-tank missilemen. They team up to provide the combined arms power of the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun, [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|Mk 19]] 40MM automatic grenade launcher, [[m240|M-240B]] medium machine gun, and the [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missile system either from vehicles or from a ground position.

== Basic operations against armored vehicles ==
In its most basic role, a CAAT platoon and its various sections and teams will engage armored vehicles (tanks, APCs, etc.) first with heavy machine guns, usually the M2 .50 caliber machine gun. This is to "button up" the vehicle, or have the vehicle operators close all the hatches in order to protect themselves from the incoming rounds. When the target is effectively buttoned up, the TOW missile operator will fire a TOW missile, which, upon impact, will cause a dramatic increase in pressure in the closed target vehicle (such as a tank), causing it to explode from the overpressure, eliminating the enemy.

===Additional missions===
Due to their vehicle-borne nature, CAAT platoon will provide scouting capabilities during movements. They will traditionally take the lead for a movement of vehicles for security reasons, and therefore also taking responsibility for navigation and orientation. In addition, CAAT vehicles will be the last vehicles in the convoy (the rear, or "tail end charlie") for protection and get visual identitification on any oncoming vehicles from behind. If necessary, other CAAT vehicles can scout parallel routes or forward positions as necessary.

==Organization of a CAAT platoon==
A CAAT platoon will be divided into 2 or 3 sections, and each section will have an odd number of teams. Each section will be headed by a staff NCO, and the remaining pairs of vehicles will have NCOs in charge (personnel permitting). The billets (or jobs) in a vehicle can include:

*Vehicle Commander (VC) - The vehicle commander makes all decisions regarding the vehicle and its inhabitants.  The VC will usually be on the [[SINCGARS|radio]] (or other communications device, i.e., laptop) and communicate directly with other vehicles.  Exceptions to this rule are officers who usually have another Marine use the radio.
*Driver - The driver not only drives the vehicle but is responsible for its entire upkeep and maintenance.  The driver coordinates with the motor pool and its Marines to ensure timely repairs and maintenance.  In addition, during ship-borne deployment, the driver is responsible whenever the vehicle must be moved.  During missions, the driver takes cues from the VC as to where to go and how to get there.
*Gunner - The gunner maintains and operates the gun, and also provides a view to the VC from atop the vehicle.  The gunner is quite visible in the turret of the vehicle, and so he can also be a communicator to any people outside the vehicle.
*Corpsman - The platoon's Corpsman is a U.S. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]] with additional field medical training. The corpsman takes a full part in operations with the rest of the team, but also provides medical assistance and coverage when necessary.
*Dismount - The dismount is responsible for anything that needs to be done outside of the vehicle such as obtaining visual information that is not possible from the vehicle's point of view.  This billet may be combined with any of the other billets, except usually not for the VC or the driver.
*Ammo man - The Ammo man is another combined billet.  When the gunner is using the gun, someone may be responsible for taking old ammo and providing the gunner with live ammo (missiles or rounds).  This provides the gunner with an effective rate of fire.
*Guy in back (GIB) - Not a billet, but a name for any other military personnel in the back of the vehicle.

The CAAT teams will usually be paired up as one heavy machine gun and one TOW truck.  This allows the [[combined arms]] effect that is most effective on an armored vehicle.  Usually the section heads (the odd vehicle of the paired teams) have an [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|Mk 19]], while the other teams have a [[M2 Browning machine gun|.50 cal]], [[M240 machine gun|M-240G]], or a [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missile]].  In addition, the section heads usually travel with a team (making three vehicles), so as to not be left alone.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

A '''congregation''' is a formal meeting of senior members of a [[university]], especially in the [[United Kingdom]].

Examples include [[Regent House]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the House of Congregation and the Ancient House of Congregation at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/statutes/regulations/1083-120.shtml "Regulations of Congregation for the Membership of Congregation"], [[University of Oxford]], UK, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, very few congregations have actually been held, with most important business conducted by [[postal ballot]] of its members. The main exceptions are those held to formally award university degrees; stemming from this tradition, in some universities a [[graduation]] ceremony is known as a congregation even if the ceremony is not a meeting of the university's governing body in the traditional sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">In [[computer science]], more particularly in [[formal language theory]], a '''cyclic language''' is a set of strings that is closed with respect to repetition, root, and [[cyclic shift#Applications|cyclic shift]].

==Definition==
If ''A'' is a set of symbols, and ''A''&lt;sup&gt;[[Kleene star|*]]&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of all strings built from symbols in ''A'', then a string set ''L'' ⊆ ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is called a [[formal language]] over the [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]] ''A''.
The language ''L'' is called ''cyclic'' if
# ∀''w''∈''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. ∀''n''&gt;0. ''w'' ∈ ''L'' ⇔ ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''L'', and
# ∀''v'',''w''∈''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. ''vw'' ∈ ''L'' ⇔ ''wv'' ∈ ''L'',
where ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''n''-fold repetition of the string ''w'', and ''vw'' denotes the [[concatenation]] of the strings ''v'' and ''w''.&lt;ref name="Beal.Carton.Reutenauer.1996"&gt;{{cite book | contributionurl=http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~christo/Publi%C3%A9s/1996/Strongly%20cyclic%20languages.pdf | author=Marie-Pierre Béal and Olivier Carton and Christophe Reutenauer | contribution=Cyclic Languages and Strongly Cyclic Languages | editor= | title=Proc. [[Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science]] | publisher=Springer | series=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume=1046 | pages=49&amp;ndash;59 |  year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Def.1}}

==Examples==
For example, using the alphabet ''A'' = {''a'', ''b'' }, the language
{|
|-
| ALIGN=RIGHT | ''L'' = 
| {
|
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ... 
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;
| :
| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 and ''p''+''q'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }
|-
| ALIGN=RIGHT | ∪
| {
| ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
| ...
| ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;
|
| :
| ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0  and ''p''+''q'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; }
|}
is cyclic, but not [[regular language|regular]].&lt;ref name="Beal.Carton.Reutenauer.1996"/&gt;{{rp|Exm.2}}
However, ''L'' is [[context-free language|context-free]], since ''M'' = { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ... ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; : ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0 } is, and context-free languages are closed under [[circular shift#Applications|circular shift]]; ''L'' is obtained as circular shift of ''M''.

Toussaint is also a contributor to ''[[HuffPost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[HuffPost]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/david-toussaint|title=David Toussaint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born on April 23, 1964 to Maynard and Leona Toussaint in [[Walnut Creek, California]], Toussaint is the youngest of five children including [[Beth Toussaint]].  While in high school, he was an intern for the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' in Walnut Creek and eventually was hired as an assistant to the real estate editor.  From 1977 to 1979, Toussaint attended the [[American Conservatory Theater]] and toured as an actor throughout California with the theater's Young Conservatory group.  He attended the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] with a major in [[English literature]].  Toussaint now lives in [[Manhattan]].

==Career==
Since 1997, Toussaint has written articles for ''[[Brides]]'' magazine, ''[[Conde Nast Traveler]]'', ''Working Woman'', ''[[Instinct (magazine)|Instinct]]'', ''[[Gay Financial Network]]'', ''Outsider Ink'', ''Caribbean Travel'' and ''Life and Diversion'' magazine.  He has been an editor at [[Condé Nast Publications|Conde Nast]] and a three-time guest editor for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s online magazine ''Zoetrope'', and was a full-time columnist for ''GayWeddings.com''. Currently he writes a weekly column and is a theater critic for ''EDGE magazine'', and is the senior editor for ''GuySpy.com.'' In 2003, Toussaint wrote an article entitled ''Outward Bound'' on [[same-sex wedding]]s for ''Brides'' magazine.  It was the first article on [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] weddings to be published by any of the five major, top-selling bridal magazines, and its publication created a significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill |last=Werde |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/28/business/media/28BRID.html |title=MEDIA; A First at Bride's Magazine: A Report on Same-Sex Unions |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] F|date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toussaint's book, ''Gay and Lesbian Weddings: Planning the Perfect Same-Sex Ceremony'' was published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 2004,&lt;ref name=P/&gt; and his May 2009 ebook, ''Toussaint'', was published by Stay Thirsty Publishing. Toussaint's book "The Gay Couples Guide to Wedding Planning" was published by Sellers Publishing in 2012. His book "DJ: The Dog Who Rescued Me" was published by Turn the Page Publishing in 2013. Toussaint wrote, produced and directed a one-act play, ''Backstage Bitches'', which ran for two consecutive summers in [[New York City]] (1998–1999). The play starred a young Jake Robards, son of [[Jason Robards]], in his professional acting debut. Toussaint acted in the 2008 film ''Dissonance''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Diminishment''' is the legal process by which the [[United States Congress]] can reduce the size of an [[Indian reservation]].

==History==
In 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Solem v. Bartlett]]'', 465 U.S. 463 (1984), that "only Congress may diminish the boundaries of an Indian reservation, and its intent to do so must be clear."&lt;ref name="slipopinion"&gt;''Nebraska v. Parker'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1406_6536.pdf No. 14–1406], 577 U.S. ____ (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; This was noted in the Court's 2016 case ''[[Nebraska v. Parker]]'', 577 U.S. ___ (2016), in which the Court held that an 1882 Act passed by Congress did not diminish the [[Omaha Reservation]].

The ''Solem'' case established a "diminishment doctrine" that U.S. courts could use when evaluating whether diminishment had taken place.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/enrd/solem-v-bartlett Solem V. Bartlett | ENRD | Department of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 case ''[[Hagen v. Utah]]'', 510 U.S. 399 (1994), the Supreme Court held that Congress's 1902 Act had diminished the [[Uintah Reservation]].&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-6281.ZS.html Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.S. 399 (1994).]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court applied its doctrine established in the ''Solem'' case.

==Notes==
Diminishment commonly refers to the reduction in size of a reservation. A finding of diminishment generally suggests that a discrete, easily identifiable parcel of land has been removed from reservation status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BIRKHOLD|first1=MATTHEW H.|title=JUDGING "INDIAN CHARACTER"?

'''Europe–Democracy–Esperanto''' ('''EDE''', '''E–D–E''', or '''E° D° E°'''; [[Esperanto]]: ''Eŭropo–Demokratio–Esperanto'') is an [[electoral list]], which participates in the [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. The party's main platform is the introduction of Esperanto as the official language of the [[European Union|EU]] in order to make international communication more efficient and fair in economical and philosophical terms, based on the conclusions of a report by [[François Grin]].

As Europe–Démocratie–Espéranto, the party first took part in an election in the [[European Parliament election, 2004]], in [[France]]. Its German branch, Europa–Demokratie–Esperanto, failed to gather the 4000 signatures necessary to participate in the elections in [[Germany]].

The list's main goal is the promotion of Esperanto in the EU. In the medium term, it wants Esperanto taught in schools Europe-wide, and in the long term, it wants the EU to adopt Esperanto as its [[official language]]. In order to make this goal a reality, the EDE is striving to have list candidates in each country in the EU for the [[European Parliament election, 2009]]. Until now the organisation has only had branch offices in France and Germany.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Debate within Esperanto movement==
{{Esperanto sidebar}}

While most Esperanto institutions such as [[Universala Esperanto-Asocio]] are by statute and in practice politically neutral, some discussion about the neutrality of EDE &lt;ref name="Politika agado por Esperanto"&gt;[http://www.u-matthias.de/verein/ede_eo.htm Politika agado por Esperanto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has arisen. Specifically, there is concern over what other policies might through EDE be linked with Esperanto other than the advancement of Esperanto itself. German Esperanto writer Ulrich Matthias argues that in gaining broad support in Germany at least, EDE would be best served to identify with centrist positions advancing [[humanism]], [[peace]] and [[environmentalism]], as well as opposing "U.S. hegemony" and [[linguistic imperialism]] in the correct fashion.&lt;ref name="Politika agado por Esperanto"/&gt;

Because Esperanto is considered by many Esperanto speakers to be a worldwide movement, some fear that advancing the cause of Esperanto within the EU could cast the language as a European issue and hamper the progress of the language outside of Europe.

== 2004 Election results==
The party did not set out to have a referendum on languages — instead, the EDE tries to set up Esperanto as an alternative to the twenty different official languages of the European Union, which leads enormous expenses. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The 2004 parliamentary election broke records for the number of parties participating, and the EDE became something of a [[poster child]] for protest parties, being picked out by national papers as an example of the ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;"Des antiradars aux espérantistes; EUROPÉENNES La pléthore des petites listes."

'''Formwork''' is temporary or permanent [[Molding (process)|molds]] into which [[concrete]] or similar materials are poured. In the context of concrete construction, the [[falsework]] supports the '''shuttering''' molds.&lt;ref&gt; https://theconstructor.org/building/formwork-shuttering/types-of-formwork-shuttering/3767/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Formwork and concrete form types==
Formwork comes in several types: 
#''Traditional timber formwork''. The formwork is built on site out of [[timber]] and [[plywood]] or moisture-resistant [[particleboard]]. It is easy to produce but time-consuming for larger structures, and the plywood facing has a relatively short lifespan. It is still used extensively where the labour costs are lower than the costs for procuring reusable formwork. It is also the most flexible type of formwork, so even where other systems are in use, complicated sections may use it.
#''Engineered Formwork System''. This formwork is built out of prefabricated modules with a metal frame (usually steel or [[aluminium]]) and covered on the application ([[concrete]]) side with material having the wanted surface structure (steel, [[aluminum]], timber, etc.). The two major advantages of formwork systems, compared to traditional timber formwork, are speed of construction (modular systems pin, clip, or screw together quickly) and lower life-cycle costs (barring major force, the frame is almost indestructible, while the covering if made of wood; may have to be replaced after a few - or a few dozen - uses, but if the covering is made with steel or aluminium the form can achieve up to two thousand uses depending on care and the applications).
#''Re-usable plastic formwork''. These [[interlocking]] and modular systems are used to build widely variable, but relatively simple, concrete structures. The panels are lightweight and very robust. They are especially suited for similar structure projects and low-cost, mass housing schemes. To get an added layer of protection against destructive weather, galvanized roofs will help by eliminating the risk of corrosion and rust. These types of modular enclosures can have load-bearing roofs to maximize space by stacking on top of one another. They can either be mounted on an existing roof, or constructed without a floor and lifted onto existing enclosures using a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://speedspace.org/equipment-pump-enclosures/|title=Prefabricated Pump Houses &amp; Equipment Enclosures - Speed Space|work=Speed Space|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Permanent Insulated Formwork''.  This formwork is assembled on site, usually out of insulating concrete forms (ICF). The formwork stays in place after the concrete has cured, and may provide advantages in terms of speed, strength, superior [[thermal]] and [[acoustics|acoustic]] insulation, space to run utilities within the EPS layer, and integrated furring strip for cladding finishes.
#''Stay-In-Place structural formwork systems''. This formwork is assembled on site, usually out of prefabricated [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] forms. These are in the shape of hollow tubes, and are usually used for columns and [[pier]]s. The formwork stays in place after the concrete has cured and acts as axial and [[Shear stress|shear]] reinforcement, as well as serving to confine the concrete and prevent against environmental effects, such as [[corrosion]] and [[freeze-thaw]] cycles.
# ''Flexible formwork''. In contrast to the rigid moulds described above, flexible formwork is a system that uses lightweight, high strength sheets of fabric to take advantage of the fluidity of concrete and create highly optimised, architecturally interesting, building forms. Using flexible formwork it is possible to cast optimised structures that use significantly less concrete than an equivalent strength prismatic section,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, J. J., Darby, A. P., Ibell, T. J., Evernden, M. C. and Otlet, M., 2011. Concrete structures using fabric formwork. The Structural Engineer, 89 (8), pp. 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby offering the potential for significant embodied energy savings in new concrete structures.

==Slab formwork (deck formwork)==

[[File:Steel and Plywood Formwork.jpg|thumb|Steel and plywood formwork for poured in place concrete foundation]]

===History===
Some of the earliest examples of concrete slabs were built by Roman engineers. Because concrete is quite strong in resisting [[compression (physical)|compressive loads]], but has relatively poor [[Tensile stress|tensile]] or [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] strength, these early structures consisted of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[dome]]s. The most notable concrete structure from this period is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. To mould this structure, temporary [[scaffold]]ing and formwork or [[falsework]] was built in the future shape of the structure. These building techniques were not isolated to pouring concrete, but were and are widely used in [[masonry]]. Because of the complexity and the limited production capacity of the building material, concrete’s rise as a favored building material did not occur until the invention of [[Portland cement]] (and developments by the [[Edison Portland Cement Company]]) and [[reinforced concrete]].

===Timber beam slab formwork===
Similar to the traditional method, but [[stringer (woodworking)|stringer]]s and joist are replaced with [[engineered wood]] beams and supports are replaced with adjustable metal props. This makes this method more systematic and reusable.

===Traditional slab formwork===
[[File:Formwork.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional timber formwork on a jetty in [[Bangkok]]]]
On the dawn of the rival of concrete in slab structures, building techniques for the temporary structures were derived again from [[masonry]] and [[carpentry]]. The traditional slab formwork technique consists of supports out of lumber or young tree trunks, that support rows of stringers assembled roughly 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;feet or 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;metres apart, depending on thickness of slab. Between these stringers, joists are positioned roughly 12&amp;nbsp;inches, 30&amp;nbsp;centimeters apart upon which boards or [[plywood]] are placed. The stringers and joists are usually 4 by 4&amp;nbsp;inch or 4 by 6&amp;nbsp;inch lumber. The most common imperial plywood thickness is ¾ inch and the most common metric thickness is 18&amp;nbsp;mm.

===Metal beam slab formwork ===
Similar to the traditional method, but stringers and joist are replaced with [[aluminium]] forming systems or steel beams and supports are replaced with metal props. This also makes this method more systematic and reusable.  Aluminum beams are fabricated as telescoping units which allows them to span supports that are located at varying distances apart.  Telescoping aluminium beams can be used and reused in the construction of structures of varying size.

[[File:WTF Formwork.jpg|thumb|left|Hand setting modular aluminum deck formwork]]
[[File:Concrete Formwork.JPG|thumb|Handset modular aluminum formwork]]

===Modular slab formwork===
These systems consist of prefabricated timber, steel or aluminum beams and formwork modules. Modules are often no larger than 3 to 6 feet or 1 to 2 metres in size. The beams and formwork are typically set by hand and pinned, clipped, or screwed together. The advantages of a modular system are: does not require a crane to place the formwork, speed of construction with unskilled labor, formwork modules can be removed after concrete sets leaving only beams in place prior to achieving design strength.

===Table or flying form systems===

These systems consist of slab formwork "tables" that are reused on multiple stories of a building without being dismantled. The assembled sections are either lifted per elevator or "flown" by crane from one story to the next. Once in position the gaps between the tables or table and wall are filled with "fillers". They vary in shape and size as well as their building material. The use of these systems can greatly reduce the time and manual labor involved in setting and striking the formwork. Their advantages are best utilized by large area and simple structures. It is also common for architects and engineers to design building around one of these systems.
[[File:Large Flying formwork tables.JPG|thumb|Flying formwork tables with aluminium and timber joists. The tables are supported by shoes attached to previously poured columns and walls]]

====Structure====
A table is built pretty much the same way as a beam formwork but the single parts of this system are connected together in a way that makes them transportable. The most common sheathing is [[plywood]], but steel and [[fiberglass]] are also in use. The joists are either made from timber, wood I-beams, aluminium or steel. The stringers are sometimes made of wood I-beams but usually from steel channels. These are fastened together (screwed, weld or bolted) to become a "deck". These decks are usually rectangular but can also be other shapes.

====Support====
All support systems have to be height adjustable to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum [[truss]]es. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether.  In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors.

====Size====
The size of these tables can vary from {{convert|70|to|1500|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. There are two general approaches in this system:
#Crane handled: this approach consists of assembling or producing the tables with a large formwork area that can only be moved up a level by crane.  Typical widths can be 15, 18 or 20&amp;nbsp;feet, or 5 to 7&amp;nbsp;metres, but their width can be limited, so that it is possible to transport them assembled, without having to pay for an oversize load.  The length might vary and can be up to 100&amp;nbsp;feet (or more) depending on the crane capacity.  After the [[concrete]] is [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]], the [[concrete slab|deck]]s are lowered and moved with rollers or [[Flatbed trolley|trolley]]s to the edge of the building.  From then on the protruding side of the table is lifted by crane while the rest of the table is rolled out of the building. After the [[centre of gravity]] is outside of the building the table is attached to another [[Crane (machine)|crane]] and flown to the next level or position.

This technique is fairly common in the United States and east Asian countries. The advantages of this approach are the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique. The disadvantages of this approach are the necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility.

[[File:Slab Formwork Tables.JPG|thumb|Formwork tables in use at a building site with more complicated structural features]]

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crane fork or elevator handled:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
By this approach the tables are limited in size and weight. Typical widths are between {{convert|6|and|10|ft|m|1}}, typical lengths are between {{convert|12|and|20|ft|m|1}}, though table sizes may vary in size and form. The major distinction of this approach is that the tables are lifted either with a crane transport fork or by material platform elevators attached to the side of the building. They are usually transported horizontally to the elevator or crane lifting platform singlehandedly with shifting trolleys depending on their size and construction.  Final positioning adjustments can be made by trolley. This technique enjoys popularity in the US, Europe and generally in high labor cost countries. The advantages of this approach in comparison to beam formwork or modular formwork is a further reduction of labor time and cost. Smaller tables are generally easier to customize around geometrically complicated buildings, (round or non rectangular) or to form around columns in comparison to their large counterparts. The disadvantages of this approach are the higher material costs and increased crane time (if lifted with crane fork).

===Tunnel forms===
Tunnel forms are large, room size forms that allows walls and floors to be cast in a single pour. With multiple forms, the entire floor of a building can be done in a single pour.  Tunnel forms require sufficient space exterior to the building for the entire form to be slipped out and hoisted up to the next level. A section of the walls is left uncasted to remove the forms. Typically castings are done with a frequency of 4 days.  Tunnel forms are most suited for buildings that have the same or similar cells to allow re-use of the forms within the floor and from one floor to the next, in regions which have high labor prices.

==Flexible formwork==
There is an increasing focus on sustainability in design, backed up by carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets. The low embodied energy of concrete by volume is offset by its rate of consumption which make the manufacture of cement accountable for some 5% of global CO2 emissions.&lt;ref&gt;WRI (2005) Carbon Dioxide Emissions by Source 2005. Earthtrends Data Tables: Climate and Atmosphere, Available online&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete is a fluid that offers the opportunity to economically create structures of almost any geometry - we can pour concrete into a mould of almost any shape. This fluidity is seldom utilise, with concrete instead being poured into rigid moulds to create high material use structures with large carbon footprints. The ubiquitous use of orthogonal moulds as concrete formwork has resulted in a well-established vocabulary of prismatic forms for concrete structures, yet such rigid formwork systems must resist considerable pressures and consume significant amounts of material. Moreover, the resulting member requires more material and has a greater self-weight than one cast with a variable cross section.

Simple optimisation methods&lt;ref&gt;Orr JJ, Darby AP, Ibell TJ, et al (2011) Concrete structures using fabric formwork. The Structural Engineer 89(8): 20-26. http://opus.bath.ac.uk/23588/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kostova K, Ibell T, Darby AP and Evernden M (2012) Advanced composite reinforcement for fabric formed structural elements. In Second International Conference on Flexible Formwork (Orr JJ, Darby AP, Evernden M and Ibell T. (eds)). University of Bath, Bath, UK. www.icff2012.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garbett J, Darby AP and Ibell TJ (2010) Optimised beam design using innovative fabric-formed concrete. Advances in Structural Engineering 13(5): 849-860.&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to design a variable cross section member in which the flexural and shear capacity at any point along the element length reflects the requirements of the loading envelope applied to it.

By replacing conventional moulds with a flexible system composed primarily of low cost fabric sheets, flexible formwork takes advantage of the fluidity of concrete to create highly optimised, architecturally interesting, building forms. Significant material savings can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Orr JJ, Darby AP, Ibell TJ and Evernden M (2012a) Optimisation and durability in fabric cast 'Double T' beams. In The Second International Conference on Flexible Formwork (Orr JJ, Darby AP, Evernden M and Ibell T. (eds)). University of Bath, Bath, UK http://opus.bath.ac.uk/30078/&lt;/ref&gt; The optimised section provides ultimate limit state capacity while reducing embodied carbon, thus improving the life cycle performance of the entire structure.

Control of the flexibly formed beam cross section is key to achieving low-material use design. The basic assumption is that a sheet of flexible, permeable fabric is held in a system of falsework before reinforcement and concrete are added. By varying the geometry of the fabric mould with distance along the beam, the optimised shape is created. Flexible formwork therefore has the potential to facilitate the change in design and construction philosophy that will be required for a move towards a less material intensive, more sustainable, construction industry. Its potential is further demonstrated in work by Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, DSH (2010) Study of construction methodology and structural behaviour of fabric formed form-efficient reinforced concrete beam. PhD Thesis, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabric formwork is a small niche in concrete technology. It uses soft, flexible materials against the fresh concrete as formwork, normally with some sort of strong tension textile or plastic material. The International Society of Fabric Forming conducts research on fabric formwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabricforming.org/PAPERS.html|title=Research papers|website=www.fabricforming.org|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cassette formwork ==
Due to its ease of use, cassette laying formwork creates a supreme output{{clarify|date=May 2018}}. Since there is no need for a crane, the materials needed are just assemblies of parts that people can carry which means there is lower amounts of personnel, labor hours, and quick turnaround times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portisan.com/cassette-slab-formwork.html|title=Cassette Slab Formwork|website=www.portisan.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
For removable forms, once the concrete has been poured into formwork and has set (or ''cured''), the formwork is ''struck'' or ''stripped'' (removed) to expose the finished concrete. The time between pouring and formwork stripping depends on the job specifications, the cure required, and whether the form is supporting any weight, but is usually at least 24 hours after the pour is completed. For example, the [[California Department of Transportation]] requires the forms to be in place for 1–7 days after pouring,&lt;ref&gt;[Section 90-7] from the [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] Standard Specifications, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while the Washington State Department of Transportation requires the forms to stay in place for 3&amp;nbsp;days with a damp blanket on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;[Section 6-02.3(11)] from the [[Washington State Department of Transportation|WSDOT]] Standard Specifications, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mexico formwork.jpg|thumb|left|Formwork stripped exposing the set concrete]]

Spectacular accidents have occurred when the forms were either removed too soon or had been under-designed to carry the load imposed by the weight of the uncured concrete. Less critical and much more common (though no less embarrassing and often costly) are those cases in which under-designed formwork bends or breaks during the filling process (especially if filled with a high-pressure concrete pump). This then results in fresh concrete escaping out of the formwork in a ''form blowout'', often in large quantities.

Concrete exerts less pressure against the forms as it hardens, so forms are usually designed to withstand a number of feet per hour of pour rate to give the concrete at the bottom time to firm up. For example, wall or column forms are commonly designed for a pour rate between 4–8&amp;nbsp;ft/hr.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The hardening is an [[asymptotic]] process, meaning that most of the final strength will be achieved after a short time, though some further hardening can occur depending on the cement type and admixtures.

Wet concrete also applies [[hydrostatic]] pressure to formwork. The pressure at the bottom of the form is therefore greater than at the top. In the illustration of the column formwork to the right, the 'column clamps' are closer together at the bottom. Note that the column is braced with steel adjustable 'formwork props' and uses 20&amp;nbsp;mm 'through bolts' to further support the long side of the column.

'''Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Jr.''' (May 7, 1874 – December 20, 1943) was a [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] politician, historian, and educator. He was the last official interpreter of the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii|Hawaii Supreme Court]] during the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and was the first professor of [[Hawaiian language]] at the [[University of Hawaii]].

==Biography==
He was born on May 7, 1874, in Honolulu, the son of [[Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Sr.]] and [[Emma Kaili Metcalf Beckley Nakuina|Emma Kaili Metcalf]]. He was descended from chiefly lineages from both his parents, and his ancestors included High Chief [[Hoolulu|Hoʻolulu]] and Captain [[George Charles Beckley]], both advisors of King [[Kamehameha I]].

It may arise in association with [[personality disorder]]s or it may occur in people who do not have any detectable illness. In fact, surveys have shown that the majority of people have had homicidal fantasies at some stage in their life.&lt;ref name="JDuntley" /&gt; Many theories have been proposed to explain this.&lt;ref name="JDuntley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InnateMind"&gt;{{cite book

==Assessment / diagnostic issues==

===Violence risk===
Homicidal ideation is noted to be an important risk factor when trying to identify a person's risk for [[violence]]. This type of assessment is routine for psychiatric patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/Med/topic3358.htm |title=History and Mental Status Examination |author=Brannon, Guy E. |date=February 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any other patients presenting to hospital with mental health complaints. There are many associated risk factors which include: history of violence and any thoughts of committing harm, poor impulse control and an inability to [[Deferred gratification|delay gratification]], impairment or loss of reality testing, especially with [[delusion]]al beliefs or command [[hallucination]]s, the feeling of being controlled by an outside force, the belief that other people wish to harm him or her, the perception of [[Social rejection|rejection]] or [[humiliation]] at the hands of others,&lt;ref name="PsychServ" /&gt; being under the [[Substance intoxication|influence]] of substances or a history of [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[frontal lobe]] dysfunction or [[head injury]].

===Associated psychopathology===
People who have homicidal ideation are at higher risk of other [[mental disorder|psychopathology]] than the normal population. This includes [[suicidal ideation]], [[psychosis]], [[delirium]], or intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Homicidal ideation may arise in relation to behavioural conditions such as [[personality disorder]] (particularly [[conduct disorder]], [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]]). A study in Finland showed an increased risk of violence from people who have antisocial personality disorder, which is greater than the risk of violence from people who have schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Homicidal ideation may arise in people who are otherwise quite well,&lt;ref name="PsychServ" /&gt; as is demonstrated by the fact that the greater majority of people within the general population have had homicidal fantasies. When triggering factors are sought regarding homicidal fantasies the majority seem to be linked in some way to the disruption of a couple relationship. Either [[jealousy]] or [[revenge]], greed/[[lust]] or even [[fear]] and [[self-defense]] prompt homicidal thoughts and actions in the majority of cases.&lt;ref name="DBuss"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 1-59420-043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a minority of cases, homicides and acts of violence may be related to [[mental disorder]]. These homicides and fantasies do not seem to have the same underlying triggers as those by people without a mental disorder, but when these trigger factors are present the risk for violence is greater than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who present with homicidal ideation also have a higher risk of suicide. This shows the need for an assessment of suicide risk in people with thoughts of violence towards others.&lt;ref name="PsychServ" /&gt;

===Spurious and fictitious homicidal ideation===
Sometimes people claiming to have homicidal ideation do not actually have homicidal thoughts but merely claim to have them. They may do this for a variety of reasons, e.g. to gain attention, to coerce a person or people for or against some action, or to avoid social or legal obligation (sometimes by gaining admission to a hospital) — see [[malingering]] or [[factitious disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Theories==

A number of [[Theory|theories]] have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of homicidal ideation or [[homicide]] itself.&lt;ref name="InnateMind" /&gt; Many of these theories seem to overlap. They often are not mutually exclusive. At present no single theory explains all the phenomena noted in homicide, although many theories go some way to explaining several areas. Most of these theories follow the reasoning of theories studied in [[criminology]]. A brief synopsis of theories specific to homicide follows.

===Homicide adaptation===
This is the most recent of evolutionary theories. It claims to explain most of the phenomena associated with homicide. It states that humans have evolved with adaptations that enable us to think of and/or plan homicide. We come up with the idea as a possible answer to our problem position (threat to ourselves, our mate or our resources) and include a range of thought processes regarding killer and victim (degree of relatedness, relative status, gender, reproductive values, size and strength of families, allies and resources) and the potential costs of making use of such a high penalty strategy as homicide. If homicide is determined to be the best solution strategy, then it might be functional.&lt;ref name="JDuntley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DBuss" /&gt;

===By-product hypothesis ("slip up")===
According to this hypothesis, homicide is considered to be a mistake or over-reaction. Normal psychological mechanisms for control of property, partner or personal safety may not appear to be sufficient under certain stressful circumstances and abnormal mechanisms develop. Particularly extreme expressions of this may occur leading to homicide where in the normal state the perpetrator would not behave in this manner.&lt;ref name="InnateMind" /&gt;

==Management==
Not much information is available regarding the management of patients with homicidal thoughts. In Western countries, the management of such people lies within the realms of the police force and the health system. It is generally agreed upon that people with homicidal thoughts who are thought to be at high risk of acting them out should be recognized as needing help. They should be brought swiftly to a place where an assessment can be made and any underlying medical or mental disorder should be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In terms of research methods, interactional sociolinguists analyze [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] or [[Video|video recordings]] of [[conversation]]s or other interactions. Analysis focuses not only on linguistic forms such as [[word]]s and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s but also on subtle cues such as [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] that signal contextual [[presupposition]]. These [[contextualization (sociolinguistics)|contextualization]] cues are culturally specific and usually unconscious. When participants in a conversation come from different cultural backgrounds they may not recognize these subtle cues in one another's speech, leading to misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=Gumperz/&gt;

'''Ishkashimi''' (Ishkashimi: ''škošmī zəvuk/rənīzəvuk'') &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskasemi-language|title=EŠKĀŠ(E)MĪ|last=Steblin-Kamensky|first=I.M.|date=1998|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] spoken in the [[Badakhshan Province]] in [[Afghanistan]], [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in [[Tajikistan]], and [[Chitral]] region of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The total number of speakers is c. 2,500, most of whom are now dispersed throughout Tajikistan and Afghanistan and small villages within the vicinity. Based on this number, Ishkashimi is threatened to becoming critically endangered or extinct in the next 100 years whereas other significant languages are being spoken in schools, homes, etc. These languages are Tajik language in [[Tajikistan]] and [[Dari language]] in Afghanistan, and they contribute to the decline in the use of Ishkashimi, which at the moment has a status of endangered language. Besides, information about Ishkashimi language is limited due to the lack of extensive and systematic research and the lack of a written system.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2471720/Dodykhudoeva_L.R._Ivanov_V.B._Language_immersion_in_endangered_Pamiri_communities_History_and_Language_interrelations_in_Endangered_languages_and_history_proceedings_of_the_conference_FEL_XIII_24-26_September_2009_Khorog_Tajikistan|title=Data Elicitation in Endangered Pamiri communities: Interdependence of Language and History|last=Dodykhudoeva|first=Leila|date=|website=academia.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishkashimi is closely related to [[Zebaki]] and [[Sanglechi]] dialects (in [[Afghanistan]]). It was grouped until recently with the Sanglechi dialect under the parent family [[Sanglechi-Ishkashimi language|Sanglechi-Ishkashimi]] (sgl), but a more comprehensive linguistic analysis showed significant differences between these speech varieties.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sang1343|title=Ishkashimi|last=|first=|date=|website=Glottolog|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonology and grammar of Ishkashimi language is similar to phonology and grammar of the closely related Zebaki dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grierson|first=George Abraham|year=1921|title=Specimens of Languages of the Eranian Family: Compiled and Edited by George Abraham Grierson|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.107145|journal=Superintendent Government Printing|volume=10|pages=505–508|via=Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Ishkashimi language has approximately 2500 speakers, of which 1500 speakers are in the Ishkashim and Wakham districts and a variety of villages in the [[Badakhshan Province]] in [[Afghanistan]], and 1000 speakers are in the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in [[Tajikistan]], Ryn and Sumjin villages, and the [[Ishkoshim, Tajikistan|Ishkoshim]] town, and some inhabit the Chitral region of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/isk|title=Ishkashimi|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Ishkashimi is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] of the [[Indo-European Languages|Indo-European family]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Originally Ishkashimi was considered to belong to the Sanglechi-Ishkashimi family of [[Eastern Iranian languages]]. But recent research showed that such a combination was inappropriate for these dialects due to the significant linguistic differences between them. And on January 18, 2010 the parent language had retired and been split into what are now [[Sanglechi language|Sanglechi]] and Ishkashimi dialects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This subfamily has furthermore been considered a part of the [[Pamir languages]] group, together with the [[Wakhi language]], and of the subgroup comprising [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Rushani]], [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], [[Yazgulyam language|Yazgulyam]], etc. However, this is an areal rather than genetic grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7au4-y3Q-AC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;focus=viewport#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Iranian Languages|last=Windfuhr|first=Gernot|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135797034|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official status ===
Ishkashimi is a threatened language that does not have a status of official language in the regions of its use.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Language domain ===
The Ishkashimi language vitality, despite the positive attitudes towards the language, is declining due to increasing use by native speakers of other languages like Dari in Afghanistan and [[Tajik language|Tajik]] in Tajikistan in a variety of domains, such as education, religious, private domain and others.&lt;ref name="Beck2"&gt;Beck, Simone. [http://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/1/article/399?htmlOnce=yes#2.2 The Effect of Accessibility on Language Vitality: The Ishkashimi and the Sanglechi Speech Varieties in Afghanistan]. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, due to Dari being the language of the education system, almost all Ishkashimi speakers, and especially the younger ones, have high Dari proficiency.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt; Education can get complicated with the use of two languages, therefore schools prefer to use Dari. Instructions are solely in Dari, but rarely will teachers speak Ishkashimi to students for explanations. Similar to schools, religion is widely practiced with Dari especially for preaching and prayers, and when it comes to mass media and the government, Dari is exclusively used.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt; Meanwhile, in the private and community domains both Dari and Ishkashimi languages are used equally.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt; In Tajikistan areas Ishkashimi is a first choice for communication between family members and in private conversations between friends and coworkers, however the use of Tajik and Wakhi languages in other domains leads to decline in Ishkashimi use.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;  There is an understanding in the Ishkashimi speaking community that the language can face a possible extinction because of its limited use .&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt;

== Dialects/Varieties ==
There is an Afghan and Tajik Ishkashimi varieties of Ishkashimi language, and they are considered to be mutually comprehensible, as some sociolinguistic questionnaires demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
There are seven vowel phonemes: a, e, i, o, u, u, and ə &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Special features ===
Ishkashimi, as one of the Pamir languages, does not contain velar fricative phonemes, which is possibly the result of being influenced by Persian and Indo-Aryan languages throughout the history of  its development. Also the use of the consonant [h] in the language is optional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Stress ===
There are many exceptions, but as a rule stress falls on the last syllable in a word with multiple syllables. Sometimes, as a result of the rhythm in the phrase, the stress will freely move to syllables other than the last syllable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==

=== Morphology ===
* Grammatical gender is not used.
* There is no variation between adjectives and no distinction in number.
* The expression of comparatives and superlatives is done through syntax and adverbial modifiers, while pre- and postpositions and suffixes are used for case relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Syntax ===
The word order in Ishkashimi is [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] (Subject–object–verb), however the order can be influenced by the varieties of the information structure in the sentences.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karvovskaya|first=Elena|date=2015|title=‘Also’ in Ishkashimi: additive particle and sentence connector.|url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/sl.39.3.07kar/details|journal=Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure|volume=17|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==

=== Borrowed words ===
A significant part of Ishkashimi vocabulary contains words and syntactic structures that were borrowed from other languages, the reason behind it is a regular and close contact of Ishkashimi speakers with other languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, the history of the focus particle "Faqat" (Eng: ''only'') shows that it was borrowed from Persian language, which was earlier borrowed by Persian from Arabic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Taboo words ===
[[Word taboo|Taboo words]] were formed and added into Ishkashimi language as a result of use of ancient epithets and of derivation of the words from other languages, often followed by the change of their meaning and pronunciation. Some of the taboo Ishkashimi words, which are also similarly seen as taboo in other [[Pamir languages]], are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_WhLdCr3UEC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=language+in+time+and+space+bauer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LahurfQhDk&amp;sig=_mWsbADJMnOxkIGYbGKOhXwhqK0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4j8inzM_TAhUJMyYKHVwYCgIQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20in%20time%20and%20space%20bauer&amp;f=false|title=Language in Time and Space: A Festschrift for Werner Winter on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday|last=Bauer|first=Brigitte L.

* Sabilik - for wolf
* Urvesok - for fox
* Si - for hare
* Purk - for mouse/rat

== Writing system ==
Ishkashimi is a non-written language that does not have a writing system or literature, and in the previous centuries the [[Persian language]], which dominated the region, was used to write down some of the traditional folklore.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt; There were, however, some efforts made at the end of the twentieth century to implement a writing system based on [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]].&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt;

=== Written sources ===
The first attempts by linguists to collect and organize data about the Ishkashimi language were made around the beginning of the 19th century, and were later continued by Russian and Ishkashimi linguists, like T. Pakhalina.&lt;ref name="Ishkashimi: a father's language"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tiessen, C., Abbess, E., Müller, K., Paul, D., Tiessen, G.,|title=Ishkashimi: a father's language|url=https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/9082|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 February 2017|location=Tajikistan|page=3|format=Survey report|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before any systematic description and documentation of Ishkashimi language, the researchers collected some random vocabulary examples and mentioned the language in the works about Iranian languages.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt;  Only in the end of the twentieth century linguists created a more comprehensive description of Ishkashimi language.&lt;ref name="Beck2" /&gt;

==Personal life==
===Early life===

Jim Goad was born June 12, 1961, in [[Ridley Park, Pennsylvania]]. Growing up in [[Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania]], Goad described himself as a teenager who was a loner, [[misanthropic]] and a weirdo. He attended a [[Catholic]] school, and experienced violent treatment by the [[nuns]] and his father, eventually learning to fight back. As a teenager he wanted to move to New York City to study acting and was accepted to study at [[New York University]] under [[Stella Adler]].&lt;ref name="NYPress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-6057-jim-goad-is-a-bad-man.html |title=Jim Goad is a Bad Man |author=[[John Strausbaugh]] |date=2 July 2002 |work=[[New York Press]] |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205031547/http://www.nypress.com/article-6057-jim-goad-is-a-bad-man.html |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s–90s===

Goad graduated in 1985 with a [[B.A.]] in Journalism from [[Temple University]] while living in New Jersey.&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NNDB"/&gt; In the early 1980s Goad met [[Debbie Goad|Debbie Rosalie]] at a [[Johnny Thunders]] concert in New York City. Debbie was eight years older than Goad, Jewish and lived in [[Coney Island]].&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt; The couple lived in New York and Debbie worked at the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] and Goad at a [[Lower East Side]] print shop.&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt; The couple left New York suddenly after Goad beat up their [[Brighton Beach]] landlord for calling Debbie "stupid". The landlord filed, and then dropped, assault charges, but the Goads would not return to New York, settling in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; The couple married in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in 1987. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Goad started working at the ''[[Los Angeles Reader]]'', covering local news, and freelancing for ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine. Goad was unhappy with the content he was covering, and wishing to cover more fringe subjects the couple began publishing their own work.&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt;

Around 1994 the couple moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] and Goad devoted his time to writing.&lt;ref name="Bizarre1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/books/100/jim_goad.html|title='Why are you so fucking stupid?'|first=|date=|publisher=[[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111004/http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/books/100/jim_goad.html|archive-date=4 March 2007|dead-url=|author=|work=Books|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debbie would be diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] while Goad was dating&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt; ''ANSWER Me!'' [[groupie]] Anne "Skye" Ryan.&lt;ref name="PXLife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=12327 |title=Citizen Goad |author=Joseph Gallivan |date=30 Oct 2009 |work=Entertainment |publisher=Portland Life |accessdate=3 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132618/http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=12327 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goad described Ryan as "Sweet Dracula girl" and as being "...fifteen years younger than me and a thousand times more fucked-up."&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote="I'll hit anyone who's seriously threatening my life... that's what happened, and that's what sent me to prison."&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;—Jim Goad, 2002&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt;|width=25%|align=left}}

Goad and Ryan would have a physically abusive relationship, often beating one another up. They fought in public and were arrested and released.&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; In November 1997, Debbie filed a restraining order against Goad, claiming he was beating her on a daily basis, eventually withdrawing it, stating she was "bullied into" filing it and was mad at Goad for having an affair with Ryan.&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt; Ryan eventually threatened to kill Goad, and he took out a [[restraining order]] against her.&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; Goad and Debbie would divorce in 1997.&lt;ref name="NNDB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/697/000025622/ |title=Jim Goad |year=2011 |work= |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1998&lt;ref name="LLC1999"/&gt; the two had another confrontation with a fight in Goad's car outside of Portland. Goad left Ryan by the side of the road, fled to [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt; and was charged with assault and [[kidnapping]], totaling 25 years in prison. While Goad served 7 1/2 months of pretrial prison time, Ryan befriended a dying Debbie. The two heavily publicized their relationships with Goad, who would eventually [[cop a plea]]. Ryan would go on to serve a couple of months in prison on her own unrelated assault charges. When asked if he had any [[remorse]] or guilt about beating Ryan, Goad said, "Absolutely not. I enjoyed it."&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; Starting in May 1998 he would go on to spend a year in a [[minimum security prison]], after serving in a [[county jail]] and eventually moving into a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]]. Goad served 2 1/5 years, being released in 2002.&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt;

While Goad was in prison, author [[Jim Hogshire]] started a "Free Jim Goad" website, claiming that Goad was innocent and should be released from prison. Goad disagreed with the concept of the website, admitting that he was not innocent regarding his actions.&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt;

===2000s===

Upon his release from prison in 2002, Goad returned to Portland and was on [[parole]] for a time. He wrote for ''Exotic'', a free guide to the [[sex industry]] of the [[Northwestern United States]] and [[DJing]] "hard country with a big bass" at a local bar.&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; In 2008 Goad became a father.&lt;ref name="BigCityRDNK"/&gt; He currently maintains his website, JimGoad.net, and writes for ''[[Taki's Magazine]]''. Goad currently resides in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takimag.com/contributor/JimGoad/205#axzz1ZmXHuGzW |title=Jim Goad |author= |year=2011 |work=Contributors |publisher=[[Taki's Magazine]] |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Writing style and beliefs===

As a writer, Jim Goad has been called the "poster boy for the transgressive school of writing."&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt; Goad utilizes wit and a style of prose described as "machine gun delivery," which reads in a fast paced manner, like "it was written by an angry auctioneer on XTC."&lt;ref name="Parrot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/12/the-last-hipster-jim-goads-the-redneck-manifesto/ |title=The Last Hipster |author=Matt Parrott |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Counter Currents |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck Palahniuk]] describes Goad's writing style as being "brutally honest without worrying about being correct."&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt;

Goad's work examines American culture, often popular and political culture. His early work reads anti-[[politically correct]] and as [[shock value]], while his later work, like the ''Redneck Manifesto,'' and journalism contributions have marked Goad as a political and societal commentator. His political and social views have been called "Proto-Marxist," by book reviewer Matt Parrott, who also described Goad as being "anti-elite."&lt;ref name="Parrot"/&gt; In his political commentary he has described [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] in the United States as "two asscheeks surrounding the same hairy bunghole," and that politicians know how to take advantage of lower- and middle-class people because of a human's innate tribalism.&lt;ref name="HumorisDead"/&gt; He has stated his support for [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/noteconomicallyviable/episodes/2017-07-11T11_01_55-07_00|title=Jim Goad on Why Donald Trump Was REALLY Elected|date=2017-07-12|publisher=Podomatic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''ANSWER Me!''====

{{Main|Answer Me! (magazine)}}
From 1991 to 1994, Goad [[Self-publishing|self-published]] four yearly issues of the zine ''ANSWER Me!'', with then wife Debbie Goad.&lt;ref name="BigCityRDNK"/&gt; It featured illustrations by [[Nick Bougas]]. With a circulation of 13,000 the magazine sought to upset [[politically correct]] thinkers by covering subjects about race and feminism. The publication was banned and seized by customs officials in several countries, and the final ''Rape Issue'', was rejected by some bookstore owners. The zine, called "massively influential" by ''[[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]]'', would also be credited as an inspiration by [[Francisco Martin Duran]], who took 29 shots at the [[White House]],&lt;ref name="Bizarre1"/&gt; influencing the suicides of three British [[Neo-Nazi]]s, and a possible influence on [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide.&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt;

====''The Redneck Manifesto''====
In 1994, Goad signed a two-book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] for $100,000.&lt;ref name="LLC1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=RJ|title=American Psycho|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YG5YubNw1pgC&amp;pg=PA101|accessdate=4 October 2011|edition=15|volume=1|date=January 1999|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|pages=101–109|issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies Hicks and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats'' was published in 1997. The book explores the idea of poor whites celebrating their heritage similar to poor African Americans, and that discrimination in the United States is focused around [[social class]], not [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. His thesis is that the rich elite blind the poor, and cause them to fight one another, instead of working together for their mutual benefit.&lt;ref name="Colorado"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cozine.com/1997-december/the-redneck-manifesto-by-jim-goad/ |title=The Redneck Manifesto by Jim Goad |author=Marcia Darnell |date=December 1997 |work=Rural Life |publisher=Colorado Central |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Shit Magnet''====

''Shit Magnet: One Man's Miraculous Ability to Absorb the World's Guilt'', is Goad's second book. Major New York publishing houses declined to publish ''Shit Magnet'',&lt;ref name="Offend1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.salon.com/2001/06/14/angry_males/ |title=I offend, therefore I am |author=Amy Benfer |year=2001 |work=Paul Shirley |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published in 2002 by [[Feral House]]. The book, written while Goad was in prison, is an [[autobiography]]. It examines Goad's childhood, teenage years, his relationships with former wife Debbie Goad and ex-girlfriend Anne Ryan, and reflections about his time in prison and his experience with the judicial system. The book includes great detail about Oregon prison life, including detailed descriptions about fellow prisoners, of whom he writes "forced sterilization maybe wasn't such a bad idea."&lt;ref name="PXLife"/&gt; Writer [[John Strausbaugh]] described ''Shit Magnet'' as "extremely painful" in detail and comparative in drama to the autobiography of [[Klaus Kinski]].&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; ''Humor is Dead'' calls ''Shit Magnet'' a "sordid and often shocking personal allegory of guilt and violence."&lt;ref name="HumorisDead"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humorisdead.com/news/goad.html |title=An Interview with Jim Goad |author= |year=2003 |work= |publisher=Humor is Dead |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a play titled "Torn Between Two Bitches," was produced in [[Los Angeles]] by Michael Sargent, based on ''Shit Magnet''.&lt;ref name="LAist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laist.com/2008/10/30/torn_between_two_bitches_answer_me_gets_even_more_self-indulgent.php |title=Torn Between Two Bitches @ The Unknown Theater |author=Brian M.

====Other work====

He wrote a [[comic]] called ''Trucker Fags in Denial'', which was originally published as a comic strip in the Portland-based publication ''Exotic'' and was published as a comic book by [[Fantagraphics]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="HumorisDead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SwagRag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-3480-goad_warrior.html |title=Goad Warrior |author=Byron Beck|authorlink=Byron Beck (blogger) |year=2004 |work=Swag Rag |publisher=[[Willamette Week]] |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Jim+Goad/ |title=Jim Goad |author=SG Jaime |year=2005 |work=Interviews |publisher=[[Suicide Girls]] |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic, written by Goad and illustrated by Jim Blanchard, is about two [[trucker]]s named Butch and Petey. The two characters are [[homophobic]] and beat up gays between trucking. The characters contradict their behavior by having a [[homosexual]] relationship with each other. The comic serves as a satirical examination of cultural scapegoating, often seen in Goad's writing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Goad came up with the idea for the comic while in prison, where he frequently observed male prisoners insulting each other as being "fags," and as "fagging off,' despite engaging in homosexual acts themselves while incarcerated.&lt;ref name="SwagRag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; ''[[Willamette Week]]'''s gay columnist [[Byron Beck (blogger)|Byron Beck]] described ''Trucker Fags in Denial'' as "twisted, vile, unrepentant...and absolutely hilarious."&lt;ref name="SwagRag"/&gt;

In 2007, ''Jim Goad's Gigantic Book of Sex'' was published.&lt;ref name="BigCityRDNK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigcityredneck.co.uk/articles/Jim_Goad/86/7/1 |title=Jim Goad |author=Justin Farrington |year=2008 |work=Interviews |publisher=Big City Redneck |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404184004/http://www.bigcityredneck.co.uk/articles/Jim_Goad/86/7/1 |archive-date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book consists of over 100 articles, [[op-ed]]s and facts about [[sex]], all written by Goad.&lt;ref name="MetroTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/arts/story.asp?id=13693 |title=Lust Issues |author=Michael Jackman |year=2009 |work=Lit Up |publisher=Metrotimes |accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Goad writes a weekly column for ''[[Taki's Magazine]]'' and is a writer/producer for Thought Catalog. Goad has also contributed to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt; and ''[[Hustler (magazine)|Hustler]]''.&lt;ref name="HumorisDead"/&gt; In 2013 Goad wrote a foreword to a compilation of issues of the 1990s zine ''Gun Fag Manifesto''. He thanked the editor, Hollister Kopp, in his book ''The Redneck Manifesto''

''The New Church Ladies: The Extremely Uptight World of "Social Justice"'', a collection of essays, was published February 13, 2017 by Obnoxious Books.

==Acting and music==

Jim Goad has released music and performed as Big Red Goad. In 2007 he toured with [[Hank III]].&lt;ref name="Slaughter1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kevinislaughter.com/tag/jim-goad/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085721/http://www.kevinislaughter.com/tag/jim-goad/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title=Hoof Prints – Podcast Episode 2 – Jim Goad |author=Kevin I.

In 2002 Goad acted in ''The Suzy Evans Story'', a film about a police detective who protects a battered woman named Suzy and proceeds to abuse her himself. Goad acknowledges that it was [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]].&lt;ref name="NYPress1"/&gt; The film was never released.&lt;ref name="TheCult"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chuckpalahniuk.net/interviews/authors/jim-goad |title=The Outlaw |author=[[Chuck Palahniuk]] |date=28 Feb 2007 |work= |publisher=The Cult |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jèrriais literature''' is [[literature]] in [[Jèrriais]], the [[Norman language|Norman]] dialect of [[Jersey]] in the [[Channel Islands]].

The literary tradition in [[Jersey]] is traced back to [[Wace]], the 12th century Jersey-born poet, although there is little surviving literature in Jèrriais dating to before the introduction of the first [[printing]] press in Jersey in the 1780s. The first printed Jèrriais appears in the first newspapers at the end of the 18th century, and the earliest identified dated example of printed [[poetry]] is a fragment by Matchi L’Gé (Matthew Le Geyt 1777–1849) dated 1795.

==19th century==

An astonishing boom in competing newspapers and journals throughout the 19th century provided a platform for poets and writers to publish regularly in the [[feuilleton]]s - typically, [[Satire|satirical]] comment on the week’s news, [[Elections in Jersey|elections]], [[Politics of Jersey|politicians]] and notables. Annual [[almanac]]s (up until 1958) reprinted favourite poems and stories that had appeared throughout the year, or specially composed pieces.

The copious [[Dgèrnésiais]] poetry published in [[Guernsey]] by [[George Métivier]] (nicknamed the "Guernsey Burns") from around 1818 inspired similar literary activity in Jersey. The international interest in [[Robert Burns]]'s [[Scots language|Scots]] poetry provided the background to a conscious effort by [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] writers to promote [[vernacular literature]].

[[Matthew Le Geyt]] (1777–1849) was the first poet to publish in Jèrriais following the introduction of printing. The earliest dated piece of his writing comes from 1795. He was from [[Saint Helier|St Helier]] but he must have lived in [[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]] as well where he was a [[Vingtaine|Vingtenier]]. It is suggested that Le Geyt was influenced by the Norman language ''purin'' literature of [[Rouen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, ''Les Falaises de la Hague'', 1991. {{ISBN|2-9505884-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satirical playlets were published in newspapers in the 19th century. ''Élection de St. Martin'', a playlet in Jèrriais and French published in the newspaper ''Le Constitutionnel'' on 24 November 1838, was probably never staged, but rather read in company. Henri Luce Manuel's play in rhyming couplets ''Queur de Femme'' (in modern spelling: ''Tchoeu d'Femme'' - "heart of a woman") of 1861 was published in pamphlet form.

[[File:Sir Robert Pipon Marett.jpg|thumb|left|''Laelius'' - Sir [[Robert Pipon Marett]]]]

The first printed anthology of Jèrriais poetry, ''Rimes Jersiaises'', was published in 1865 by Abraham Mourant. It collected works by Matthew Le Geyt, "Laelius" (Sir [[Robert Pipon Marett]] 1820 - 1884, [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] of Jersey 1880 - 1884), "L." ([[Henri Luce Manuel]]), [[Esther Le Hardy]], and "L'Anmîn Flip" ([[Philippe Asplet]]). Some Dgèrnésiais is also included in the form of mutual tributes in verse between Laelius and [[George Métivier]]. This anthology enjoyed great popularity in continental Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand Lechanteur, ''La Littérature patoise en Normandie'', in ''Dialectes belgo-romans'' vol. XII, 1955&lt;/ref&gt; It included dramatic duologues, which may have been performed at traditional ''veil'yes'' (social neighbourhood gatherings) or read as [[closet drama]]s.

Sir Robert Pipon Marett’s prestige and influence also helped to reinforce the movement towards standardisation of the writing system based on French [[orthography]], a trend which was also helped by the nascent [[Norman language|Norman]] literary revival in the neighbouring [[Cotentin Peninsula|Cotentin]] area of mainland [[Normandy]] where writers, inspired by the example of the Norman writers of Jersey and Guernsey, began their own production of literary works.

[[François-Victor Hugo]] reproduced an extract from Laelius's "La Fille Malade" in his "''La Normandie inconnue''", which spread awareness of Jèrriais literature far beyond Jersey but which overstated Laelius's literary influence in Jersey since Sir Robert Pipon Marett's literary production dwindled as he took on high office. Laelius is the most quoted poet from this period and the most popular in mainland Normandy, most probably because of his familiarity with and fidelity to French classical models, as well as the fact that his writing is generally less satirical than his contemporaries and therefore requires less knowledge of Jersey institutions, events and personalities.

[[File:Augustus Asplet Le Gros.jpg|thumb|''A.A.L.G.'' - [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]]]]

Other influential writers include "A.A.L.G." ([[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]] 1840 - 1877) and "St.-Luorenchais" ([[Philippe Langlois]] 1817 - 1884).

Le Gros was among the first generation to be educated at [[Victoria College, Jersey|Victoria College]], the school founded by the [[States of Jersey]] on the model of English [[public school (England)|public schools]]. Although he trained for the law, he became a farmer by profession, and moved into politics, being elected [[Constable]] of [[Saint Peter, Jersey|St. Peter]] and eventually [[Jurat]]. He was a founder of the [[Société Jersiaise]]. He wrote poetry in [[English language|English]], two volumes of which were published in [[London]] in 1863 and 1868, but was most devoted to poetry in Jèrriais. He edited an annual literary anthology called "''La Nouvelle Année''", dedicated to the Norman literature of Jersey and Guernsey, between 1868 and 1875.

Philippe Langlois came from a [[Saint Lawrence, Jersey|St. Lawrence]] family, hence his pen name. He studied medicine in Paris and Dublin, qualifying as a doctor. He served as Deputy in the [[States of Jersey]] and on 27 June 1876 he was elected [[Jurat]]. He was president of La Société Jersiaise, and started work on a dictionary of Jèrriais - in the ''Glossaire du Patois Jersiais'' published by the Société in 1924 and based partly on Langlois' lexicographic foundations, his poem ''Lé Jèrriais'' was reprinted (from ''La Nouvelle Année'' of 1875) as a frontispiece. This poem describes features of the various dialects of the language around the Island.

[[Philippe Asplet]] (1818–1893) wrote under the name of ''Flip'' or ''L'Anmin Flippe''. He was a Trinity man, although he was born in [[Saint Martin, Jersey|St. Martin]] and died in [[Grouville]]. His spelling shows the typical ''z'' instead of ''th'' that was typical of the now-disappeared Faldouet dialect. He was a [[Centenier]] and often wrote verses on parish elections. His work appeared in the satirical newspaper ''La Voix des Îles'', frequently as captions to caricatures. He was a supporter of [[Victor Hugo]] and the French proscrits, and attacked the decision to force Hugo to leave Jersey. The [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant-Governor]] tried to force Asplet to resign as Centenier because of his links with the proscrits, but L'Anmin Flippe refused and made public the correspondence. He spent a number of years in Paris and was clearly influenced by French poetry.

Jean Sullivan (or John Sullivan, 1813–1899) wrote under the pen-names ''Oméga'' or ''J.S.'' and is the only author known to have claimed to write in the now-disappeared St. Helier dialect, although his spelling is so idiosyncratic that it is difficult to identify which features might be typical of that dialect and which represented his personal fancies. Victor Hugo described him as "un vrai Poëte" (a true poet), although his highly coloured style full of classical allusions and antiquarianism mean that his popularity is restricted nowadays. He was a devoted monarchist, writing many poems on royal subjects, and in 1884 received permission from Buckingham Palace to translate Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]'s ''More leaves from the Highlands'' into Jèrriais. This project, like many others announced by Sullivan, remained unpublished or unfinished.

Esther Le Hardy's three-act play in rhyming couplets ''L'Enchorchelai, ou les très Paires'' (in modern spelling: ''L'Enchorchélé, ou les Trais Paithes'' - "The Bewitched, or the Three Pears") was published in 1880.

==Into the 20th century==

The de Faye sisters, Mathilda (born 1846, who wrote under the [[nom de plume]] ''Georgie'') and Alice (1849–1925, who wrote under the nom de plume ''Livonia''), wrote mostly about the social scene, with an interest in fashion, novelties and social events.

[[File:Bram Bilo 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Some of Philippe Le Sueur Mourant's more popular stories were republished in booklet form after their first appearance in newspapers.]]

[[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]] (1848&amp;ndash;1918) wrote under several pseudonyms. His first great success was with the character ''Bram Bilo'', a self-important but naïve countryside notable. Having eventually killed off his best-known character, in 1911 he launched, under the name of ''Piteur Pain'', a new series of articles in newspapers relating the adventures and opinions of the Pain family, newly moved to [[Saint Helier]] and its [[Anglicization|anglicized]] society and fashionable entertainments. The Bram Bilo stories remained more popular, being reprinted a number of times since. They were also translated into Dgèrnésiais by [[Thomas Alfred Grut|Thomas Grut]] in the 1920s and published in ''La Gazette de Guernesey''. It has also been suggested that the ''Bram Bilo'' stories influenced the writing of the [[Orne]] writer, Octave Maillot.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guernsey Norman French Translations of Thomas Martin: A Linguistic Study of an Unpublished Archive'', Mari C. Jones, Leuven 2008, {{ISBN|978-90-429-2113-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two volumes entitled ''Patois Poems of the Channel Islands'' were published (from 1883) by John Linwood Pitts in Guernsey. They included poems by A.A. Le Gros, Laelius, Philippe Asplet, Philippe Langlois, and Henri Luce Manuel – all with parallel English verse translations.

Jean Picot (1846–1922) was born in St. Helier but of an old Trinity family. A farmer by profession, when an injury forced him into retirement he took up literature. He wrote under the pen name of ''J.P.'', especially for ''La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey'' and its Almanac. He often undertook translations from English, notably versions of poems by [[Robert W. Service|Robert Service]], and of ''Mrs. Caudle's Curtain Lectures'' genre pieces by [[Douglas William Jerrold|Douglas Jerrold]], originally published in [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] in the 1840s which may have later influenced Edward Le Brocq's ''Ph'lippe et Merrienne'' stories. His verses are metrical rather than syllabic.

[[File:Edwin John Luce gravestone St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|E.J. Luce's [[gravestone]] in St. Helier's Almorah cemetery describes him in French as ''"auteur de prose et poësie en langue jersiaise"'' ("author of prose and poetry in the Jersey language")]]

''Elie'' ([[Edwin J. Luce]] 1881–1918) was editor of the [[French language]] newspaper ''La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey'' and a poet who wrote topical poems for the newspaper. He was also active in promoting the development of drama in Jèrriais and organised performances, ultimately leading to the establishment of a Jèrriais section of the [[Jersey Eisteddfod]] in 1912. Unfortunately for the language, he died at a young age in the [[Spanish flu|influenza pandemic]] of 1918. His brother, Philip W. Luce (1882–1966), also a journalist and poet (nom de plume ''Ph'lippe d'la Golarde''), emigrated to [[Canada]], but sent occasional writings back to Jersey.

''Caouain'' ([[George William de Carteret|George W. De Carteret]] 1869 - 1940) maintained a weekly newspaper column purporting to be the work of an owl (''cahouain'') who flew from parish hall to parish hall to report on the latest election news and local gossip. The domestic ructions of the owl and his wife, Marie Hibou, also provided a humorous commentary on social attitudes. G.W. De Carteret also wrote recitations in verse and playlets for the annual Eisteddfod competitions.

Besides [[Edmund Blampied]]'s work in the visual arts, he also amused himself and his friends by writing poetry in Jèrriais, signing himself as ''Un Tout-à-travèrs''. He wrote [[nonsense verse]] for children. In 1933, ''La Chronique de Jersey'' considered publishing a booklet of Blampied poems illustrated by the artist himself, but the plans came to nothing.

==Since 1940==

During the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|Occupation]] (1940–1945), little original writing was permitted to be published by the German military [[censorship]]. However very many older pieces of literature were re-published in the newspapers as an act of cultural self-assertion and morale-boosting. Some literature circulated clandestinely, such as Edmund Blampied's words for an insulting anti-Hitler song entitled ''La chanson Hitleur'' written in 1944. The inability of the Germans to understand Jèrriais enabled the performance of dramas that would otherwise not have passed the censor. A Jèrriais play performed at a parish hall was "as patriotic as could possibly be" but the Germans who attended the production did not understand it.&lt;ref name=occupationtheatre&gt;{{cite news|title=The Story of "Occupation Theatre"|newspaper=The Evening Post|date=18 November 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Occupation and with the re-establishment of a free press, the re-opened English language newspaper, ''The Morning News'', under the editorship of [[Edward Le Brocq]] (1877–1964) revived the weekly column in 1946 with a letter from ''Ph'lip et Merrienne'', supposedly a traditional old couple from [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] who would comment on the latest news or recall time past. On the final closure of the ''Morning News'' in 1949, the letters transferred to the last remaining French language newspaper in Jersey, ''Les Chroniques de Jersey'' until its closure in turn in 1959 when they transferred to the ''[[Jersey Evening Post|Evening Post]]'' until the author's death in 1964.

[[File:George Francis Le Feuvre grave.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of George d'la Forge in churchyard of [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]]. [[Inscription]] reads ''George Francis Le Feuvre, "George d'la Forge", 29.9.1891 - 27.10.1984, Auteur en langue Jèrriaîthe'' (Author in the Jersey language)]]

The most influential writer of Jèrriais in the 20th century was a [[United States|U.S.]] citizen, [[George F. Le Feuvre|George Francis Le Feuvre]] (1891–1984) whose pen-name was "George d’la Forge". He emigrated to [[North America]] after the [[World War I|First World War]] but for almost forty years maintained a flow of articles in Jèrriais back to Jersey for publication in newspapers, first in ''Les Chroniques de Jersey'' (1946–1954) and later in the ''Evening Post'' (subsequently ''Jersey Evening Post'' ) (1964–1984). Selections of his articles have been published in book form as ''Jèrri Jadis'' and ''Histouaithes et Gens d'Jèrri''.

[[Frank Le Maistre]] (1910–2002) (known as ''Dr. Fraînque Le Maistre'', although his doctorate was honorary), compiler of the dictionary, maintained a literary output starting in the 1930s with newspaper articles under the pseudonym ''Marie la Pie'', poems, magazine articles, research into [[toponymy]] and [[etymology]]. He himself considered his masterpiece the translation of the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] that he undertook during the German Occupation.

The foundation of ''L'Assembliée d'Jèrriais'', a body to preserve and promote the language, in 1952 led to the publication of a quarterly journal, ''Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An'', providing a literary outlet for Jèrriais which became even more important after the closure of ''Les Chroniques de Jersey'' in 1959. The editor was Frank Le Maistre.

''Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An'' ceased publication in 1977, having notched up a quarter-century, and was replaced by ''Les Chroniques du Don Balleine'' (1979–1987) which in turn gave way to the current ''Les Nouvelles Chroniques du Don Balleine'' (winner of the ''Prix Littéraire du Cotentin'' in 1993).

Following the death of George d'la Forge, Sir [[Arthur de la Mare]] (1914–1994), a retired ambassador, took over the task of contributing regular columns to the newspaper. Written in the [[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]] [[dialect]], as distinct from the St. Ouen dialect used by George d'la Forge and Frank Le Maistre which is laid out in the standard grammar of Jèrriais and the standard dictionaries, Sir Arthur's articles included reminiscences of his life as a diplomat, especially in [[Japan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], as well as comments on events and politics in Jersey. Sir Arthur's mix of foreign tales and domestic farming comments continued the pattern set by George d'la Forge who alternated between reminiscences of his youth in Jersey, his life in North America and travels round the world, and commentary on news sent from Jersey. Since Sir Arthur's death, a roster of contributors have maintained the tradition of the weekly newspaper column.

'''Karuk''' or '''Karok''' is an [[endangered language]] of northwestern [[California]]. It is the traditional language of the [[Karuk]] people, most of whom now speak English. The name is derived from the word ''Káruk'', which means 'upriver'.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyle Campbell|title=American Indian Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h36tPYqAZPwC|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534983-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|397}}

==History and usage==
The Karuk language originated around the Klamath River between [[Seiad Valley, California|Seiad Valley]] and Bluff Creek. Prior to [[Europe]]an contact, it is estimated that there may have been up to 1,500 speakers.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Linguist [[William Bright]] documented the Karuk language and when Bright began his studies in 1949 there were "a couple of hundred fluent speakers," but by 2011, there were fewer than a dozen fluent elders.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walters|first=Heidi|title=In Karuk: A family struggles to bring its ancestral tongue back to life|url=http://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/in-karuk/Content?oid=2132629|accessdate=October 4, 2013|newspaper=North Coast Journal|date=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A standardized system for writing the languages was adopted in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "e18" /&gt;

==Classification==
Karuk is a language isolate, sharing few if any similarities with other nearby languages. Historically, the American linguist [[Edward Sapir]] proposed it be classified as part of the [[Hokan languages|Hokan family]] he hypothesized although little evidence supports this proposal.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt; As Bright wrote, "The Karok language is not closely or obviously related to any other (in the area), but has been classified as a member of the northern group of Hokan languages, in a subgroup which includes Chimariko and the Shasta languages, spoken in the same general part of California as Karok itself."&lt;ref name="Bright1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Bright|title=The Karok Language, by William Bright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqxLYAAACAAJ|year=1957|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Karuk is spoken within the range of the original territory where the Karuk people lived prior to [[Europe]]an contact. The ancestral territory is in Northwestern California existing in [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou]], [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt]], and [[Del Norte County, California|Del Norte]] counties.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karuk.org/territorymap.shtml|title=Karuk Ancestral Territory Map - Karuk Language Resources on the Web|last=Gehr|first=Susan|website=karuk.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language originated around the [[Klamath River]] between [[Seiad Valley, California|Seiad Valley]] and Bluff Creek. Karuk is most notably found in towns [[Somes Bar, California|Somes Bar]], which is near The Karuk Center of the World (in Karuk, "Katimiin"), [[Happy Camp, California|Happy Camp]] ("Athithufvuunupma"), and [[Orleans, California|Orleans]] ("Panamniik").&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Karuk only has 16 consonants, a small compared to the relatively large consonant inventories of most California languages.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Karuk also does not show any modifications to its consonants like glottalization or labialization, also unusual for a California language.

=== Syllabification ===
When two high vowels are juxtaposed in a word, then the first vowel turns into a [[Glide (vowel)|glide]] in the following examples.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/|title=Phonemic vs. derived glides|last=Levi|first=Susannah|date=27 September 2008|website=ScienceDirect|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

=== General ===
Karuk is a [[polysynthetic language]] known for its method of arranging old and new information: "... skilled Karuk speakers use separate words to communicate new, salient detail, or to underscore known detail; and they use affixes for background details so that a listener's attention is not diverted."&lt;ref name="SilverMiller1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shirley Silver|author2=Wick R. Miller|title=American Indian languages: cultural and social contexts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAiDAAAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-1802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}

=== Morphology ===
Karuk is similar to many other [[American Indian languages|American Indian Languages]] because "verbs bear a complex person-marking system, where subject and object are marked in portmanteau [[prefix]]es."&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Depending on the subject and the object the speaker is referring to, there is a prefix for both positive and negative indicatives, as well as a prefix for the potential mood. Through his research, [[William Bright]] found there to insufficient words to describe [[cardinal direction]]s, but the language uses [[suffix]]es on verbs to describe relevant direction. Many motion verbs have a singular and plural form. Through [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], long-form vowels are used when ''a'' is next to ''i'' or ''u''. Karuk uses accents where vowels can sound differently in each word, making the language difficult to learn.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Although the structure may be similar, Karuk is considered to be much different than its neighboring languages, such as [[Yurok language|Yurok]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED282688.pdf|title=American Indian Bilingual Education|last=Bennett|first=Ruth|date=1 March 1987|website=eric.ed.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verbs ===
Karuk uses prefixes and suffixes in a way [[William Bright]] relates to how English words ''snort'', ''sniff'', and ''sneeze'' all start with a ''sn-''. The following are examples of prefixes in Karuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macaulay|first=Monica|date=1993-01-01|title=Reduplication and the Structure of the Karuk Verb Stem|jstor=1265470|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=59|issue=1|pages=64–81|doi=10.1086/466185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revitalization efforts ==

=== Dr. William Bright ===
Dr. [[William Bright]] started studying the Karuk language in 1949 in pursuit of his doctorate in [[linguistics]] at [[U.C. Berkeley|U.C Berkeley]]. Bright was met with open arms by tribal elders and was taken in and called '''Uhyanapatánvaanich''', or "little word-asker" in Karuk.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; A little under a decade later, Bright published ''The Karok Language''&amp;nbsp;(University of California), which was a highly informative piece on the Karuk language, its grammar, and [[syntax]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/23/books/23bright.html|title=William Bright, 78, Expert in Indigenous Languages, Is Dead|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2006-10-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright worked with Susan Gehr, a tribe member and fellow linguist, on a Karuk [[dictionary]], which was published in 2005.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bright was a different type of linguist because he did not see language without cultural context. He would record everyday conversations, songs, stories, and poetry of fluent Karuk speakers to attempt to capture the language and what it meant to those speaking it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He spent over fifty years studying, researching, and documenting Karuk, and is the only non-Indian to be inducted as an honorary member of the tribe thanks to his contributions to the community. Bright was buried on Karuk land when he died in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/in-karuk/Content?oid=2132629|title=In Karuk|last=Walters|first=Heidi|website=North Coast Journal|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival through education ===

==== American Indian Bilingual Teacher Credential Program ====
In the late 1980s, [[Humboldt State University]] started the "American Indian Bilingual Teacher Credential Program", where they brought in teachers from four local tribes, being the [[Hupa]], [[Yurok]], [[Karuk]], and [[Tolowa]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED282688.pdf|title=American Indian Bilingual Education|last=Bennett|first=Ruth|date=1 March 1987|website=eric.ed.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teachers were bilingual in their tribe's native language as well as [[English language|English]], and would be employed in local public schools to teach American Indian children. The university developed this initiative to help local [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] populations either further develop their English for higher education or improve upon their native language to preserve culture. Bilingual teachers in both Karuk and English would teach [[Orleans, California|Orleans]] Elementary and [[Happy Camp, California|Happy Camp]] Elementary, where children would learn how to live in America while keeping their identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Karuk Language Restoration Committee ===
In 1990, attempts were made to revive the language by The Karuk&amp;nbsp;Language&amp;nbsp;Restoration Committee. This committee, composed of eight volunteers, drafted a 5-year minimum plan in attempt to preserve the Karuk language and help it grow in the future.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=7a944d7f-ed00-4fe1-96f0-31f96d38359a%40sessionmgr4008&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4208&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=9610253548&amp;db=a9h|title=Karuk Language Restoration Committee nearing completion of five-year plan.|last=Burcell-Price|first=Suzanne|date=30 August 1990|website=Ebscohost|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was also advised by Dr. [[William Bright]] and tribal member Julian Lang, a dedicated researcher of the language. Their studies showed that the decline of the language is caused by a combination of a lack of younger fluent speakers, the number of speakers is falling in general, it is not typically taught at home at young ages, it is not flexible to be modernized, and most tribal members cannot read the Karuk language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The committee ultimately created a five-step plan:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# Recording and writing down fluent speakers communicating in Karuk.
# Training more people to become fluent for a long-term goal.
# Teaching tribal members and local communities why learning the language is vital to not only the language, but also to the culture.
# Reviewing and receiving community feedback regarding the current plan.
# Facilitating the community to participate in programs that have people practice and speak Karuk.

The concept of [[linguistic relativity]] concerns the relationship between language and thought, specifically whether language influences thought, and, if so, how.  This question has led to research in multiple disciplines—especially [[anthropology]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], and [[philosophy]]. Among the most popular and controversial theories in this area of scholarly work is the theory of [[linguistic relativity]] (also known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis). An often-cited "strong version" of the claim, first given by Lenneberg in 1953, proposes that language structure determines how we perceive the world. A "weaker version" of this claim posits that language structure ''influences'' the world view of speakers of a given language but does not determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L. (1999).  ''Language: The Basics''.  London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two formal sides to the color debate, the universalist and the relativist. The universalist side claims that the biology of all human beings is all the same, so the development of [[color term]]inology has absolute universal constraints. The relativist side claims that the variability of color terms cross-linguistically (from language to language) points to more culture-specific phenomena. Because color exhibits both biological and linguistic aspects, it has become a deeply studied domain that addresses the relationship between language and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1982). ''Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective''. Bruxelles: Centre de recherche sur le pluralinguisme Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 review of the debate [[Paul Kay]] and Terry Regier concluded that "The debate over color naming and cognition can be clarified by discarding the traditional 'universals versus relativity' framing, which collapses important distinctions. There are universal constraints on color naming, but at the same time, differences in color naming across languages cause differences in color cognition and/or perception."&lt;ref&gt;Kay, P., &amp; Regier, T. (2006). Language, thought and color: recent developments. Trends in cognitive sciences, 10(2), 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The color debate was made popular in large part due to [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]]'s famous 1969 study and their subsequent publishing of ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;Berlin, Brent &amp; Kay, Paul (1969).  ''Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution''.  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although much on color terminology has been done since Berlin and Kay's famous study, other research predates it, including the mid-nineteenth century work of [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[Lazarus Geiger]], which also predates the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, as well as the work of [[Eric Lenneberg]] and [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] in 1950s and 1960s.

== Universalist view ==

=== Berlin and Kay ===

The universalist theory that color cognition is an innate, physiological process rather than a cultural one was introduced in 1969 by [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] in their book ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;  Their study was intended to challenge the formerly prevailing theory of [[linguistic relativity]] set forth by [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]. Berlin and Kay found universal restrictions on the number of basic color terms (BCTs) that a language can have, and on the ways the language can use these terms. The study included data collected from speakers of twenty different languages from a range of [[language families]]. Berlin and Kay identified eleven possible basic color categories: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, and gray. To be considered a basic color category, the term for the color in each language had to meet certain criteria:

# It is [[wikt:monomorphemic|monomorphemic]]
# It is [[wikt:monolexemic|monolexemic]] (for example, blue, but not bluish)
# Its signification is not included in that of any other color term (for example, crimson is a type of red)
# Its application must not be restricted to a narrow class of objects (for example, blonde is restricted to hair, wood and beer)
# It must be psychologically salient for [[Informant (linguistics)|informants]] (for example, "the color of grandma's freezer" is not psychologically salient for all speakers)

In case of doubt, the following "subsidiary criteria" were implemented:
# The doubtful form should have the same distributional potential as the previously established basic color terms (for example, you can say reddish but not salmonish)
# Color terms that are also the name of an object characteristically having that color are suspect, for example, gold, silver and ash
# Recent foreign loan words may be suspect
# In cases where lexemic status is difficult to assess, morphological complexity is given some weight as a secondary criterion (for example, red-orange might be questionable)

Berlin and Kay also found that, in languages with fewer than the maximum eleven color categories, the colors followed a specific evolutionary pattern. This pattern is as follows:

# All languages contain terms for black and white.
# If a language contains three terms, then it contains a term for red.
# If a language contains four terms, then it contains a term for either green or yellow (but not both).
# If a language contains five terms, then it contains terms for both green and yellow.
# If a language contains six terms, then it contains a term for blue.
# If a language contains seven terms, then it contains a term for brown.
# If a language contains eight or more terms, then it contains terms for purple, pink, orange or gray.

In addition to following this evolutionary pattern absolutely, each of the languages studied also selected virtually identical focal hues for each color category present. For example, the term for "red" in each of the languages corresponded to roughly the same shade in the [[Munsell color system]].  Consequently, they posited that the cognition, or perception, of each color category is also universal.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

=== Additional universalist arguments ===

A later study supporting this universal, physiological theory was done by Kessen, Bornstein, and Weiskopf. In this study, sixteen four-month-old infants were presented with lights of different frequencies corresponding to different colors.  The lengths of [[habituation]] were measured and found to be longer when the infant was presented with successive hues surrounding a certain focal color than with successive focal colors.  This pattern of response is what is expected when the infants are distinguishing between the focal colors, but not distinguishing between successive hues (i.e. different shades of red are all "red" but "blue" and "red" focal colors are different).  This is to say that infants respond to different hues of color in much the same way as adults do, demonstrating the presence of color vision at an age younger than previously expected.  Kessen, Bornstein and Weiskopf therefore claim that the ability to perceive the same distinct focal colors is present even in small children.&lt;ref name="bornsteinkessenand weiskopf"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1246610 | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = M. | last2 = Kessen | first2 = W. | last3 = Weiskopf | first3 = S. | year = 1976 | title = The categories of hue in infancy | url = | journal = Science | volume = 191 | issue = 4223| pages = 201–202 | pmid = 1246610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research before Berlin and Kay (1969) ===

==== Gladstone and Geiger ====

In their paper ''Language and thought: Which side are you on anyway?'', Regier et al. discuss the presence of a universalist perspective on the color debate in the mid-nineteenth century.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the mid-nineteenth century, various scholars, notably William Gladstone (1858) and Lazarus Geiger (1880), noted that the speakers of ancient written languages did not name colors as precisely and consistently – as they saw it – as the speakers of modern European languages. They proposed a universal evolutionary sequence in which color vocabulary evolves in tandem with an assumed biological evolution of the color sense".&lt;ref&gt;Regier, T., Kay, P., Gilbert, L., Ivry, B. (2007).  ''Language and thought: Which side are you on anyway?''. Retrieved April 8, 2009, from http://www.ccp.uchicago.edu/faculty/Terry_Regier/papers/lehigh.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gladstone was a Homeric scholar and in his writings, notably ''[[Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age]]'', expressed that, because there was virtually a lack of color terminology in Homeric Greek literature, Greeks could probably not see color as we can today.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" ... that the organ of color and its impressions were but partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gladstone |first1= W.E. |year=1858 |title=Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UgVAAAAQAAJ |location= London |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geiger expanded on Gladstone's ideas by looking at other classic works and hypothesized that man gradually became aware of color over time. He posited the idea that this awareness was connected to the order colors came up in the spectrum, starting with longest wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Geiger |first1=Lazarus | year=1880 |title= Contributions to the History of the Development of the Human Race |location= London |publisher= Trübner and Company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXCpQAAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lenneberg &amp; Roberts ====

Lenneberg and Roberts presented their paper ''The Denotata of Color Terms''&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, E., Roberts, J.(1953). ''The denotata of language terms''. Paper presented at the Linguistic Society of America, Bloomington, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Linguistic Society of America]] in 1953. In this paper they reported their findings on color recall in [[Zuni language|Zuni]] speakers. Zuni has one color term for yellow and orange, and Lenneberg and Roberts' study reported that Zuni speakers encountered greater difficulty in color recall for these colors than English speakers, who have available terms to distinguish them. Brown and Lenneberg attributed this effect to the property of codability.

Linguistic codability is the ease with which people can name things and the effects of naming on cognition and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Day, R.S.(n.d.). ''Basic Cognition''. Retrieved April 6, 2009, from Duke University Web Site http://www.duke.edu/~ruthday/basiccog.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brown &amp; Lenneberg ====

Brown and Lenneberg published ''A Study in Language and Cognition''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0057814 | last1 = Brown | first1 = R. | last2 = Lenneberg | first2 = E. | year = 1954 | title = A study in language and cognition | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 3| pages = 454–462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954, where they discussed the effect of codability on recognition. In their experiment they used a series of Munsell chips to test color recall and recognition in English speakers. Their findings suggested that the availability of a basic color term in a given language affected the retention of that color in recall testing. Brown and Lenneberg linked their study to Lenneberg and Roberts' 1953 findings on color recall in Zuni speakers.

== Relativist view ==

Initially, Berlin and Kay's theory received little direct criticism. But in the decades since their 1969 book, a significant scholarly debate has developed surrounding the universalism of color terminology. Many relativists find significant issues with this universalism. Discussed below, Barbara Saunders and John A. Lucy are two scholars who are prominent advocates of the opposing relativist position. Also, [[Daniel Everett]]'s work on the [[Pirahã language]] of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Everett |first1=Daniel L. |year=2005 |title=Cultural constraints on grammar and cognition in Pirahã |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2012 |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial case, found several peculiarities, including what he interpreted as the Pirahã language's lack of color terms in the way those are otherwise defined. Everett's conclusions were met with skepticism from universalists,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Frank |first1=Michael C. |last2=Everett |first2=Daniel L. |last3=Fedorenko |first3=Evelina |last4=Gibson |first4=Edward |year=2008 |title=Number as a cognitive technology: Evidence from Pirahã language and cognition |pmid=18547557 |periodical=Cognition |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.04.007 |url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Frank%20et%20al.%20InPress%20Cog.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2009 |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=819–24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215125604/http://tedlab.mit.edu/tedlab_website/researchpapers/Frank%20et%20al.%20InPress%20Cog.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that the linguistic deficit is explained by the lack of need for such concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ira Nevins | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Pesetsky | first2 = David | last3 = Rodrigues | first3 = Cilene | year = 2009 | title = Piraha Exceptionality: a Reassessment | url = | journal = Language | volume = 85 | issue = 2| pages = 355–404 | doi = 10.1353/lan.0.0107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbara Saunders ===

[[Barbara Saunders]] believes that Berlin and Kay's theory of basic color terminology contains several unspoken assumptions and significant flaws in research methodology. Included in these assumptions is an ethnocentric bias based on traditions of Western scientific and philosophical thought. She regards the evolutionary component of Berlin and Kay's theory as "an endorsement of the idea of progress" and references Smart's belief that it is "a Eurocentric narrative that filters everything through the West and its values and exemplifies a universal evolutionary process of modernization."

With regard to Berlin and Kay's research, Saunders criticizes the translation methods used for the color terms they gathered from the 78 languages they had not studied directly. Like many others, she also questions the effectiveness of using the [[Munsell color system]] in the elicitation of color terminology and identification of focal hues. She feels that "use of this chart exemplifies one of the mistakes commonly made by the social sciences: that of taking data-sets as defining a (laboratory) phenomenon which supposedly represents the real world", and entails "taking a picture of the world for the world and then claiming that that picture is the concept". Finally, she takes issue with the anomalous cases of color term use that she believes Berlin, Kay and Merrifield disregarded in their work on the ''World Color Survey'' for the purpose of purifying their results.&lt;ref name=saunders95&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/095269519500800402 | last1 = Saunders | first1 = B. | year = 1995 | title = Disinterring Basic Color Terms: a study in the mystique of cognitivism | url = | journal = History of the Human Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 7| pages = 19–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Saunders' 1997 article with van Brakel, they criticize the amount of weight given to the study of physiological color perception as support for the universalism of color terminology. They primarily criticize the idea that there is an autonomous neuro-physiological color pathway, citing a lack of concrete evidence for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saunders | first1 = B. | last2 = van Brakel | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Are there nontrivial constraints on colour categorization? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 167–228 | pmid = 10096997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders is also bothered by the overall de-contextualization of color terminology and the failure of universalists to address the limitations of their methodologies. She points out that:&lt;ref name=saunders95/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Ordinary colour talk is used in a variety of ways – for flat coloured surfaces, surfaces of natural objects, patches of paintings, transparent objects, shining objects, the sky, flames, illumination, vapours, volumes, films and so on, all of which interact with overall situation, illumination, edges, textures, patternings and distances, making the concept of sameness of colour inherently indeterminate".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== John Lucy ===

[[John A. Lucy]]'s criticisms of Berlin and Kay's theory are similar to those of Saunders and other relativists, primarily focusing on shortcomings in research methodologies and the assumptions that underlie them.

Lucy believes that there are problems with how linguistic analysis has been used to characterize the meanings of color terms across languages. Referential range (what a color term can refer to) and grammatical distribution (how the term can be used) are two dimensions Lucy believes are critical to defining the meaning of a term, both of which "are routinely ignored in research on color terms which focuses primarily on denotational overlap across languages without any consideration of the typical use of the terms or their formal status." He also feels that any attempt to contrast color term systems requires understanding of each individual language and the systems it uses to structure reference.

Lucy also believes that there is significant bias present in the design of Berlin and Kay's research, due to their English-speaking and Western points of view. He thinks the use of the [[Munsell color system]] demonstrates their adherence to the ideas that "speech is about labeling accuracy" and that "Meaning is really about accurate denotation," which he believes "...both derive directly from the folk understandings of English speakers about how their language works." He refers to Conklin's study of [[Hanunó'o language|Hanunóo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conklin | first1 = H.C. | year = 1955 | title = Hanunóo Color Categories | url = | journal = Southwestern Journal of Anthropology | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 339–344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a demonstration of what a study might reveal about a language's color term system when such bias is not present. He demonstrates that "an 'adequate knowledge' of the system would never have been produced by restricting the stimuli to color chips and the task of labeling" (original emphasis).

In summation, he feels that the approach universalists have taken in researching color term universals sets up a procedure that "...guarantees both their discovery and their form," and that, "It does not really even matter whether the researchers involved are open-minded and consciously willing to recognize relativism as a possible outcome—because the universalist conclusion is guaranteed by their methodological assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, J. A. (1997). The linguistics of "color". In C.L. Hardin &amp; L. Maffi (Eds.), ''Color categories in thought and language'' (pp. 320–346). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent scholarship ==

Scholarship on color vision has proceeded in three principal domains within the last twenty years.  There have been revisions to the Berlin &amp; Kay hypothesis; in response, there have been continued challenges to that hypothesis; and lastly, the field of vision science has expanded to explore hue categorization at a perceptual level, independent of language-based distinctions, possibly offering compromise in the two polar theories.

=== Revisions of the Berlin &amp; Kay hypothesis ===

In 1999 Paul Kay and [[Luisa Maffi]] published an article entitled ''Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons'',&lt;ref name="Kay"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/aa.1999.101.4.743 | last1 = Kay | first1 = Paul | last2 = Maffi | first2 = Luisa | year = 1999 | title = Color Appearance and the Emergence and Evolution of Basic Color Lexicons | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 743–760 | jstor = 684051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they outline a series of revisions in response to data collected in the World Color Survey (WCS) and to Stephen Levinson and his work on the language [[Yélî Dnye language|Yélî Dnye]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] (see below).&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/jlin.2000.10.1.3 | last1 = Levinson | first1 = Stephen C. | year = 2000 | title = Yeli Dnye and the Theory of Basic Color Terms | url = | journal = Journal of Linguistic Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While upholding an evolutionary track for the addition of basic color terms (BCTs) to any given lexicon, they outlined a series of three Partition Rules (i.e., superordinate rules that determine the evolution of BCTs):

# Black and White (Bk&amp;W): Distinguish black and white.
# Warm and Cool (Wa&amp;C): Distinguish the warm primaries (red and yellow) from the cool primaries (green and blue).
# Red: Distinguish red.

The ordering of these rules is reflective of the data of the overwhelming majority of languages studied in the WCS. However, exceptions do exist, as was accounted for by Yélî Dnye and other languages within the WCS. Furthermore, they also propose a 0) rule, one which simply states: partition. Such a rule is necessary to motivate the specification of later basic color terms, namely those that can no longer be brought about by application of rules 1)–3).

With respect to the evolution of color terms within a given lexicon, Kay and Maffi further outlined the possibilities of different trajectories of evolution, though all of those numerically possible are not attested in the World Color Survey. Another significant contribution of this article is a discussion of the Emergence Hypothesis (see below), its relation to Yélî Dnye, and its motivation for the authors' revision of evolutionary trajectories.

Using [[phylogenetic]] approach, Bowern &amp; Haynie found support for Berlin &amp; Kay hypothesis in the [[Pama-Nyungan language]] family, as well as other alternative trajectories for gaining and losing color terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Linguists explore the evolution of color in new study|date=December 9, 2016|access-date=2016-12-12|publisher=Science Daily|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161209133255.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Berlin &amp; Kay et al. ===

Here are three approaches to such critiques:
# Those brought about by implications within the taxonomic structure of the B&amp;K model (as seen further in Berlin's treatment of ethnobiological systems of classification&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Brent (1992).  ''Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies''.  Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;)
#Those as seen in research in color perception in children and infants
#Those brought about by specific fieldwork

==== Anna Wierzbicka and universals of visual semantics ====

In an article titled ''The Semantics of Colour: A New Paradigm'',&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicka, Anna (2006).  The Semantics of Colour: A New Paradigm.  In Pitchford, N.J. &amp; Biggam, C.P. (eds.), ''Progress in Colour Studies: Volume I. Language and Culture'' (pp. 1–24).  Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Wierzbicka discusses three main critiques of the universalist approach:

# The inability to prove the existence of true color terms (i.e., those based on variations in hue) in languages that lack a superordinate word for color in their [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]
# The lack of inquiry into the semantic range of any given language's assumed color naming.
# That the Western universalist tradition "[imposes] on other languages and cultures one's own conceptual grid" and does not reflect " 'the native's point of view'", citing [[Malinowski]] in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Branislaw (1922).  ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea''.  London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to 1), she states that "the basic point ... is that, in many languages, one cannot ask the question, 'What color is it?'"  The assumption oscillates between two versions: on the one hand she argues that languages with no superordinate word for color simply do not have minimal color terms. On the other hand, she argues that even if one contests the first point (i.e., agree that languages that lack a word for color still have color terms), the fact that one cannot ask the question she posits (above) means that color is not a salient [[semantic domain]] in these languages. In the structure of her [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Wierzbicka |first1= Anna |year=1996 |title=Semantics: Primes and Universals |location=  Oxford |publisher= Oxford University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZN029Pmbnu4C | isbn=978-0-19-870003-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; color does not constitute a semantic "primitive", though she argues for many others cross-linguistically. (For more on the NSM related to color terms, see ''Theoretical Linguistics'' 29:3.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1515/thli.29.3.237 | last1 = Kay | first1 = Paul | year = 2003 | title = NSM and the Meaning of Color Words | url = | journal = Theoretical Linguistics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 237–245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Pitchford &amp; Mullen: ''The developmental acquisition of basic colour terms'' =====

This study&lt;ref&gt;Pitchford, Nicola J. &amp; Mullen, Kathy T. (2006).  The Developmental Acquisition of Basic Colour Terms.  In Pitchford, N.J. &amp; Biggam, C.P. (eds.), ''Progress in Colour Studies: Volume II. Psychological Aspects'' (pp. 139–158).  Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; compares the evolutionary model of color terms of Berlin &amp; Kay to the acquisition of color terms in children (something which has been thought to lag behind other lexical acquisitions). Their study proceeds to three main questions:

# Are color terms acquired late?
# Are basic color terms acquired in a fixed developmental order?
# What factors may influence the acquisition of basic color terms?

With regard to 1), they find that color terms are not acquired any later than other relevant lexemes to distinguish objects. It had been thought, for example, that since color is not necessarily unique to a given object, and diverse objects are more likely to share common color than a common shape, that color terms lagged behind shape terms in development. This was found not to be the case.

Second, they found no correlation between the order of color term acquisition in children and in languages generally. It was found that gray and brown are learned later in development; there was no preference for the six primary color terms over the remaining three secondary ones. The similarity between the acquisition of these terms in children and in language vocabularies was assumed to be comparable, since even in current notions of the B&amp;K hypothesis the evolutionary order of color terms is thought to be based on universals of [[neurophysiology]]. While some studies in [[neurophysiology]] have shown greater salience for the basic color terms (and thus correlate their earlier evolutionary status), [[neurophysiology]] has not been able to account for such phenomena as intuitive separations of warm and cool colors (the second partition rule posited by Kay [see above] is essential to such early-onset warm/cool distinctions, yet is overridden in language with a yellow/green/blue color term).&lt;ref name="Kay"/&gt;

===== Levinson &amp; Yélî Dnye =====

The [[Yele language]] is a language isolate spoken on [[Rossel Island]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].  Among observations about the class, derivation, usage of, and disagreement over, color naming words in Yele is a critique of the BCT-model's assumption that languages which have not yet fully lexicalized the semantic space of color (as was posited to be universal in the original and subsequent B&amp;K papers [1969&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; &amp;1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/412789 | last1 = Kay | first1 = Paul | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = Chad K. | year = 1978 | title = The Linguistic Significance of Meanings of Basic Color Terms| journal = Language | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 610–646 | jstor = 412789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]) with the use of all eleven basic color names do so by use of the fewer composite terms that they do possess (by B&amp;K's criteria for Yele, three).  As [[Stephen Levinson]] argues using methodology similar to that used by B&amp;K for their initial tests and later for the WCS, there are simply regions of the color spectrum for which Yele has no name, and which are not subsumed by larger composite categories, even despite the inventive nature of color terms in Yele that fall outside the criteria for "basic" status. Given the fact that such color naming words are extremely inventive, (a "semi-productive" mode of adjectival derivation is the duplication of related nouns), Levinson argues that this is highly detrimental to the BCT-theory, insomuch that Yele is "a language where a semantic field of color has not yet jelled", and thus one not open to universal constraint.&lt;ref name="Levinson"/&gt;

As Levinson points out, there is evidence that supports the emergence of BCTs through physical objects and words used to signify simultaneous properties such as lightness. As such, these terms do not cohere as a unique, separable semantic domain denoting hue (see Bornstein for this criterion). Over time, though, and through processes of [[semantic change]], such a domain can emerge. In response to work by Levinson and Lyons, Kay dubs this perspective the Emergence Hypothesis (EH). (See Levinson's article for a discussion on the co-existing evolutionary tracks for color words if one accepts both B&amp;K's position and the Emergence Hypothesis.) Kay &amp; Maffi (1999) incorporate the EH into their evolutionary track by removing from their model the assumption that languages begin by fully segmenting the color spectrum.  This inverts their Partition Principles (see above), namely by placing 1) and 3) over 0) and 2).  That is, languages partially segment the space into black, white, and red (i.e., 1) &amp; 3)), and then the assignment to partition (0)) and split warm and cool colors (2)) accommodates the rest of the space.  As Kay &amp; Maffi explain, this is essential to explications of Y/G/Bu terms (e.g., [[Cree]]), which were previously incompatible with the model. However, this model also introduces the possibility for previously divergent evolutionary paths for color terms, since it is only after the rearrangement and reassignment of the Partition Principles that a language that derived from EH origins joins with a language that originally partitioned the whole of the color spectrum.&lt;ref name="Kay"/&gt;

=== Vision science and theoretical compatibility ===

[[Marc Bornstein]]'s essay ''Hue Categorization and Color Naming: Physics to Sensation to Perception''&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, Marc H. (2006).  Hue Categorization and Color Naming: Physics to Sensation to Perception.  In Pitchford, N.J. &amp; Biggam, C.P. (Eds.), ''Progress in Colour Studies: Volume II. Psychological Aspects'' (pp. 35–68).  Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; separates an analytical review of [[vision science]] and color naming into three sections:

# Categorization: and its aids to both perceptual and cognitive functions generally
# [[Color Vision]] and Hue Categorization
# Color Naming (an unarticulated derivative of the first two ideas [see his companion essay ''Hue Categorization and Color Naming: Cognition to Language to Culture''&lt;ref name="Bornstein"&gt;Bornstein, Marc H. (2007).  Hue Categorization and Color Naming: Cognition to Language to Culture.  In MacLaury, Robert E., Paramei, Galina V. &amp; Dedrick, Don (Eds.), ''Anthropology of Color'' (pp. 3–27).  Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; for a further discussion of this point])

As a result, he summarizes both the findings of vision science (as it relates to color naming) and the linking of three separate but causally related processes within the study of color naming phenomena.  He states that "the physics of color, the psychophysics of color discrimination, and the psychology of color naming are not isomorphic".  The color spectrum clearly exists at a physical level of [[wavelengths]] (inter al.), humans cross-linguistically tend to react most saliently to the primary color terms (a primary motive of Bornstein's work and vision science generally) as well as select similar exemplars of these primary color terms, and lastly comes the process of linguistic color naming, which adheres both to universal patterns but demonstrates individual uniqueness.  While one may have origins in its predecessor, variation among test subjects in vision science and linguistic variation demonstrate that it is not a process of whole causality.  In his companion essay,&lt;ref name="Bornstein"/&gt; he demonstrates that this process of causality may indeed be reversed, which he explains through a set of "models of development":

# Undeveloped
# Partially developed
# Fully developed

In response, there are three ways that outside experience may affect this development: through (A) induction, (B) modification, or (C) deprivation.  Thus the logical possibilities are 1A &amp; 1C; 2A, 2B &amp; 2C; and 3B &amp; 3C.  Using this format, he explains that developmental altering in hue categories "entail perceptual 'sharpening' and 'broadening'".  He attributes this to either "maturation" (perceptually) or "experience".  Such a conclusion is necessarily indeterminate because understanding of why certain hue categories are lost and others induced (cf. developmental processes above) "requires further exacting research".  Coming from these two perspectives (i.e., those outlined in the causation above, and the models of development), this leads Bornstein to conclude that "there appear to be nontrivial biological constraints on color categorization [and that] ... the available evidence seems compatible with a position of moderate universality that leads to expectations of probabilistic rather than deterministic cross-cultural correspondence", and that "in color, relativism appears to overlay a universalist foundation".&lt;ref name="Bornstein"/&gt;

'''Merchandization''' is a critical term coined by the [[anti-globalization movement]] to designate the process of change in viewpoint of individuals or society towards an object, service or substance. Things that were formerly thought of as "simply being there", are now being thought of as [[Commodity|commodities]] for sale and [[corporate]] profit.  This change in viewpoint is called merchandization of an object.

For example, anti-globalization and anti-capitalism activist claim that in today's society, many things, including [[health care]], [[culture]], and [[education]], are becoming mere [[merchandise]].

[[Karl Marx|Marx]] discussed this "fetishism of commodities" in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S4 ''Capital'': Volume One Part I.1.4 – THE FETISHISM OF COMMODITIES]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely,  value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour time by the magnitude of that value.  These formulæ, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulæ appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself. Hence forms of social production that preceded the bourgeois form, are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the Fathers of the Church treated pre-Christian religions. . . . . Could commodities themselves speak, they would say: Our use value may be a thing that interests men. It is no part of us as objects. What, however, does belong to us as objects, is our value. Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it. In the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchange values.|sign=Karl Marx|source=''[[Das Kapital]]'', volume one, part I.1.4}}

In other words, something may have usefulness, but it has no value unless it can be exchanged in the marketplace for something else considered to have value. That value may come because it fills a need through consumption or being further exchanged. In this way, labor, time, and natural resources have come to serve the market instead of the other way around.

The slogan of [[Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens' Action|ATTAC]] is "the World is not Merchandise" (''le monde n'est pas une marchandise'').

'''Muskogean''' (also '''Muskhogean''', '''Muskogee''') is an indigenous language family of the [[Southeastern United States]]. Though there is an ongoing debate concerning their interrelationships, the Muskogean languages are generally divided into two branches, Eastern Muskogean and Western Muskogean. They are [[agglutinative language]]s. Although only 1 language is extinct, [[Apalachee language|Apalachee]], all surviving languages are critically endangered.

==Genetic relationships==

===Family division===
The Muskogean family consists of six languages which are still spoken: [[Alabama language|Alabama]], [[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]], [[Creek language|Creek-Seminole]], [[Koasati language|Koasati]], and [[Mikasuki language|Mikasuki]], as well as the now-extinct [[Apalachee language|Apalachee]], [[Houma language|Houma]], and [[Hitchiti]] (the last is generally considered a dialect of Mikasuki).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy 2005, pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; "Seminole" is listed as one of the Muskogean languages in Hardy's list, but it is generally considered a dialect of Creek rather than a separate language, as she comments (Hardy 2005:70; see also Mithun 2005:462, Crawford).

The major subdivisions of the family have long been controversial, but the following lower-level groups are universally accepted: Choctaw–Chickasaw, Alabama–Koasati, Hitchiti–Mikasuki, and Creek–Seminole.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell 1992, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy 2005, pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Munro 2005, pg. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Because Apalachee is [[language death|extinct]], its precise relationship to the other languages is uncertain; [[Mary Haas]] and [[Pamela Munro]] both classify it with the Alabama–Koasati group.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell 1992, pp. 3; 41-2, footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haas's classification====
For connections among these groupings, the traditional classification is that of [[Mary Haas]] and her students, such as Karen Booker, in which "Western Muskogean" (Choctaw-Chickasaw) is seen as one major branch, and "Eastern Muskogean" (Alabama-Koasati, Hitchiti-Mikasuki, and Creek-Seminole) as another. Within Eastern Muskogean, Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki are generally thought to be more closely related to each other than to Creek-Seminole.&lt;ref name="H2005classification"&gt;Hardy 2005, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; That classification is reflected in the list below:&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 2005, pg. 461&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997, pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Western Muskogean'''
** '''[[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]]'''
** '''[[Choctaw language|Choctaw]]''' (also called Chahta, Chacato)
*'''Eastern Muskogean'''
** '''[[Creek language|Creek-Seminole]]''' (also called Muskogee, Maskoke, Seminole)
** '''[[Mikasuki language|Hitchiti-Mikasuki]]''' (also called Miccosukee)
** Apalachee–Alabama–Koasati
*** '''[[Apalachee language|Apalachee]]''' †
*** '''[[Alabama language|Alabama]]''' (also called Alibamu)
*** '''[[Koasati language|Koasati]]''' (also called Coushatta)

====Munro's classification====
A more recent and controversial classification has been proposed by [[Pamela Munro]]. In her classification, the languages are divided into a "Southern Muskogean" branch (Choctaw-Chickasaw, Alabama-Koasati, and Hitchiti-Mikasuki) and a "Northern Muskogean" one (Creek-Seminole). Southern Muskogean is the subdivided into Hitchiti-Mikasuki and a "Southwestern Muskogean" branch containing Alabama-Koasati and "Western Muskogean" (Choctaw-Chickasaw).&lt;ref name="H2005classification" /&gt; The classification is reflected in the list below:&lt;ref name="C1997pg148"&gt;Campbell 1997, pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Muskogean''':
*'''[[Creek language|Creek-Seminole]]'''

'''Southern Muskogean''':
*'''[[Mikasuki language|Hitchiti-Mikasuki]]'''
* Southwestern Muskogean
** '''[[Apalachee language|Apalachee]]''' (†)
** ''Alabama–Koasati''
*** '''[[Alabama language|Alabama]]
*** '''[[Koasati language|Koasati]]'''
** ''Western Muskogean''
*** '''[[Chickasaw language|Chickasaw]]'''
*** '''[[Choctaw language|Choctaw]]'''

====Kimball's classification====
A third proposed classification is that of Geoffrey Kimball, who envisions a threeway split among the languages, with "Western Muskogean" (Choctaw-Chickasaw), "Eastern Muskogean" (Creek-Seminole), and "Central Muskogean" (Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki).&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 1999, pg. 462&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kimball's classification has not received as much support as either Haas's or Munro's.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broader relationships===
====Possible Muskogean languages====
Several sparsely attested languages have been claimed to be Muskogean languages. George Broadwell suggested that the languages of the [[Yamasee]] and [[Guale]] were Muskogean.&lt;ref name="Campbell149"&gt;Campbell 1997, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadwell 1992, pp. 41–42, fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, William Sturtevant argued that the "Yamasee" and "Guale" data were Creek and that the language(s) spoken by the Yamasee and Guale people remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant 1994, referenced in Campbell 1997, pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the Yamasee were an amalgamation of several different ethnic groups and did not speak a single language. Chester B. DePratter describes the Yamasee as consisting mainly of speakers of Hitchiti and Guale.&lt;ref&gt;{{NRHP url|id=64500575|title=Dr. Chester B. DePratter, "The Foundation, Occupation, and Abandonment of Yamasee Indian Towns in the South Carolina Lowcountry, 1684-1715"}}, National Register Multiple Property Submission&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Steven Oatis also describes the Yamasee as an ethnically mixed group that included people from Muskogean-speaking regions, such as the early colonial-era native towns of ''Hitchiti'', ''Coweta'', and ''Cussita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Oatis |first= Steven J. |title= A Colonial Complex: South Carolina's Frontiers in the Era of the Yamasee War, 1680–1730 |year= 2004 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |isbn= 0-8032-3575-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pensacola people|Pensacola]] and [[Chatot people|Chatot]] (or Chacato) people are reported to have spoken the same Muskogean language, which may have been closely related to Choctaw.&lt;ref&gt;Milanich:96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coker:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanton:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparse evidence indicates that a Muskogean language was spoken by at least some of the people of the paramount chiefdom of [[Cofitachequi]] in northeastern [[South Carolina]]. If so, that would be the most eastern outpost of Muskogean. The people of Cofitichequi were probably absorbed by nearby [[Siouan]] and [[Iroquoian]] speakers in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Charles ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions'' Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1990, pp. 68-73, 75&lt;/ref&gt;

A vocabulary of the [[Houma Tribe|Houma]] may be another underdocumented Western Muskogean language or a version of [[Mobilian Jargon]]. Mobilian Jargon is a pidgin based on Western Muskogean.

====Gulf====
The best-known connection proposed between Muskogean and other languages is Mary Haas' [[Gulf languages|Gulf hypothesis]], in which she conceived of a macrofamily comprising Muskogean and a number of [[language isolate]]s of the southeastern US: [[Atakapa language|Atakapa]], [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]], [[Tunica language|Tunica]], and [[Natchez language|Natchez]]. While well-known, the Gulf grouping is now generally rejected by historical linguists.&lt;ref name="Campbell149" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997, pp. 305-9&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Muskogean scholars continue to believe that Muskogean is related to Natchez.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1997, pg. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Phonology===
Proto-Muskogean is reconstructed as having the consonants (given in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription):&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonemes reconstructed by Haas as {{IPA|*/x/}} and {{IPA|*/xʷ/}} show up as {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/f/}} (or {{IPA|/ɸ/}}&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005, pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt;), respectively, in all Muskogean languages;&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005, pp. 248, 252, 254&lt;/ref&gt; they are therefore reconstructed by some as {{IPA|*/h/}} and {{IPA|*/ɸ/}}.&lt;ref name="C1997pg148" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Munro 2005, pg. 318, fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|*/kʷ/}} appears as {{IPA|/b/}} in all the daughter languages except [[Creek language|Creek]] for which it is {{IPA|/k/}} initially and {{IPA|/p/}} medially. The value of the proto-phoneme conventionally written {{angle bracket|θ}} (or {{angle bracket|N}}) is unknown;&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005, pg. 286, footnote 7&lt;/ref&gt; it appears as {{IPA|/n/}} in Western Muskogean languages and as {{IPA|/ɬ/}} in Eastern Muskogean languages. Haas reconstructed it as a voiceless {{IPA|/n/}} (that is, {{IPA|*/n̥/}}), based partly on presumed cognates in [[Natchez language|Natchez]].&lt;ref name="C1997pg148" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005, pp. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Most family languages display lexical accent on nouns and [[grammatical case]] which distinguishes the nominative from the oblique. Nouns do not obligatorially inflect for gender or number.

===Verbs===
Muskogean verbs have a complex [[ablaut]] system; the verbal stem almost always changes depending on aspect; less commonly, it is affected by tense or modality.  In Muskogean linguistics, the different forms are known as "grades."

Verbs mark for first and second person, as well as agent and patient (Choctaw also marks for dative). Third-persons (he, she, it) have a null-marker.

Plurality of a noun agent is marked by either affixation on the verb or an innately plural verbal stem:

Pluralization via affixation, Choctaw:

:'''ishimpa'''
:ish-impa
:2SG.NOM-eat
:"you [sg.] eat"

:'''hashimpa'''
:hash-impa
:2PL.NOM-eat
:"you [pl.] eat"

Innately-numbered verbal stems, Mikasuki:

:'''łiniik'''
:run. SG
:"to run (singular)"

:'''palaak'''
:run. PAUCAL
:"to run (several)"

:'''mataak'''
:run. PL
:"to run (many)"

'''''Musqué''''' is a [[French language|French]] term applied to certain [[variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[clone (plant)|clone]]s of [[grape]]s used for making [[wine]]. The term means both perfumed ("[[musk]]y") and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]]-like, and indicates that the variety or clone is highly aromatic.&lt;ref name="OCW Musqué"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=Musqué |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''musqué'' is usually suffixed to the name of certain grape varieties to indicate a clone with ''musqué'' properties, e.g. "[[Chardonnay]] ''musqué''" or "[[Sauvignon blanc]] ''musqué''". Such clones have arisen through [[mutation]] of a regular ("non-musqué") clone of the variety, and such mutations have been recorded for several different grape varieties.&lt;ref name="OCW Musqué"/&gt;

The most well-known ''musqué'' grape is [[Gewürztraminer]], which is a ''musqué'' mutation of a red-skinned [[Traminer]], which is also known as [[Savagnin rose]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Jancis Robinson | encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Wine |edition= Third |title=Gewürztraminer |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''musqué'' Gewürztraminer has largely replaced non-''musqué'' Traminer, it is generally considered a grape variety in its own right rather than a clone of Traminer or Savagnin.

The issue of whether the ''musqué'' mutations, with their distinct aromatic properties should be classified as varieties in their own right, and be allowed to be used for [[varietal]] wine labelling has created bureaucratic problems for some winemakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wineloverspage.com/wineadvisor2/tswa20070219.php Wineloverspage.com 30 Second Wine Advisor: Aromatic Musque], accessed April 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20626">The '''N400''' is a component of time-locked [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] signals known as [[event-related potential]]s (ERP). It is a negative-going deflection that peaks around 400 milliseconds post-stimulus onset, although it can extend from 250-500 ms, and is typically maximal over centro-parietal [[electrode]] sites. The N400 is part of the normal [[brain]] response to [[words]] and other meaningful (or potentially meaningful) stimuli, including visual and auditory words, [[sign language]] signs, [[pictures]], [[face]]s, environmental sounds, and smells.&lt;ref name=review1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kutas | first1 = M. | last2 = Federmeier | first2 = K.D. | year = 2000 | title = Electrophysiology reveals [[semantic memory]] use in [[language]] comprehension | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 463–470 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01560-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=review2&gt;Kutas, M. &amp; Federmeier, K.D.

==History==
The N400 was first discovered by [[Marta Kutas]] and Steven Hillyard in 1980.&lt;ref name=kutas80&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kutas | first1 = M. | last2 = Hillyard | first2 = S. A. | year = 1980 | title = Reading senseless sentences: Brain potentials reflect semantic incongruity | url = | journal = Science | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 203–208 | doi=10.1126/science.7350657 | pmid=7350657}}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted the first experiment looking at the response to unexpected words in read [[sentences]], expecting to elicit a [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] component. The P300 had previously been shown to be elicited by unexpected stimuli. Kutas and Hillyard therefore used sentences with anomalous endings (i.e.''I take coffee with cream and '''dog'''''), expecting to see a P300 to the unexpected sentence-final words. However, instead of eliciting a large positivity, these anomalous endings elicited a large negativity, relative to the sentences with expected endings (i.e. ''He returned the book to the '''library''''') In the same paper, they confirmed that the negativity was not just caused by any unexpected event at the end of a sentence, since a semantically expected but physically unexpected word (i.e. ''She put on her high-heeled '''SHOES''''') elicited a P300 instead of negativity in the N400 window. This finding showed that the N400 is related to semantic processing, and is not just a response to unexpected words.

==Component characteristics==
The N400 is characterized by a distinct pattern of electrical activity that can be observed at the scalp.  As its name indicates, this waveform peaks around 400 ms post-stimulus onset, with negativity that can be observed in the time window ranging from 250-500 ms. This latency (delay between stimulus and response) is very stable across tasks—little else besides [[ageing|age]] affects the timing of its peak.&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt; The N400 is a negative component, relative to reference [[electrodes]] placed on the [[mastoid]] processes (the bony ridge behind the ear), and relative to a 100 ms pre-stimulus baseline. Its amplitude can range from -5 to 5 [[volt|microvolts]]. However, it is important to note that in studies using the N400 as a dependent measure, the relative [[amplitude]] of the waveform compared to another experimental condition (the "N400 effect") is more important than its absolute amplitude. The N400 itself is not always negative—it is just a more negative-going deflection than that seen to other conditions. Its distribution is maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites, and is slightly larger over the left side of the head for visual words, although the distribution can change slightly depending on the eliciting stimulus.&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt;

==Main paradigms==
A typical experiment designed to study the N400 will usually involve the visual presentation of words, either in sentence or list contexts. In a typical visual N400 experiment, for example, subjects will be seated in front of a [[computer monitor]] while words are presented one-by-one at a central screen location. Stimuli must be presented centrally because [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]] will generate large amounts of electrical noise that will mask the relatively small N400 component. Subjects will often be given a behavioral task (e.g., making a word/nonword decision, answering a comprehension question, responding to a [[memory]] probe), either after each stimulus or at longer intervals, to ensure that subjects are paying attention. Note, however, that overt responses by the subject are not required to elicit the N400—passively viewing stimuli will still evoke this response.

An example of an experimental task used to study the N400 is a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] paradigm. Subjects are shown a list of words in which a prime word is either associatively related to a target word (e.g. bee and honey), semantically related (e.g. sugar and honey) or a direct repetition (e.g. honey and honey). The N400 amplitude seen to the target word (honey) will be reduced upon repetition due to semantic priming.&lt;ref name="review1" /&gt; The amount of reduction in amplitude can be used to measure the degree of relatedness between the words.

Another widely used experimental task used to study the N400 is sentence [[reading (process)|reading]]. In this kind of study, sentences are presented to subjects centrally, one word at a time, until the sentence is completed. Alternatively, subjects could listen to a sentence as natural auditory speech. Again, subjects may be asked to respond to comprehension questions periodically throughout the experiment, although this is not necessary. Experimenters can choose to manipulate various linguistic characteristics of the sentences, including contextual constraint or the cloze probability of the sentence-final word (see below for a definition of cloze probability) to observe how these changes affect the waveform's amplitude.

As previously mentioned, the N400 response is seen to all meaningful, or potentially meaningful, stimuli. As such, a wide range of paradigms can be used to study it. Experiments involving the presentation of spoken words,&lt;ref name=vanpetten99&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Petten | first1 = C. | last2 = Coulson | first2 = S. | last3 = Rubin | first3 = S. | last4 = Plante | first4 = E. | last5 = Parks | first5 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Time course of word identification and semantic integration in spoken language | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 394–417 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.25.2.394}}&lt;/ref&gt; acronyms,&lt;ref name=laszlo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laszlo | first1 = S. | last2 = Federmeier | first2 = K.D. | year = 2008 | title = Minding the PS, queues, and PXQs: Uniformity of semantic processing across stimulus types | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 458–466 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00636.x| pmc = 2704151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pictures embedded at the end of sentences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Federmeier | first1 = K.D. | last2 = Kutas | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Meaning and modality: Influences of context, semantic memory organization, and perceptual predictability on picture processing | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 202–224 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.1.202}}&lt;/ref&gt; music,&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo09&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daltrozzo | first1 = J. | last2 = Schön | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Conceptual processing in music as revealed by N400 effects on words and musical targets | url = http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_Schon_2009a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = 10| pages = 1882–1892 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21113 | pmid=18823240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and videos of real-word events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sitnikova | first1 = T. | last2 = Kuperberg | first2 = G. | last3 = Holcomb | first3 = P.J. | year = 2003 | title = Semantic integration in videos of real0world events: an electrophysiological investigation | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 160–164 | doi=10.1111/1469-8986.00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all been used to study the N400, just to name a few.

==Functional sensitivity==

Extensive research has been carried out to better understand what kinds of experimental manipulations do and do not affect the N400. General findings are discussed below.

===Factors that affect N400 amplitude===
The frequency of a word's usage is known to affect the amplitude of the N400. With all else being constant, highly frequent words elicit reduced N400s relative to infrequent words.&lt;ref name=vanpetten90&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Petten | first1 = C. | last2 = Kutas | first2 = M. | year = 1990 | title = Interactions between sentence context and word frequency in event-related brain potentials | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 380–393 | doi=10.3758/bf03197127}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously mentioned, N400 amplitude is also reduced by repetition, such that a word's second presentation exhibits a more positive response when repeated in context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Petten | first1 = C. | last2 = Kutas | first2 = M. | last3 = Kluender | first3 = R. | last4 = Mitchiner | first4 = M. | last5 = McIsaac | first5 = H. | year = 1991 | title = Fractionating the word repetition effect with event-related potentials | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 131–150 | doi=10.1162/jocn.1991.3.2.131 | pmid=23972089}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that when a word is highly frequent or has recently appeared in context, it eases the semantic processing thought to be indexed by the N400, reducing its amplitude.

N400 amplitude is also sensitive to a word's neighborhood size, or how many other words differ from it by only one [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] (e.g. ''boot'' and ''boat''). Words with large neighborhoods (that have many other physically similar items) elicit larger N400 amplitudes than do words with small neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holcomb | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Grainger | first2 = J. | last3 = O'Rourke | first3 = T. | year = 2002 | title = An electrophysiology study of the effects of orthographic neighborhood size on printed word perception | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 938–950 | doi=10.1162/089892902760191153 | pmid=12191460}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding also holds true for pseudowords, or pronounceable letter strings that are not real words (e.g. flom), which are not themselves meaningful but look like words. This has been taken as evidence that the N400 reflects general activation in the [[Understanding|comprehension]] network, such that items that look like many words (regardless of whether it itself is a word) partially activate the representations of similar-looking words, producing a more negative N400.

The N400 is sensitive to [[priming (psychology)|priming]]: in other words, its amplitude is reduced when a target word is preceded by a word that is semantically, morphologically, or orthographically related to it.&lt;ref name="review1" /&gt;

In a sentence context, an important determinant of N400 amplitude elicited by a word is its cloze probability. Cloze probability is defined as the probability of the target word completing that particular sentence frame. Kutas and Hillyard (1984) found that a word's N400 amplitude has a nearly inverse linear relationship with its cloze probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kutas | first1 = M. | last2 = Hillyard | first2 = S. A. | year = 1984 | title = Brain potentials during reading reflect word expectancy and semantic association | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 307 | issue = | pages = 161–163 | doi=10.1038/307161a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, as a word becomes less expected in context, its N400 amplitude is increased relative to more expected words. Words that are incongruent with a context (and thus have a cloze probability of 0) elicit large N400 amplitudes as well (although the amplitude of the N400 for incongruent words is also modulated by the cloze probability of the congruent word that would have been expected in its place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borovsky | first1 = A. | last2 = Kutas | first2 = M. | last3 = Elman | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Learning to use words: Event related potentials index single-shot contextual word learning | journal = Cognition | volume = 116 | issue = 2 | pages = 289–296 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.004 | pmid=20621846 | pmc=2904319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, the N400 amplitude elicited by open-class words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) is reduced for words appearing later in a sentence compared to earlier words.&lt;ref name="vanpetten90" /&gt; Taken together, these findings suggest that when the prior context builds up meaning, it makes the processing of upcoming words that fit with that context easier, reducing the N400 amplitude they elicit.

===Factors that do not affect N400 amplitude===
While the N400 is larger to unexpected items at the end of a sentence, its amplitude is generally unaffected by [[negation]] that causes the last word to be untrue and thus anomalous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischler | first1 = I. | last2 = Bloom | first2 = P.A. | last3 = Childers | first3 = D.G. | last4 = Roucos | first4 = S.E. | last5 = Perry | first5 = N.W. | year = 1983 | title = Brain potentials related to stages of sentence verification | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 400–410 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1983.tb00920.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence ''A sparrow is a '''building''''', the N400 response to ''building'' is more negative than the N400 response to bird in the sentence ''A sparrow is a '''bird'''''. In this case, '''building''' has a lower cloze probability, and so it is less expected than ''bird''. However, if [[negation]] is added to both sentences in the form of the word ''not'' (i.e. ''A sparrow is not a '''building''''' and ''A sparrow is not a '''bird'''''), the N400 amplitude to ''building'' will still be more negative than that seen to ''bird''. This suggests that the N400 responds to the relationship between words in context, but is not necessarily sensitive to the sentence's [[truth value]]. More recent research, however, has demonstrated that the N400 can sometimes be modulated by quantifiers or adjectives that serve negation-like purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Urbach | first=Thomas | last2=Kutas | first2=Marta | title=Quantifiers more or less quantify online: ERP evidence for partial incremental interpretation | year=2010 | journal=Journal of Memory and Language | pmid=20640044 | volume=63 | issue=2 | pages=158–79 | pmc=2902883 | doi=10.1016/j.jml.2010.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[Pragmatics (linguistics)|pragmatically]] licensed negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nieuwland | first=Mante | last2=Kuperberg | first2=Gina | title=When the truth is not too hard to handle: an event-related potential study on the pragmatics of negation | year=2008 | journal=Psychological Science | volume=19 | issue=12 | pages=1213–8|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02226.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, grammatical violations do not elicit a large N400 response. Rather, these types of violations show a large positivity from about 500-1000 ms after stimulus onset, known as the [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]].&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt;

===Factors that affect N400 latency===
A striking feature of the N400 is the general invariance of its latency. Although many different experimental manipulations affect the amplitude of the N400, few factors (aging and disease states and language proficiency being rare examples) alter the timing of the N400 component.&lt;ref&gt;Federmeier, K. D. and Laszlo, S.  (2009).  Time for meaning:  Electrophysiology provides insights into the dynamics of representation and processing in semantic memory.  In B. H. Ross (Ed.), Psychology of Learning and Motivation, Volume 51 (pp 1-44).  Burlington:  Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Although localization of the neural generators of an ERP signal is difficult due to the spreading of current from the source to the sensors, multiple techniques can be used to provide converging evidence about possible neural sources.&lt;ref&gt;Haan, H., Streb, J., Bien, S., &amp; Ro, F. (2000). Reconstructions of the Semantic N400 Effect : Using a Generalized Minimum Norm Model with Different Constraints ( L1 and L2 Norm ), 192, 178–192.&lt;/ref&gt; Using methods such as recordings directly off the surface of the brain or from electrodes implanted in the brain, evidence from brain damaged patients, and [[Magnetoencephalography|magnetoencephalographic (MEG)]] recordings (which measure magnetic activity at the scalp associated with the electrical signal measured by ERPs), the left [[temporal lobe]] has been highlighted as an important source for the N400, with additional contributions from the right [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Petten | first1 = C. | last2 = Luka | first2 = B. | year = 2006 | title = Neural localization of semantic context effects in electromagnetic and [[hemodynamic]] studies | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 97 | issue = 3| pages = 279–293 | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, however, activity in a wide network of brain areas is elicited in the N400 time window, suggesting a highly distributed neural source (See Kutas &amp; Federmeier, 2011,&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt; for a more complete discussion).

==Theories==
There is still much debate as to exactly what kind of neural and comprehension processes the N400 indexes. Some researchers believe that the underlying processes reflected in the N400 occur after a stimulus has been recognized. For example, Brown and Hagoort (1993) believe that the N400 occurs late in the processing stream, and reflects the integration of a word's meaning into the preceding context (see Kutas &amp; Federmeier, in press,&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt; for a discussion). However, this account cannot explain why items that themselves have no meaning (e.g. pseudowords) also elicit the N400. Other researchers believe that the N400 occurs much earlier, before words are recognized, and represents [[orthography|orthographic]] or [[phonological]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deacon | first1 = D. | last2 = Dynowska | first2 = A. | last3 = Ritter | first3 = W. | last4 = Grose-Fifer | first4 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Repetition and semantic priming of nonwords: Implications for theories of N400 and word recognition | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 60–74 | doi=10.1111/1469-8986.00120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent accounts posit that the N400 represents a broader range of processes indexing access to [[semantic memory]].  According to this account, it represents the binding of information obtained from stimulus input with representations from short- and long-term [[memory]] (such as recent context, and accessing a word's meaning in long term memory) that work together to create meaning from the information available in the current context (Federmeier &amp; Laszlo, 2009; see Kutas &amp; Federmeier, in press&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt;). As research in the field of electrophysiology continues to progress, these theories will likely be refined to include a complete account of just what the N400 represents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8417">The '''Obligatory Contour Principle''' (frequently abbreviated '''OCP''') is a hypothesis in [[autosegmental phonology]] that states that (certain) consecutive identical [[distinctive feature|features]] are banned in [[underlying representations]]. The OCP is most frequently cited when discussing the tones of [[tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]] (stating for example that the same [[morpheme]] may not have two underlying high tones), but it has also been applied to other aspects of phonology.

==Background considerations==

A commonly held conception within phonology is that no [[morpheme]] is allowed to contain two consecutive high [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. If two consecutive high tones appear within a single morpheme, then some rule must have applied {{Harv|Odden|1986}}. Maybe one of the surface high-tone vowels was underlyingly high-toned, while the other was underlyingly toneless. Then, since all vowels must have tone at the surface (in this hypothetical language), the high tone of the one vowel [[feature spreading|spreads]] onto the other (see: [[autosegmental phonology]]). Alternatively, one (or both) of the vowels may have started out low-toned and become high-toned due to the application of some rule; or perhaps there was a low tone between the two high tones that got deleted at some point. Regardless, the OCP claims that there can not have been two consecutive high tones (nor two consecutive low tones, etc.) in the underlying representation of the morpheme, i.e. in the morpheme's [[lexicon|lexical entry]].

==History==

The ''locus classicus'' of the OCP is {{Harvcoltxt|Leben|1973}}, in which it was formulated as a [[morpheme-structure constraint]] precluding sequences of identical tones from [[underlying representations]]. In [[autosegmental phonology]] {{Harvcol|Goldsmith|1976}}, with articulated conceptions about associations between featural melodies and skeletal units (i.e. [[CV phonology]], see {{Harvcolnb|McCarthy|1979}}, {{Harvcolnb|McCarthy|1981}},  {{Harvcolnb|Steriade|1982}},  {{Harvcolnb|Clements|Keyser|1983}}), [[moraic phonology]] (Hyman 1985, Hayes 1989), the OCP was considered to be relevant to adjacent singly linked melodies but not to doubly linked melodies. The OCP in this 'rules and constraints' era was no longer simply a constraint on underlying forms, but also began to play a role in the course of a [[phonological]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]. {{Harvtxt|McCarthy|1986}} proposed that the OCP can actively block the application of or repair the output of phonological rules, while in {{Harvtxt|Yip|1988}}, [[Moira Yip]] attempted to extend the role of the OCP to trigger the application of rules as well. However, there was also a strong opposition to the OCP as a formal constraint in phonological theory, headed by [[David Odden]]. {{Harvtxt|Odden|1986}} showed that, contrary to the contemporaneous assumption that constraints were inviolable, an examination of African tonal systems reveals many apparent surface violations of the OCP. A lively debate continued between [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John McCarthy]] and David Odden for several years, with each adding an extra 'anti-' to the title of the previous article of the other - e.g. "Anti anti-gemination and the OCP" {{Harv|Odden|1988}}, a reply to {{Harv|McCarthy|1986}}.

==Debate==

In [[Optimality Theory]] (OT) ({{Harvcolnb|Prince|Smolensky|2004}}), the OCP has been again redefined as a violable constraint. Yet many issues as to its precise formal character remain: (i) locality - what is the domain of the OCP (i.e. strict adjacency? etc.) and how is the domain represented in the theory; (ii) near-identical sequences - many languages show an OCP-like resistance to sequences of segments that differ in just one [[distinctive feature]]; is this the effect of the OCP, some other constraint? If the latter, how is this constraint formally related to the OCP; (iii) status as an OT constraint - is the OCP a single constraint, or is it the [[local self-conjunction]] of [[markedness]] constraints (Alderete 1997)?  These and other issues related to the OCP continue to be hotly debated in phonological theory.

==Meeussen's Rule==
A particular instance of the OCP is [[Meeussen's Rule]] {{Harvcol|Goldsmith|1984}}, named after the Belgian Bantu specialist [[A. E. Meeussen]], which has been used to explain how a sequence HH tones becomes HL in various [[Bantu languages]].

A '''paint marker''' is a type of [[marker pen]] that is used to create permanent writing on a variety of surfaces such as paper, metal, stone, rubber, plastic, and glass.

==Ink==
Unlike with most [[permanent marker]]s the ink is an oil-based paint and generally requires shaking before use, similar to an aerosol [[spray paint]] can. In addition, the line is very opaque and, unlike spirit-based or other permanent inks, will not fade with exposure to UV light, and overlays all other colors beneath it.  The paint from these types of markers is not truly permanent, as it can be removed using [[high pressure cleaning]] or [[paint thinner|paint thinning]] [[solvent]]s such as [[acetone]].

==Dangers==
Paint markers, and permanent markers generally, contain the toxic compounds [[xylene]] or [[toluene]]. Like spray paint, these markers give off [[volatile organic compounds]], which can be dangerous when not used in a well ventilated area or with a [[particulate mask]]. Gloves can also be worn to avoid absorption through the skin.

==Solidified paint pens==
Another type of paint marker is the solidified paint pen.  This is a type of marker, often contained within a twist tube, that is a cylinder of semi-hardened oil-paint with a pointed tip. As one writes with it, the point wears down and must be advanced to in order to continue writing. The marker leaves a mark similar to that of [[chalk]].  It is useful for marking on wet or oily surfaces.  It is sold under the brand name [[Mean Streak Marker|MeanStreak]] in the United States and generic versions are also available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paintmarkersource.com/shop/en/24-solid-paint-marker-.html|publisher=Carmel Industries|title=Solid Paint Marker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is made by [[Sanford (writing products)|Sanford]], the maker of Sharpies, but there are many different brands and types of solidified paint pens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nordicmaling.dk/|title=Sadolin Colour Paint Marker Nordicmaling|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Paint pens are used for a variety of purposes. Their most general usage is on windows, and they are often used to advertise sales or discounts meant to bring prospective buyers in. Restaurant's often hire a professional artist to "paint" with the markers on their windows. Another popular use is for [[tire lettering]], where auto enthusiasts use the markers to customize the look of their tires.

'''Precognition''' (from the [[Latin]] ''prae-'', "before" and ''cognitio'', "acquiring knowledge"), also called '''prescience''', '''future vision''', '''future sight''' is a claimed [[psychic]] ability to see events in the future.

As with other forms of [[extrasensory perception]], there is no accepted scientific evidence that precognition is a real phenomenon and it is widely considered to be [[pseudoscience]]. Precognition also appears to violate the principle of [[causality]], that an effect cannot occur before its cause.

Precognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people still believe it to be real; it is still widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the [[parapsychology]] community.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Since ancient times, precognition has been associated with [[trance]] and [[dream]] states involved in phenomena such as [[prophecy]], [[fortune telling]] and [[second sight]], as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.&lt;ref name="inglis"&gt;Inglis (1985), Chapter on "Precognition"&lt;/ref&gt;

Such claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. [[Aristotle]] carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. He accepted that "it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]" but also believed that "most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere [[coincidence]]s...". Where [[Democritus]] had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. (350 BC). On Prophesying by Dreams.  [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prophesying.html Trans. J.I. Beare], MIT. (Retrieved 5 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th–19th centuries===
The term "precognition" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.&lt;ref name="inglis"/&gt;

An early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African [[witch-doctor]] whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.&lt;ref name="inglis"/&gt;

===Early 20th century===
In the early 20th century [[J. W. Dunne]], a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]''. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.&lt;ref name="dunne1927"&gt;Dunne (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Flew|Flew, Antony]]; "The Sources of Serialism'', in Shivesh Thakur (Ed). ''Philosophy and Psychical Research'', George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd. 1976, pp. 81-96. {{ISBN|0-04-100041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Donnell, ''The Paranormal Explained''. Lulu 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dunne1927" /&gt; In 1932 he helped the [[Society for Psychical Research]] to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] failed to agree on the significance of the results.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''. Paladin (Grafton), 1986, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunne (1927), 3rd Edition, Faber, 1934, ''Appendix III: The new experiment''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the Philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] remarked that, "The only theory known to me which seems worth consideration is that proposed by Mr. Dunne in his Experiment with Time."&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Broad; "The Philosophical Implications of Foreknowledge", ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes'', Vol. 16, Knowledge and Foreknowledge (1937), pp. 177-209&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s infant son was kidnapped, murdered and buried among trees. The psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees. This number was no better than chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = D. R. | year = 1937 | title = A Note on the Possible Clairvoyance of Dreams | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 309–313 | doi=10.1080/00223980.1937.9917500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ongoing and organized research program on precognition was instituted by [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] in the 1930s at [[Duke University]]'s [[Rhine Research Center|Parapsychology Laboratory]]. Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Gulliksen]]. (1938). ''Extra-Sensory Perception: What Is It?''. American Journal of Sociology. Vol. 43, No. 4. pp. 623-634. "Investigating Rhine's methods, we find that his mathematical methods are wrong and that the effect of this error would in some cases be negligible and in others very marked. We find that many of his experiments were set up in a manner which would tend to increase, instead of to diminish, the possibility of systematic clerical errors; and lastly, that the ESP cards can be read from the back."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Wiggins (2001), p. 156: "It is now known that the experiments conducted in his laboratory contained serious methodological flaws. Tests often took place with minimal or no screening between the subject and the person administering the test. Subjects could see the backs of cards that were later discovered to be so cheaply printed that a faint outline of the symbol could be seen. Furthermore, in face-to-face tests, subjects could see card faces reflected in the tester’s eyeglasses or cornea. They were even able to (consciously or unconsciously) pick up clues from the tester’s facial expression and voice inflection. In addition, an observant subject could identify the cards by certain irregularities like warped edges, spots on the backs, or design imperfections."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hines (2003), pp. 78–81. "The procedural errors in the Rhine experiments have been extremely damaging to his claims to have demonstrated the existence of ESP. Equally damaging has been the fact that the results have not replicated when the experiments have been conducted in other laboratories."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Soal|Samuel G. Soal]] was described by Rhine as one of his harshest critics, running many similar experiments with wholly negative results. However from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came ''after'' the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate.&lt;ref name="colman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=Facts, Fallacies and Frauds in Psychology|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1988|pages=175–180|isbn=0-04-445289-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhine now described Soal's work as "a milestone in the field".&lt;ref name="colman" /&gt; However analyses of Soal's findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud.&lt;ref name="hyman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hyman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Ray|authorlink= |editor=Robert J. Sternberg |editor2=Henry L. Roediger |editor3=Diane F. Halpern |title=Critical Thinking in Psychology |year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-60834-1 |pages=219–223 |chapter=Evaluating Parapsychological Claims }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy continued for many years more.&lt;ref name="colman" /&gt; In 1978 the statistician and [[paragnost]]{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=WTF?}} Betty Markwick, while seeking to vindicate Soal, discovered that he had tampered with his data.&lt;ref name="hyman" /&gt; The untainted experimental results showed no evidence of precognition.&lt;ref name="colman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Betty Markwick. (1985). ''The establishment of data manipulation in the Soal-Shackleton experiments''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. ''A Skeptic’s Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 287-312. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th century===
As more modern technology became available, more automated techniques of experimentation were developed that did not rely on hand-scoring of equivalence between targets and guesses, and in which the targets could be more reliably and readily tested at random. In 1969 [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] introduced the use of high-speed random event generators (REG) for precognition testing, and experiments were also conducted at the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab]].&lt;ref name=Smee&gt;{{cite journal |title=The lab that asked the wrong questions |journal=Nature |date=March 1, 2007 |first=Lucy |last=Odling-Smee |issue=7131 |pages=10–11 |doi=10.1038/446010a |url=http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |accessdate=2007-06-29 |volume=446 |pmid=17330012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630213439/http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |df= |bibcode=2007Natur.446...10O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, flaws were found in all of Schmidt's experiments, when the psychologist [[C. E. M. Hansel]] found that several necessary precautions were not taken.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation''. Prometheus Books. pp. 222-232. Hansel found that in the experiments of Schmidt there was no presence of an observer or second-experimenter in any of the experiments, no counterchecking of the records and no separate machines used for high and low score attempts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the [[BBC]] television programme ''Monitor'' broadcast an appeal by the writer [[J.B. Priestley]] for experiences which challenged our understanding of Time. He received hundreds of letters in reply and believed that many of them described genuine precognitive dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''. Paladin (Grafton), 1986, p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priestley1964"&gt;Priestley (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the BBC Radio 4 broadcaster [[Francis Spufford]] revisited Priestley's work and its relation to the ideas of J.W. Dunne.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Spufford, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04h7lr0 I Have Been Here Before]", ''Sunday Feature'', BBC Radio 3, 14 Sep 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ryback, a psychologist in [[Atlanta]], used a questionnaire survey approach to investigate precognitive dreaming in college students.  His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66.9 percent reported some form of paranormal dream.  He rejected many of these reports, but claimed that 8.8 percent of the population was having actual precognitive dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Ryback, David, PhD. "Dreams That Came True". New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

G. W. Lambert, a former Council member of the SPR, proposed five criteria that needed to be met before an account of a precognitive dream could be regarded as credible:&lt;ref name="inglis"/&gt;
#The dream should be reported to a credible witness before the event.
#The time interval between the dream and the event should be short.
#The event should be unexpected at the time of the dream.
#The description should be of an event destined literally, and not symbolically, to happen.
#The details of dream and event should tally.

===21st century===
In 2011 the psychologist [[Daryl Bem]], a Professor Emeritus at [[Cornell University]], published findings showing statistical evidence for precognition in an upper tier journal, the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=DJ|title=Feeling the future: experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=March 2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=407–25|doi=10.1037/a0021524|pmid=21280961|url=http://dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was heavily criticised and the criticism widened to include the journal itself and the validity of the peer review process.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock]], [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/back_from_the_future ''Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair''], March/April 2011 [[Skeptical Inquirer]], January 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/01/06/the-esp-study-when-science-goes-psychic/when-peer-review-falters | work=The New York Times | title=Room for Debate: When Peer Review Falters | date=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public controversy over the paper continued until in 2012 the results were published of an independent attempt to reproduce Bem's results, which failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rouder | first1 = J. | last2 = Morey | first2 = R. | year = 2011 | title = A Bayes factor meta-analysis of Bem's ESP claim | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13423-011-0088-7.pdf| journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 682–689 | doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0088-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bem|first=Daryl|title=Response to Alcock’s "Back from the Future: Comments on Bem"|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/response_to_alcocks_back_from_the_future_comments_on_bem|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alcock|first=James|title=Response to Bem’s Comments|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/response_to_bems_comments|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galak | first1 = J. | last2 = LeBoeuf | first2 = R.

==Scientific criticism==
Claims of precognition are, like any other claims, open to scientific criticism. However the nature of the criticism must adapt to the nature of the claim.&lt;ref name="hyman217"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyman|first=Ray|title=Critical Thinking in Psychology|editor=Robert J. Sternberg |editor2=Henry J. Roediger III |editor3=Diane F. Halpern |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|chapter=Evaluating Parapsychological Claims|isbn=0-521-60834-1|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of precognition are criticised on two main grounds:
*There is no known scientific mechanism which would allow precognition and it appears to break known scientific laws.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn &amp; Wiggins (2001), p. 165. "One of the reasons scientists have difficulty believing that psi effects are real is that there is no known mechanism by which they could occur. PK action-at-a-distance would presumably employ an action-at-a-distance force that is as yet unknown to science... Similarly, there is no known sense (stimulation and receptor) by which thoughts could travel from one person to another by which the mind could project itself elsewhere in the present, future, or past."&lt;/ref&gt;
*A large body of experimental work has produced no accepted scientific evidence that precognition exists.

Consequently, precognition is widely considered to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock|Alcock, James]]. (1981). ''Parapsychology-Science Or Magic?: A Psychological Perspective'' Pergamon Press. pp. 3-6. {{ISBN|978-0080257730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zusne, Leonard; Jones, Warren H. (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. p. 151. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarelli, Saundra E; Meyer, Glenn E. ''Psychology''. (2007). Prentice Hall Higher Education. p. 118. {{ISBN|978-0136030638}} "Precognition is the supposed ability to know something in advance of its occurrence or to predict a future event."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violation of natural law===
Precognition would violate the principle of antecedence ([[causality]]), that an effect does not happen before its cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Bunge|Bunge, Mario]]. (1983). ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy: Volume 6: Epistemology &amp; Methodology II: Understanding the World''. Springer. pp. 225-226. {{ISBN|978-9027716347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hyman217" /&gt; Information passing backwards in time would need to be carried by physical particles doing the same. Experimental evidence from high-energy physics suggests that this cannot happen. There is therefore no direct justification for precognition from physics."&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Taylor|Taylor, John]]. (1980). ''Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician''. Temple Smith. p. 83. {{ISBN|0-85117-191-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precognition contradicts "most of the neuroscience and psychology literature, from electrophysiology and neuroimaging to temporal effects found in psychophysical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwarzkopf | first1 = Samuel | year = 2014 | title = We Should Have Seen This Coming | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 332 | pmc=4034337 | pmid=24904372 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a [[delusion]] by mainstream [[psychiatry]].{{cn|date=August 2018|reason=cited source was inappropriate}}

The relatively new discovery of evidence for quantum [[retrocausality]] is sometimes suggested as a possible mechanism for precognition.&lt;ref&gt;Merali, Zeeya. "[http://discovermagazine.com/2010/apr/01-back-from-the-future Back From the Future]". ''Discover'', April 2010. (recovered 5 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; However it is generally held that such "quantum weirdness", even if it is shown to exist, cannot carry information at a macroscopic level.

===Lack of evidence===
A great deal of evidence for precognition has been put forward, both as witnessed anecdotes and as experimental results, but none has yet been accepted as rigorous scientific proof of the phenomenon.{{cn|date=September 2018|reason=open to challenge?}}

====Alternative explanations====
Various known psychological processes have been put forward to explain experiences of apparent precognition. These include:

*''[[Déjà vu]]'' or ''identifying paramnesia'', in which people conjure up a false memory of a vision having occurred before the actual event.
* ''[[subliminal stimuli|Unconscious perception]]'' by which people unconsciously infer, from data they have unconsciously learned, that a certain event will probably happen in a certain context. When the event occurs, the former knowledge appears to have been acquired without the aid of recognized channels of information.
* ''[[Self-fulfilling prophecy]]'' and ''Unconscious enactment'' in which people unconsciously bring about events which they have previously imagined.
* ''[[List of memory biases|Memory biases]]'' where people selectively remember or distort past experiences to match subsequent events.&lt;ref name="hines"&gt;Hines (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcock|first=James E. |title=Parapsychology: Science or Magic?: a psychological perspective| publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford |year=1981|isbn=0-08-025773-9}} via Hines (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams. This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Madey |first=Scott|author2=Thomas Gilovich| title=Effects of Temporal Focus on the Recall of Expectancy-Consistent and Expectancy-Inconsistent Information|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=65|issue=3|year=1993|pmid=8410650|pages=458–68|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.458}} via {{cite book|last=Kida |first=Thomas|title=Don't Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking|year=2006|publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-408-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
===Popular belief===
[[Premonition]]s have sometimes affected the course of important historical events. Related activities such as [[prophecy]] and [[fortune telling]] have been practised throughout history and are still popular today.

Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people still believe in precognition.&lt;ref name="Priestley1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peake, Anthony; ''The Labyrinth of Time'', Arcturus, 2012, Chapter 10: "Dreams and precognition".&lt;/ref&gt; A 1978 poll found that 37% of Americans surveyed believed in it.&lt;ref name="Association1978"&gt;{{citation|author=American Bar Association|title=ABA Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOPLuo4B-4EC&amp;pg=PA1847|date=December 1978|publisher=American Bar Association|pages=1847–|issn=0747-0088|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some psychologists, belief is greater in college women than in men, and a 2007 poll found that women were more prone to superstitious beliefs in general.&lt;ref name="Vyse2013"&gt;{{citation|author=Stuart A. Vyse|title=Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition - Updated Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDNpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=1 September 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-999693-3|pages=45–|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laysummary=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have been carried out on psychological reasons for such a belief. One such study suggested that greater belief in precognition was held by those who feel low in [[Self-control|control]], and the belief can act as a psychological [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenaway | first1 = KH | last2 = Louis | first2 = WR | last3 = Hornsey | first3 = MJ | year = 2013 | title = Loss of Control Increases Belief in Precognition and Belief in Precognition Increases Control | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 8| page = e71327 | pmc=3737190 | pmid=23951136 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071327| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...871327G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''Radio programming''' is the process of [[broadcast programming|organising a schedule]] of [[radio format|radio content]] for [[commercial broadcasting]] and [[public broadcasting]] by [[radio station]]s.

The original inventors of [[radio]], from [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s time on, expected it to be used for one-on-one [[wireless]] communication tasks where [[telephone]]s and [[telegraph]]s could not be used because of the problems involved in stringing [[copper wire]]s from one point to another, such as in ship-to-shore communications. Those inventors had no expectations whatever that radio would become a major [[mass media]] [[entertainment]] and information medium earning many millions of dollars in revenues annually through [[radio advertising]] commercials or [[sponsorship]]. These latter uses were brought about after 1920 by business entrepreneurs such as [[David Sarnoff]], who created the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), and [[William S. Paley]], who built [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS). These broadcasting (as opposed to [[narrowcasting]]) business organizations began to be called [[network affiliate]]s, because they consisted of loose chains of individual stations located in various cities, all transmitting the standard overall-system supplied fare, often at synchronized agreed-upon times. Some of these [[radio network]] stations were [[owned and operated]] by the networks, while others were [[independent radio]] owned by entrepreneurs allied with the respective networks. By selling blocks of time to advertisers, the medium was able to quickly become profitable and offer its products to listeners for free, provided they invested in a radio receiver set.

The new medium had grown rapidly through the 1930s, vastly increasing both the size of its [[audience]] and its profits. In those early days, it was customary for a corporation to sponsor an entire half-hour radio program, placing its commercials at the beginning and the end. This is in contrast to the pattern which developed late in the 20th century in both television and radio, where small slices of time were sold to many sponsors and no corporation claimed or wanted sponsorship of the entire show, except in rare cases. These later [[radio commercial|commercials]] also filled a much larger portion of the total program time than they had in the earlier days.

In the early radio age, content typically included a balance of [[Radio comedy|comedy]], [[Radio drama|drama]], news, music and sports reporting. Variety radio programs included the most famous [[Hollywood]] talent of the day. During the 1920s, radio focused on musical entertainment, the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', has been focused on broadcasting [[country music]] since it began in 1925. Radio [[soap opera]]s began in the U.S. in 1930 with ''[[Painted Dreams]]''. ''[[Lørdagsbarnetimen]]'', a Norwegian children's show, with its premiere in 1924 interrupted only by the Second World War, was the longest running radio show in the world until it ceased production in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.nrk.no/kultur_og_underholdning/1.7264676 Kultur og underholdning]''" (Norwegian){{spaced ndash}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrk.no%2Fkultur-og-underholdning%2F1.7264676 English translation by Google translate]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, [[television program]]ming eroded the popularity of radio comedy, drama and variety shows.&lt;ref name="listening"&gt;(26 November 1956).

[[File:Satyendranath Dutta, Bengali Poet's photo...jpg|right]]
'''Satyendranath Dutta''' (also spelt as '''Satyendranath Datta''' or '''Satyendra Nath Dutta''') ({{lang-bn|সত্যেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত}}) (1882 – 25 June 1922), a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet, is considered the wizard of rhymes (or ছন্দের যাদুকর - ''chhonder jadukar'' in  [[Bengali language|Bengali]]). Satyendranath Dutta was an expert in many disciplines of intellectual enquiry  including medieval Indian history, culture, and mythology.&lt;ref name=pedia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rasid|first1=Md. Harun-ar|title=Dutta, Satyendranath|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutta,_Satyendranath|website=Banglapedia|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Satyendranath Dutta was the son of Rajaninath Dutta, who was a trader. He was born at Nimta, 24 Parganas (north). The family hailed from Chupi in [[Purba Bardhaman district]] on February 11, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861692768|title=Historical dictionary of the Bengalis|last=Kunal.|first=Chakrabarti,|others=Chakrabarti, Shubhra, 1954-|isbn=9780810853348|location=Lanham [Maryland]|oclc=861692768}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, [[Akshay Kumar Datta]], was a great thinker, [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo]] social reformer and writer who was the guiding spirit of the [[Tattwabodhini Patrika]]. After passing the school leaving examination from the Central Collegiate School, he received his graduate level education from the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta|General Assembly’s Institution]] in [[Kolkata]]. Although he left (what is now) [[Scottish Church College]] without taking a degree, his training there helped him immensely for the future. After unsuccessfully to join the ranks of his father in their family business, he quit that to devote his energies entirely to scholarly pursuits.He wrote poems like Jatir Pati.

==Death==
He died on June 25, 1922, aged 40. Rabindranath Tagore has immortalized Satyendranath in a poem written after his death. A street in South Kolkata has been named after him.

==Works==
Satyendranath Dutta composed poems and initially composed poems for the Bengali magazine ''Bharati''. Although his stylistic nuances during this stage reflect the influence of [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]], Akshay Kumar Boral, and Debendranath Sen, his later poetry illustrates a greater resonance with the poetry of [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

Dutta wrote under multiple pseudonyms, including ''Nabakumar'', ''Kaviratna'', ''Ashitipar Sharma'', ''Tribikram Varman'' and ''Kalamgir''.

Secondary data analysis can save time that would otherwise be spent collecting data and, particularly in the case of [[quantitative data]], can provide larger and higher-quality [[database]]s that would be unfeasible for any individual researcher to collect on their own. In addition, analysts of social and economic change consider secondary data essential, since it is impossible to conduct a new survey that can adequately capture past change and/or developments. However, secondary data analysis can be less useful in marketing research, as data may be outdated or inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sources of secondary data==
Secondary data can be obtained from different sources:
* information collected through [[census]]es or government departments like housing, social security, electoral statistics, tax records 
* internet searches or libraries
* progress reports

===Administrative data and census===

Government departments and agencies routinely collect information when registering people or carrying out transactions, or for record keeping – usually when delivering a service. This information is called administrative data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ADRN » What are administrative data |url= http://adrn.ac.uk/admin-data/admindata/ |website= adrn.ac.uk |access-date= 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* personal information such as names, dates of birth, addresses
* information about schools and educational achievements
* information about health
* information about criminal convictions or prison sentences
* tax records, such as income

A [[census]] is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. It is a type of administrative data, but it is collected for the purpose of research at specific intervals. Most administrative data is collected continuously and for the purpose of delivering a service to the people.

==Advantages and disadvantages of secondary data==

Secondary data is available from other sources and may already have been used in previous research, making it easier to carry out further research. It is time-saving and cost-efficient: the data was collected by someone other than the researcher. Administrative data and census data may cover both larger and much smaller samples of the population in detail. Information collected by the government will also cover parts of the population that may be less likely to respond to the census (in countries where this is optional).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ADRN » Benefits of administrative data|url = http://adrn.ac.uk/admin-data/benefits/|website = adrn.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear benefit of using secondary data is that much of the background work needed has already been carried out, such as [[literature review]]s or [[Case study|case studies]]. The data may have been used in published texts and [[Descriptive statistics|statistics]] elsewhere, and the data could already be promoted in the media or bring in useful personal contacts. Secondary data generally have a pre-established degree of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] which need not be re-examined by the researcher who is re-using such data.

Secondary data can provide a baseline for primary research to compare the collected primary data results to and it can also be helpful in [[research design]].

However, secondary data can present problems, too. The data may be out of date or inaccurate. If using data collected for different research purposes, it may not cover those samples of the population researchers want to examine, or not in sufficient detail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Administrative data, which is not originally collected for research, may not be available in the usual research formats or may be difficult to get access to.

==Secondary analysis or re-use of qualitative data==
While 'secondary data' is typically associated with quantitative databases, analysis focused on verbal or visual materials created for another purpose, is a legitimate avenue for the qualitative researcher. Actually one could go as far as claim that qualitative secondary data analysis “can be understood, not so much as the analysis of pre-existing data; rather as involving a process of re-contextualising, and re-constructing, data.”&lt;ref&gt;Moore, N. (2006). ‘The contexts of context:  Broadening perspectives in the (re)use of qualitative data’, Sociological Research Online [Online], Special Section on Reusing Qualitative Data, 12(3) http://erdt.plymouth.ac.uk/mionline/public_html/viewarticle.php?id=27&amp;layout=html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of secondary qualitative data, good [[documentation]] cannot be underestimated as it provides future researchers with the background and context and allows replication.&lt;ref name="socresonline.org.uk"&gt;Bishop, L. (May 2007) 'A reflexive account of reusing qualitative data: beyond primary/secondary dualism', Sociological Research Online [Online], Special Section on Reusing Qualitative Data, 12(3) http://www.socresonline.org.uk/12/3/2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sin City''' is an urban area (a city or part of) that caters to various [[vice]]s. These vices may be [[legal]] (depending on area) or illegal activities which are tolerated.

Examples of vices include [[sexual intercourse|sex]]-related [[Sex industry|services]] ([[prostitution]], [[strip club]]s, [[sex shop]]s, etc.), [[gambling]] ([[casino]]s, [[betting shop]]s, etc.), or [[recreational drug use|drug]] use ([[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], etc. consumption), and even excessive [[organized crime]] and [[gang activity]]. If the city is known for prostitution, it is often called a [[red-light district]], as in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]].

The following is an overview of the '''grammar''' of the '''[[Slovene language]]'''.

==Common phonological changes==

As in most other Slavic languages, changes to consonants and vowels often occur between related forms of words. Most of these can be traced back to changes that occurred in the ancestral [[Proto-Slavic language]]. Over time, many of the original changes have been reversed or levelled out.

===Consonant alternations===

* The '''[[Slavic first palatalization]]''' causes alternations in the consonants '''k''', '''g''' and '''h'''. It occurs in the present tense of consonant stem verbs, and when certain suffixes (often beginning with ''e'' or ''i'') are attached to words.
* The '''[[Slavic second palatalization]]''' affects the same consonants, but has different results, and occurs most notably in the imperative form of consonant stem verbs.
* '''Iotation''' is the effect that the consonant '''j''' has on a preceding consonant. It may merge with the preceding consonant, causing effects similar to the first palatalization, or it may cause other changes. However, not all instances of ''j'' have this effect. This change happens in the present forms of certain verbs in ''-ati''.

The following table gives an overview of the above changes:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 40em"
! Normal
| b || p || v || m || d || t || s || z || g || k || h
|-
! First palatalization
| b || p || v || m || d || t || s || z || ž || č || š
|-
! Second palatalization
| b || p || v || m || d || t || s || z || z || c || s
|-
! Iotation
| blj || plj || vlj || mlj || j || č || š || ž || ž || č || š
|}

These changes are very similar to those found in the related [[Serbo-Croatian language]], but in iotation, Slovene ''j'' corresponding to Serbo-Croatian ''đ'', and ''č'' with ''ć''.

===Hard and soft stems===

Word stems that end in '''c''', '''č''', '''š''', '''ž''' or '''j''' are called "soft" stems, while the remainder is "hard". When endings begin with '''-o-''', this vowel usually becomes '''-e-''' after a soft stem; this is called "preglas" in Slovene. This happens in many noun and adjective declensions, and also in some verbs. For example, the instrumental singular form of ''korak'' "step" is ''korak'''o'''m'', while for ''stric'' "uncle" it is ''stric'''e'''m''.

There are also some instances where the vowel stays as ''o'', such as the accusative singular of feminine nouns. These instances can be traced back to an earlier nasal vowel ''ǫ'' in Proto-Slavic, which did not undergo this change.

===Fill vowel===

When certain hard-to-pronounce [[consonant cluster]]s occur word-finally, an additional fill vowel is inserted before the last consonant(s) of the word to break up the cluster. This typically happens where there is no ending, like in the nominative singular, or the genitive dual and plural. The fill vowel is usually a schwa ({{IPA|/ə/}}, spelled ''e''). For example, the noun ''igra'' "game" has the genitive plural form ''ig'''e'''r'', not ''igr''.

If the last consonant is ''j'', then ''i'' is used as the fill vowel instead. For example, ''ladja'' "boat" has the genitive plural ''lad'''i'''j''. However, if the stem ends in ''lj'', ''nj'' or ''rj'', then the fill vowel is the normal ''e'' and is inserted before ''both'' consonants. The noun ''og'''e'''nj'' "fire", for example, loses the fill vowel in the genitive singular form ''ognja''.

There are a few cases where the fill vowel is instead a stressed ''a''. These are irregular and must simply be memorized. An example is ''ovca'' "sheep", which is ''ov'''a'''c'' in the genitive plural, not ''ovec''.

==Noun==
{{Main|Slovene declension#Nouns}}

Nouns are marked for case and number. There are 6 cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental) and 3 numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Slovenian nouns are divided into 3 genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Each gender has different declension patterns, for a total of 10 declension forms.

==Adjective==
{{Main|Slovene declension#Adjectives}}

The [[adjective]] expresses three main ideas: quality ('''qualitative adjectives''', ''kakovostni pridevniki''), relation ('''relational adjectives''', ''vrstni pridevniki'') and possession ('''possessive adjectives''', ''svojilni pridevniki'').

Adjectives in Slovenian can serve in three syntactical functions: left attributes (levi prilastek), predicate articles (povedkovo določilo) and predicate attributes (povedkov prilastek).
* Left attribute: '''''Kakšno''''' ''pričesko'' želiš? ('''''What kind of''''' ''haircut'' would you like?)
: &amp;ndash; Želim '''''modno''''' ''pričesko''. (I would like a '''''fashionable''''' ''haircut''.)
* Predicate article: '''''Kakšna''''' ''je'' pričeska? ('''''What''''' ''is'' the haircut '''''like'''''?)
: &amp;ndash; Pričeska ''je'' '''''modna'''''. (The haircut ''is'' '''''fashionable'''''.)
* Predicate attribute: '''''Kakšna''''' ''se je naredila'' pričeska? ('''''What kind of''''' haircut ''has been made''?)
: &amp;ndash; Pričeska ''je bila narejena'' '''''lepa'''''. (The haircut ''has been made'' '''''beautiful'''''.)

The majority of adjectives are of the first kind. These express any qualities and properties of personal and impersonal nouns. Such adjectives are gradable either in the two- or three-step comparison, depending if they are relative to another, opposite adjective (three-step) or not (two-step or three-step). (''lep - grd'' (beautiful - ugly) vs ''bolan'' (ill)).

Relational adjectives express type, class or numerical sequence of a noun. For instance: ''kemijska in fizikalna sprememba'' (chemical and physical change), ''fotografski aparat'' (photographic device (=camera)).

Possessive pronouns define possession, ownership or belonging. For example: ''barvin sijaj'' (the colour's shine), ''Karmenina torbica'' (Karmen's handbag), ''delavska halja'' (workers' overall).

Some adjectives expressing ''properties'' next to masculine nouns imply definiteness ('relation') or indefiniteness ('quality') of nouns.&lt;br&gt;
For an exactly defined noun or a specific type thereof:
* the adjective in nominative singular has the ending '''-ni''' or '''-i'''
* the question word is '''Kateri?''' (''Which?'' (in German ''Welcher?''))
For nouns not exactly defined, being mentioned for the first time or generic:
* the adjective in nominative singular has the ending '''-en''' or '''-''' (no ending)
* the question word is '''Kakšen?''' (''What sort of?'' (in German ''Was für ein?''))
Adjectives ending in ''-i'' and all possessive pronouns do not have special indefinite forms. There are two special adjectives which have special definite and indefinite forms for all genders and all cases, namely ''majhen'' (small) and ''velik'' (big) (the definite forms are ''mali'' and ''veliki'' respectively):

* Stari učitelj je to dejal. (The old teacher said this.) &amp;ndash; the implication here is that there is at least one other teacher who is not old
* Star učitelj je to dejal. (An old teacher said this.)

The adjective matches the subject or the predicate article to which it is ascribed. If it describes two singular nouns or one dual noun, the adjective should be in the dual. If it describes a plural or one singular and one non-singular noun, the adjective should be in the plural. Although gender should match the group, sometimes the gender of the adjacent noun is used with the appropriate grammatical number. For declension patterns of adjectives, see the section on [[#Noun|nouns]] (the fourth declension is always adjectival). Some adjectives, however, are never declined, for example ''bež'' (beige), ''poceni'' (cheap), ''roza'' (pink), ''super'' (super), ''seksi'' (sexy), and some other loanwords.
* Mesto in vas '''sta''' ''bila'' proti predlogu občine. (The city and the village were against the suggestion of the municipality.)
* Mesto in vas '''sta''' ''bili'' proti predlogu občine (the same, but somewhat unusual and seldom heard)
* Ti in tvoji sestri boste precej odšli! (You [masculine since the verb is in masculine] and your two sisters shall leave forthwith.)

Possessive adjectives for masculine and neuter possessed nouns add ''-ov'' (or ''-ev'' if the possessive noun ends in ''c'', ''č'', ''ž'', ''š'' and ''j'' (''"preglas"'')) to the possessive noun. Feminine possessed nouns always take ''-in''. Possessive nouns can include proper names, in which case they are written capitalised.

Negative adjectives are formed by prefixing the negative ''ne-'', which is ''almost'' always a proper form even though sometimes, a Latin prefix is an alternative.
* lep -&gt; nelep (beautiful, not beautiful (but not ugly (grd))
* reverzibilen -&gt; nereverzibilen (reversible, irreversible)
* moralen -&gt; nemoralen (moral, immoral) (note that 'amoral' in English has a different meaning)
* legitimen -&gt; nelegitimen (legitimate, illegitimate)

===Comparative===
The ''[[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]]'' is formed by adding the ending ''-ši'' (''-ša'', ''-še''), ''-ejši'' (''-ejša'', ''-ejše'') or ''-ji'' (''-ja'', ''-je'') to an adjective, or using the word ''bolj'' (more) in front of an adjective in case of stressing and also when the adjective in question cannot be formed by adding an ending, such as when dealing with [[colour]]s, or when the adjective ends in such a sound that it would be difficult to add the appropriate ending:

* lep - lepši (beautiful - more beautiful)
* trd - trši (hard - harder) (-d- falls out)
* zelen - bolj zelen (green - greener)
* zanimiv - zanimivejši (interesting - more interesting)
* transparenten - transparentnejši (transparent - more transparent) (-e- falls out)
* globok - globlji (deep - deeper) (notice the added -l-, -o- and -k- fall out)
* otročji - bolj otročji (childish - more childish)

===Superlative===
The ''[[superlative]]'' is formed by prepending the word ''naj'' directly in front of the comparative, whether it comprises one or two words.

* lep - lepši - najlepši
* trd - trši - najtrši
* zelen - bolj zelen - najbolj zelen
* zanimiv - zanimivejši - najzanimivejši (but najbolj zanimiv is more common)
* transparenten - transparentnejši - najtransparentnejši
* globok - globlji - najgloblji
* otročji - bolj otročji - najbolj otročji'

==Verb==
{{Main|Slovene verbs}}

In Slovenian, the verbs are conjugated for 3 persons and 3 numbers (singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and plural). There are 4 tenses (present, past, pluperfect, and future), 3 moods (indicative, imperative, and conditional) and 2 voices (active and passive). Verbs also have 4 participles and 2 verbal nouns (infinitive and supine). Not all combinations of the above are possible for every case.

==Gerund==
A [[gerund]] is a noun [[word formation|formed]] from a verb, designating an action or a state. The standard substantive in Slovenian ends in ''-anje'' or ''-enje'':

* usklajevati -&gt; usklajevanje (to harmonise -&gt; harmonising)
* pisati -&gt; pisanje (to write -&gt; writing)
* goreti -&gt; gorenje (to burn -&gt; burning)
* saditi -&gt; sajenje (to plant (into soil, as in potatoes (krompir), maize (koruza) or flowers (rože)) -&gt; planting)
* sejati -&gt; sejanje (to plant (by throwing seeds into the air, as in most any [[cereal]] (žito), such as buckwheat (ajda), wheat (pšenica), rice (riž) (but also 'saditi riž'), millet (proso), etc.) -&gt; planting)

For example:
* Pisanje ni naravno: potrebno se ga je priučiti. (Writing is not natural: it must be learnt.)
* Ob visokih temperaturah gašenje ognja ni enostavno. (At high temperatures, putting out a fire is not trivial.)
* Brenčanje mrčesa me spravlja ob živce! (The buzzing of insects is driving me crazy!)

==Numerals==
{{Main|Slovene numerals}}

==Adverb==
The [[adverb]] in Slovene is always the same as the singular neuter form of any given adjective if derived from an adjective.
# "Dan je bil lep." (The day was nice.) - masculine adjective
# "Bilo je '''lepo'''." (It was nice.) - neuter adjective

—&gt; "Imeli smo se ''lepo''." (literally, "We had ourselves nicely.", the meaning is 'We had a nice time.')

—&gt; "Govorili so ''lepo''." (They spoke nicely.)

Other types of adverb are derived from nouns (doma (at home), jeseni (in autumn)), prepositional constructions  (naglas (aloud), pozimi (in winter), potem (then)), verbs (nevede (unknowingly), skrivoma (secretly), mimogrede (by the way)) or numerals (see [[#Adverbial Numeral (Prislovni števnik)|adverbial numeral]]).

In essence, there are four main types of adverb: ''adverbs of time'' (danes (today), večno (perpetually)), ''adverbs of place'' (domov (towards home, homewards)), ''adverbs of manner'' (grdo (uglily), povsem (entirely)) and ''adverbs of cause and reason'' (nalašč (on purpose)).

Adverbs are, much like adjectives, normally gradable.

* To je storil natančno. (This he did carefully.)
** Naslednjič pa še natančneje. (The next time, however, more carefully still.)

==Pronouns==
{{Main|Slovene pronouns}}

[[Pronoun]]s can replace a noun in a sentence; this is, as opposed to, say, an adjective or an adverb.

===Personal pronouns===
A [[personal pronoun]] denotes the speaker (''I''), the addressee (''you'') or a third person (''it''). Personal pronouns in Slovene are inflected in a somewhat unusual way, for there are many different forms for each of the pronouns.

Several of the pronouns have unstressed and clitic forms that are unstressed, and may attach to another word. For example:
* ''Za'''nj''' mi je dal denar.'' "He gave me the money for '''him'''." (Note: if the 'he' was referring to the same person, the reflexive personal pronoun would be used.)
* ''Za '''njega''' mi je dal denar.'' "He gave me the money for '''him''' (in particular)."
* ''Sledili smo '''jim'''.'' "We followed '''them'''."
* ''Spodbudili smo '''jih''', da naj se pokažejo vredne našega zaupanja, a so nas nesramno zavrnili.'' "We encouraged '''them''' to prove themselves worthy of our trust, but they rejected us rudely."
* ''Na'''njo''' se je zgrnila ena nesreča za drugo.'' "'''She''' was struck by one misfortune after another."
* ''Da bi le '''njim''' to lahko dopovedali! "If only we could make '''them''' understand this!"
* ''Za'''me''' ni več rešitve: pugubljena sem.'' "For '''me''' there is no solution any more: I am doomed."
* ''Pogledal '''ga''' je s kancem ironije v očeh.'' "He looked at '''him''' with a drop of irony in the eyes."
* ''Pogledal je '''njega'''. "He looked at '''him''' (in particular)."

The nominative forms of personal pronouns are not used in neutral sentences, only when emphasizing the subject, especially so for the first person singular ''jaz'' "I". This is because unlike in English, the form of the verb gives all applicable information such as the gender, grammatical number and person by itself.

* '''''Jaz''' mislim drugače.'' "'''I''' (in particular, or contrasting) think otherwise."

The [[reflexive pronoun]] begins with ''s-'' and is used to refer back to the subject, or to some other word.

For example:
* ''Umivam '''si''' roke.'' "I am washing '''my''' hands."
* ''Umivate '''si''' roke.'' "You are washing '''your''' hands."
* ''Umivam '''se'''.'' "I am washing '''myself'''."
* ''Umivate '''se'''.'' "You are washing '''yourselves'''."

Similarly as in English, the reflexive pronoun can sometimes be replaced by the reciprocal phrase ''drug drugega'' "each other, one another". Thus:
* '''''Drug drugemu''' umivata roke.'' "The two of them are washing '''each other's''' hands."
* ''Umivata '''drug drugega'''.'' "The two of them are washing '''each other'''."

The accusative ''se'' can bind with prepositional words just like other personal pronouns:
* ''Na'''se''' je nanesla lepotilno kremo.'' "She put beautifying cream on '''herself'''."
* ''Ampak ko dela za'''se''', dela učinkovito.' "But when he/she works for '''him-/herself''', he/she works efficiently."

Other cases and examples:
* '''''Sebi''' gradi grobnico.'' "He/She is building a tomb '''for him-/herself'''."
* ''Gradi '''si''' grobnico.'' "He/She is building a tomb '''for him-/herself'''." (The emphasis here is not so much on for whom the tomb is, but rather the tomb or the building itself.)
* '''''S sabo/seboj''' ni zadovoljna.'' "She is not happy '''with herself'''."
* ''Najprej počisti pri '''sebi''', potlej šele kritiziraj druge!'' "First clean up at '''yourself''', only then criticise others!"
* ''Ko je videl odsev '''sebe''' v ogledalu, mu je ta pogled povsem pokvaril dan.'' "When he saw the reflection '''of himself''' in the mirror, this sight completely ruined the day for him." (Not a widely used construction, this would be more usually expressed with the possessive adjective: ''Ko je videl '''svoj''' odsev v ogledalu ...'')

===Interrogative pronouns===

The [[interrogative pronoun]]s introduce direct and indirect questions. There are two nominative forms: ''kdo'' "who" and ''kaj'' "what".

* '''''Kaj''' je ta stvar, ki se premika? "'''What''' is this thing that is moving?"
* ''Vprašal sem ga, o '''kom''' je bil govoril.'' "I asked him about '''whom''' he had been talking."
* '''''Komu''' naj dam to?'' "'''To whom''' ought I to give this?"
* '''''Česa''' ne smem storiti?'' "'''What''' may I not do?"

===Relative pronouns===

The substantival [[relative pronoun]] is derived from the interrogative by adding ''-r'': ''kdor'' "who, that", ''kar'' "which, that".

* '''''Kdor''' krade, ni pošten.'' "'''Someone who''' steals is not honest."
* '''''Kar''' poveš, tega ne moreš več obvladovati.'' "'''Something that''' you say, that you cannot control any more."
* ''Odrekli so ji možnost do izbire odvetnika, s '''čimer''' je bila kršena njena ustavna pravica.'' "They refused her the option of choosing a solicitor, with '''which''' her constitutional right was violated."

===Negative pronouns===

The [[negative pronoun]] is derived from the interrogative as well, and starts with ''ni-'': ''nihče'' "nobody, anybody", ''nič'' "nothing, anything".

A negative pronoun demands a negative predicate, resulting in the so-called [[double negation]]:

* '''''Nihče''' me nikoli '''ni''' maral.'' "'''Nobody''' ever liked me."
* ''Nikjer '''ni''' '''nikogar'''.'' "There is '''no one''' anywhere."
* '''''Nič''' '''ni''' resnično.'' "'''Nothing''' is real."
* ''Od '''nikogar''' ne želim '''ničesar'''.'' "I want '''nothing''' from '''no one'''." or more freely "I don't want '''anything''' from '''anyone'''."
* '''''Nikogaršnja''' neolikanost ni nikdar in nikjer in na nikakršen način '''nikomur''' pridobila '''nič''' drugega kot neodobravanje. "'''No one's''' impropriety gained ever '''anyone''' anywhere and in whatever way '''anything''' else than disapproval."

===Universal pronouns===

The [[universal pronoun]]s are ''vsakdo'' "everyone" and ''vse'' "everything, all".

* '''''Vsemu''' so namenjali pozornost.'' "They dedicated attention '''to everything'''."
* '''''Vsakogar''' bodo vrgli iz službe, če ne bo izpolnjeval zahtev.'' "They will sack '''everyone''' who will not fulfil requirements."

''Vsak'' "each, every" is an adjective that can function as a pronoun. Also in this category are ''vsakateri'' and ''vsakteri'', both meaning "everyone", which are old-fashioned and not used in modern language.

===Indefinite pronouns===

The [[indefinite pronoun]] is derived from the interrogative, and starts with ''ne-'': ''nekdo'' "someone, anyone", ''nekaj'' "something, anything". It refers to an unknown or deliberately untold person or object. The inflection follows the pattern of ''kdo'' and ''kaj''.

* '''''Nekoga''' so videli stati ob oknu, a niso mogli ugotoviti, kdo bi to lahko bil.'' "They saw '''someone''' standing near the window, but they could not figure out who could have been that."
* ''Zgodilo se je '''nekaj''' strašnega!'' "'''Something''' horrible has happened!"
* ''Zataknilo se jima je pri '''nečem''', a nikakor se ne morem spomniti, pri čem.'' "They faltered at '''something''', but I cannot in any way remember at what."
* '''''Nekdo''' prihaja. Skrijmo se.'' "'''Someone''' is coming. Let us hide."

The interrogatives ''kdo'' and ''kaj'', can also refer to any unspecified person or object, or one that can be chosen at will.

* ''Sporoči mi, prosim, če se bo '''kaj''' spremenilo.'' "Please let me know if '''anything''' changes."
* ''Seveda dvomim o '''čem''': kaj to ni normalno?'' "Naturally I doubt about '''something''': is this not normal?"
* '''''Česa''' podobnega še nisem videl!'' "I have never seen '''anything''' like that!"
* ''Uporabi klorovodikovo kislino ali '''kaj''' drugega, da nevtraliziraš to bazo.'' "Use hydrochloric acid or '''something''' else to neutralise this base."
* ''Denar, ki si ga '''kdo''' sposodi, seveda ni njegov, pač pa z njim le upravlja.'' "Money that '''someone''' borrows is obviously not his; he merely manages it."
* ''Naj stopi '''kdo''' vendar do tega DJ-ja in ga nekajkrat lopne po glavi.'' "May '''someone''' go to this DJ and smack him on the head a few times."
* ''Ojej, kakšne lepe govorice! O tem se res moram s '''kom''' pogovoriti.'' "Oh dear, what beautiful gossip! I really must talk to '''someone''' about this."

===Relative indefinite pronouns===

The relative indefinite pronouns are ''kdorkoli'' or ''kdor koli'' (whoever) and ''karkoli'' or ''kar koli'' (whatever). The meaning conveyed is very similar to the unspecified pronoun. The inflexion follows the pattern of the relative pronoun with ''-koli'' or ''&amp;nbsp;koli'' appended. The space, as shown, is optional, but for sake of consistency, once one method has been adopted, one should not use the other.

* '''''Kdorkoli''' pokliče 112, mora znati povedati, kaj je narobe.'' "'''Whoever''' rings [[Emergency telephone number|112]] must know how to say what is wrong."
* '''''Kogarkoli''' poslušam od teh politikov, vsi govorijo iste neumnosti.'' "'''To whichever''' of these politicians I listen, they all speak the same stupidities."
* '''''Karkoli''' stori, stori to dobro.'' "'''Whatever''' he/she does, he/she does it well."

===Manifold pronouns===

The manifold pronouns are ''marsikdo'' "many (people)" and ''marsikaj'' "many (things)". The inflexion follows the basic pattern of ''kdo'' and ''kaj''. Although these pronouns refer to multiple people or things, they are grammatically singular. In addition to ''marsi-'', other prefixes are possible, such as ''redko-'' (''redkokdo'' "rarely anyone"), ''mnogo-'' (''mnogokdo'', same as ''marsikdo'', although perhaps somewhat less usual) and ''malo-'' (''malokdo'' "few (people)").

* '''''Marsikdo''' pravi, da je lepše živeti na deželi, a jaz jim seveda ne verjamem.'' "'''Many people''' say that it is nicer to live in the countryside, but I of course do not believe them."
* ''Res je, da '''marsičesa''' ne vem, pa vendar veš ti še mnogo manj.'' "It is true that I do not know '''many things''', but you know far less still."
* ''Z '''marsičim''' je že bila obdarjena, a česa takšnega, kar ji je prinesel egiptovski odposlanec, ni bila nikdar poprej še videla.'' "'''Many things''' she had been gifted, but something like that which the Egyptian emissary brought she had never before seen."
* '''''Redkokdo''' bi priznal, da je storil takšno napako.'' "'''Rarely anyone''' would admit that he has made such a mistake."
* '''''Mnogokaj''' mi je šlo po glavi, a bolje je, da ne povem, kaj.'' "'''Many things''' went through my mind, but it is better that I do not say which."
* '''''Maločesa''' se loti, če ve, da se popolnosti pri stvari ne da doseči.'' "He attempts to do '''few things''' if he knows that perfection cannot be achieved at them."

* '''''Njegove''' oči so kot kupi koruze na polju.'' "'''His''' eyes are like heaps of maize on a field."
* ''Letalo je bilo last vojske in '''njene''' države.'' "The aeroplane was the property of the military and '''her''' (the military's or another person's, depending on the context) country.''
* '''''Vaše''' kraljevo veličanstvo, klanjam se pred Vami.'' "'''Your''' royal highness, I bow before You."
* ''Cerkev je '''njen''' grob na pokopališču prodala, kajti '''njeni''' potomci niso imeli dovolj denarja, da bi plačali pristojbino.'' "The church has sold '''her''' grave at the graveyard, since '''her''' descendants did not have enough money to pay the fee."
* ''S '''tvojim''' avtom smo šli: saj ne zameriš, kajne?'' "We went with '''your''' car: you do not resent (us), do you?"

The [[reflexive determiner]] ''svoj'' is used much as the reflexive pronoun is used, to point back to the subject or another word.

* ''Stopam v '''svojo''' sobo.'' "I am walking into '''my''' room."
* ''Kupili so jim lepo darilo; vso '''svojo''' domiselnost so vložili v njegovo izbiranje.'' "They bought them a beautiful gift; all '''their''' ingenuity they have invested into its choosing."
* '''''Svojega''' leva je pustila na dežju.'' "She left '''her''' lion in the rain."

The reflexive possessive and 'normal' possessive pronouns make some ambiguous English sentences perfectly clear in Slovene. The sentence "She has taken her towel into the bathroom" can be translated into the following two ways:

* '''''Njeno''' brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.'' (the towel she has taken belongs to another person)
* '''''Svojo''' brisačo je vzela v kopalnico.'' (the towel she has taken is her own)

Quantitative adverbial pronouns are non-inflected at all times. All other pronouns are normally inflected.

Examples:
* ''Čeprav mi je '''tisti''' avtobus bolj všeč, moram na '''tega''', kajti '''tisti drugi''' vozi v drugo smer.'' "Even though I like '''that''' bus more, I have to board '''this one''', for '''that other one''' is driving in another direction."
* '''''Mnogokakšna''' želja se mi je že uresničila, vendar mi je '''marsikatera''' prinesla tudi '''kakšne''' stranske neprijetnosti.'' "'''Many a''' wish has come true for me, however '''many''' (a wish) has brought me '''some''' side inconveniences."
* ''Vlak, '''ki''' smo ga videli, je pravzaprav '''tisti''', '''na katerega''' bi se bili morali usesti.'' "The train '''that''' we have seen is actually '''the one onto which''' we should have boarded." (literally: sat on)
* '''''čigav''' svinčnik je '''to'''? "'''Whose''' pencil is '''this'''?"
* '''''Nekakšna''' radirka je bila nameščena na '''drugem''' koncu.'' "'''Some type of''' rubber was mounted on '''the other''' end."
* '''''Enak''' kalkulator imam kot ti.'' "I have '''the same type of''' calculator as you."
* ''Vzemi mnenje, '''katerega''' ne odobravaš, in ga poskusi spremeniti.'' "Take an opinion '''that''' you do not approve of and try to change it."
* '''''Nekoliko''' pozni ste, a nič ne de.'' "You are '''somewhat''' late, but that is all right."
* ''Zaradi '''nekega''' bedaka mi je '''vsako''' letalo ušlo.'' "Because of '''some''' fool, '''every''' aeroplane got away from me. (I missed every plane because of some fool; in the sense that this person has taught me to get to an airport too late or similar, not that all planes have left without me.)
* '''''Toliko''' truda '''za nič''' učinka.'' "'''So much''' effort '''to no''' avail."

==Interjection==
An [[interjection]] is ordinarily an [[uninflected word]] expressing mental states, encouragement towards actions, greetings or mocking of sounds and voices.

* Uf, končno smo na vrhu. (Phew, we're finally at the top.)
* Uf, povsem mi je ušlo iz spomina. (Gosh, that has slipped my mind completely.)
* Petelin zapoje ''kikiriki''. (A cock sings ''cock-a-doodle-doo''.)
* Mojbog, kaj še vedno klamfaš neumnosti? (My god, are you still talking nonsense?)
* Čira čara, in zajec bo izginil. (Hocus-pocus, and the rabbit will disappear.)
* Torej, kaj porečeš na to? (So, what do you say to this?)
* Brr, kako mraz je. (Brr, it's so cold.)
* Oj (or Hej), ti človek tam zadaj: kako ti je ime? (Hey, you person back there: What's your name?)
* O ne, tako pa se ne govori z menoj. (Oh no, this is not how one speaks to me.)
* ''No'', pa ''adijo''! (''Well'', then ''goodbye''!)
* Ne bev ne mev niso rekli. (They didn't say anything.)
* Šššš: bo že bolje. (Shhh, it will get better.)

Interjections may be inflected; however, in spite of the words' being the same, such use calls for a different word class (part of speech), this most frequently being nouns. 
* "Ufov in ojojev se izogibajte, kajti bolnik je zelo ubog revež s to obrazno hibo." (Steer clear of 'uf's and 'ojoj's, because the patient suffers a lot with this facial deformity.)

==Syntax==
===Case use===
The nominative case defines a subject of a sentence; all other cases define an object as either direct or indirect.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case !! Slovene ''(semi)'' !! English
|-
| Nominative || '''Moj stol''' je v sobi || '''My chair''' is in the room
|-
| Genitive || '''Mojega stola''' ni v sobi || '''My chair''' is not in the room
|-
| Genitive || Košček '''papirja''' mi je ostal v dlani || A piece '''of paper''' remained in my palm
|-
| Genitive || Tipkovnica '''računalnika''' je vhodna enota || A '''computer’s''' keyboard is an input device

| Locative || Mnogo je rečenega '''o novem sodniku''' || A lot is being said '''about the new judge'''
|-
| Instrumental || Na sprehod grem '''s svojim psom''' || I am going for a walk '''with my dog'''
|}

===Use of number===
There are four types of [[inflexion]] related to the [[grammatical number]] in Slovene. The future tense is here used to demonstrate its usage. The future tense is formed with the verb to be in the future tense plus the l-participle of the full lexical verb. For example, a table of the English expression "I will see" ("Jaz bom videl") with gender for he ("on") and she ("ona") without it ("ono") can be written as:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Singular !! Dual ''(semi)'' !! Plural
|-
| I will see || We (both/two) will see || We (all) will see
|-
| You will see || You (both/two) will see || You (all) will see
|-
| He/She will see || They (both/two) will see || They (all) will see
|}

can be translated into Slovene as:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Singular with M/F gender !! Dual with M/F gender !! Plural with M/F gender
|-
| Jaz bom videl/Jaz bom videla || Midva bova videla/Midve bova videli || Mi bomo videli/Me bomo videle
|-
| Ti boš videl/Ti boš videla || Vidva bosta videla/Vidve bosta videli || Vi boste videli/Ve boste videle
|-
| On bo videl/Ona bo videla || Ona (or onadva) bosta videla/Oni (or onidve) bosta videli || Oni bodo videli/One bodo videle
|}

Slovene has singular and plural but also has the rare [[dual grammatical number]], a separate form of every noun used when there are only two such items (except for natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, for which the plural is used). Dual grammatical number, when an ambiguity between dual and plural forms exists, can be rendered into other languages in various ways; comparatively often, there is no ambiguity, and the dual is extraneous. (This explains the relatively early [[Comparative timeline of the Slavic languages|disappearance]] of the dual in most languages). Dual grammatical number was a feature of the [[Proto-Slavic]] language which has been retained by Slovene. An example of dual grammatical number would be "onadva sta" ("The two are"), which refers to two objects or subjects in the [[masculine gender]] or "onidve sta" ("The two are"), which refers to the same concept but in the [[feminine gender]]. However "oni so" ("They are ") refers to more than two objects or subjects in the masculine gender while "one so" ("They are") does the same the feminine gender. Dual grammatical number is also preserved in gender. The dual is used consistently in Slovene.
:Bil je lep jesenski dan. Odšla sva v park. Usedla sva se na klopco in se pogovarjala. Lepo nama je bilo.
::It was a nice autumn day. We (the two of us) went to the park. We (the two of us still) sat down on a bench and talked. We had a nice time.

:Bil je lep jesenski dan. Odšli smo v park. Usedli smo se na klopco in se pogovarjali. Lepo nam je bilo.
::It was a nice autumn day. We went to the park. We sat down on a bench and talked. We had a nice time.

The first phrase sounds much more [[romantic love|romantic]] and [[intimacy|intimate]] to a Slovene, a style that is impossible to [[translation|translate]] into English, which lacks the dual grammatical number.

===Sentence===
====Constituents====
In a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], there can be only four types of constituent, the order of which is seldom crucial:
: '''[[subject (grammar)|subject]]''' (osebek) + '''[[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]''' (povedek) + '''[[accusative case|object]]''' (predmet) + '''[[adverb|adverbial phrase]]''' (prislovno določilo).

By changing the order, the stressed part changes. It may also serve to create poetic sentiment, common in [[poetry]].

====Free sentence====
:   ''Včeraj sem šel domov.'' (''I went home yesterday.'') (or: ''Yesterday I went home.'')
:   ''Danes prihajam domov.'' (''I am coming home today.'')
:   ''Jutri bom šel od doma.'' (''I'll leave home tomorrow.'')

====Compound sentence====
:   ''Res me veseli, da si prišel.'' (''I am really glad you came.'')
:   ''Da &amp;ndash; tako je bilo, kakor praviš!'' (''Yes &amp;ndash; it was as you say!'')

====Incomplete sentence====
This is a sentence with no predicate.

:   ''Rana ura, zlata ura.'' (''Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise''; ''The early bird catches the worm'' (literally ''Early hour, golden hour''))

====Inserted sentence====
:   ''V tistih časih &amp;ndash; bil sem še mlad in sem od sveta veliko pričakoval &amp;ndash; sem lepega večera srečal starega berača in ...'' (''In those times &amp;ndash; I was still young and I expected a lot from the world &amp;ndash; I  met an old beggar one fair evening and ...'')

====Accompanying sentence and direct speech====
:   "Dobro jutro," je rekla Lojza. ("Good morning," said Aloysine.)
:   Lojza je rekla: "Dobro jutro." (Aloysine said, "Good morning.")
:   &amp;ndash; Dobro jutro. ("Good morning.")

==Punctuation==
{{Main|Slovene punctuation}}

[[Punctuation]] marks are one or two part graphical marks used in writing, denoting tonal progress, pauses, sentence type ([[syntax|syntactic]] use), [[abbreviation]]s, et cetera.

Marks used in Slovene include [[full stop]]s (.), [[question mark]]s (?), [[exclamation mark]]s (!), [[comma (punctuation)|commas]] (,), [[semicolon]]s (;), [[colon (punctuation)|colons]] (:), [[dash]]es (&amp;ndash;), [[hyphen]]s (-), [[ellipsis|ellipses]] (...), different types of inverted commas and [[quotation mark]]s ("", &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ‚‘, „“, »«), [[bracket]]s ((), [], {}) (which are in syntactical use), as well as [[apostrophe (mark)|apostrophes]] (',’), [[slash (punctuation)|solidi]] (/), [[equal sign]]s (=), and so forth.

'''Sona''' is an [[international auxiliary language]] created by [[Kenneth Searight]] and described in a book he published in 1935. The word ''Sona'' in the language itself means "auxiliary neutral [[object (philosophy)|thing]]", but the name was also chosen to echo "sonority" or "sound".

Searight created Sona as a response to the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]] of other [[Artificial language|artificial]] [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary languages]] of his time, such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]].&lt;ref name=aldrich&gt;{{citation |title=Colonialism and Homosexuality |last=Aldrich |first=Robert |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-19616-7 |pages=279–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Searight intended his language to be more practical than most ''[[A priori (languages)|a priori]]'' languages like [[Solresol]] or [[Ro (language)|Ro]], which were intended to be unbiased by any particular group of natural languages.  Thus, ''Sona'' sacrificed familiarity of grammar and lexicon for some measure of "universality", while at the same time preserving basic notions common to grammars around the world such as compounding as a method of word formation. Searight used inspiration from many diverse languages, including [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], to create his eclectic yet regular and logical language.&lt;ref name=hyam&gt;{{citation |title=Understanding the British Empire |last=Hyam |first=Ronald |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0-521-13290-8 |pages=454–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searight specifically chose only sounds that speakers of any language could say, therefore making it a true universal. He hoped that in a perfect world, Sona would be taught to young children everywhere.

Sona is an [[agglutinative language]] with a strong tendency towards being an [[isolating language]]. The language has 360 ''radicals'' or root words whose meanings are based on the categories in [[Roget]]'s original [[Roget's Thesaurus|thesaurus]], plus an additional 15 particles. Ideas and sentences are formed by juxtaposing the radicals. Thus, ''ra'' "male" plus ''ko'' "child" makes ''rako'' "boy".

Searight's book, ''Sona; an auxiliary neutral language'' (London, K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd., 1935, LCCN: 35016722) is the only published example of this language. There is a small community on the Internet interested in reviving and using Sona.

== Writing ==
Sona uses the Latin alphabet and contains 24 letters. Although the author provides the rules for writing in Sona in his text, he also specifies that Sona has "few hard and fast rules." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One mentioned rule in regards to writing covered by Searight is that foreign words are written with a capital. Even in regards to punctuation, Searight claims it is "desirable that we leave the matter more or less opened to choice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Sona alphabet has 24 letters. Searight lists no official order but presents the following chart:
{| class="wikitable"
|six  vowels
|''a''
|''e''
|''i''
|''o''
|''u''
|''y''
|-
|six aspirates
|''c''
|''j''
|''x''
|''f''
|''v''
|''h''
|-
|six consonants (i)
|''g''
|''d''
|''z''
|''m''
|''b''
|''l''
|-
|six consonants (ii)
|''k''
|''t''
|''s''
|''n''
|''p''
|''r''
|}
The vowels are sounded as in Italian. British English equivalents are ''fast, fete, machine, fort, rule''. ''y'' is the neutral vowel of Welsh, but before another vowel, it is pronounced as the English ''y'' (e.g. ''yard'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sona: an auxiliary neutral language|last=Searight|first=Kenneth|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., Ltd.|year=1935|isbn=|location=London|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alphabet letters are "named" by adding the vowel ''y''. For the vowels of the alphabet, the y is initial, such as ''ya, ye, yi, yo, yu, y'', and is final for aspirates and consonants, such as ''cy, gy, ky,'' etc. The ''y'' is also useful for separating two like vowels in a word and for separating an -n radical from a vowel. For instance, ''ta-ata'' becomes ''tayata'' and ''ta-o'' becomes ''tayo''. This helps reduce confusion by distinguishing words from other similar combined radicals. ''i'' and ''u'' are shortened before a vowel. The only consonant that is final allowed is ''-n.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Radicals ==
The language consists of 360 radicals and 15 particles, each of which represents a single unit of meaning. Every word in Sona can be decomposed into radicals and, conversely, new words can be constructed by combining them in various ways. Radicals are meant to represent symbolic ideas or groups of ideas, and this simplifies the language by connecting words to one another based on universal concepts.

The radicals are organized into groups of five which share both a consonant-vowel root and a fundamental meaning. Each radical in the group is created by attaching a-, u-, or i- or -n. For example, the group ''ta'' (increase) also contains the radicals ''tan'' (bulk), ''ata'' (extension), ''ita'' (filling), and ''uta'' (swelling).

When radicals are combined, their order affects the resulting meaning. A radical used as a prefix will be dominant, while one used as a suffix will be subordinate, hence ''tara'' "big man" versus ''rata'' "giant."

A radical can change meaning depending its context. Some radicals take on a different meaning when used as an affix, e.g. when used as a prefix, the meaning of ''ka'' changes from "lead" to a [[Causative|causal maker]]. Many compounds take on set meanings beyond that of their component parts. For example, ''akizu'', literally "fast animal," signifies "horse." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Phonetics and phonology ==
The 360 radicals are split up into consonants and aspirates. Of the 12 consonants, each can be categorized five different ways, isolated and with the four possible affixes. This gives us 300 radicals. The 6 aspirates, ''c, j, x, f, v,'' and ''h'', have only the ''-n'' form, which gives us the remaining 60 radicals. Searight decided to exclude diphthongs from Sona in order to maintain its universality. Here is an example of how radicals are modified with prefixes and suffixes to create new words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Primary
!
!''TA'' (augment)
!''TE'' (grasp)
!''TO'' (passing)
|-
|''-n''
|
|''tan'' (bulk)
|''ten'' (reception)
|''ton'' (exhaust) 
|-
|''a-''
|
|''ata'' (extension)
|''ate'' (tube)
|''ato'' (senility) 
|-
|''i-''
|
|''ita'' (filling)
|''ite'' (flap) 
|''ito'' (expiring) 
|-
|''u-''
|
|''uta'' (swelling)
|''ute'' (pocket)
|''uto'' (excess) 
|}

There are 180 disyllables, and the remaining 5 monosyllables are the particles ''au, ua, ue, ui,'' and ''uo''. The only vowels allowed as radical prefixes are ''a, i,'' and ''u.''

Sona does not use a formal suffix for possession, but one may add ''-si'' for emphasis, which is the equivalent of an English ''-'s''.

The epithet is always placed before its head word, so one would say "the big dog," as in English, and not "the dog big," as in Spanish.

While radicals may be compounded, they also can be isolated words. For instance, ''te'' alone means "hand," but compounding it creates ''tebi'' (handle), ''bute'' (nose), and ''tega'' (arm).

As for the aspirates, ''h'' is aspirated, ''x'' is pronounced like the ''sh'' in "shin," ''j'' may be sounded as in the English "ʤ" or the French "[[Voiced palato-alveolar sibilant|ʒ"]]. Since there is already a letter ''k'' in Sona, ''c'' is pronounced like the ''ch'' in "chin." ''f'' and ''v'' are pronounced how English speakers pronounce them.

As for the consonants, only three of them need mentioning. ''g'' is always a hard G, meaning it is pronounced like the G in Gary as opposed to the G in Gym. ''z'' is pronounced like the Z in "zeal," but it can vary to the Italian variation of ''dz'', or the German variation of ''ts''. Also, ''s'' is always sharp, meaning it never sounds like a Z as in "as." The remaining consonants are pronounced as English speakers would pronounce them. Sona also has no double consonants or digraphs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sona utilizes elision, meaning when a radical with a vowel prefix is followed by its own primary or ''-n'' form, the common vowel is dropped. For example, ''ata-ta'' becomes ''atta'', and ''ata-tan'' becomes ''attan''.

For foreign sounds and words, Sona uses the phonetic symbol for that word and writes it with an initial capital letter. Sona rarely utilizes capital letters, and ''Sona'' is the only word in Sona spelled with a capital letter. For technical and scientific terms, such as Greek and Latin words, Sona leaves them as is, occasionally changing an initial C to K to match the sounds, for instance ''Carnival'' becomes ''Karnival''. These words are spelled in accordance with the language of origin, and last names are not altered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sona is not a tonal language and therefore the tonic accent is evenly distributed throughout speech, such as Japanese and French.

Punctuation is not a necessary part of the language since there are prefixes and suffixes for questions and emphasis. However, in Sona it is up to a person's preference whether or not they would like to use punctuation.

For nouns, the definite article is ''en'', meaning "it," and is optionally used for emphasis. For instance, ''ra'' stands for "man", but ''en ra'' means "the (very) man." There is no indefinite article in Sona. It does, however, borrow an Honorific from Japanese. O is used before names, words of address, and verbs as an expression of politeness. For instance, ''O ra'' means "honorable man." It can also mean "please."

For naming, the radical ''ha'', meaning "name," converts another radical into a name that addresses a person. For instance, ''hara'' (name and man) signifies Mr. Monsieur, Signor, Herr, Sir, etc. Inanimate objects have no gender. Sex is marked by ''ra'', meaning male or man, and ''zan'', meaning female or woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Morphology ==
All words can be fully analyzed into their constituent radicals (with the exception of proper nouns and borrowed words). As a result, the morphology of the language is a combination of [[Isolating language|isolating]] and [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]], and contains no [[Fusional language|fusional]] element.

Most word formation is done by compounding. When compounding radicals, the first one is said to be the "governing radical," and the following ones act as modifiers. The language also permits the compounding of polysyllabic words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Inflectional morphology ===

==== Nouns ====
There are twelve [[Grammatical case|cases]]. For [[Nominative case|nominative]] and [[Accusative case|accusative]], the noun and the verb are compounded. For the former, the noun comes first and for the latter, the verb. For [[possessive]], the possessor is simply placed before the possessed, but the suffix ''-si'' can be added to the possessor if needed for clarification. Three of the cases are formed with affixes: the [[Vocative case|vocative]] with ''-ha'', the [[Directive Case|directive]] with ''-li'', and the [[Locative case|locative]] with ''a-.'' The remaining cases are formed analytically with a word placed before the noun: ''dili'' for the [[Motive Case|motive]], ''li'' for the [[Dative case|dative]], ''ne'' for the [[Ablative case|ablative]], ''bi'' for [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], ''vi'' for [[Genitive case|genitive]], and ''di'' for [[Partitive case|partitive]].

Nouns can optionally be marked for [[plural]] (''-e''), [[Collective noun|collective]] (-''gi'').

Only [[Animacy (linguistics)|animate]] nouns are marked for gender: ''ra'' for male, ''zan'' for female, and ''-ji'' or ''-ci'' for neuter, with the latter having an additional [[Agent noun|agentive]] meaning. The inanimates have special noun affixes which mark them as either inorganic (''-na'') or organic (''-ga'').

The [[augmentative]] is ''-ta-'' and the [[diminutive]] is ''-ko-''. The [[approbative]] is marked by ''-xa'' and the disapprobative is marked by ''-ze''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Adjectives =====
The comparative is formed by ''e-'' and superlative is formed by ''en e-'' (with ''en'' meaning "the"). However, they do not have to be marked explicitly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Verbs ====
Both prepositions and pronouns may be optionally attached to the end of the verb.

Three different radicals can be used to mark transitivity: -ka- ("cause"), -ba ("strike, forceful"), -ru ("go, get").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Searight gives this verb paradigm using the root ''ru'', "move," as an example:

=== Derivational morphology ===

==== Nouns ====
Instrumental nouns can be formed with ''-bi''; places are denoted by ''-a, -ma,'' or ''-ca''; buildings by ''-kan''; times are formed with ''-ri.''

Abstract nouns may be formed in several ways. A noun of state is produced with ''-ne'', a [[verbal noun]] is produced with -''da'', and a noun of quality is produced with ''-vi''. For example, starting with the radical ''di'', "divide," one can create ''dine,'' "division;"  ''dida'', "dividing;" and ''divi'', "particularity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Adjectives ====
The primary method of adjective formation is the suffix ''-(y)o'', as in ''tayo'', "great." They can be [[Adjective#Types of use|used as predicates]] by omitting the o, as in ''ra ta'', "the man is big."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Adjectives with more specific meanings can be derived in several other ways. Searight gives the following list, using ''ra'', "man," to generate an example of each:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Adjectival suffixes
!Suffix
!Meaning
!Example
|-
|''-vio''
|of the quality of
|''ravio'', "virile"
|-
|''-bio''
|used for
|''rabio'', "phallic"
|-
|''-dio''
|of, belonging to
|''radio'', "masculine"
|-
|''-lio''
|able to
|''ralio'', "potent"
|-
|''-sio''
|like, ish
|''rasio'', "manly"
|-
|''-kio''
|beginning to
|''rakio'', "adolescent"
|-
|''-fio''
|not quite, hardly
|''rafio'', "effeminate"
|-
| -''cio'' or -''ci''
|[[participle]]
|''racio'', "one who acts like a man" or "brave"
|-
| -''nio'' or -''ni''
|passive adjective, -ized
|''ranio'', "virilized"
|-
|''-beyo''
|without, -less
|''rabeyo'', "without a man"
|-
| -''noyo''
|bearing
|''ranoyo'', "bearing sons"
|-
| -''panyo''
|full of, -ful
|''rapanyo'', "manful"
|}

==== Adverbs ====
Some adverbial forms are derived by a suffix, like adjectives, while others are formed analytically. The default method of creating an adverb is the word ''po'' preceding it. Searight offers the following adverb derivations:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Adverbial suffix
!Derivation
!Meaning
!Example
|-
|''-(y)u''
|manner
|''irau'', "strongly"
|-
|''bi''
|means
|''bi ira'', "by force"
|-
|''po''
|general
|''po ira'', "in strength"
|-
|''a-''
|rest
|''afu'', "outside"
|-
|''-li''
|motion
|''fuli'', "outwards"
|-
|''-i''
|gerund
|''fui'', "while putting out"
|-
|''-ua''
|emphatic
|''naua'', "not at all"
|-
|''-ui''
|affirmative
|''naui'', "yet"
|}

==== Verbs ====
Radicals can be converted into verbs analytically by the addition of ''da'' before the root.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Syntax ==
Searight's central claim on syntax in Sona is that "the construction of the Sona sentence is based upon the logical sequence of ideas." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The syntactical structure of Sona is intended to be as intuitive and logical as possible, although Searight does present some rules in his text under the "Syntax" section. According to Searight, the [[word order]] is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]], with qualifying words preceding the words they qualify. Searight stresses that "the construction of the Sona sentence must not be confined to European models."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Teresa Solana started her professional career as a translator, mainly from French and English. She was the director of the translation center in Tarassona between 1998 and 2004. She also wrote various articles and essays on translation.

In 2006 she published her first novel, ''Un crim imperfecte'', for which she received the ''Premi Brigada 21'' prize. This is the first story in which there appear the twin investigators Eduard and Borja Masdéu. Afterwards she published ''Drecera al paradís'' with the same protagonists. In 2010 she published her first, and up to now only, short story collection, ''Set casos de sang i fetge i una història d'amor''. In 2013 she participated in the [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] with the story 'Natura quasi morta 41'. She also published the novel ''Negres tempestes'' in which for the first time stars the investigator Norma Forester and with which she won the 3rd ''Premi Crims de Tinta'' prize. In 2011 she published ''L'hora del zen'', another story with Eduard and Borja as protagonists. In early 2014 there appeared her seventh novel, ''La casa de les papallones'', protagonized by Norma Forester. ''Campanes de boda'' (2016) includes the twin investigators again. ''Matèria grisa'', also a crime novel, won the 19th ''Premi Roc Boronat'' prize.

The '''Virgilian Progression''' is a literary term to define [[Virgil]]'s progression in his career as a poet.

This progression shows that Virgil moved from pastoral poetry in his ''[[Eclogues]]'', to poetry on the working man in his ''[[Georgics]]'', to epic poetry which was found in the ''[[Aeneid]]''. As Virgil is considered one of the major writers of Rome his works were carefully studied by Medieval and Renaissance scholars. The discovery of a Virgilian progression led many men to attempt to emulate Virgil's literary career so that they too might become great poets of their time. Examples of some of these authors include [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

'''Timbira''' is a [[dialect continuum]] of the [[Jê languages]] of [[Brazil]]. The various tribal dialects are distinct enough to sometimes be considered separate languages. The principal varieties, '''Krahô''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɑː|h|oʊ}}&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; (Craó), and '''Kanela''' {{IPAc-en|k|æ|ˈ|n|ɛ|l|ə}}&lt;ref name=Bauer/&gt; (Canela), have 2000 speakers apiece, few of whom speak Portuguese. Kreye, however, is nearly extinct, with only 30 speakers in 1995.

==Varieties==
Loukotka (1968) divides the Timbira tribes into two groups, Timbirá (Canela) and Krao. The majority are included under Timbira:

;Timbira (Canela): ''Mehin, Tajé'' (Timbirá), ''Kreapimkatajé'' (Krepúnkateye), ''Krenjé'' (Krẽyé), ''Remkokamekran'' (Remako-Kamékrere, Merrime), ''Aponegicran'' (Apáñekra), ''Krenkatajé'' (Canella, Kenkateye), ''Sakamekran'' (Chacamecran, Mateiros), ''Purekamekran, Makamekran'' (Pepuxi), ''Apinagé, Karaho'' (Carauau), ''Menren'' (Gaviões, Augutjé – only a few words known), ''Meitajé''
;Krao: ''Krahó, Krikati'' (Krikatajé), ''Piokobjé'' (Bucobu, Pukobje, Paicogê), ''Kapiekran''

Apart from Kapiekran, all Krao varieties are recognized by the ISO.  Under the Timbira group, Loukotka included several purported languages for which nothing is recorded:  ''Kukoekamekran, Karákatajé, Kenpokatajé, Kanakatayé, Norokwajé'' (Ñurukwayé).  The ''Poncatagê'' (Põkateye) are likewise unidentifiable.

Another common convention for division, though geographic rather than linguistic, is ''Western Timbira'' (Apinayé alone) vs ''Eastern Timbira'' (Canela, Krikatí, Krahô, Gavião, and others).

''Gurupy'' is a river, sometimes used to refer to the Krenye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20017">'''UTF-EBCDIC''' is a [[character encoding]] used to represent [[Unicode]] characters.  It is meant to be [[EBCDIC]]-friendly, so that legacy EBCDIC applications on [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] may process the characters without much difficulty. Its advantages for existing EBCDIC-based systems are similar to [[UTF-8]]'s advantages for existing [[ASCII]]-based systems.  Details on UTF-EBCDIC are defined in Unicode Technical Report #16.

To produce the UTF-EBCDIC encoded version of a series of Unicode code points, an encoding based on UTF-8 (known in the specification as UTF-8-Mod) is applied first (creating what the specification calls an I8 sequence). The main difference between this encoding and UTF-8 is that it allows Unicode code points U+0080 through U+009F (the [[C1 control code]]s) to be represented as a single byte and therefore later mapped to corresponding EBCDIC control codes. In order to achieve this, UTF-8-Mod uses 101XXXXX instead of 10XXXXXX as the format for trailing bytes in a multi-byte sequence. As this can only hold 5 bits rather than 6, the UTF-8-Mod encoding of codepoints above U+009F is generally larger than the UTF-8 encoding.

The UTF-8-Mod transformation leaves the data in an ASCII-based format (for example, U+0041 "A" is still encoded as 01000001), so each byte is fed through a reversible (one-to-one) lookup table to produce the final UTF-EBCDIC encoding. For example, 01000001 in this table maps to 11000001; thus the UTF-EBCDIC encoding of U+0041 (Unicode's "A") is 0xC1 (EBCDIC's "A").

This encoding form is rarely used, even on the EBCDIC-based mainframes for which it was designed. [[IBM]] EBCDIC-based mainframe operating systems, such as [[z/OS]], usually use [[UTF-16]] for complete Unicode support. For example, [[DB2 UDB]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/I]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and the [[IBM]] [[XML]] toolkit support UTF-16 on IBM mainframes.

== Codepage layout ==
There are 160 characters with single-byte encodings in UTF-EBCDIC (compared to 128 in UTF-8). As can be seen, the single-byte portion is similar to [[EBCDIC 1047|IBM-1047]] instead of [[EBCDIC 37|IBM-37]] due to the location of the square brackets. [[CCSID]] 37 has [] at hex BA and BB instead of at hex AD and BD respectively.

Blue cells containing a large single-digit number are the start bytes for a sequence of that many bytes. The unbolded hexadecimal code point number shown in the cell is the lowest character value encoded using that start byte. This value can be greater than the value which would be obtained by following the start byte with continuation bytes which are all 65 (hex 0x41), if this would result in an invalid overlong form.

Orange cells with one dot are continuation bytes. The hexadecimal number shown after a "+" plus sign is the value of the 5 bits they add.

Red cells indicate start bytes (for a sequence of that many bytes) which can never appear in properly encoded UTF-EBCDIC text, because any possible continuation would result in an invalid overlong form. For example, 0x76 is marked in red because even 0x76 0x73 (which maps to the UTF-8-Mod sequence 0xC2 0xBF) would merely be an overlong encoding of U+005F (properly encoded as UTF-8-Mod 0x5F, UTF-EBCDIC 0x6D).

== {{anchor|UTFE}}Oracle UTFE ==
&lt;!-- Not sure if this is related to UTF-EBCDIC. If not, a separate article is warranted. --&gt;
''Oracle UTFE'' is a Unicode 3.0 UTF-8 [[Oracle database]] character set with six-byte support for supplementary characters. It is used only on EBCDIC platforms.&lt;ref name="Oracle_2002_DGSG"/&gt;

Advantages:
* Only Unicode character set for EBCDIC.
* Length of SQL CHAR types can be specified in number of characters.
* Binary order of the SQL CHAR columns is same as binary order of the SQL NCHAR columns if the data consists of same supplementary characters. Consequently, these columns sort the same for identical strings.&lt;ref name="Oracle_2002_DGSG"/&gt;

Disadvantages:
* Supplementary characters occupy six bytes instead of four bytes only. Consequently, supplementary characters need to be converted.
* UTFE is not a Unicode standard encoding. Clients requiring UTF-8 encoding must convert data on retrieval and storage.&lt;ref name="Oracle_2002_DGSG"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oracle9i Database Globalization Support Guide |author-first1=Cathy |author-last1=Baird |author-first2=Dan |author-last2=Chiba |author-first3=Winson |author-last3=Chu |author-first4=Jessica |author-last4=Fan |author-first5=Claire |author-last5=Ho |author-first6=Simon |author-last6=Law |author-first7=Geoff |author-last7=Lee |author-first8=Peter |author-last8=Linsley |author-first9=Keni |author-last9=Matsuda |author-first10=Tamzin |author-last10=Oscroft |author-first11=Shige |author-last11=Takeda |author-first12=Linus |author-last12=Tanaka |author-first13=Makoto |author-last13=Tozawa |author-first14=Barry |author-last14=Trute |author-first15=Mayumi |author-last15=Tsujimoto |author-first16=Ying |author-last16=Wu |author-first17=Michael |author-last17=Yau |author-first18=Tim |author-last18=Yu |author-first19=Chao |author-last19=Wang |author-first20=Simon |author-last20=Wong |author-first21=Weiran |author-last21=Zhang |author-first22=Lei |author-last22=Zheng |author-first23=Yan |author-last23=Zhu |author-first24=Valarie |author-last24=Moore |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |edition=Release 2 (9.2) |date=2002 |orig-year=1996 |id=Oracle A96529-01 |chapter=Appendix A: Locale Data |url=https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96529.pdf |access-date=2017-02-14 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214190952/https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96529.pdf |archive-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Amazon Echo Plus 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Amazon Echo]], an example of a voice computer]]
'''Voice computing''' is the discipline that develops hardware or software to process voice inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Schwoebel, J. (2018). An Introduction to Voice Computing in Python. Boston; Seattle, Atlanta: NeuroLex Laboratories. https://neurolex.ai/voicebook&lt;/ref&gt;

It spans many other fields including [[human-computer interaction]], [[conversational computing]], [[linguistics]], [[natural language processing]], [[automatic speech recognition]], [[speech synthesis]], [[audio engineering]], [[digital signal processing]], [[cloud computing]], [[data science]], [[ethics]], [[law]], and [[information security]].

Voice computing has become increasingly significant in modern times, especially with the advent of [[smart speakers]] like the [[Amazon Echo]] and [[Google Assistant]], a shift towards [[serverless computing]], and improved accuracy of [[speech recognition]] and [[text-to-speech]] models.

==History==
Voice computing has a rich history.&lt;ref&gt;Timeline for Speech Recognition. https://medium.com/swlh/the-past-present-and-future-of-speech-recognition-technology-cf13c179aaf&lt;/ref&gt; First, scientists like [[Wolfgang Kempelen]] started to build speech machines to produce the earliest synthetic speech sounds. This led to further work by Thomas Edison to record audio with [[dictation machines]] and play it back in corporate settings. In the 1950s-1960s there were primitive attempts to build automated [[speech recognition]] systems by [[Bell Labs]], [[IBM]], and others. However, it was not until the 1980s that [[Hidden Markov Models]] were used to recognize up to 1,000 words that speech recognition systems became relevant.

|}

Around 2011, [[Siri]] emerged on Apple iPhones as the first voice assistant accessible to consumers. This innovation led to a dramatic shift to building voice-first computing architectures. [[PS4]] was released by Sony in North America in 2013 (70+ million devices), Amazon released the [[Amazon Echo]] in 2014 (30+ million devices), [[Microsoft]] released Cortana (2015 - 400 million Windows 10 users), Google released [[Google Assistant]] (2016 - 2 billion active monthly users on Android phones), and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released [[HomePod]] (2018 - 500,000 devices sold and 1 billion devices active with iOS/Siri). These shifts, along with advancements in cloud infrastructure (e.g. [[Amazon Web Services]]) and [[codecs]], have solidified the voice computing field and made it widely relevant to the public at large.

==Hardware==
A &lt;strong&gt;voice computer&lt;/strong&gt; is assembled hardware and software to process voice inputs.

Note that voice computers do not necessarily need a screen, such as in the traditional [[Amazon Echo]]. In other embodiments, traditional [[laptop computers]] or [[mobile phones]] could be used as voice computers. Moreover, there has become increasingly more interfaces for voice computers with the advent of [[Internet of things|IoT]]-enabled devices, such as within cars or televisions.

As of September 2018, there are currently over 20,000 types of devices compatible with Amazon Alexa.&lt;ref&gt;Voicebot.AI. https://voicebot.ai/2018/09/02/amazon-alexa-now-has-50000-skills-worldwide-is-on-20000-devices-used-by-3500-brands/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
&lt;strong&gt;Voice computing software&lt;/strong&gt; can read/write, record, clean, encrypt/decrypt, playback, transcode, transcribe, compress, publish, featurize, model, and visualize voice files.

Here are some popular software packages related to voice computing:
* &lt;strong&gt;[[FFmpeg]]&lt;/strong&gt; - for [[transcoding]] audio files from one format to another (e.g. .WAV --&gt; .MP3).&lt;ref&gt;FFmpeg. https://www.ffmpeg.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;[[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]]&lt;/strong&gt; - for recording and filtering audio.&lt;ref&gt;Audacity. https://www.audacityteam.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;[[SoX]]&lt;/strong&gt; - for manipulating audio files and removing environmental noise.&lt;ref&gt;SoX. http://sox.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Natural Language ToolKit&lt;/strong&gt; - for featurizing transcripts with things like [[parts of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;NLTK. https://www.nltk.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;LibROSA&lt;/strong&gt; - for visualizing audio file spectrograms and featurizing audio files.&lt;ref&gt;LibROSA. https://librosa.github.io/librosa/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;[[OpenSMILE]]&lt;/strong&gt; - for featurizing audio files with things like mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;OpenSMILE. https://www.audeering.com/technology/opensmile/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;PocketSphinx&lt;/strong&gt; - for transcribing speech files into text.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Pyttsx3&lt;/strong&gt; - for playing back audio files (text-to-speech).&lt;ref&gt;Pyttsx3. https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Pycryptodome&lt;/strong&gt; - for encrypting and decrypting audio files.&lt;ref&gt;Pycryptodome. https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Alexa Voice Service&lt;/strong&gt; - enables you to access cloud-based Alexa capabilities with the support of AVS APIs, hardware kits, software tools, and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Alexa Voice Service. https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Voice computing applications span many industries including voice assistants, healthcare, e-Commerce, finance, supply chain, agriculture, text-to-speech, security, marketing, customer support, recruiting, cloud computing, microphones, speakers, and podcasting. Voice technology is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19-25% by 2025, making it an attractive industry for startups and investors alike.&lt;ref&gt;Businesswire. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180417006122/en/Global-Speech-Voice-Recognition-Market-2018-Forecast&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal considerations==
In the United States different states have varying [[telephone recording laws]]. In some states, it is legal to record a conversation with the consent of only one party, in others the consent of all parties is required.

Moreover, [[COPPA]] is a significant law to protect minors on the internet. With an increasing number of minors interacting with voice computing devices (e.g. the Amazon Alexa), the [[Federal Trade Commission]] recently relaxed the COPAA rule so that kids can issue voice searches and commands.&lt;ref&gt;Techcrunch. https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/ftc-relaxes-coppa-rule-so-kids-can-issue-voice-searches-and-commands/&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, [[GDPR]] is a new European law that governs the [[right to be forgotten]] and many other clauses for EU citizens. GDPR also is clear that companies need to outline clear measures to obtain consent if audio recordings are made and define the purpose and scope as to how these recordings will be used (e.g. for training purposes). The bar for valid consent has been raised much higher under the GDPR. Consents must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous; tacit consent is no longer be enough.&lt;ref&gt;IAPP. https://iapp.org/news/a/how-do-the-rules-on-audio-recording-change-under-the-gdpr/&lt;/ref&gt;

All these things make it quite unclear how voice computing technology will be regulated into the future.

==Research Conferences==
There are many research conferences that relate to voice computing. Some of these include:
* [[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing]]
* Interspeech &lt;ref&gt;Interspeech 2018. http://interspeech2018.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* AVEC &lt;ref&gt;AVEC 2018. http://avec2018.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
* IEEE Int'l Conf. on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition &lt;ref&gt;2018 FG. https://fg2018.cse.sc.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;
* ACII2019 The 8th Int'l Conf. on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction &lt;ref&gt;ASCII 2019. http://acii-conf.org/2019/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developer community==
Google Assistant has roughly 2,000 actions as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Voicebot.ai. https://voicebot.ai/2018/01/24/google-assistant-app-total-reaches-nearly-2400-thats-not-real-number-really-1719/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 50,000 Alexa skills worldwide as of September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Voicebot.ai. https://voicebot.ai/2018/09/02/amazon-alexa-now-has-50000-skills-worldwide-is-on-20000-devices-used-by-3500-brands/.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, [[Google]] released AudioSet,&lt;ref&gt;Google AudioSet. https://research.google.com/audioset/&lt;/ref&gt; a large-scale collection of human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. It contains 1,010,480 videos of human speech files, or 2,793.5 hours in total.&lt;ref&gt;Audioset data. https://research.google.com/audioset/dataset/speech.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as part of the IEEE ICASSP 2017 Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Gemmeke, J. F., Ellis, D. P., Freedman, D., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, &amp; Ritter, M. (2017, March). Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events. In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2017 IEEE International Conference on (pp. 776-780). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[Mozilla Foundation]] released the Common Voice Project, a collection of speech files to help contribute to the larger open source machine learning community.&lt;ref&gt;Common Voice Project. https://voice.mozilla.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Common Voice Project. https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/29/announcing-the-initial-release-of-mozillas-open-source-speech-recognition-model-and-voice-dataset/&lt;/ref&gt; The voicebank is currently 12GB in size, with more than 500 hours of English-language voice data that have been collected from 112 countries since the project's inception in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Mozilla's large repository of voice data will shape the future of machine learning. https://opensource.com/article/18/4/common-voice&lt;/ref&gt; This dataset has already resulted in creative projects like the DeepSpeech model, an open source transcription model.&lt;ref&gt;DeepSpeech. https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wikiquote''' is one of a family of [[wiki]]-based [[Wikimedia project|project]]s run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], running on [[MediaWiki]] software. Based on an idea by Daniel Alston and implemented by Brion Vibber, the goal of the project which began as an outgrowth to Wikipedia Famous Quotations is to produce collaboratively a vast reference of [[quotation]]s from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and to be as proper as possible in regard to the details of the quotations and also providing the appropriate human reference of the quotation. 
Though there are many online collections of quotations, Wikiquote is distinguished by  being among the few that provide an opportunity for visitors to contribute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 | author=DeVinney, Gemma | title = Wikiquote: Another source for quotes on the Web |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/ubreporter/archives/vol38/vol38n19/columns/eh.html | work=UB Reporter | publisher=University of Buffalo | date = 18 January 2007| accessdate =29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the very few which strive to provide exact sources for each quotation as well as corrections of misattributed quotations. Wikiquote pages are cross-linked to articles about the notable personalities on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/science/archive/070127/science15.htm|title=It's all about Wikis|author=Ahsan, Hafsa |date= 27 January 2007|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504164927/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/science/archive/070127/science15.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the project was created solely in English; a later expansion to include additional [[language]]s was started in July 2004.{{fact|date=February 2015}}
