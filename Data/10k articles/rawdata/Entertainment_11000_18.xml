"'''{{'}}Round the World with the Rubber Duck'''" is the 1976 [[novelty song]] performed by [[C. W. McCall|C.W. McCall]] (pseudonym of Bill Fries) that was the sequel to the similar [[truck-driving country]] hit, "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]". "'Round the World with the Rubber Duck" 

==Content==
The song continues the story about the fictitious truck [[convoy]] from the song "[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]".  The truckers cross to Europe (''there ain't no way out 'cept for that one Atlantic Ocean'') and travel through several countries including Great Britain, Germany, Russia, and Japan.  At the end of the song there is also a reference to Australia (''Ah, ten-four, Pig Pen, what's your twenty? Australia? Mercy sakes, ain't nothin' down there but Tasmanian devils and them cue-walla bears.'').  The lyrics&lt;ref name=TechRen&gt;

'''Sir Alfred Butt, 1st Baronet'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p23533.htm|title=Person Page #235325| publisher=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes, Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.:, 2003, volume 1, page 450. Genealogical Books Ltd, 2003|accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (20 March 1878 – 8 December 1962) was a British theatre impresario, [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and racehorse owner and breeder. During a fourteen-year tenure as manager of [[London]]'s [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], beginning in 1904, Butt built a theatre empire, expanding firstly with the [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]], [[Glasgow]] in 1910, followed by the London Victoria Palace a year later, to rival that of Edward Moss and others. He became managing director of several London West End theatres beginning in 1914, including the [[Adelphi Theatre]], the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] and the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], as well as theatres outside London. He continued as a theatre impresario until 1931.

During the [[First World War]], also, Butt became Director of Food Rationing at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]. He was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] for his services to the ministry, and for his work for war charities, in 1918. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Balham and Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Balham and Tooting]] in 1922. In 1929, he was created a [[Butt baronets|baronet "of Westminster in the County of London"]] for his services to political and public life. He was forced to resign from the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|Commons]] in June 1936 over a financial scandal. After this, Butt concentrated on horse racing.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web | title=Butt, Sir Alfred | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56176 | work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2004 | accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Alfred Butt was born in London, the son of solicitor [[Solomon Beyfus (1820-1893)#Alfred Butt|Alfred Beyfus]] whose forebears had migrated from [[Hamburg]] to Glasgow and London, and educated at [[Emanuel School]] before entering employment in the counting-house of [[Harrod's]] department store where his uncle, [[Edgar Israel Cohen|Edgar Cohen]], through the Beyfus family was a director.&lt;ref name="Smith, Alhambra Glasgow"&gt;Smith, ''Alhambra Glasgow''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Sir Alfred Butt. Politics, Racing and the Theatre |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=10 December 1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently joined the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], a [[music hall]] in [[Cambridge Circus, London|Cambridge Circus]], London, largely controlled by the Beyfus family and associates.&lt;ref name="Smith, Alhambra Glasgow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He became company secretary of the Palace Theatre Limited in 1898, at the young age of 19. He quickly advanced to the position of assistant manager, and when [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]] died in 1904, he became manager of the Palace. In 1906 he became managing director, a position he held for 14 years.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He developed close links with the [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum Vaudeville Circuit]] and its associates in the United States, and brought numerous American stars to London. He also introduced British audiences to continental performers such as [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Yvette Guilbert]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; In 1910 he greatly expanded his theatre business when he took control of [[Thomas Barrasford]]'s music halls and formed a joint company, the "Variety Theatres Controlling Company Limited", with [[Walter de Frece]]. VTCC became the second largest chain of music halls in the United Kingdom, second only to [[Moss Empires]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Among their London theatres managed by Butt were the Globe and [[Queen's Theatre]]s.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Outside London Butt opened two new theatres, firstly, the [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]], Glasgow, in 1910, designed by [[John James Burnet|Sir John James Burnet]] and, secondly, the [[Theatre Mogador]], [[Paris]] in 1919 (delayed by the [[First World War]]), designed by [[Bertie Crewe]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Butt became managing director of three West End theatres during the war: the [[Adelphi Theatre]] (1915–19), the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]] (1914–28) and the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (1915–19). He became joint owner and managing director of London's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] from 1925-31.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Also during the First World War, he was appointed in 1917 by the new Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], on the recommendation of Lord Northcote, as the Director of Food Rationing and introduced compulsory food rationing with the support of his principal civil servant [[William Beveridge]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Alhambra Glasgow"/&gt; He was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] for his services to the Ministry, and for his work for war charities, in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30825 |date=2 August 1918 |page=9111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Butt was a supporter of the Conservative &amp; Unionist Party. After standing unsuccessfully for the party at parliamentary elections at [[Walworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Walworth]] and [[Paddington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Paddington North]], he was elected as member of parliament for [[Balham and Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Balham and Tooting]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In 1929 he was created a [[Butt baronets|baronet "of Westminster in the County of London"]] for his services to political and public life.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33523 |date=6 August 1929 |page=5143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the seat at successive elections until he was forced to resign from the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|Commons]] in June 1936 over a scandal concerning a leak of budget details from which he was believed to have benefitted financially.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Likely Candidates at Balham |work=[[The Times]] |page=16 |date=13 June 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of his political career, Butt concentrated on his interest in the horse-racing industry. He purchased the Brook Stud near [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. His two most successful horses were ''[[Steady Aim]]'', winner of [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]], and ''[[Petition (horse)|Petition]]'', winner of the [[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|Ascot New Stakes]], both in 1946.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Personal life==
He was married twice. The first marriage in 1908 was to Georgina Mary Say, who died in 1960. His second marriage was to Wilhelmine Wahl later in 1960. He had one son, Kenneth Dudley Butt, from his first marriage.

Sir Alfred Butt died at his Newmarket home in December 1962, aged 84.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was cremated at [[Cambridge]] Crematorium.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

'''''Alpha Waves''''' is a 1990 [[3D computer graphics|3D]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grenouillebouillie.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/is-it-worth-disputing-the-title-of-first-3d-game-on-a-pc-to-john-carmack/|title=Is it worth disputing the title of "first 3D game on a PC" to John Carmack?|first=Christophe de|last=Dinechin|date=17 January 2013|website=Grenouillebouillie.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; game that combines labyrinthine exploration with [[platform game]]play. It combined for the first time full-screen, six-axis, flat-shaded 3D with 3D object interaction (like bouncing on a platform). Alpha Waves was an abstract game with a moody, artistic presentation, named for its supposed ability to stimulate the different emotional centers of the brain with its use of color and music.

It was developed initially for the [[Atari ST]] by [[Christophe de Dinechin]], and later ported to the [[Amiga]] and [[DOS]]. The DOS port was done by [[Frédérick Raynal]], a notable game designer who would go on to develop ''[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'' (often abbreviated AitD), and ''[[Little Big Adventure]]''. He has said that his work on ''Alpha Waves'' was a major inspiration for the 3D engine for ''Alone in the Dark''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313184154/http://www.adventure-eu.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=207&amp;Itemid=29] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-alone-dark] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version was also localized in North America by [[Data East]], and retitled '''''Continuum'''''. [[Infogrames]] may have also published their own version in the US under the original title, and it was also released as a part of no less than two Infogrames compilations, on which it retained its original name.

In 2009, Christophe de Dinechin released the complete [[assembly language]] and [[GFA BASIC]] [[source code]] for the Atari ST version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cc3d.free.fr/Alpha-Waves.zip|title=cc3d.free.fr/Alpha-Waves.zip|website=Cc3d.free.fr|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a started PC port in C++ on [[sourceforge]] by the original author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grenouillebouillie.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/the-dawn-of-3d-games/|title=The dawn of 3D games…|first=Christophe de|last=Dinechin|date=9 November 2007|website=Grenouillebouillie.wordpress.com/|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/alpha-waves/|title=Alpha-Waves / Continuum|website=SourceForge.net|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
''Alpha Waves'' features two main modes of play: Action and Emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/continuum|title=Continuum for Amiga (1991) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core gameplay in both is the same.

Players guide one of six crafts (which are little more than geometric shapes in many cases) onto trampoline-like platforms. On these platforms, the player bounces automatically, higher, with each jump, until he reaches the maximum height possible for that platform (some are stronger than others). Every room in the game is a [[cube]], and the walls contain doorways leading to other rooms. In this way, players have to work their way through the game's rooms, and reach different areas based on different emotions.

In Action Mode, players also work against the clock. Time bonuses are awarded for entering new rooms, and keys can be collected to open new paths. There is not a particular end to the game, but the goal is simply to last as long and to discover as much as possible before time runs out. Emotion Mode allows players to explore without time constraints, but players are not allowed to cross certain game boundaries.

Emotion mode was not time limited, and allowed players to explore the game environment freely. While completing the game in Action Mode was very difficult, many players simply enjoyed exploring the game territory in Emotion Mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/continuum/61-2332/|title=Continuum (Game) - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version differences==
''Alpha Waves'' was initially released on the [[Atari ST]]. This version is notable for allowing two players to compete simultaneously. It lacked music entirely on the Atari 520ST, because of insufficient memory to store the music samples. On Atari 1040ST and later models, the theme song played during the intro. The music was stored on the second side of the floppy disk, since any Atari ST with enough memory also had a dual-sided floppy drive. A promotional version of the program was distributed by a French magazine on single-sided floppy disks, crashing any machine with more than 512K of memory.

The [[Amiga]] port was second and added a theme song at the title screen. The interface is similar, but the zone select in Emotion has been redone. Beyond this, it is very similar to the original - including the retention of the split-screen two player mode.

The MS-DOS version was the last one, and contains a number of improvements. This version supported [[AdLib]]/[[SoundBlaster]] sound cards. Despite the fact that these used the more limited FM synthesis of the [[Yamaha YM3812]], compared to the PCM synthesis of the Amiga, ''Alpha Waves'' is one of the rare exceptions where the AdLib sound quality is superior. The soundtrack was also expanded to play in-game, and each zone had its own music. Additionally some of the mobiles have been changed, level layouts tweaked, and the camera tilting toned down for easier viewing. The menus and level selection screen have been redone again, and are noticeably enhanced. The DOS version also includes a two player Action Mode (turn-based as opposed to the split-screen of the other two versions).

The DOS version lacks a mechanism to regulate speed when played on systems faster than it was intended for (essentially causing it to play in fast forward on newer hardware). However, when played on a properly configured system or [[emulator]], this can be considered the superior version, for solo play especially.

Other 3D games of the same era include [[Elite (video game)|Elite]] (1984), [[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon]] (1987), [[Driller (video game)|Driller]] (1987),  [[Starglider 2]] (1988), and [[Hovertank 3D]] (1991). Alpha-Waves (1990) brought a number of innovations to the 3D gaming experience that make it a significant landmark in 3D gaming:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.com/2007/10/dawn-of-3d-games.html|title=The dawn of 3D games...|website=Grenouille-bouillie.blogspot.com|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/the-top-10-most-psychedelic-video-games-ever-26377.phtml|title=The Top 10 Most Psychedelic Video Games Ever|website=Destructoid.com|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Depth-of-field [[Clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]] (objects disappearing in the distance)
*Large (for the time) number of 3D objects displayed simultaneously
*First simultaneous 2-player [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] mode on a single computer (only on the [[Atari ST]] and [[Amiga]] versions)

''Alpha Waves'' ran on 16-bit microcomputers that did not have hardware [[floating-point]] capabilities. For that reason, it performed all perspective and rotation computations using only integer arithmetics. In order to avoid using integer multiplications, which were expensive at the time, it described objects using displacements that were multiples of a base vector. For instance, a square in the Z plane would have been described as "+1X +1Y -1X -1Y". As a result, the vast majority of geometric computations were performed using only additions, not multiplications.

The computation of [[Sine|sine and cosines]] was similarly done using only [[Integer (computer science)|integer arithmetic]]. All angles were represented using not degrees, but 1/256th of a circle. A [[lookup table]] contained the value of the sine multiplied by 32767. Multiplying this value by a 16-bit coordinate gave a 32-bit value, and the 16-bit high-half of that result was used.

Another key to performance was a highly optimized polygon-filling routine, which used a number of tricks, including an assembly version of [[Duff's device]] to achieve a  high fill rate, besting the in-house [[self-modifying code|self-modifying]] routine [[Infogrames]] was using at the time.

The Atari ST and Amiga versions were written in assembly language. The DOS version was written in [[C (programming language)|C]].

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the game "plays like one would expect a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' "[[holodeck]]" game to play". The magazine said that it offered "some fascinating game experiences", but the lack of combat or two-player [[online game|modem racing]]—and goals so uninteresting that they "actually ''detract'' from the game"—caused it to "fall short in the most important department of lasting entertainment".&lt;ref name="taylor199107"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1991&amp;pub=2&amp;id=84 | title=A Good Time Continuum | work=Computer Gaming World | date=July 1991 | accessdate=18 November 2013 | author=Taylor, Matt | pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bimini Run''''' is a [[third person shooter]]/[[action game|action]] [[video game]] for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. It was developed and published by Nuvision Entertainment. Since it was a two-player game, Bimini Run allowed both players to traverse a wide scrolling environment on objective based missions.

==Story==
The story begins with the kidnapping of a Kim Ohara, the sister of an expert [[motorboat]] driver and [[secret agent]] Kenji. The kidnapping is immediately traced to Dr. Orca, who has hired other boat drivers and helicopter pilots to protect his island laboratory/fortress where he plans on unleashing a super weapon on the entire world. Kenji and his partner Luka arm themselves on a [[go-fast boat|power boat]] and prepare to rescue Kim and save the world.

==Gameplay==
The player controls the boat's steering by Kenji and shooting a rapid-fire bazooka by Luka. The gameplay consists of moving around the map (typically, an archipelago), completing objectives and shooting enemies who stand in the way. The player instantly loses a life if hit, so maneuvering to dodge enemy fire and other obstacles is a critical skill to learn. Typical objectives include reaching and destroying certain structures on the islands or following something around the map to their destination. New objectives are received in the form of radio messages notified of by a specific sound effect.

In the pause menu, the player can see the last radio message and the map of the area with current targets marked on it.

'''Morestone''', which later changed its name to the more well-known '''Budgie Toys''', was an English diecast toy distributor and then manufacturer based in London. The company first specialised in horse-drawn carriages and coaches. It later made a wide variety of miniature cars and trucks. Vehicles were about [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] size, though a bit smaller and a bit cruder. Some models marketed as Morestone were made by a separate company called Modern Products.

==History==
Morestone got its name as a contraction of "Morris" and "Stone" who started distributing the toys in the 1940s. Vehicles were somewhat similar to [[Dinky Toys]] in concept, but other toys were also marketed, like a "dulcimer" [[xylophone]] and a toy drum  (Johnson 1998: pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179). Some vehicles, like the mechanical road sweeper were equipped with clockwork motors. Often Morestone vehicles were made by the company Modern Products, thus "A Modern Product" or simply "Modern" would be stated on the boxes, and some models were marketed as 'A Modern Product' without any reference to Morestone. Some boxes say, "Modern" within a diamond-shaped logo (Nigel 2013). Models later in the 1950s were apparently made by Morestone as the Modern Product label was dropped, usually replaced by "Morestone Series". Morestone Series vehicles were varied, but commonly featured AA and RAC Land Rovers and motorcycles with [[sidecar]]s. Later, reissues of Morestone Series vehicles were made in white metal by 'Zebra Toys'. Another company, Autocraft / DGM acquired many of the dies for early Morestone Series models and reintroduced various motorcycles.

Earlier models said "Morris &amp; Stone" on the boxes, but the name was late. contracted Models were also marketed as promotionals for ESSO (First Gear, no date). The Budgie name, was introduced in 1959 and was more like other British toys named after dogs and other animals (Husky and Corgi, etc.).

The company was acquired by S. Guiterman in 1961, but went out of business in 1966 (Nigel 2013). After this, Modern Products kept making some of the Budgie models until 1969 (First Gear, no date; Ragan 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;27). Also after 1966, the H. Seener Ltd. company continued to produce slightly altered Budgie models which appeared under the "Seerol" name until the late 1990s (First Gear, no date). Modern Products, H. Seener, and Seerol produced models through the 1990s mainly for the London tourist market (First Gear, no date). Another company that took over dies from Modern Products was Starcourt, so it took a while for Budgie Model production to truly cease.  In 2017 the original dies for the matchbox size VW beetle and Microbus reappeared under new ownership and are being offered online by the creator of DG copy models, Dave Gilbert under the budgie models website.

==Horse-drawn vehicles==
Early Morestone Modern Product toys were a variety of agricultural, truck and automotive vehicles. Often horse-drawn vehicles were common - in particular a couple of [[stagecoach]]es. One of these was a more European squarish style "Ye Olde Coach &amp; Four", the four being four horses (usually two brown and two gray) with driver and trunk. Also in a more European style was the more ornate single horse "Gypsy Caravan". One variation had a yellow body with red details and a green roof. Diecast metal wheels were often painted gold. Another American style "Stage Coach" came with either two or four horses. The coach, rigging, chest, horses and driver were all made of [[zamac]]. This more-rounded coach came in "Wild West", "Wells Fargo", or "Kansas to Texas" (return from the cattle drive?) styles. With four horses these coaches were about {{convert|5|to|6|in|cm}} long.

A similar vehicle also was the four-horse, American-style covered wagon, available with material canopy and side water barrels. The canopy ("hood") was sometimes plain and sometimes imprinted with cowboy and Native American design. Over the years, boxes also came in a variety of colors. Later offerings of this covered wagon were "Hawkeye, the Last of the Mohicans", and "[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color|Walt Disney's]] Davey Crockett". This wagon normally appeared with four detachable horses, but at times came with six. Another smaller {{convert|3|in|adj=on|spell=in}} covered wagon was also offered (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;68).

Other horse-drawn vehicles were a single-horse wheeled "Sam's" coffee stall, a horse-drawn snack bar, a single-occupant horse-drawn Hansom Cab, and Santa's sleigh with single reindeer (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;106). Additionally available was a smaller State Landau elaborate coach with six horses, but the finish was a bit cruder, and the horses were not detachable.

==Model details==
Morestone cars in the 1950s were painted a variety of non-metallic colors, and often were two toned paint. Their wheels were most often plain silver metal. 1960s Budgie cars and trucks were reminiscent of Matchbox, though slightly smaller, with less detail, and simpler with plain paint and no windows (Ragan 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;27-28). It seems the detail increasingly required to satisfy Matchbox and Hot Wheels' toy-hungry children was something Budgie had problems keeping up with. The Morestone, Modern Product and ESSO series toys were a smaller scale and were the more common; some trucks and motorcycles were a bit larger scale, somewhat like Corgi Toys or Dinkys.

Despite the simplicity, some models and their liveries could be quite clever, and Morestone/Budgie's forte seemed to be in selecting unique subjects not manufactured by other companies (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;38). Distinct cars and smaller vehicles were wheeled air compressors, a [[tandem bicycle]] with two metal 'riders' and [[sidecar]], a 1953 [[Packard Clipper]] convertible, a [[1957 Plymouth Belvedere]] convertible, and a 1967 [[Oldsmobile 98]] 'town sedan' (Ragan 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;46, 79-80).  In trucks and construction, notable were the Morris "Budgie Service" breakdown lorry, the ERF low loader with electrical cable spools on the trailer, the strangely shaped ERF-articulated, mobile traffic "Jumbo" control unit, the Leyland tanker truck labeled with the phrase "You'll feel a lot better if you drink milk", or the [[R.E.A. Express]] Commer van with appropriate budgerigar illustrated on the van's sides (Ragan 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;71; Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;114, 143). One intriguing model was the [[Thornycroft]] Amazon salvage lorry with crane which raises and swivels - the model also features a separate auxiliary engine (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;39). Another would be the early-1960s GMC delivery van with Hertz markings or the 
Bedford tipper truck with "Ham River Grit" written on the sides (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
[[File:Lesneyaustin195westminstercountryman.JPG|right|thumb|266x266px| Morestone/Budgie Austin Westminster Countryman estate.]]
One assembly detail different on Morestone/Budgie models, compared to other manufacturers, is the painting of wheels ''after'' they have been attached to axles. The appearance of painted 'hubs' at times makes a buyer wonder if the model has been 'retouched' by a collector, but this is factory spec (Ragan 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;27; Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;39).

Before and after the Budgie name was introduced, the company also offered a line of Enid Blyton's 'Noddy' character figurines and vehicles. This included metal characters with wagons and bicycles of the wooden boy [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]] and his [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]] friend, [[Big Ears (character)|Big Ears]].

==Packaging==
Early packaging for stagecoaches, etc. would be marked "Morestone" and "Modern Products". Boxes were two parts; lid and bottom with staples closing the lid on each end. The lid was covered with a printed, rather monocolor, paper label.

Later, yellow and red boxes with white trim seem to have been "Modern" Products offerings only without any reference to Morestone or Budgie (which name was introduced in 1959). Whichever package was seen, the vehicles themselves often only said, "Made in England" along with their names and number on the metal bases&amp;nbsp;– but no indication of manufacturer&amp;nbsp;– making their manufacturer difficult to identify at times (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;39). Morestone/Budgie models are thus often mistaken for Matchbox toys. The goal may have been to make vehicles generically labeled for easier marketing under several different names: "Modern", "Morestone" or "[[Esso Petroleum|ESSO]]".

As mentioned, ESSO petrol was a main sponsor and its distinctive oval sign appears on many Morestone models. ESSO-themed packaging was a main theme of the mid-1950s models and the boxes portrayed the name in 'portrait' style with box standing on end. Morestone's ESSO packaging is reminiscent of other companies that attempted to claim a market niche with unique box styles. Whereas Matchbox had 'Match'-boxes, [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] had 'Cigar'-boxes, Charbens had little suitcases and Benbros had boxes that looked like TV sets, Morestone's ESSO line packaged vehicles in little boxes that looked like gas pumps (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;39). One side of the box looked like (with end flap open) the face of an 'ESSO-Extra' petrol pump with a gallons gauge, while opposite sides illustrated the toy. The box front states "ESSO Petrol Pump Series manufactured and produced by Morris &amp; Stone (London) Ltd. by permission of the owners of the ESSO trademark" (Rixon 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;39). Stores were supplied with colorful ESSO display stands which held the 20 Morestone vehicles in the series. Buyers could get a free 'garage' by sending in coupons off of the boxes (which most certainly hinders the search for non-cut, perfectly boxed models).

Packaging c. 1960, after the Budgie name was introduced, consisted of pale yellow boxes with black flaps. Later, hanging blister packs were a pale-turquoise with a bright-orange stripe across the top. "Budgie" was written in bold white letters in the orange area with a [[budgerigar]] bird illustrated to the right. Selected models are listed on the back of the package. Other blister cards were yellow with black highlighting or red, white, and blue. Gift sets had pictures of young boys with the cars. Some Budgie blister cards were sponsored by ''Life'' magazine and distributed through The Toy House. The packaging for these had more of a blue-and-white colored card with red lettering. The card carried both the logo for The Toy House and said, "Advertised in LIFE magazine".

Some later Budgie Toys made their way into the New Zealand [[Fun Ho! Toys]] Midget Car series along with many Matchbox toolings. The kiwi Midget Toys boxes took their design from the earlier Budgie / Modern Products boxes and their red and yellow colored panels.

== History ==
Previously known as Blue Heart Travel, Inc, the company was established in October 1992 by Neeta Helms and Jacques Vallerand-Parisi with a base in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington, D.C.]]. The company began with tours to [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] one year after the [[Soviet Union]] fell and soon added destinations such as [[Croatia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[South Africa]], and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yenckel|first1=James T.|title=Russia: Braving a Budget Package Tour of Moscow and St. Petersburg: Just What Do You Get for Your Money?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/travel/1993/05/16/russia-braving-a-budget-package-tour-of-moscow-and-st-petersburg-just-what-do-you-get-for-your-money/aeff0e08-36c3-472f-8f1c-635fc774a087/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar-Curran, Terri

Since 1997, Classical Movements has been based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruhe|first1=Shirley|title=People At Work: Classical Movements Practices 24-hour Music Diplomacy|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2017/sep/11/people-work-classical-movements-practices-24-hour-/|website=Alexandria Gazette|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Americans for the Arts]], an arts [[advocacy organization]] in the [[United States]], awarded Classical Movements the BCA10: Best Businesses Partnering with the Arts in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BCA 10 Winners|url=http://www.americansforthearts.org/events/bca-10/bca-10-archive/bca-10-winners|website=Americans for the Arts|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural diplomacy ==
[[File:United States Memorial Service for Nelson Mandela.jpg|thumb|The official United States Nelson Mandela memorial service where the Morgan State University Choir and Pacific Boychoir performed in Washington D.C. in December 2013.]]

Classical Movements has been involved in numerous cultural diplomacy events.

A year after its founding, in 1993, Classical Movements took the [[Choral Arts Society of Washington]] on tour to [[Moscow, Russia]] with the [[National Symphony Orchestra]] [[conducted]] by [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]. This concert marked the first time any event other than a [[military parade]] had taken place in the [[Red Square]]. Among the audience of 100,000 was [[President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] as millions more watched and listened worldwide to the [[live broadcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Midgette|first1=Anne|title=Inside the NSO’s grand return to Russia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/inside-the-nsos-grand-return-to-russia/2017/04/07/5c309112-1900-11e7-8003-f55b4c1cfae2_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Movements began touring to [[South Africa]] in 1994 shortly after [[apartheid]] was abolished and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRAVEL ADVISORY; Seeing South Africa: A Choice of Tours|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/travel/travel-advisory-seeing-south-africa-a-choice-of-tours.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Classical Movements became the first American company to offer tours in Croatia after the end of the [[Croat–Bosniak War]], as well as in [[China]] becoming one of the first travel companies in the country following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square]], and in [[Vietnam]] following the new United States [[Embassy]] in [[Hanoi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Several years later in 2003, the [[United States Department of State]] and [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] invited the [[Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra]] to perform in Washington, alongside [[Leonard Slatkin]]'s National Symphony Orchestra. Classical Movements arranged for the Iraqi musicians' travel from [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horvath|first1=Janet|title=Classical Movements II  "Moving the Music; Changing the World"|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/classical-movements-ii-moving-music-changing-world/|website=Interlude|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its president Neeta Helms, Classical Movements worked for [[Google]] in 2009 to arrange all the travel and logistics for the debut of the [[YouTube Symphony Orchestra]], where musicians from across the globe electronically met to perform at [[Carnegie Hall]]. In 2011, there was a reprise at the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sardana|first1=Nikhil|title=Neeta Helms, Founder and President – Classical Movements|url=https://serenademagazine.com/interviews/neeta-helms-founder-president-classical-movements|website=Serenade Magazine|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Classical Movements arranged the travel for the first joint concert for American and Cuban choirs in [[Havana]] on the [[4th of July]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Ladies Choir Charms Cuban Audiences|url=http://havanareporternews.com/culture/us-ladies-choir-charms-charms-cuban-audiences.html|website=The Havana Reporter|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2015 the company arranged a Cuban tour with [[Minnesota Orchestra]] despite there being no official [[diplomatic ties]] yet between the United States and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Michael|title=Minnesota Orchestra’s Cuba Trip Puts It at the Cultural Vanguard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/arts/music/minnesota-orchestras-cuba-trip-puts-it-at-the-cultural-vanguard.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Movements was also involved in the official United States [[memorial service]] for [[Nelson Mandela]] at [[Washington National Cathedral]] in 2013 where on behalf of the South African [[Ambassadors of the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], [[Ebrahim Rasool]], they invited original Ihlombe! participants [[Morgan State University]] Choir and [[Pacific Boychoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Morgan State University Choir to perform at Mandela service in D.C., streamed online|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-12-11/entertainment/bal-morgan-state-choir-to-sing-at-mandela-memorial-in-dc-20131210_1_memorial-service-nathan-carter-d-c|website=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orchestral and choir tours ==

Classical Movements organizes more than 200 concerts on 60 tours each season in 145 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heath|first1=Thomas|title=s Alexandria firm moves the music around the world|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/alexandria-firm-moves-the-music-around-the-world/2013/09/15/f75e0548-1a26-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Prague Summer Nights: Young Artists Music Festival''' (since 2015) is a 30-day program for singers and instrumentalists to receive professional performance training and experiences.

It includes fully staged opera, directed by the [[operatic]] [[baritone]] [[Sherrill Milnes]], as well as orchestral concerts, [[chamber music]], solo [[recitals]], and [[cabaret]] performed in historic halls in [[Tábor]], [[Prague]], and [[Salzburg]].

| style="text-align: left;" | "''Coke Studio Explorer'' is a story of people and resilience. It sparks the broader conversation of diversity and language. The program is centered around a number of hugely talented and driven musicians whose songs will do Pakistan proud. It is driven by our desire to help put the genre of folk amalgamated with the urban sounds of the country, on an international landscape. We travelled across the country with our laptops and mobile recording system, in the hope to truly capture the essence and spirit of music across the country. It was important to record each artist in their own spaces; where they were most at ease. With ''Coke Studio Explorer'', we hope to discover, archive and narrate these songs and stories in an urbanized 2018 soundscape.

In March 2018, ''[[Coca-Cola]]'' Pakistan announced [[Ali Hamza]] and [[Zohaib Kazi]] would helm [[Coke Studio Pakistan (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ''Coke Studio'' as a producers and directors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1654287/4-confirmed-ali-hamza-single-handedly-produce-coke-studio-11/|title=‘Coke Studio’ unveils Ali Hamza, Zohaib Kazi as producers for season 11|date=March 8, 2018|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=July 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Bilal Maqsood]] and [[Asif Kapadia]] of [[Strings (band)|Strings]] left the show to continue their own music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://tribune.com.pk/story/1544551/4-strings-bid-farewell-coke-studio-good-note/|title=Strings bid farewell to Coke Studio on a good note|date=October 29, 2018|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=July 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/132623/strings-take-leave-coke-studio-heartfelt-goodbye-2/|title=Strings take their leave from ‘Coke Studio’ with a heartfelt goodbye - Daily Times|date=October 31, 2018|work=Daily Times|access-date=July 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Speaking of their collaboration Zohaib said, "we met on a bench in a park; it was [[Alhamra Arts Council|Alhamra Park]] bench in Lahore. That's how it began. And when you know what the end will be, things become easy. And things fall into place."&lt;ref name="CSX2"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://tns.thenews.com.pk/unveiling-coke-studio-explorer-ii/|title=Unveiling Coke Studio Explorer – II |first=Maheen |last= Sabeeh|work =The News ON Sunday |language=en-US|date=July 15, 2018|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair met in August 2017 and after two months they outlined the structure for the show, in an interview with ''[[Arab News]]'' Hamza said, "we sat down to talk very specifically about this opportunity and it was amazing! In a matter of 10 to 15 minutes we were so triggered, so driven-I truly felt I had known Zohaib for a long time."&lt;ref name="CSXArabnews"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.arabnews.com/node/1333771/lifestyle |title =Coke Studio set to give world a Pakistani culture shock|first=Sabah Bano|last=Malik|date=July 5, 2018|work=[[Arab News]]|access-date =July 19, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailing further he said, "a common theme in a lot of our conversations was that Pakistan and Pakistanis are going through a bit of an identity crisis; one of the primary discussions we had was, 'what do we do after ten years?' We had to innovate. It was very important for us to recognize and acknowledge the countercultures that exist around us; these are the people who give our identity depth. ''Coke Studio'' has the reach to allow us to get to know these cultures more intimately and to amplify their colors."&lt;ref name="CSXArabnews"/&gt; It was not until March 8, 2018 when the duo were announced as a new producers for the series and as a part of new module, ''Coke Studio Explorer'' was revealed at the end of June 2018; in an interview Hamza said, "we wanted to focus on things that we hadn't ever explored before, and to look at elements of what makes Pakistan what it is today-highlighting the Pakistani identity and truly owning the white in our flag."&lt;ref name="CSXForbes"/&gt; On the idea of series Kazi said, "the thing that was established in the first ten minutes was how we were going to end this because once you establish the end, automatically your goals are established and a plan emerges."&lt;ref name="CSX1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/unveiling-coke-studio-explorer/#.W1CjgNgzYWr|title=Unveiling Coke Studio Explorer |first=Maheen |last= Sabeeh|work =The News ON Sunday |language=en-US|date=July 1, 2018|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On explaining the creation behind ''Coke Studio Explorer'' Zohaib said, "we felt that CS had to spread its wings and throw a larger net across the country, to not just attract the urban pool, but the rural pool as well. At the end of the day, the regions and its people collectively make Pakistan. It was important for us to explore this vision in depth."&lt;ref name="CSXformat1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1180351|title=Ali Hamza and Zohaib Kazi go out of the studio for this year’s Coke Studio|last=Sarym|first=Ahmed|date=July 2, 2018|work=Dawn Images|access-date=July 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the new format of the show Hamza said, "we've learned a lot from both the producer's ([[Rohail Hyatt]], Strings) tenures. Both had their positives, but by the end, we know there’s always going to be margin for more. We didn’t look at it as individuals, but across 10 years of CS rather than the journey of Rohail Hayat or Strings. We were very clear that we weren't going to put our journeys into it either, but focus objectively on the platform after this decade."&lt;ref name="CSXformat1"/&gt; Kazi also chipped, "after ten years, we felt that ''Coke Studio'' needed to innovate and search for talent wider and deeper than it had in the past. As producers, that is what we tried to do with ''Coke Studio Explorer''. More importantly, we tried to construct a module that will bring people together. We are in an election year and the political climate of the country is both charged and polarised. We hope that ''Coke Studio Explorer'' will help add some love and amity to the atmosphere and bring people together, using the tremendous power of music."&lt;ref name="CSXformat2"/&gt;

The General Manager of ''Coca-Cola'' Pakistan and Afghanistan, Rizwan U. Khan explained, "''Coke Studio Explorer'' is an unique manner of exploring the vast talent of our country. In addition "Coke Studio" has a legacy which has embraced and promoted Pakistan’s rich, vibrant and diverse culture. That has helped shaped a new narrative within and externally."&lt;ref name="CSXdetail2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coca-colajourney.com.pk/stories/coke-studio-explorer-revisiting-the-narrative-of-music-in-pakistan|title=Coke Studio Explorer: Revisiting the Narrative of Music in Pakistan|work=The Coca-Cola Company|date=July 15, 2018|access-date=July 19, 2018|language=en-PK}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that "''Coke Studio Explorer'' has been created as a natural and progressive chapter to the continuing legacy of ''Coke Studio''.&lt;ref name="CSXdetails1"/&gt;

===Explorer recording and artists=== 
The duo travelled extensively in the norther region of Pakistan, Sindh and Punjab to discover the regional but relatively unknown artists of their respective regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1180362|title=Coke Studio to explore hidden sounds of the nation|last=Sponsor|date=July 2, 2018|work=Dawn Images|access-date=July 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview duo said, "we established the criteria for selection before embarking on our search for musicians. The musicians had to be relatively unknown. They had to represent a unique aspect of the culture, history and spirit of Pakistan. And, they had to be talented. The selections were made in the field-in a natural, freewheeling and largely unrestrained manner – using the criteria that had been established in the beginning."&lt;ref name="CSXformat2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/260494/coke-studio-explorer-presents-authentic-folk-stories-in-an-urbanised-manner/|title=‘Coke Studio Explorer presents authentic folk stories in an urbanised manner’ - Daily Times|date=July 1, 2018|work=Daily Times|access-date=July 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kazi search for such artists was "both extensive and expansive" and together they covered four provinces of Pakistan bringing five artists to the platform.&lt;ref name="CSXformat1"/&gt; The duo developed a special mobile recording system for the on-location recordings and while additional tracks and engineering was completed in studio.&lt;ref name="CSXformat2"/&gt;

Ariana and Amrina are true personification of this traditional musical journey. They may be 4,000 but there chants make them sound like Four Hundred Thousand!".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/lifestyle/coke-studio-explorer-launches-kalash-based-song-pareek/|title=Pakistan’s Famous Music platform launches Kalash based song ‘Pareek’|first=Asma|last=Malik|date=July 4, 2018|work=Daily Pakistan|access-date=July 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Goth|Deewan Lal Chand]] village of [[Sindh]], the brother-sister Vishnu and Shamu Bai famous for their [[bhajans]] were made part of,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.urdupoint.com/en/lifestyle/coke-studio-explorer-takes-one-to-a-journey-t-387912.html|title=Coke Studio Explorer Takes One To A Journey To Sindh With ‘Faqeera’|first=Mahnoor| last=Sheikh|work=[[UrduPoint]] |date=July 5, 2018|access-date=July 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Sohbatpur District]], [[Overtone singing|throat-singers]] Mangal, Darehan and Shayan (now Bloach Throat singers) known for their singing technique "Naur-Sur" made their debuts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/340817-coke-studio-explorer-introduces-the-art-of-nar-sur-in-third-episode| title=Coke Studio Explorer introduces the art of ‘Nar Sur’ in third episode|last=Sabeeh|first =Maheen| work=The News International| date=July 12, 2018|access-date=July 25, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Muzaffarabad]], [[Azad Kashmir]] a band of four musicians titled, Qasamir lead by Altaf Mir with Ghulam Mohammad Daar, Manzoor Ahmed Khan, Saifuddin Shah performed.

The duso said, "we are big fans of original song writing, when we found her we didn't want to give her someone else's song and we didn't want to compose for her because then it'd become our expression.

'''''Comix 2000''''' was an international [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] independent [[comic book]] published in 2000 by [[L'Association]] (France) and distributed in the United States by [[Fantagraphics Books]].

All the comics featured in ''Comix 2000'' are wordless in order to accommodate readers of any nationality. Notable contributors to ''Comix 2000'' include [[Jessica Abel]], [[Edmond Baudoin]], [[Nick Bertozzi]], [[:fr:Stéphane Blanquet|Stéphane Blanquet]], [[Émile Bravo]], [[David B.]], [[Mike Diana]], [[Julie Doucet]], [[Renée French]], [[Tom Hart (comics)|Tom Hart]], [[Dylan Horrocks]], [[Megan Kelso]], [[Patrice Killoffer]], [[James Kochalka]], [[Étienne Lécroart]], [[Jean-Christophe Menu]], [[Brian Ralph]], [[Ron Regé, Jr.]], [[Joann Sfar]], [[R. Sikoryak]], [[Lewis Trondheim]], [[Chris Ware]], [[Skip Williamson]], and [[Aleksandar Zograf]].

The book's layout resembles that of a [[dictionary]], with 2000 pages of comics depicting the work of 324 authors from 29 different countries, plus an introduction—in ten different languages—and a bibliography for each contributor.

[[File:Playing card diamond 9.svg|thumb|upright|right|The '''Nine of Diamonds''' is sometimes referred to as the '''Curse of Scotland'''.]]
The '''Curse of Scotland''' is a nickname used for the '''Nine of Diamonds''' [[playing card]].&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com.|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/curse%20of%20Scotland|accessdate=23 April 2014|chapter=Curse of Scotland}}&lt;br&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary (1971) and Chambers 20th Century Dictionary (1983) give similar definitions&lt;/ref&gt; The expression has been used at least since the early 18th century, and many putative explanations have been given for the origin of this [[List of playing-card nicknames#endnote 9h|nickname for the card]].

[[File:Curse of Scotland.png|thumb|right|upright|Extract from ''British Apollo'' of 1708]]
In a book printed in London in 1708, ''The British Apollo, or, Curious amusements for the ingenious'', a question is posed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. ''Why is the'' Nine of Diamonds ''called'' the curse of Scotland?&lt;br/&gt;
A. Diamonds as the Ornamental Jewels of a Regnal Crown, imply no more in the above-nam'd Proverb than a mark of Royalty, for SCOTLAND'S ''Kings'' for many Ages, were observ'd, each ''Ninth'' to be a ''Tyrant'', who by Civil Wars, and all the fatal consequences of [[wikt:intestine|intestine]] discord, plunging the ''Divided Kingdom'' into strange Disorders, gave occasion, ''in the course of time'', to form the Proverb.&lt;ref name=bp1708&gt;{{cite book|last=A Society of Gentlemen|title=The British Apollo, or, Curious amusements for the ingenious, Volume I|date=13 February 1708|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRYTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PT225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}.

A similar book of 1726 gives the same question and answer, still regarding the question as relating to a proverb.&lt;ref name=apollo&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Theodore|title=The British Apollo: Containing Two Thousand Answers to Curious. Volume 2|date=1726|publisher=Arthur Bettesworth|page=533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHo0AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22british%20apollo%22%20%22curse%20of%20scotland%22&amp;pg=PA533#v=onepage&amp;q=%22british%20apollo%22%20%22curse%20of%20scotland%22&amp;f=false|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1757 the card was described as "commonly called the Curse of Scotland" with the explanation that the epithet refers to [[Adam Cockburn, Lord Ormiston|Lord Ormistoune]], [[Lord Justice Clerk]] from 1692 to 1735, who suppressed the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] and "became universally hated in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary of the Scottish language|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=45582&amp;startset=23730321&amp;query=LORD&amp;fhit=curse+of+scotland&amp;dregion=entry&amp;dtext=snd#fhit|publisher=Scottish Language Dictionaries|accessdate=23 April 2014}} (entry for ''Lord'')&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th-century Scotland, the nine of diamonds was sometimes called the "Justice Clerk", and was considered to be the most unlucky card in the pack.&lt;ref name=Burnett&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=Peter|title=The Curse of Scotland Part 1|url=http://peterburnett.info/scotland-blog/665-the-curse-of-scotland-pt-1|publisher=peterburnett.info|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Pope Joan" and 19th century speculation==
James Mitchell's 1825 ''Scotsman's Library'' claimed that the expression originated from the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] writing orders on such a card before the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] (1679).&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=James|title=The Scotsman's Library; Being a Collection of Anecdotes and Facts Illustrative of Scotland and Scotsmen|date=1825|publisher=Anderson, Cumming &amp; Jones|location=London|page=600|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVtZAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA600&amp;ots=ZZYkwuqj0k&amp;dq=Duke%20of%20Monmouth%20before%20the%20battle%20of%20Bothwell%20Brig%20nine%20diamonds&amp;pg=PA600#v=snippet&amp;q=nine%20diamonds&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite this, in ''[[The Spectator]]'', a reviewer of an 1885 book by George Gomme&lt;ref name=gomme&gt;{{cite book|last=Gomme|first=George Lawrence|title=The "Gentleman's Magazine Library: being a classified collection of the chief contents of the Gentleman's Magazine from 1731 to 1868;|date=1884|location=London|url=http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31402793/}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented that the reviewer had believed that the phrase had started from an order written on a {{diamonds}}9 by the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] ("Butcher" Cumberland) on the eve of the [[Battle of Culloden]] (1746). However he went on to remark that the book claims that "The curse of Scotland must be something which that nation hates and detests. The Scots held in the utmost detestation the Pope."&lt;ref name=spectator /&gt;{{refn|group=note|The pope was sometimes known to [[Presbyterianism#Scotland|Scots presbyterians]] as the [[antichrist]].&lt;ref name=scotsman&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the Curse of Scotland in the cards?|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/is-the-curse-of-scotland-in-the-cards-1-466324|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=9 March 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424124418/http://www.scotsman.com/news/is-the-curse-of-scotland-in-the-cards-1-466324|archivedate=24 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Lady Godina's rout; - or - Peeping-Tom spying out Pope-Joan by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Gillray]] caricature of 1796 showing a lady playing ''Pope Joan'' and holding the nine of diamonds]]
In the card game [[Pope Joan (card game)|Pope Joan]], very popular in the 19th century, the {{diamonds}}9 is the most powerful card, and it is called the "Pope". The game is played on a special board on which the middle is marked "Pope Joan", and it is used in association with this card.

A letter written in response to ''The Spectator's'' book review pointed out that the saying was established well before Culloden, and preferred the Pope Joan theory to other explanations.&lt;ref name=black /&gt;

Other explanations given in the letter were:
* the family arms of [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair]] (the villain of the [[massacre of Glencoe]]) have a more than passing resemblance to the {{diamonds}}9 playing card;
[[File:Flag of Scotland (traditional).svg|thumb|St Andrew's Cross]]
* "curse" is a corruption of "cross" and the nine pips on cards were in the form of a [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]];
* a thief in [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]' reign attempted to steal the Crown Jewels and got away with nine diamonds, and all Scotland was taxed for the theft;{{refn|group=note|The thief was one George Campbell.&lt;ref name=scotsman /&gt;}}
* [[James IV]], before the [[Battle of Flodden]], spent time searching for a missing card—the {{diamonds}}9—time which would have been better spent in preparing for the battle;
* [[Mary of Lorraine]] (or maybe [[James, Duke of York]]) introduced the game of "Comette" into Scotland, in which the {{diamonds}}9 is the winning card, against which many Scottish nobles lost their wealth.&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=William George|title=The Curse of scotland|journal=The Spectator|date=21 March 1887|page=387|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/21st-march-1885/15/the-curse-of-scotland|accessdate=23 April 2014}} (The Spectator originally misprinted the author's surname)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Many of the claims had been previously published in Chambers' ''The Book of Days'' (1864).&lt;ref name=chambers&gt;{{cite book

An 1864 book by [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], upon which this letter seems to have been based, describes the theories as "most lame and unsatisfactory suggestions" compared with the Dalrymple theory. The book dismisses the Culloden theory because of an earlier 1745 caricature of "the young chavalier attempting to lead a herd of bulls, laden with papal curses, excommunications &amp;c., across the Tweed, with the Nine of Diamonds lying before them".&lt;ref name=chambers /&gt;

==Other connotations==
===Nine of diamonds===
The 19th century [[Tarot of Marseilles]] is one of the standard designs for [[tarot]] cards. It contains a [[The Hierophant|"Pope" card]] (and, indeed, a [[The High Priestess|"Popess"]]) but there seems to be no connection with the Pope Joan card game, even though the popess may have derived from the mythical [[Pope Joan]].&lt;ref name=pardoe&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pardoe|first1=Rosemary A.|last2=Pardoe|first2=Darroll|title=The Female Pope : the Mystery of Pope Joan: the first complete documentation of the facts behind the legend|date=10 March 1988|publisher=Crucible|location=Wellingborough, England|isbn=9781852740139|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pardos/PopeJoan8.html|edition=1st|chapter=Chapter 8.

===Curse of Scotland===
The expression "Curse of Scotland" is sometimes used simply to refer to an occasion of bad luck at cards and can also refer to generally unwanted situations in Scotland, such as swarms of [[midge]]s.&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Alistair|title=Curse of Scotland|url=http://www.incallander.co.uk/scottishsongs/curse.htm|publisher=Callender Enterprise|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608014723/http://www.incallander.co.uk/scottishsongs/curse.htm|archivedate=8 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[theatrical superstition]], sometimes called the ''Scottish curse'', that speaking the name ''Macbeth'' in the theatre brings bad luck. Hence "[[the Scottish Play]]" is used to refer to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play.

'''David Roth''' (born 1952, [[New York City]]) is an American [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] widely regarded as one of the world's greatest living [[Coin Magic|coin magicians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waters|first=T.A.|title=The Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians|year=1988|publisher=Facts on File|location=USA|isbn=0-8160-1349-7|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth was an important contributor to Richard Kaufman's ''Coinmagic'' an influential text on contemporary coin technique; his major work was chronicled in ''David Roth's Expert Coin Magic'', a book co-written with Richard Kaufman.  Roth is now associated with Fantasma magic, a magic manufacturing and retail company in New York City.

The [[sleight of hand]] artist [[Dai Vernon]], wrote about Roth:

"First let me state that David Roth has an amazing ability when performing with coins. He is truly a genius. I have been fortunate to have enjoyed the confidence and friendship of the leading exponents of coin manipulation of the past. [[T. Nelson Downs]], Allan Shaw, Manuel and Welch Miller all specialized in this branch of the magical art. To the very best of my judgment, David’s ideas and execution far surpass any one of them. I feel quite certain that if they could witness his performance they would not only be astounded but realize that they had seen the master."

== Major technical contributions ==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
Roth's trick "The Hanging Coins" (which was first revealed in ''Apocalypse'' magazine, Volume 1, No. 6, page 68, 1978) took an ancient, and long ignored, sleight-of-hand technique and made it far more deceptive and useful.  This technique, which Roth dubbed "Edge Grip," has subsequently been explored in depth by other experts in the field.  It is a significant tool of contemporary coin magic.

Roth's virtuoso execution of a "persistence of vision vanish" led to tremendous interest in his handling of the move (which he refers to "The Retention Vanish"), and – perhaps – to increased use of this move among magicians.

Roth's handling and application of a technique that has – largely thanks to him – become known as "The Shuttle Pass" is highly influential.

Roth's "The Original Chinese Coin Assembly" was highly influential as the first published coin assembly that used the bare hands.  This was a highly influential development that has been widely used and explored by other sleight-of-hand experts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32662">'''Digital terrestrial television in Canada''' (often shortened to DTT) is transmitted using the [[ATSC standard]]. Because Canada and the U.S. use the same standard and frequencies for channels, people near the [[Canada–United States border]] can watch [[digital television]] [[Broadcast programming|programming]] from [[television station]]s in either country where available. The ATSC standards are also used in [[Mexico]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Suriname]] and [[South Korea]].

Jurisdiction over terrestrial broadcasting in Canada is primarily regulated by [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).  Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has jurisdiction over the allotment of the terrestrial spectrum and the CRTC has jurisdiction over the allotment of broadcast licences.

The CRTC imposed in 28 mandatory markets a digital transition deadline for full power transmitters of August 31, 2011, with the exception of some [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] transmitters. Two weeks before the deadline, the CBC transmitters were given a temporary one-year extension to remain in analog. No digital transition deadline has been set for low-power analogue transmitters and analog transmitters outside the 28 mandatory markets.

In January 2007, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada stopped issuing licences within Canada for new television transmitters broadcasting in analogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf08702.html Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada Advisory Letter — The Use of Unplanned Over-the-Air (OTA) Broadcasting Television Spectrum and the Manufacturing and Importation for the Sale of Digital Capable Television Receiving Apparatus]&lt;/ref&gt;

All remaining analog terrestrial television signals across Canada are scheduled to be shutdown no later than 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/DTV-transition-schedule2017.pdf/$FILE/DTV-transition-schedule2017.pdf Digital Television (DTV) Transition Schedule] - Updated April 2017 - [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The digital television transition in Canada and the United States will result in spectrum on channels 52 to 69 being re-allocated for other purposes. The United States government already auctioned most of this spectrum and Canada is planning on doing the same. The United States government, using some proceeds of the spectrum auction, funded an education campaign in advance of the transition, provided subsidies to many broadcasters in support of transitioning to digital, and provided subsidies to consumers for digital to analogue converter boxes. In contrast, the Canadian government did not provide any similar funding in support of the digital television transition. The Canadian government's most visible efforts to support the public in the transition to digital over-the-air television has been in the form of a website entitled [http://digitaltv.gc.ca/ Canada's Transition to Digital Television (DTV)] along with some newspaper, radio, and television advertisements in the month leading up to the transition deadline.

Engineering firm Spectrum Expert Inc. estimated a total cost to Canadian broadcasters of [[Canadian dollar|$]]378-425 million to convert all 738 Canadian full-power television transmitters to DTV on their newly assigned channels; if the 1238 low-power transmitters were converted, costs would increase further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/dtv0903.pdf Cost Estimate of Digital Television (DTV) Conversion for Canada], P. Lemée / F. Gauthier, [http://spectrumexpert.ca Spectrum Expert Inc.], March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the highest costs were for existing full-power VHF [[rebroadcaster|rebroadcast transmitters]] that would have to be replaced by new UHF facilities in locations far from broadcast studios. As a worst case, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]-[[owned-and-operated station|owned]] [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV-6 and CJOH-TV-8]] were estimated at a conversion cost of over four million dollars each. WhileDigital Television (DTV) Transition Schedule - Industry Canada CTV had threatened to shut down a long list of these full-power rebroadcasters on August 31, 2009, {{as of|2011|lc=on}} the transmitters are still on the air.

Several broadcasters, including the CBC, argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. Converting a transmitter to digital has up front capital equipment costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which can in more extreme cases reach over a million dollars, though some cost recovery in energy costs is possible due to lower transmission power required to cover an area as compared to analog, if the same channel is used. At CRTC hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee ([[fee-for-carriage]]) similar to that already charged by cable [[specialty channel]]s, permitting [[licence fee]]s similar to those that fund the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.

The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising, gradually removing all limits to the number of advertisements per hour of broadcast programming, as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080624.wrcable24/BNStory/Technology/home "Networks unprepared for digital TV shift: CRTC"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles06240801.asp Networks unprepared for digital TV shift: CRTC by Grant Robertson]&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed the regulator's concern that Canada's television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|US financial crisis]] and subsequent [[Late-2000s recession|2008 recession]] adverserly affected advertising sales, the primary source of revenue for most broadcasters. Inadequate revenue in combination with debt incurred from purchasing other media companies caused [[Canwest]], owner of the [[Global Television Network]], to file for bankruptcy protection and to be subsequently purchased by [[Shaw Communications]]. Some [[Global Television Network]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] stations in smaller markets were closed or sold. Seeking further sources of revenue, the television broadcasters including [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] launched an aggressive and somewhat successful campaign to re-open debate for introducing [[fee-for-carriage|value for signal]] from cable and satellite television providers) debate in 2009.

On August 6, 2010, CBC/Radio-Canada announced in a press release that only its existing digital stations, along with both [[Alberta]] [[CBC Television]] originating stations plus all [[Télévision de Radio-Canada]] (SRC) originating stations in [[Quebec City]] and [[Moncton]], would be DTV-ready in time for the August 2011 deadline. The remaining CBC/SRC originating [[owned-and-operated station|O&amp;O]]s were to be converted a year later in August 2012, subject to CRTC approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/08/06/cbc-digital-television-transition.html CBC won't meet digital TV deadline], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], August 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, CBC/Radio-Canada updated the information on its website to state that it was striving to convert originating [[owned-and-operated station|O&amp;O]] by August 31, 2011. CBC stated that it does not intend on transitioning any of its full-power repeaters to digital, despite in some cases being in markets (such as [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Saskatoon]]) required to convert by August 31, 2011.

In many instances, stations transitioning to digital continued utilizing the same channel, antenna or other facilities for their new digital transmitters after the end of transition. To save costs, with the exception of some stations in the largest markets, stations chose to flash cut from analogue to digital at the transition deadline rather than spending on the infrastructure and energy costs needed to broadcast the station in analogue and digital at the same time.

Leading up to the transition deadline, CRTC expressed concern that "if all broadcasters wait until the last moment to proceed to the transition, there could be a shortage of professional engineers and competent technicians capable of assuming the development of new plans and the installation of new systems and structures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-129.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-129, 26 June 2008 re: Change in the effective control of TQS inc. and licence renewals, Section 86: Conversion to digital]&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to limited engineering resources, [[Global Television Network]] flash cut its transmitters over a 2-month period leading up to the deadline and [[TV Ontario]] flash cut its transmitters two weeks before the deadline.  In contrast, most other networks and stations converted at the deadline.

There are no requirements for new televisions sold in Canada to include digital tuners ([[All-Channel Receiver Act|as they must in the US market]]), nor are there any labelling requirements for analogue-only receivers; some new televisions may be unable to tune a digital signal without an external [[ATSC tuner]]. {{asof|2010}}, an estimated 900000 Canadians relying on antennas prior to the transition deadline were expected to lose over-the-air television reception by the transition deadline, as they are not ready for the digital transition. While a new HDTV receiver connected to a terrestrial television antenna will receive OTA digital television, Canadian regulations do not require [[cable television]] operators to carry these free local HDTV signals in [[encrypt|unencrypted]] digital format on their systems.

==Deployment==
[[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] was the first Canadian station to provide digital terrestrial service, first broadcasting in January 2003, and going full-time in March 2003. The first HD broadcast in Canada was [[CBC Sports]]' coverage of the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]], an outdoor [[National Hockey League|NHL]] game. CBC ultimately launched a high definition feed of their eastern (Toronto) flagship [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] in 2005, later launching feeds in Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montreal. As of 2008, other digital stations on-air included the [[CBC Television|CBC]] and [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] stations in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], as well as [[CTV Television Network|CTV's]] [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] and [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]], and [[Quebecor Media]]'s independent station [[CKXT-DT|CKXT]].

The first Canadian broadcaster to have delivered a digital-only terrestrial TV signal of any type, [[CKXT-DT|CKXT-TV]] (in [[Ottawa]] and [[London, Ontario|London]]), signed on its pair of digital-only transmitters in 2008. These were both [[rebroadcaster]]s of the same [[Toronto]] station with no local programme origination; the main Toronto station transmitted in both analogue and digital format. The first stations to complete the digital transition (on their main signals) were [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]]'s [[CFKM-DT]], followed by [[CISA-DT]] in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]].

As of July 2011, digital television broadcasts had commenced in just 11 of Canada's largest markets, but nearly all of the stations in mandatory markets ended up meeting the transition deadline.  The stations that did not meet the deadline fall into two categories.  First, there were some stations that had delays in converting to digital due to financial or technical issues.  Second, are the CBC rebroadcaster transmitters in mandatory markets, and CTV's Access transmitters in [[Calgary, AB]] and [[Edmonton, AB]].  In CBC's case, the CBC obtained an over year extension to convert its transmitters, publicly stating that it was not planning on converting these transmitters.  CBC later announced that all its analogue transmitters will be permanently shut down on July 31, 2012 and will not be replaced.  In the case of CTV's Access transmitters, the network chose to shut them down at the transition deadline rather than converting them to digital.

Broadcasting digital terrestrial signals instead of analog offers numerous advantages to the viewer, such as the following: support for [[High-definition television|high definition (HD)]] picture, support for 5 speaker surround sound, support for [[PSIP|information on the current and the next few programs shown on the channel]], support for [[digital subchannel|sub-channels]], [[Solomon-Reed error correction]] to eliminate [[multipath interference|multipath]] ([[ghosting (television)|ghosting]]), and support for mobile devices (i.e. [[ATSC-M/H]]). Canadian broadcasters have implemented many of the listed features to varying extents.  [[CJON-DT]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] has become the first to offer different content on a subchannel, in the form of sister radio station [[CHOZ-FM]] on an audio-only subchannel, and [[CIII-DT]] in [[Toronto]] offers an SD simulcast of its HD feed on a subchannel, which is allowed under current CRTC licensing policies. On August 17, 2012, the CRTC gave approval to [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] [[community station (Canada)|community station]] [[CFTV-DT|CFTV-TV]] in [[Leamington, Ontario]] to broadcast four local subchannels on its digital signal, making it the first station in Canada to launch original content on its multiplex channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-446.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there are currently no transmitters broadcasting TV signals intended for mobile devices, though [[CBLFT-DT]] has done occasional test broadcasts of a mobile simulcast of sister station [[CBLT-DT]] in 2011 and 2012.

==Transition details==

The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) initially decided not to enforce a single date for ending analog broadcasts, opting to let market forces decide when the switchover will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2002/pb2002-31.htm |title=Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2002-31 |accessdate=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently reversed its position, on May 17, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/Eng/archive/2007/pb2007-53.htm |title=Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2007-53 |accessdate=2009-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; setting an analogue shutoff date of August 31, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/oca-bc.nsf/en/ca02336e.html Canada’s Office of Consumer Affairs - What You Need to Know About the Analogue-to-Digital Television Transition in Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916083326/http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/oca-bc.nsf/en/ca02336e.html |date=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just over two years after the American transition date of June 12, 2009.  Mandatory markets with a transmitter that does not transition to digital by the deadline will lose the over-the-air signal for the corresponding station permanently or until a digital transmitter is brought on-the-air for that station in that area.  Note that the transition deadline only concerns over-the-air signals and does not impact other televisions reception methods in Canada such as over the Internet (already digital), cable (some analog, most digital), or satellite (already digital).

On July 6, 2009, the CRTC issued a decision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-406.htm|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2009-406|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limited the required digital conversion to mandatory markets meeting any of the following criteria:
*the National Capital Region, provincial capitals, and territorial capitals
*markets served by multiple originating stations (including CBC stations)
*markets with populations greater than 300,000.

On March 14, 2011, the CRTC removed territorial capitals as mandatory markets on the basis that these are small and remote markets, and that only 1 of the 6 transmitters in these markets were planned to be converted to digital, while the remainder of the transmitters would be shut down rather than converted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-184.htm|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2011-184|accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18, 2011, the CRTC mandated a requirement that television stations must broadcast public service announcements regarding the digital over-the-air television transition from May 1, 2011 until August 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-198.htm|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2011-198|accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations must broadcast these ads 6 times a day, and increase this to 8 times a day starting August 1, 2011 or one month before the digital transition date for that station, whichever is sooner. Also by May 1, 2011, broadcasters must post on their websites about the broadcasters' specific plans for digital transition.

On August 18, 2011, the CRTC issued a decision that allowed CBC's mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analogue to remain on-air until August 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2011/2011-494.htm |title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2011-494|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the CRTC made this announcement, the CBC communicated that it planned on requesting an extension to remain broadcasting in analog past the August 31, 2012 deadline.  Although the CRTC allowed the CBC the extension to remain in analogue, the corporation's full power transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 were still required to either relocate to channels 2 to 51 or become low power transmitters. In some cases, CBC has opted reduce the power of existing transmitters to low power transmitters, which will result in signal loss for some viewers.

'''List of Mandatory Markets''':
* [[Alberta]]: Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Lloydminster
* [[British Columbia]]: Vancouver, Victoria

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201012616|title=Applicant response dated 6 December 2010|accessdate=2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

---&gt;

Although the majority of the over-the-air transmitters that were planned to be converted to digital made this conversion by August 31, 2011, a handful of stations had delays and were permitted to remain broadcasting in analog. In February 2012, [[CFTU-DT|CFTU-TV]] converted its transmitter to digital, marking the last of the mandatory market transmitters planned to become digital, to finally make the switch. This left 23 CBC and SRC rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets being required to transition to digital by August 31, 2012, though the CBC shut down all of its remaining analog television transmitters on July 31, 2012, with no further transmitters made digital.

Following the August 31, 2011 deadline, some channels requested to make changes to their digital transmitters to improve the signal. Requested changes included the following (note that this is a list of applications to the CRTC and does not reflect what the CRTC has approved or what has been implemented):
* CBC / SRC: CBVT-DT (SRC - Quebec) and CBOFT-DT (SRC - Ottawa) - moving from VHF to UHF; CKSH-DT (SRC - Sherbrooke) - increasing power on VHF
* Channel Zero Inc: CHCH-DT (Hamilton) - moving from VHF to UHF
* Global: CIII-DT (Kitchener) and CIII-DT-6 (Ottawa) - moving from VHF to UHF
* V Interactions Inc: CFRS-DT (Saguenay) - increasing power on VHF

===Non-mandatory markets===
Most stations have announced no plans for converting or shutting down analog transmitters outside mandatory markets required to transition to digital by August 31, 2011, but here are some exceptions:
* [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN)]], which has a network of transmitters in the [[Yukon]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], and one in northern [[Alberta]], shut down 39 low power transmitters on August 31, 2011, representing nearly half of its transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aptn.ca/psa/index.php Transmitters slated to shut down on August 31, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826021821/http://www.aptn.ca/psa/index.php |date=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CBC Television|CBC]] / [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|SRC]] converted its [[Rimouski|Rimouski, QC]] SRC transmitter ([[CJBR-DT]]) to digital on August 31, 2011, and its [[Yellowknife|Yellowknife, NT]] CBC transmitter ([[CFYK-TV]]) on August 1, 2012. CBC has stated that only the 27 originating station transmitters, which include Yellowknife and Rimouski, are to be converted to digital. On July 31, 2012, CBC permanently shut down its 620 remaining analogue television transmitters.
* [[Corus Entertainment]], owner of [[CKWS-TV|CKWS]], had to relocate a rebroadcast transmitter located in [[Brighton, Ontario|Brighton, ON]] to a lower channel because it was on a channel above 52, which had to be vacated by August 31, 2011. In addition to relocating this transmitter to a lower channel, the transmitter was converted to digital, but (as a repeater of an analogue station) offers only standard definition.
* [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] had to relocate a rebroadcast transmitter of [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] located in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough, ON]] to a lower channel because it was on a channel above 52, which had to be vacated by August 31, 2011. In addition to relocating this transmitter to a lower channel, the transmitter was converted to digital.
* [[Global Television Network|Global]] will be converting all of its transmitters to digital by 2016. The exception is its Fort Erie transmitter, which was shut down on August 31, 2011 with coverage instead provided by [[CIII-DT|Global's Toronto]] transmitter.
* [[Newcap Radio]] (formerly Newcap Broadcasting), owner of [[Lloydminster]] stations [[CITL-DT|CITL]] and [[CKSA-DT|CKSA]], shut down most of these stations' transmitters outside the Lloydminster area on August 31, 2011, despite the fact there is no requirement to make changes or to shut down these transmitters.
* [[Télé Inter-Rives]]' stations [[CKRT-DT|CKRT]], [[CIMT-DT|CIMT]], and [[CFTF-DT|CFTF]] [[Rivière-du-Loup|Rivière-du-Loup, QC]] and their translators were converted to digital on August 31, 2011. [[Carleton-sur-Mer|Carleton-sur-Mer, QC]] station [[CHAU-TV|CHAU]] and its associated translators were converted to digital a few months later.
* [[Télé-Québec]] converted all of its transmitters to digital, all located in [[Quebec]], by September 1, 2011.
* [[TFO|TFO (Télé-Française d'Ontario)]] shut down its 3 full power analogue transmitters in [[Sudbury, ON]], [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury, ON]], and [[Pembroke, ON]], along with one lower analogue power transmitter on July 31, 2012.  According to [[TFO]], the transmitter towers are owned by [[TV Ontario]], which began decommissioning them on July 31, 2012, thus the [[TFO]] transmitters had to shut down.  After July 31, 2012, [[TFO]] only had some low power analogue transmitters remaining.
* [[TVOntario]] permanently shut down all of its 114 analog TV transmitters (14 full power and 100 low power) on July 31, 2012.  Previously, in August 2011, [[TVOntario]] had to relocate three transmitters, in [[Chatham–Kent|Chatham, ON]], [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville, ON]], and [[Cloyne, Ontario|Cloyne, ON]] to lower channels because they were on channels above 52, which had to be vacated by August 31, 2011.  When the three transmitters were moved to lower channels, they were also converted to digital.

=== Transmitters using channels 51 to 69 ===
The 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band, occupying channels 52 to 69, occupied by television transmitters, is being re-allocated for mobile telecommunications devices and public safety communication.  The mobile telecommunications portion of the spectrum is to be auction by the Canadian government to telecommunications companies in 2013.  Industry Canada stopped issuing broadcast certificates for the upper part of this channel range in 2000 and the remainder of this channel range in 2007.  On August 22, 2011, the [[United States of America|United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]] announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-11-1428A1.pdf General Freeze on the Filing and Processing of Applications for Channel 51 Effective Immediately]&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent [[adjacent-channel interference]] to the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.  On December 16, 2011, [[Industry Canada]] placed a moratorium on future television stations using [[Channel 51 (disambiguation)|Channel 51]] for broadcast use, to prevent [[adjacent-channel interference]] to the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.&lt;ref name="ICUHF51"&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10161.html Industry Canada Advisory Letter - Moratorium on the Use of Television Channel 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

All remaining transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69 are low power analog and no new transmitters are allowed to be added to this channel range.  The Government of Canada has not set a deadline for low power transmitters to vacate this channel range.  Industry Canada has proposed that if notification is given for a transmitter to cease transmitting within this channel range, it will have 2 years to vacate the channel, if in a rural area, and 1 year, if it is in an urban area.  All of the remaining transmitters in the channel 52 to 69 range, are subject to the 2-year notification period.

On July 31, 2012, [[CBC Television|CBC]] / [[Télévision de Radio-Canada|SRC]] and [[TVOntario]] shut down all of their analogue transmitters, resulting in a combined total of 21 transmitters shutting down from the channel 52 to 69 range.

As of January 2013, based on Industry Canada's database of TV transmitters and based on transmitters known to have been permanently shut down,&lt;ref name="database"&gt;[http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Broadcasting Database Files]&lt;/ref&gt; there are 15 remaining television transmitters occupying channels 52 to 69, all low power analog, located in the following communities:
* [[Chéticamp, Nova Scotia|Cheticamp, NS]] (3 transmitters)
* [[Chetwynd, British Columbia|Chetwynd, BC]] (2 transmitters)
* [[Slocan Valley|Crescent Valley, BC]] (CH5646, low power channel 51)
* [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James, BC]] (9 transmitters)
* [[London, Ontario|London, ON]] ([[CHCH-DT|CHCH-DT-2]], channel 51)
* Santa Rosa, [[British Columbia|BC]] (1 transmitter, rebroadcaster of [[Global Television Network]]'s [[CHAN-DT]]) - By September 2016, this will be converted to digital, causing a move to the channel 2-50 range.  Conversion to digital is per a commitment by [[Shaw Communications]], when it purchased the [[Global Television Network]].
* [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg, MB]] ([[CBWFT-DT]], channel 51)

Except for the transmitter in Santa Rosa, the transmitters in the channel 52 to 69 range are all community operated transmitters.

A '''fabliau''' (plural '''fabliaux''') is a comic, often anonymous tale written by [[jongleur]]s in northeast [[France]] between ca. 1150 and 1400. They are generally characterized by sexual and [[scatological]] [[obscenity]], and by a set of contrary attitudes—contrary to the church and to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch (1986) ''Introduction'', p.11: "The scandal of the fabliaux--the excessiveness of their sexual and scatological obscenity, their anticlericalism, antifeminism, anticourtliness, the consistency with which they indulge the senses, whet the appetites (erotic, gastronomic, economic) and affirm what Bahktin identifies as the "celebration of lower body parts."&lt;/ref&gt; Several of them were reworked by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] for the ''[[Decameron]]'' and by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] for his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Some 150 French fabliaux are extant, the number depending on how narrowly ''fabliau'' is defined. According to R. Howard Bloch, fabliaux are the first expression of [[literary realism]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;R. Howard Bloch, "Postface," in Rossi and Straub, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nineteenth-century scholars, most notably [[Gaston Paris]], argue that fabliaux originally came from the [[Orient]] and were brought to the West by returning [[Crusades|crusaders]] &lt;ref&gt;Nykrog, Per, ''Les Fabliaux'', Geneva: Droz, 1973, xx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and definition of the genre==
The fabliau is defined as a short narrative in (usually octosyllabic) verse, between 300 and 400 lines long,&lt;ref name="Cuddon"&gt;Cuddon 301.&lt;/ref&gt; its content often comic or satiric.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;Abrams 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, it flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries; in England, it was popular in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Abrams" /&gt; Fabliau is often compared to the later [[short story]]; [[Douglas Bush]], longtime professor at [[Harvard University]], called it "a short story broader than it is long."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Abrams 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fabliau is remarkable in that it seems to have no direct literary predecessor in the West, but was brought from the East by returning crusaders in the 12th century. The closest literary genre is the [[fable]] as found in [[Aesop]] "and its eastern origins or parallels," but it is less moral and less ''didactic'' than the fable.&lt;ref name="FabliauxEncyclopadia"&gt;"Fabliaux," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the word is a northern French diminutive from ''fable''.."&lt;ref name=lewis241/&gt; In terms of morality it is suggested to be closer to the [[novel]] than to the [[parable]]: "the story is the first thing, the moral the second, and the latter is never suffered to interfere with the former."&lt;ref name="FabliauxEncyclopadia" /&gt; Still, according to Robert Lewis, "some two-thirds of the French fabliaux have an explicit moral attached to them."&lt;ref name=lewis241&gt;Lewis 241-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known fabliau is the anonymous ''[[Richeut]]''&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 424.&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1159-1175&lt;ref&gt;1159 in Cuddon 301; 1175 in "Fabliau, ''Merriam-Webster'' 399.&lt;/ref&gt;); one of the earliest known writers of fabliaux is [[Rutebeuf]], "the prototype of the jongleur of medieval literature."&lt;ref&gt;Hellman 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre has been quite influential: passages in longer medieval poems such as ''[[Le Roman de Renart]]'' as well as tales found in collections like [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decamerone]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' have their origin in one or several fabliaux. Additionally, the medieval church also found use for the fabliau form. Noting its popularity, the church turned to their own form of minstrelsy similar to the fabliau that espoused "worthy thoughts" rather than the "ribaldry" a more typical fabliau would couch its moral in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bahn |first1=Eugene |last2=Bahn |first2=Margaret |title=A History of Oral Interpretation |publisher=Burgess Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=0-8087-0260-2 |location=Minneapolis, MN |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fabliau gradually disappeared, at the beginning of the 16th century, it was replaced by the [[prose]] short story, which was greatly influenced by its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Balachov 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous French writers such as [[Molière]], [[Jean de La Fontaine]], and [[Voltaire]] owe much to the tradition of the fabliau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Columbian cyclopedia|year=1897|publisher=Garretson, Cox &amp; Company}}, vol. 11, 420-421&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Cast of characters, audience===
Typical fabliaux contain a vast array of characters, including [[cuckold]]ed husbands, rapacious [[clergy]], and foolish [[peasant]]s, as well as beggars, connivers, thieves, and whores. Two groups are often singled out for criticism: the clergy&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Burrows (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and women. The status of peasants appears to vary, based on the audience for which the fabliau was being written. Poems that were presumably written for the [[nobility]] portray peasants (''vilains'' in [[French language|French]]) as stupid and vile, whereas those written for the lower classes often tell of peasants getting the better of the clergy.

The audience for fabliaux is estimated differently by different critics. Joseph Bedier&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bedier. Les Fabliaux. Etude de littérature populaire et d'histoire littéraire du moyen âge. Quatrième édition, revue et corrigée. Paris, H. Champion, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests a bourgeois audience, which sees itself reflected in the urban settings and lower-class types portrayed in fabliaux. On the other hand, Per Nykrog&lt;ref&gt;Nykrog (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; argues that fabliaux were directed towards a noble audience, and concludes that fabliaux were the impetus for literary refreshment.

===Subject matter===
The subject matter is often sexual: fabliaux are concerned with the elements of love left out by poets who wrote in the more elevated genres such as [[Ovid]], who suggests in the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (II.704-5) that the Muse should not enter the room where the lovers are in bed; and [[Chrétien de Troyes]], who maintains silence on the exact nature of the joy discovered by Lancelot and Guinevere in ''[[Le Chevalier de la Charrette]]'' (4676-4684).&lt;ref&gt;Rossi and Straub 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lai (poetic form)|Lai]]s'' and fabliaux have much in common; an example of a poem straddling the fence between the two genres is ''[[Lecheor]]''.

Fabliaux derive a lot of their force from puns and other verbal figures; indeed, "fabliaux . . . are obsessed with wordplay." Especially important are [[paranomasia]] and [[catachresis]], tropes which disrupt ordinary signification and displace ordinary meanings&lt;ref&gt;Root 19.&lt;/ref&gt;—by similarity of sound, for instance, one can have both "con" and "conte" ("cunt" and "tale") in the same word, a common pun in fabliaux.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The standard form of the fabliau is that of [[Medieval French literature]] in general, the [[octosyllable]] [[rhyme]]d [[couplet]], the most common verse form used in verse [[chronicle]]s, [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] (the ''romans''), ''[[Lai (poetic form)|lai]]s'', and ''dits''. They are generally short, a few hundred lines; Douin de L'Avesne's ''Trubert'', at 2984 lines, is exceptionally long.

==Authors and tales==
Famous writers of fabliau include [[Jean Bodel]], Garin, [[Gautier le Leu]], [[Rutebeuf]], Enguerrant le Clerc d'Oisi and Douin de L'Avesne.

Some representative tales:

===Gombert et les deus clers===
A well-known storyline is found in "Gombert et les deus clers" ("Gombert and the two clerks"). Two traveling clerks (students) take up lodging with a ''villain'', and share the bedroom with Gombert, his beautiful wife, and their two children—one teenage girl, and one baby. One of the clerks climbs into bed with the teenage daughter and, promising her his ring, has his way with her; the other, while Gombert is "ala pissier" ("gone pissing," 85), moves the crib with the baby so that Gombert, on his return, lies down in the bed occupied by the clerks—one of whom is in bed with his daughter, while the other is now having sex with Gombert's wife, who thinks it's Gombert come to pleasure her. When the first clerk returns to his bed where he thinks his friend still is, he tells Gombert all about his adventure: "je vien de fotre / mes que ce fu la fille a l'oste" ("I've just been fucking, and if it wasn't the host's daughter," 152-53). Gombert attacks the first clerk, but ends up being beaten up by both.&lt;ref&gt;"Gombert et les deux clers," in Rossi and Straub 119-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale is found practically unchanged in [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Summary of Decameron tales#Sixth tale .28IX.2C 6.29|Decamerone]]'' and in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Reeve's Tale]]."

===L'enfant de neige===
In "L'enfant de neige" ("[[The Snow-child|The snow baby]]"), a [[black comedy]], a merchant returns home after an absence of two years to find his wife with a newborn son. She explains one snowy day she swallowed a snowflake while thinking about her husband which caused her to conceive. Pretending to believe the "miracle", they raise the boy until the age of 15 when the merchant takes him on a business trip to [[Genoa]]. There, he sells the boy into [[slavery]]. On his return, he explains to his wife that the sun burns bright and hot in [[Italy]]; since the boy was begotten by a snowflake, he melted in the heat.&lt;ref&gt;Balachov 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bérangier au lonc cul (Bérangier of the long arse)&lt;ref&gt;Simpson 52; Huot 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;===

====Summary====
[[De Bérangier au lonc cul]] is a medieval French fabliau. There are two versions of the fabliau: one by Guerin and one anonymous. In summary, the story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a "young peasant" and deems him a knight. The knight abandons the code of chivalry and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised armor, and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife's voice. He begs for "pity" and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of jousting her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse. Out of cowardice, the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female genitalia, he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, "I'm Bérangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted." The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met Bérangier and learned of her husband's cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife's wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.&lt;ref&gt;Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. 
Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender Morals in Bérangier====
The husband's initial antagonistic behavior cues the gender moral of the story: constantly demeaning a clever wife can be dangerous.&lt;ref name="Crocker, Holly 2006"&gt;Crocker, Holly. Comic Provocations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to find out her husband, the wife disguises herself as a knight who she calls “Bérangier au lonc cul” [Bérangier of the long ass]. She follows her husband into the forest, and, upon seeing his foolish actions, “the roles are reversed”.&lt;ref name="Eichmann, Raymond 1982"&gt;Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the woman previously had “[caught] the brunt of [her husband’s] bragging and insults,” seeing the “absolute farce” of his claims in the forest inspires her to become a “hard, driving force that will not only teach him a lesson but also will annihilate him in position as leader in the household”.&lt;ref name="Eichmann, Raymond 1982"/&gt; Upon the encounter with his wife, disguised as a valiant knight, the husband automatically reveals his cowardice and, out of terror, begs for mercy. His wife gives him an ultimatum: he can “jostez” [joust] and surely die or “vos me venroiz el cul baisier” [kiss her ass].&lt;ref name="Eichmann, Raymond 1982"/&gt; Without realizing the gravity of his decision, he yields the power in his marriage to his wife, reversing his position of power, when he refuses to fight the knight. In addition, he displays ignorance when he does not recognize her genitals; he merely thought the knight had “au lonc cul” [a long ass]. In an exploitation of his ignorant failure to recognize her female genitals,&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, Simon. Gender and Genre in Medieval French Literature. New York: Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the wife and the audience share pleasure in the fact she has duped her husband and the fact he will never know.&lt;ref name="Crocker, Holly 2006"/&gt; The story “draw[s] a conventional lesson about proper gender roles in marriage,” &lt;ref name="Crocker, Holly 2006"/&gt; which suggests the demeaning of a wife by a husband is not “proper.” Thus, the reversal of the gender roles in this story creates the moral.

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10337">The '''first interracial kiss on television''' is a much debated topic concerning who the first two persons of different races to kiss on television were. For a time, it was understood to have occurred during an episode of the British [[soap opera]] ''[[Emergency&amp;nbsp;– Ward 10]]'' in 1964. However, in November 2015, a Granada ''Play of the Week'', ''[[You in Your Small Corner]]'', was uncovered which was broadcast in June 1962; that quickly led to the rediscovery of another play featuring the same young Jamaican actor, ''[[Hot Summer Night (play)|Hot Summer Night]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Bidnall ''The West Indian Generation: Remaking British Culture in London, 1945-1965'' "The first on-stage interracial kiss came in 1958 with the performance of Ted Willis's ''Hot Summer Night'', and one year later that same kiss came to the small screen with the play's adaptation for ITV's ''Armchair Theatre''."&lt;/ref&gt; televised in Britain on 1 February 1959. The first interracial kiss on U.S. television was broadcast in a 1960 episode of ''Adventures in Paradise'', "Makaha Surfing", also known as "The Big Surf", between star Gardner McKay and Filipina Pilar Seurat. Competing claims have also been made in favour of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.

[[File:FIKOTYOUSMALLCORNER.png|thumb|right|''You in Your Small Corner'', live broadcast on British television from 1962.]]
In June 1962, a live performance of the play ''[[You in Your Small Corner]]'' by [[Barry Reckord]] was broadcast on British television as part of the series Granada ''Play of the Week''. The central theme of the play is a relationship between a young black intellectual and a white working class girl. During the play, a kiss takes place between actors [[Lloyd Reckord]] and [[Elizabeth MacLennan]], and what has been described as an "explicit post-coital scene".&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/20/tv-archive-discovers-couple-who-beat-kirk-and-uhara-to-first-interracial-kiss|title=TV archive discovers couple who beat Kirk and Uhura to first interracial kiss|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''You In Your Small Corner'' was rediscovered during preparations for a November 2015 [[British Film Institute]] panel discussion on "Race and Romance on TV" and was used in publicity for the event. As a result, panel moderator [[Samira Ahmed]] was able, on the night, to announce the rediscovery of an even earlier TV kiss by Lloyd Reckord, with [[Andrée Melly]], in the ITV [[Armchair Theatre]] adaptation of [[Ted Willis]]'s play ''[[Hot Summer Night (play)|Hot Summer Night]]'', broadcast on 1 February 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=@DescantDeb

====''Emergency Ward 10''====
[[File:Firstkissontv.jpg|thumb|left|One of the first interracial kisses on television occurred in an episode of British soap opera ''[[Emergency Ward 10]]'', which was broadcast in July 1964.]]

One of the earliest interracial kisses on television occurred in a July 1964 episode of British [[soap opera]] ''[[Emergency Ward 10]]'', during which characters Louise Mahler (portrayed by [[Joan Hooley]]) and Giles Farmer (portrayed by John White) kissed.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waltres|first1=Guy|title=How much do you really know about Star Trek?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-trek/11441768/How-much-do-you-really-know-about-Star-Trek.html|accessdate=29 July 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Citron|first1=Lana|title=A Compendium of Kisses: Facts, Quotes and Curiosities|date=2011|publisher=Harlequin|isbn=037389242X|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which Mahler and Farmer kissed was originally scripted to occur in Mahler's bedroom, but was rewritten so as to occur outdoors, due to concerns it would otherwise be too risqué (the earlier Lloyd Reckord plays had both been shown well after the 9pm adult-content [[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]]). According to an issue of the ''[[Daily Express]]'' published after the episode aired, "not a viewer rang-up to complain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourne|first1=Steven|title=Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television|date=2005|publisher=Bloomsbury|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview, conducted prior to the discovery of the ''You in Your Small Corner'' footage, Hooley noted that the historic importance of what had been known as the "first interracial kiss on television" had been inflated in popular memory:

===US television===

====''I Love Lucy''====
The 1950s American television programme ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' broadcast multiple instances of real-life husband and wife [[Desi Arnaz]], a [[Hispanic]] male, and [[Lucille Ball]], a woman of North European ancestry, kissing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowling|first1=Tim|title=Prepare to beam up|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/23/star-trek-film-television|accessdate=30 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Arnaz and Ball being frequently described as an "interracial couple", "Hispanic" is generally understood to be a catchall indicating persons of a [[Hispanic America|Latin American]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], or [[Filipino people|Filipino]] cultural background, as opposed to a race. Arnaz was usually considered to be a white male of [[Cubans|Cuban]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaramillo|first1=Juliana|title=Paula Deen’s Racist Brownface Stunt Isn't Even Accurate|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/07/07/paula_deen_s_racist_brownface_stunt_isn_t_even_accurate.html|accessdate=30 July 2015|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim is disputed by some who contend that in the scene in question, full lip contact between [[William Shatner]] and [[Nichelle Nichols]] did not occur, as the actors turned their heads away from the camera at the last moment to present the illusion of a kiss, meaning that this scene was not a true kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strikwerda|first1=Robert|title=Rethinking Masculinity: Philosophical Explorations in Light of Feminism|date=1996|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0847682560|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter point has been disputed, with Shatner claiming that he and Nichols' lips never fully touched and Nichols asserting that the kiss was real.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichelle Nichols, Beyond Uhura: Star Trek and Other Memories'', G.P.

It is often ignored that "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]", which originally aired on October 6, 1967, featured a scripted interracial kiss between [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] actress [[BarBara Luna|Barbara Luna]] and the aforementioned William Shatner a year prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|quote=YouTube|title=Star Trek Interracial Kiss&amp;nbsp;– Barbara Luna and William Shatner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grimlock''' is the name of several fictional robot characters in the [[Transformers]] robot franchise. He is usually portrayed as the immensely strong, power-mongering leader of the [[Dinobot]]s, a small subfaction of Autobots that transform into dinosaurs. In 2007, ''[[USA Today]]'' polled people as to which Transformer they want to appear in the [[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|second installment]] in the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]; Grimlock came in tied for second with [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]].

'''Grimlock''' is the leader of the [[Dinobot]]s, as well as the most fearsome and powerful member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimlock can be cold, merciless and contemptuous of those he considers beneath him, such as human beings, and at times, even Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]] himself, who Grimlock would gladly supplant as Autobot leader if he were able to, giving him a [[superiority complex]] as indicated by his Generation 1 tech specs. Nevertheless, he is a valiant warrior whose actions command respect from all who are witness to them, both friend and foe. One of his most distinguishing features is his famous speech impediment, which leads him to shorten sentences and refer to himself constantly as "Me Grimlock", never "I" (e.g. 
"Me Grimlock no bozo! Me KING!") - the reason for this varies from depiction to depiction, with some making it the result of true mental limitations, and others vocal processor damage or a ruse Grimlock perpetrates to allow others to think of him as less intelligent than he actually is. However he is still an Autobot and is willing to protect the Earth as much as the Autobots, and does also show a begrudging respect for Optimus Prime, however he was more accepting for [[Rodimus]] as leader when he became a Prime.

Grimlock is among the strongest of the Transformers, possibly an equal to, or even superior to Optimus Prime and [[Megatron]] in certain continuities (he was shown to be stronger than Megatron in the G1 cartoon, but in the Marvel comics, Megatron was able to defeat Grimlock and the rest of the Dinobots in their initial encounter). In ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' mode, his powerful jaws can snap virtually anything that comes between them - from steel cables to a Decepticon limb. He also can breathe fire and shoot an energy ray from his mouth. In robot mode, Grimlock wields an energon sword, whose blade is sheathed in crackling energon and can slice a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} concrete wall in one slash. He also uses a double-barreled, self-propelled rocket launcher. He is almost invulnerable in his Tyrannosaurus Rex mode as shown with his battle with Megatron due to Megatron's primary weapon, his arm-mounted fusion cannon having little or no effect on Grimlock. Grimlock is the only Dinobot whose name doesn't begin with an S.

===Reception===
Grimlock was one of the favorite Autobots of IGN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/10/transformers-our-favorite-autobots?page=3 | title=Transformers: Our Favorite Autobots | last=Pirrello | first=Phil | last2=Schedeen | first2=Jesse | publisher=ign.com | date=June 10, 2009 | accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimlock was voted the 6th top Transformer who was considered to be "badass" in the comics by Topless Robot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/04/10_transformers_that_were_only_badass_in_the_comic.php 10 Transformers That Were Only Badass in the Comics By Rob Bricken, Apr. 14 2009 By Kevin J. Guhl]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to X-Entertainment Grimlock was the 2nd top Transformers figure of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/messages/364.html |title=X-E - The Top 8 Transformers Figures Of All Time! |publisher=X-entertainment.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animated series===
====The Transformers====
The original character profiles (and the tech specs derived from them) written by [[Bob Budiansky]] and Dan Bobro indicate that Grimlock and the Dinobots were intended to come from [[Cybertron]] to Earth like the vast majority of other Transformers. However, the cartoon would diverge wildly from this when it introduced the reptilian robots. Grimlock is voiced by [[Gregg Berger]].

The discovery of fossilized dinosaur bones in a cavern in their volcano base set the Earthbound Autobots on the track to creating the Dinobots. Intrigued by the creatures, and with additional knowledge supplied by [[Spike Witwicky]], [[Wheeljack]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] created three "Dinobots" – Grimlock, [[Slag (Transformer)|Slag]] and [[Sludge (Transformer)|Sludge]]. It has not been explained why he or the other Dinobots were able to be fitted with personalities which can only be found on [[Cybertron]] from [[Vector Sigma]]. Their brains are simple, yet still it is the personalities that make them sentient. It is evident that addition of personalities or "sparks" and its origin was after the fact, and was hoped that this inconsistency would be overlooked.

Their design specs proved to be too accurate to the creatures they were modeled on, as their primitive brains went out of control, and Grimlock almost destroyed [[Teletraan I]], before the trio was stopped. Optimus Prime deemed them too dangerous to use again, and had them sealed back up in the cavern, but when the majority of the Autobot force was captured by the Decepticons, Wheeljack freed them to go to their rescue. Equipped with new devices that enhanced their brainpower to functional, yet still impaired, levels (resulting in slow thought processes and simple, clipped speech), the three Dinobots successfully rescued their Autobot comrades, and Optimus Prime admitted his error.

In his private thoughts, however, Grimlock considered Optimus Prime too weak to lead, seeking the position for himself. When [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] read his mind and learned of this animosity, Megatron was able to trick Grimlock and the Dinobots into switching sides, attacking and capturing Optimus Prime. To stop the turncoat Dinobots, two new ones were created: [[Snarl (Transformer)|Snarl]] and [[Swoop (Transformer)|Swoop]]. Ultimately, it was when Optimus Prime threw himself into harm's way to save Grimlock from an explosion that he accepted his mistake and rejoined the Autobots. In a rare display of modesty and humility, Grimlock emotionally apologized to Prime, admitted his jealousy of the leader, and accepted fault for the battle. The two subsequently patched up their differences.

Although content for the moment to remain a soldier, rather than a leader, Grimlock still had trouble accepting orders, only agreeing to help stem the tide of natural disasters ravaging Earth due to Cybertron being pulled into its orbit when he realized he would die if he did not. Grimlock and the Dinobots were semi-regularly called into action when the Autobots were faced with challenges that required extra strength, such as the Sub-Atlantican invasion of [[Washington, D.C.]], or the Decepticons' control of the TORQ III supercomputer; with every piece of help he and his troops gave, Grimlock was never slow to add a scathing remark about the inabilities of the Autobots. That said, he was not unwilling to admit the failings of his own troops, either, and willingly took them to the time-displaced "Dinobot Island", where they trained in the wilderness and helped stop a Decepticon raid on the prehistoric paradise.

The final straw for Grimlock came when he and the Dinobots were injured in a Decepticon trap at an airfield. Enraged, Grimlock refused to take orders from Optimus Prime anymore, and he and the other Dinobots left. When the Autobots began to suffer from Cybertonium deficiency, Spike Witwicky and his girlfriend Carly attempted to persuade the Dinobots - who continued to function perfectly, as they had been built on Earth without Cybertonium - to steal some of the mineral from a Decepticon shipment coming in from Cybertron. Grimlock instead opted to lead the Dinobots to Cybertron itself, where they (except Swoop) were captured by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] and put to work in the Cybertonium mines, until Swoop, Spike and Carly rescued them. Brought back to Earth, the Dinobots agreed to follow Prime's order again - until such time as Grimlock did not feel like it.

By the Earth year 2005, it seemed apparent that Grimlock had undergone some degree of a personality change, becoming more childish and petulant, rather than brutish and stubborn. He and the Dinobots accompanied Optimus Prime on the latter's rescue mission to [[Autobot City]], and fought [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]]. Subsequently, the Dinobots joined [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] and his companions in traveling back to Cybertron to face the evil [[Unicron]]. Also of note, it seemed that, along with the other Dinobots, Grimlock remained in his dinosaur mode almost exclusively, rarely changing back to his robot form. Throughout 2006, he regularly participated in missions with his fellow Autobots rather than the other Dinobots, battling on the planets of [[Chaar]], Goo, Dredd and Eurythma.

In episode #78, "Madman's Paradise", Spike and Carly hosted a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel got bored and wandered off. Grimlock followed him, and they fell into a lost chamber where [[Quintessons]] banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and were tricked into fighting on the [[Red Wizard (Transformers)|Red Wizard]]'s side, only to find out that he was the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the [[Golden One]]. [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]], [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]], [[Rewind (Transformers)|Rewind]], [[Ramhorn]], and [[Steeljaw]] followed, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of [[Perceptor]], the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron.

Grimlock helped to sniff out the "dinosaur transform static" that implicated [[Trypticon]] in the theft of world monuments. Later in the year, when [[Galvatron]], the new Decepticon leader, had Cybertron infused with function-inverting anti-electrons, a dose of the particles gave Grimlock super-intelligence. For the first time Grimlock identified himself as "I, Grimlock". During a mission to [[Unicron]]'s disembodied head, where the Autobots were outmatched by the new Decepticon [[Terrorcon]]s, Grimlock used components of Unicron's head to construct the [[Technobots]] to battle them. Combined as [[Computron (Transformers)|Computron]], the Technobots felt they could not match the Terrorcons, until Grimlock transferred his super-intelligence into Computron, reverting to his old self and allowing the Autobots to claim victory.

Grimlock's greatest victory came when he and a large number of other Transformers with primitive animal-themed transformations were summoned to a world at the centre of the galaxy by the ex-assistant of the ancient genius, [[Primacron]], creator of Unicron. The assistant had assembled these "Primitive" Transformers in the hope that their simple instincts could defeat Primacron's newest creation, [[Tornedron]], but one by one they fell to him, with Grimlock apparently crushed under [[Trypticon]]. Grimlock survived, however, and followed Tornedron back to Primacron's lab. When Tornedron turned on his master, like his predecessor, Primacron's complicated plans and equations could not find a way to stop him; Grimlock, on the other hand, randomly flicked a switch which reversed Tornedron's energy polarity, undoing the damage the now dissipating Tornedron had done. Grimlock decimated Primacron's lab while dancing around over his successful saving of the universe, dubbing it the smartest thing he'd ever done.

In a comic story found in the ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|Transformers]]'' DVD boxset for season 2, a special comic was donated by ''[[Darren Jamieson]]'' and ''[[Dylan Gibson]]'' that explored what happened when the Dinobots combined. Unleashed as a last-ditch effort by Grimlock to stop an Autobot massacre, "The Beast" was a huge mindless combiner that destroyed warriors on both sides.

In the year 2011, the Decepticons invaded Cybertron in full force. Grimlock was deployed by [[Wreck-Gar]] to fend off the invaders. He was seen fighting alongside his fellow Dinobots as well as the [[Throttlebots]] against the invading Decepticons, however, they didn't fare too well against the Decepticon [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]]s, as they are all quickly put to sleep by [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]]'s hypnosis attack. In the second episode, Grimlock was again in action, trying to protect Vector Sigma along with two fellow [[Dinobot]]s and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]].

After the animated series ended in the US Grimlock appeared in animated form one last time in the commercial for the Classic Pretenders.

Grimlock was featured in the 1993 ''Transformers: Generation 2'' coloring book "[[Decepticon Madness]]" by [[Bud Simpson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Bud|isbn=1-56144-346-8|title=Decepticon Madness|publisher=[[Modern Publishing]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
====3H Enterprises====
Although no Grimlock toy was made in the Transformers: Universe toy line, both Grimlock and his [[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]] counterpart appeared in the storyline.

The Autobots returning to Cybertron along with [[Blackarachnia]] and [[Silverbolt]] were then abducted via teleportation beams and taken to Unicron. [[Tap-Out (Transformers)|Tap-Out]], [[Transformers: Armada]] [[Megatron]], [[Brawn (Transformers)|Brawn]], War Within Grimlock and [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]] were also abducted from various timelines (Transformers: Universe #1).

''War Within'' Grimlock, ''Armada'' Megatron and ''Universe'' [[Optimus Primal]] are each transported to the Unicron world, where they eventually team up and fight [[Striker (Transformers)|Striker]] and [[Reptilion]]. Note, there is a small continuity error in that this story ends with Grimlock, Megatron and Primal standing over Reptilion, but issue #2 of the comic starts with them standing over Striker (2003 Botcon Voice Actor Play).

After the events of the Botcon 2003 voice actor play, Optimus Primal is able to use his spark telepathy to free Striker from Unicron's influence. Optimus Primal, Megatron and Grimlock help break free the slaves from various timelines which are held there and gets them to Cybertron (Transformers: Universe #2).

====Condor Verlag====
In a story called "By their Blasters you shall know them ...!" from ''[[Transformers Comic-Magazin]]'' issue #12 by German comic publisher [[Condor Verlag]] [[Optimus Prime]] instructs [[Backstreet (Transformers)|Backstreet]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and [[Ruckus (Transformers)|Ruckus]] on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Grimlock is one of those he displays to the Autobots. He is identified as a Decepticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Robert Mann| penciller = | inker =| story =By their Blasters you shall know them ...! | title =Transformers Comic-Magazin | volume = 1| issue = 12| date =December 1990 | publisher = [[Condor Verlag]]| location =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Devil's Due Publishing====
Grimlock also appeared in several of the G.I. Joe vs the Transformers series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]]. In 2004 Grimlock was among the Autobots under the leadership Optimus Prime who attempted to take back the planet Cybertron from the Decepticon tyrant [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. After an accident with the teleportational systems of the supercomputer [[Teletran-3]], Grimlock found himself sent back in time and on the planet Earth. He was reformatted in the form of an Earth dinosaur with several other Autobots. A group of humans were able to bring the new Dinobots back to Cybertron and they helped overcome Shockwave.

Grimlock returned in the third series as a main character. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. When Cobra attacked the base, the Autobots helped repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. This was simply a distraction, however, to allow [[Cobra Commander]] access to the real prize - [[Serpentor|Serpent O.R.]], a [[technorganic]] android created from the DNA of many great warleaders and parts from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]. Predictably the Megatron aspects took control and Serpent O.R. escaped, taking over the G.I. Joe battlesuits and forcing Grimlock and the other Autobots to battle them while he made his escape. The Autobots and Joes pursued him to Cybertron, where they were captured by Serpentor, the [[Predacon]]s, the [[Seacons]] and the [[Stunticon]]s. While Serpentor captured Optimus Prime, Snake-Eyes led a jailbreak, with Grimlock flattening Rampage in the process. He would then form part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe strike force to rescue Optimus Prime, at one point ripping a Decepticon prisoner's arm off to gain Prime's location. At the end, after Serpentor's defeat and Prime's rescue, Grimlock admitted he was wrong about the Joes, and that they were great heroes, warriors and friends.

There is a notable disparity in Grimlock's speech patterns between the second and third series. In the second series he is seen to speak normally, referring to himself as "I". However, in the third series he speaks in his more normal "Me Grimlock" speech.

====Dreamwave Productions====
The 21st century re-imagining of the original universe by [[Dreamwave Productions]] depicted Grimlock in a manner similar to his depiction in Marvel Comics - a powerful, cunning warrior who values strength of body and character. Through ''[[Transformers: The War Within]]'', the company shaped a background on Cybertron for Grimlock which showed that he had participated in the planet's underground gladiatorial game in order to unleash the rage and anger he had always overflowed with. When Megatron began using the games to identify suitable soldiers for his burgeoning Decepticon army, Grimlock was recruited by him and initially fought on his side, befriending Starscream and perhaps the scientist, [[Jetfire]], before defecting to the Autobots - not out of any particular fondness for them and their ideals, but rather out of sheer hatred of Megatron and his ideals. He still bears a particularly fierce grudge against Jetfire over an unspecified incident with a cerebro-shell.

During the time Autobot leader [[Sentinel Prime]] was killed, Grimlock was an established, respected member of the Autobots (perhaps most remembered for his quote "''Me Grimlock, badass!!!''"). Grimlock questioned the new leadership of Optimus Prime, including Prime's first major decision to evacuate Cybertron over defending it. Witnessing and aiding him in battle with Megatron deep beneath Cybertron, however, Grimlock came to respect Prime as time passed. When Prime and Megatron disappeared in an early test of the experimental spacebridge transport system, disarray struck the Autobot and Decepticon ranks and they splintered off into numerous smaller factions - Grimlock founded the [[Lightning Strike Coalition]] to fight the battles he considered the most important.

As the "Dark Ages" came to an end, [[Ultra Magnus]] reunified the various Autobot factions, with Grimlock becoming something of his right-hand man. Starscream's [[Predacons|Predacon]] faction attacked an attempted peace treaty between the Autobots, the Decepticons and [[Ratbat]]'s [[Ultracons]]. As Grimlock leapt to Ultra Magnus's defence, he apparently perished - naturally, we know he later returned to life, but unfortunately, due to Dreamwave's closure, this story was never resolved, and Grimlock's restoration to life was left unexplained.

What is known of the remainder of his time on Cybertron, however, is that he, Slag, Sludge, Snarl, and Swoop formed a team known as the "[[Dinobot|Dynobots]]" (they are referred to as such in the first issue of "The Age of Wrath"). The Dynobots remained on Cybertron when [[Optimus Prime]] left on [[Ark (Transformers)|The Ark]], pursued by Megatron. When Optimus Prime and [[Megatron]]'s troops vanished four million years ago, they pursued the Decepticons known as the [[Insecticons]], who had set off in search of the missing leaders. The two teams battled on prehistoric Earth, and the battle ended with both sides trapped in stasis. The eventual awakening of Prime and Megatron's forces in 1984 was followed by the Autobots' discovery and reactivation of the Dynobots, now rechristened the "Dinobots" for their new dinosaur alternate modes.

When the Transformers were all believed destroyed in the explosion of the ship that was taking them back to [[Cybertron]], several of them, including Grimlock, were recovered by a rogue military faction and reprogrammed so that they could be operating as killing machines. [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], Grimlock, [[Laserbeak]], [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] and [[Starscream]] were forced to attack the Smitco oil refinery in the Arctic to display their power for sale to the highest bidder (Transformer: Generation One #2).

When Megatron liberated himself and several others from this control, Grimlock, tired of risking his life for the humans, joined him, ripping off his insignia and joining in the Decepticon attack on [[San Francisco]], during which he was dispatched from behind by [[Trailbreaker]]. Left behind by the fleeing Decepticons, he subsequently located and liberated the other Dinobots, and headed for Cybertron. In the four-million-year interim, the planet had been unified by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] for his own sinister ends, but once there, Grimlock led an assault on Iacon, providing enough chaos and unrest for Optimus Prime's Autobot underground to overthrow Shockwave's rule of Cybertron. Grimlock successfully hauled Optimus Prime and [[Ultra Magnus]] to safety when Shockwave's citadel exploded.

Grimlock's Pretender form is given an entry in the seventh issue of the More Than Meets the Eyes profile series, indictaing there may have been plans to make him a Pretender at some point in the Dreamwave universe.

Dreamwave's closure meant that they would tell no further stories of their Grimlock, although his "War Within"-era design did appear in the ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' comic book exclusive to [[BotCon]].

Grimlock also appeared in the Dreamwave ''Transformers/G.I. Joe'' comic. Although not one of the Dinobots in this continuity, transforming into a Sherman Tank, this Grimlock shared the rebellious attitude and speech mannerisms of other incarnations of the G1 character, although he had a softer attitude towards humans. Reactivated by G.I. Joe to fight the Decepticons and [[Cobra Command|Cobra]], Grimlock battled Cobra forces and [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]] alongside [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], although the Decepticon's piledriver arms nearly defeated them, with Grimlock telling Roadblock to leave him, until [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett]] intervened. When [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] opened the Matrix on Prime's command, Grimlock was presumably deactivated.

====Fun Publications====
=====Classicverse=====
Based on the ''Transformers Classic'' toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and ''Generation 2'' comics).

When Bludgeon and his Decepticons were banished after the battle of Klo Grimlock refitted his Decepticon battleship, the Graviton, with weapons and recruited his several Dinobots and Autobots to hunt them down. The crew included [[Ultra Magnus]], Springer, Huffer, Elita One, Snarl, Terranotron and the Mini-Cons Swoop and Strongarm. After getting word from Optimus Prime that Megatron was alive on Earth Grimlock left Ultra Magnus in charge of the Graviton and took a shuttle to Earth.

In the story ''Crossing Over'' by Fun Publications Grimlock was among Autobot troops of Optimus Prime who responded to the sighting of Megatron and arrived in time to save the dimensional traveling Autobot Skyfall from Megatron's wraith.

In ''Games of Deception'' the Graviton follows Bludgeon's agent [[Bug Bite (Transformers)|Bugbite]] and several Decepticons to Earth where the Autobots join up with Grimlock. After a brief encounter with the Decepticons the Graviton leaves with Grimlock joining them.

Classic Grimlock's biography was featured in issue #13 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine.

Grimlock appears in "Beast Wars Shattered Glass Chapter One: Shattered Time" by [[Fun Publications]]. In this story Ultra Magnus and the Autobots aboard the ''Graviton'' battle Megatron and the Decepticons aboard the ''Talon''. Both ships are pulled through a vortex into the past of ''Shattered Glass'' Earth. Crashing they discover that dangerous energon readings outside the ship will place them in stasis lock. The Autobots devise organic alternate modes to protect them from the energon. The Decepticons create energon-absorbing armor for protection. Grimlock takes on the alternate form of a white velociraptor (his ''Beast Wars'' toy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Thomas Deer|date=February/March 2013 |editor=Pete Sinclair |inker= Matt Frank |issue=49 | letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Matt Frank |publisher=Fun Publications |story=Beast Wars Shattered Glass Chapter One: Shattered Time|title=The Transformers Collectors Club| volume=1 |writer=Benson Yee, Pete Sinclair &amp; Matt Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; This team of animal-based Autobots eventually renamed themselves "Maximals" after encountering a member of that faction from an alternate universe.

Grimlock and his fellow Maximals eventually joined forces with the heroic Decepticons-as opposed to their Megatron's renamed Predacons-under Galvatron. This would lead to Grimlock joining Galvatron in coming to the aid of Decepticon City on Earth when it was attacked by the Autobots in an effort to break the Decepticon war effort once and for all. Grimlock would be sent in to attack [[Superion]], only to be overpowered after letting his guard down due to the humor-in his eyes, at least-of a Combiner made up of [[Micromasters]]. Fortunately, the Micromaster Predacons came to his aid and thwarted Superion's assault.

=====Beast Wars: Uprising=====
Grimlock was also featured in the ''Beast Wars: Uprising'' storyline as a member of the Maximal-Predacon resistance movement instigated by [[Lio Convoy]]. Having transplanted his Spark into a Maximal protoform to avoid the immobility common among his fellow Autobot and Decepticon "Builders," Grimlock launches a violent campaign seeking to topple the old regime and bring Cybertron under resistance rule. However, his extreme agenda eventually leads him to steal the G-Virus, a contagion born from the essence of the fallen Galvatron with the ability to remake any Cybertronian in his image. Grimlock soon leads his team to a gladitorial event, intent on unleashing the virus on the spectators, only to have the now Micromaster [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] interfere. One of Grimlock's own subordinates then destroys most of the virus, unaware that a Cybertronian has already been affected and been turned into a new Galvatron.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.transformersclub.com/prose/Beast-Wars-Uprising-Micro-Aggressions-V1.01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====IDW Publishing====
In a flashback in ''Maximum Dinobots'' #1 Grimlock lead the Dinobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron.

In the [[The Transformers: Spotlight|Transformers Spotlight]] issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the 'Dinobots' (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially pays homage to their Marvel G1 origin. Seeking payback for a humiliating defeat by Shockwave, Grimlock pursued him to prehistoric Earth (which Shockwave was seeding with Energon). In order to protect themselves against Energon surges, the Dinobots required alternate modes covered by a layer of synthetic flesh. Refusing to pick dying and thus weak Ice Age mammals for an alternate form, Grimlock chose to utilise more ferocious dinosaruian beast modes which were much more impressive. The Dinobots got the initial jump on Shockwave, as their attack was too illogical for him to understand, but he quickly recovered and dispatched the entire team, destroying their synthetic skins and sending them into stasis lock. Grimlock got the final laugh, as the Dinobot ship fired a pre-programmed blast into the surrounding volcanoes to unleash a flow of lava that engulfs all six Transformers until they were uncovered by human paleontologists in 2006.

Following this, Skywatch, a government agency who knew about Transformers, took over the site. Later, following escalating Transformer activity on Earth (as seen in ''[[The Transformers: Devastation]]''), and losing control of their other captive Transformers [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] and [[Laserbeak]], Skywatch reactivated Grimlock as a response. The reawakening was sabotaged by the Machination, and Grimlock escaped. He met [[Scorponok]], who proposed an alliance as they were both now fugitives. Grimlock refused, but lost the subsequent battle, teleporting himself to the Dinobot ship. Vowing to bring down Scorponok, he was unaware the Machination were manipulating Skywatch into reactivating the other Dinobots, with the aim of having them dispose of Grimlock (''[[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight Grimlock]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transformers Spotlight: Grimlock Review |publisher=IGN |date= |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/869/869085p1.html |accessdate=2010-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227042515/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/869/869085p1.html |archivedate=2012-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their acquisition of the Transformers licence in 2005 [[IDW Publishing]] released a comic book series which takes place during the ''Beast Wars'' animated series, but features the toys and characters who did not appear in the show itself. The ''Beast Wars'' incarnation of Grimlock appeared, as a gigantic white ''Velociraptor''-type dinosaur, and it was revealed that Grimlock was among those in protoform stasis on the Axalon, and like the others was launched into space in the series pilot. He fought against Predacon leader [[Magmatron]] in a one-on-one battle but lost the upper hand when Magmatron split into three separate beast forms, which attacked him simultaneously; in the long run however, he provided the necessary distraction for the Maximals to steal Magmatron's Chronal Phase armband, leading to his ultimate defeat. Grimlock has since joined [[Razorbeast]]'s Maximal team. After the defeat of Magmatron's Predacons the united group of Maximals awaited rescue from [[Cybertron]].

He appears among the Maximals on the cover of the first issue of the sequel story ''Beast Wars: The Ascending''. In the beginning of ''Beast Wars The Ascending'' Razorbeast speaks to Prowl and Wolfang about how he feels there is no rescue mission coming for them from Cybertron as Grimlock hunts in the nearby woods. In ''Beast Wars: The Ascending'' #4 Grimlock was among the Maximals and Predacons returned to Cybertron to battle [[Shokaract]].

Grimlock had a biography printed in the ''Beast Wars Sourcebook'' by [[IDW Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/comics/news/article_1343405.php/Creators_of_Transformers_Beast_Wars_The_Gathering_are_back Creators of Transformers: Beast Wars: The Gathering are back] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232701/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/comics/news/article_1343405.php/Creators_of_Transformers_Beast_Wars_The_Gathering_are_back |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dawn of the Predacus=====
Grimlock also features briefly in the comic story "Dawn of the Predacus" in which his exposure to transmatter turns him into a protoform, heralding his eventual role in ''Beast Wars'' fiction. As he is placed in a stasis pod he is looked upon by Predacon-and future Maximal-Dinobot, possibly indicating where the warrior took his future name.

====Manga====
In the Japanese manga "Big War" #2, the Autobots [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]], Grimlock, [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]] and [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]], along with their human allies [[Spike Witwicky]] and [[Daniel Witwicky]] send [[Computron (Transformers)|Computron]] into battle against [[Galvatron]]'s new warrior combiner [[Abominus]]. The Terrorcons spit "corrosive control liquid" against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with "defense spray". Defeated, Galvatron retreats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tfarchive.com/comics/japanese/trans182.php |title=Transformers comics, cartoons, toys and everything else! |publisher=TFArchive |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marvel Comics====
Since [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Transformers'' series were primarily written by Bob Budiansky in its early years, the writer was able to present his origin for the Dinobots as he had originally conceived it. Hence, when [[The Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]] crashed on Earth four million years ago, it was followed down to the planet by the Decepticon [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], who touched down in the prehistoric region of [[Antarctica]] known as the [[Savage Land]]. The Ark's computer detected his presence on the planet, and its scans of the Savage Land led it to believe that dinosaurs were the dominant life form. Thus, it reconstructed Grimlock and his troops into dinosaur forms, in order to battle Shockwave. Unfortunately, he slyly outmaneuvered them and managed to pick them off at a distance with his superior firepower; knocking them into a tar pit one by one. With their final strike the battle ended in a stalemate as the Dinobots made him fall in the pit along with them, buried under a rock slide for several million years.

In 1984, when Shockwave was accidentally reactivated by an Autobot probe and took command of the Decepticons from Megatron, Autobot medic Ratchet entered into an uneasy alliance with the deposed Decepticon leader, agreeing to recover the Dinobots so that they might defeat Shockwave again. [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] pulled a double-cross, however, and had the Dinobots attack Megatron instead, resulting in a battle that ended with Megatron's disappearance.

Grimlock steadily grew more and more displeased with Optimus Prime's leadership, and eventually broke his Dinobots away from the main Autobot faction. After a prolonged period living in self-imposed exile, the news of Optimus Prime's death brought Grimlock back to the Autobots. After proving his worth by defeating the Decepticon [[Trypticon]], Grimlock was elected leader of the Autobots.

It soon proved that people with power, especially a lot of power, are more likely to be corrupt. Grimlock became a tyrannical ruler who led the Autobots with an iron fist. His policy towards Earth and its inhabitants were vastly different from Optimus Prime's – instead of viewing them as objects of protection, Grimlock expressed a disdain for humanity, viewing them as an inferior species unworthy of their protection. Under Grimlock's leadership, the Ark was repaired and made space-worthy again.

In issue #32, titled "Used Autobots", Wheeljack completed work on his Geothermal Generator, which used the heat from the volcano the Ark had crashed in to generate energon cubes. Although Wheeljack thought this would impress Grimlock by reducing their dependence on human help, Grimlock seemed to think the Autobots should just take what they need from the humans.

[[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Goldbug]] could not endure Grimlock's leadership any more, and set out on their own, only to have Grimlock mark them as traitors. Blaster was hunted down by the [[Protectobots]] and later the Dinobots themselves, and placed under imprisonment and torture.

When the Autobot [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] and [[Targetmaster]]s arrived from [[Nebulos]], Grimlock refused to recognize the authority of Fortress Maximus and failed to establish an allegiance with his group. This proved to be the last straw for the Autobots under Grimlock's command, who collectively conspired to overthrow him, arranging for Blaster to challenge Grimlock for leadership. During their battle on the moon, the Decepticons took advantage of this weakness in the Autobot ranks and interrupted the duel with an all-out assault. With all Autobots now under attack from their mortal enemies, Grimlock and Blaster put their differences aside and fought alongside each other against the Decepticon horde. Subsequently, Fortress Maximus orchestrated the recreation of Optimus Prime as a [[Powermaster]], and Grimlock stepped down as leader.

Grimlock and the Dinobots were destroyed during the battle against [[Starscream]] while the villain was super-powered by the Underbase.

Grimlock was seen among the Autobots being repaired on the Ark when Optimus Prime sent Landmine and Cloudburst on their mission to obtain computer chips to repair fellow Autobots in issue #52, "Guess Who The Mechannibals Are Having For Dinner?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=54 |title=The Transformers #52: "Guess Who The Mecannibals Are Having For Dinner?" |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimlock's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, "Back from the Dead".

After a short time, Grimlock (along with [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and Bumblebee) was rebuilt by Ratchet as a [[Pretenders (Transformers)|Pretender]]. Ratchet shortly after was lost in a transport incident while taking out [[Megatron]], and was thus unable to continue his work restoring other Autobots in stasis lock (Ratchet later returned, physically merged with Megatron). Grimlock swore to one day find a way to revive his Dinobots.

Under the leadership of Powermaster Optimus Prime, Grimlock proved to be a loyal and powerful Autobot, daring even to battle the Matrix-powered Decepticon Thunderwing during the Matrix Quest. However, he was still obsessed with quickly reviving the Dinobots, a goal which put him at odds with Optimus Prime, who advocated patience in the search for a way to rebuild the fallen Autobots. Grimlock finally lost patience, stole the bodies of the Dinobots and a shuttle from the Ark, and piloted it to the planet Hydrus Four, where scientists had developed a new fuel called [[Nucleon (Transformers)|nucleon]]. It was more powerful than energon and capable of bringing dead Transformers back to life, but it was unstable and could have unforeseen consequences. Grimlock was unwilling to subject his Dinobots to anything he would not go through himself, and thus decided to test the fuel on himself first. When no ill effects were apparent, he used it to revive the Dinobots, and brought enough back to revive the remaining fallen Autobots.

The Dinobots returned to Cybertron with the nucleon, and arrived in time for the battle with [[Unicron]]. Their arrival, and their reviving the fallen Autobots with Nucleon, was an important part of Transformer victory that day, but Optimus Prime once again lost his life, sacrificing himself to destroy Unicron, and once again naming Grimlock as his successor with his dying breath.

Before Grimlock could celebrate his new position, however, the Nucleon's effect on Transformers became apparent. Grimlock began to experience brief bursts of immobility, his joints locking, which reached a peak when he became completely paralyzed in Cybertron's wastelands while he and the Dinobots were under attack by monstrous creatures from beneath Cybertron's surface. Realizing that Grimlock had become trapped in a "[[chrysalis]]" stage, Prime's Powermaster partner, Hi-Q, tapped into and accelerated the process, completing Grimlock's evolution into a more powerful "Actionmaster" – but the enhanced power came with a price: Grimlock was now no longer able to transform into dinosaur mode.

At that point, Cybertron was believed to be dying as a result of the battle with Unicron, and the Autobots and Decepticons were co-operating to evacuate. However, the Decepticons had a hidden motive: to escape, and leave the Autobots marooned on the dying planet. Grimlock and the Dinobots were the only ones among the Autobots who saw through the Decepticons' false pretense of peaceful co-existence and suspected the plan of mass betrayal. When the Decepticons sabotaged the Autobots' ships and fled the planet, Grimlock saved the Autobots. He revealed that he had captured Decepticon ships after a strike against them before the voyage to Earth, and had hidden them away. Thanks to those ships, the Autobots were able to flee Cybertron and follow the Decepticons to the planet [[List of Transformers planets#Klo|Klo]] for a final showdown. Unfortunately Decepticon leader [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] had discovered the Autobot homing beacon and laid a trap for them. Grimlock's stubbornness meant the Autobots walked right into it, decimating them. Grimlock was one of the few survivors, and when Optimus Prime returned, recreated by the [[Last Autobot]], Grimlock participated in the rout of the Decepticons.

While the monthly ''Transformers'' comic was published in the [[United States]], its sister title in the [[United Kingdom]] reprinted its stories, and included many of its own original tales, interspliced with the running American narrative. The author of these stories, [[Simon Furman]], was particularly fond of Grimlock, often using him for his original stories, and even using the character for responses on the readers' letters page. Furman truly transformed Grimlock, from the brutish tyrant of the early American comics into a noble anti-hero.

Set in and around the U.S. stories, Grimlock and the Dinobots were the stars of several stories while self-exiled from the other Autobots, including ''In The National Interest'' where they tried to help expose the Robo-Master hoax. When leader of the Autobots, Grimlock was involved in assisting [[Action Force]] battle Megatron in London and attempted to kill the Predacon Divebomb in order to silence embarrassing facts about Swoop's past.

Towards the end of the series, the UK comics began a break-away storyline that branched off from the continuity of the American stories, beginning with Grimlock's decision to once again break his Dinobots away from the main Autobot force. Tired of Prime's pacifistic approach to protecting Earth, Grimlock was joined by several older Autobots like Prowl and Wheeljack, who had just recently been reactivated, and longed for the older, simpler days. Under Grimlock's command, they formed the Earthforce, a pro-active Autobot group based in [[Canada]] who regularly battled the two Decepticon forces under the commands of Megatron and Shockwave.

Issue #279 of the Marvel U.K. Transformers comic featured a story called "Divide and Conquer!" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream.

There was no specific ending for the Earthforce crew, but the issue of nucleon was resolved in a one-shot text story contained in the final ''Transformers'' annual (a hardback book containing new material released each year). Of the Dinobots, only Slag retained the ability to transform, until the discovery of new nucleon allowed all the Transformers previously empowered by it to regain their transforming abilities. The place in continuity of this tale is hard to determine. It followed on from the events at the conclusion of the American series, yet cannot fit in with American continuity as it puts Megatron in a situation he cannot possibly be in.

A few years after the conclusion of the original ''Transformers'' comic, the line was given a shot in the arm with the release of the new ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'' toyline and an accompanying comic. Grimlock's toy was re-released for the ''G2'' toyline in several colors including blue, but he continued to appear in his original grey color scheme for most of his appearances in the ''G2'' comic.

With his transformation capabilities restored (the explanation for which was not offered in the American series), Grimlock was Optimus Prime's second in command in the so-called ''Generation 2'' series, aiding in the Autobots' war against the "second generation" of Cybertronians led by [[Jhiaxus]]. However, he remained as rebellious and aggressive as ever, though it proved to be a mixed blessing - at one point his urge to combat Jhiaxus's forces led him and his troops right into a trap, while at another time, his willingness to defy Optimus Prime's orders and launch an all-out attack saved Prime from certain death at the hands of Megatron. When the Autobots and Decepticons united against Jhiaxus and the threat of the Swarm - a destructive by-product of Transformer reproduction - Grimlock was the joint leader of the ground troops as Prime and Megatron fought on other fronts, and survived the brutal conflict.

Grimlock appeared in his blue Generation 2 form in the short lived UK. Generation 2 comic series.

===Toys===
* '''''Generation 1'' Dinobot Grimlock''' (1985)
:Grimlock's toy was originally part of [[Takara]]'s ''[[Diaclone]]'' Dinosaur Robo series. When [[Hasbro]] imported the toy in 1985 for the Transformers line, the blue crotch was changed to red and the Diaclone driver mini-figure was dropped.
:The original Grimlock changes from a robot into a robotic ''T. rex'' and comes with a red sword, a black double-barreled rifle, and a rocket launcher with three silver rockets.
:Grimlock was later reissued in the European/Australian-exclusive Classics series (not to be confused with the 2006 Classics line).
:A variety of knockoff toys of Grimlock have been produced, including those with gold chrome, large horns on the head, and those remolded to look like [[Mechagodzilla]].
:According to X-Entertainment Grimlock was the 2nd top Transformers figure of all time.

:A small rubber version of Grimlock holding his rifle in robot mode given away as a bonus item with Transformers in 1986.
* '''''Generation 1'' Pretender Grimlock''' (1989)
:A small Grimlock toy which could be stored inside a human-like shell.

* '''''Beast Wars'' Grimlock''' (1997)
:A recolor of the original [[Dinobot]]. Comes with sword and rotating blade. The Dinobot mold was changed slightly for this release. The chest area underneath the ''[[Velociraptor]]'' head in robot mode was made up of bone-like detailing on Dinobot. However, in the center of all this detail, Grimlock has a square section that was molded to accommodate the Maximal heat sensitive rub sticker. Slightly smaller knockoffs of this toy have been sold under the Animism Defenders toy line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicron.us/tf1997/toypics/grimlock.htm Unicron.us - Grimlock]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Beast Wars'' Grimlock (himself a recolor of ''Beast Wars'' Dinobot) was remolded in silver and orange to appear more cybernetic as '''Thrustor''' for the Japanese-exclusive ''Beast Wars Second'' line. Later, for ''Beast Wars Neo'', the toy was remolded to become '''Hardhead''', a blue and purple ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', and this version of the figure was redecoed in yellow, black and green and released in the ''Beast Machines'' Dinobots subline as '''Dinotron'''. After being released under the Grimlock name again in 2003, the original version of the mold returned to its roots when it was redecoed into the 10th Anniversary edition figure of ''Beast Wars'' Dinobot.
* '''''World Smallest Dinorobots'' Commander''' (2004)
:An unlicensed smaller reproduction of the ''Generation 1'' figure by JustiToys, in the style of [[Takara]]'s [[Smallest Transformers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitoys.hk/commander_flamethrower_2.htm# JustiToys.hk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517003810/http://www.justitoys.hk/commander_flamethrower_2.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Dinobots'' Grimlock''' (2003)
:A [[Walmart]] exclusive redeco of ''[[Beast Wars]]'' Grimlock that came packaged with a [[Terrorsaur]] redeco named both Swoop and Terranotron.
* '''''Alternators'' Grimlock''' (2005)
:Grimlock staged a comeback in 2005 as part of the [[Transformers: Alternators]] toyline, known in Japan as "Binaltech". Although the American toys offer no supporting fiction, the ''Binaltech'' series tells the story of how Grimlock was reborn in his new form.
:While the Autobots on Earth were decimated by Cosmic Rust and restored in new "Binaltech" bodies through a joint partnership with human automotive corporations, Grimlock and the Dinobots were a part of the larger war raging in space. Unfortunately, Megatron struck at their primitive minds with telepathic alien lifeforms known as "Unleashers," which drove them to attack their fellow Autobots; with no other options, the Autobots were forced to counterattack, taking the Dinobots out of commission. Grimlock regained consciousness and vowed to do anything to return to the battle, and was consequently transported to Earth. His spark was implanted into the Autobots' newest Binaltech body, which combined all the aspects of the previous bodies. Now able to transform into a [[Ford Mustang (fifth generation)|Ford Mustang GT]], Grimlock immediately resented his new, non-traditional body, but came to make the best of it. He remains armed with his energo-sword, and also wields a stun laser.
:The figure was also redecoed in white and blue with a different head as [[Wheeljack]].
* '''''Titanium'' 3-inch Grimlock''' (2006)
:Grimlock was released as a 3 inch tall non-transforming toy in the Transformers: Titanium line.
:Mightiest among the Dinobots, Grimlock masked a surprising intelligence behind simplistic speech patterns. His contempt for the weak kept him often at odds with Optimus Prime, but his hatred for all those who exploited their strength at the expense of others kept him always firmly on the side of right. Though he could bring a huge array of weapons to any fight, he preferred to close with his enemies, wielding his Energo sword in robot mode, or simply crushing his enemies' limbs with his powerful jaw as a ''Tyrannosaurus''.
* '''''Classics'' Grimlock''' (2006)
:The original Grimlock returned to his original ''T. rex'' Beast mode in the [[Transformers Classics]] line, released in December 2006. He returns as leader of the [[Dinobots]], in a toy that is a homage to his original and pretender releases, but with a totally new mold and for the first time, a flexible articulated tail. His fiction seems more in-tune with his ''The War Within'' persona, faking his impediment to trick his enemies, as well as collecting pieces of his opponents left over after battles to add to an ever-growing collection. Classics Grimlock represents modern research regarding the ''T. rex'', with a horizontal back and tail carried high, rather than the classic sloped back and a ground-dragging tail.
:Initially sold separately, Classic Jetfire and Grimlock were later packaged in a 2-pack box set.
:This toy was redecoed into [[BotCon]] exclusive Overkill (2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/universe-classics-20-decepticons-263/overkill-1996/ TFW2005.com - Overkill]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Shattered Glass'' Grimlock (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/convention-exclusives-246/grimlock-1618/ TFW2005.com - Shattered Glass Grimlock]&lt;/ref&gt;
:This toy was voted the 73rd top toy released in the last 10 years by Toyfare Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Toyfare Magazine issue #122&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Attacktix'' Grimlock''' (2007)
:Series 2 of the Transformers [[Attacktix]] figures included a Generation 1 Grimlock figure in beast mode.
* '''Transformers 3D Battle-Card Game Grimlock''' (2007)
:Produced by [[Wizards of the Coast]], wave 2 of their ''Transformers'' 3D Battle-Card Game included a Grimlock card.
* '''''Titanium'' 6-inch War Within Grimlock''' (2007)
:At [[BotCon]] 2006, Hasbro announced that a figure based on Grimlock from his "War Within" [[comic book]] appearance is "''on the rollout line''" for the 6 inch metal Cybertron Heroes lineup. No further details have been revealed about this newest Grimlock yet (released as a [[Toys "R" Us]] (2008) exclusive along with War Within [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]).
* '''''Henkei! Henkei!'' C-03 Deluxe Grimlock''' (2008)
:The Japanese version of the ''Classics'' Deluxe figure by [[Takara Tomy]] sports chrome silver and gold parts in place of the metallic paint applications of the Hasbro version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/henkei-cybertrons-346/grimlock-2470/ TFW2005.com - Henkei Grimlock]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Masterpiece'' MP-08 12-inch Grimlock''' (2009)
:In March 2009, Takara released a Masterpiece-series Grimlock in his robotic and dinosaur form. The figure is highly articulated, comparable to the [[Transformers: Masterpiece series|other masterpiece transformers]]. This figure also has eyes that can be switched between red (the original toy color) and blue (the animated series color) in both robot and T. Rex modes. It makes no sounds, but does have a light-up blaster and sword. Other accessories include an attachable brain transfer device (as seen in the episode "Grimlock's New Brain", where he transferred his newly acquired intelligence to his creation, [[Technobots|Computron]]), a bowtie, an apron and a cocktail tray (used by Grimlock in "Madman's Paradise" as a waiter during an alien ambassador's meeting on Cybertron). This figure is a breath of fresh air for the Masterpiece line, in the sense that the transformation is not as complicated as the other Masterpieces, which is almost similar to that of the original G1 figure.
* '''''Masterpiece'' MP08X King Grimlock''' (2009)
:A Toy Hobby (Japan) exclusive that includes the crown, sword, and gun. The box packaging features the cover of the Marvel Comics issue where Grimlock was proclaimed king.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tformers.com/article.php?sid=12040 TFormers.com - King Grimlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

:An [[Mouse (computing)#Optical mice|optical mouse]] that transforms into Grimlock's dinosaur mode.
:Also available in a purple redeco as [[Trypticon|Dinosaurer/Trypticon]].
*'''''iGear'' IG-TF003 MP-08 Upgrade Set''' (2009)
:An unlicensed set of accessories for ''Masterpiece'' Grimlock made by iGear. This set includes a crown, a mug and small, non-transforming version of Thrust in jet mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/transformers-third-party-addon-accessory-kits-435/mp-8-upgrade-set-5149/ |title=MP-8 Upgrade Set - Third Party Unofficial Custom Transformers |publisher=TFW2005 |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Masterpiece'' Grimlock''' (2010)
:The [[Toys "R" Us]] U.S. exclusive release of Masterpiece Grimlock differs slightly from the Japanese version. More colors have been added on some parts of the figure. The teeth and claws on dinosaur mode are not as sharp as those on the Japanese version. Only the sword (which is molded in clear white instead of clear orange), gun and crown come as accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/transformers-news-rumors/296978-some-detailed-pictures-hasbros-masterpiece-grimlock-comparing-takaras.html TFW2005 - Some Detailed Pictures of Hasbro's Masterpiece Grimlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first completely different character to bear the name of Grimlock was one inhabiting the alternate universe of the 2001 ''Transformers'' toyline, ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (toy line)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. Grimlock is a 1:60 scale toy.

Grimlock (originally named '''Build Hurricane''' in the original Japanese version of the series, ''Car Robots'') was a co-leader of the Autobot Build Team, able to transform into a steam shovel. Despite his harsh appearance, Grimlock is a seasoned, upbeat warrior. He judges any situation in a composed, calm manner, and dispenses accurate advice based on his many past experiences in battle to others, particularly his leader, [[Wedge (Transformers)|Wedge]]. He can combine with his fellow Build Team members to create [[Landfill (Transformers)|Landfill]], able to form either a leg or a pair of arms.

===Animated series===
Grimlock first appeared in episode #18 "Wedge's Short Fuse" and last appeared in episode #38 "The Final Battle Part 2".

===3H Enterprises===
Robots in Disguise Grimlock (in Walmart yellow repaint colors) appeared in the 2004 [[BotCon]] voice actor play.

''Play Synopsis'': [[Rhinox]] has built a device to deflect Unicron's attempts to pull victims from other dimensions with his tractor beam. The Autobots deflect two attempts and the victims end up on a frozen planetoid instead of with Unicron. [[Maximals]] [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]] and [[Silverbolt (Beast Wars)|Silverbolt]] and the [[Predacon]] [[Waspinator]] are sent to help the victims, but [[Reptilion]], [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]], [[Ruination (Transformers)|Ruination]], and ''Universe'' [[Perceptor]] are sent to get them for [[Unicron]]. As a side effect of the device Rhinox built, a vortex opens which sucks in an Autobot shuttle from the past piloted by [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]], and [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]]. Thrust attacks the Maximal ship, but they are saved by being transported to the Autobot shuttle. The Autobots and Maximals then go to the planet where they save the victims from the Decepticons. On the planet are two groups of Autobots. One is from the ''Robots in Disguise'' story, with Landfill (Walmart recolor), ''Universe'' [[Side Burn]], and ''Universe'' Prowl. The other is from another parallel world with [[Spy Changer]] Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Prowl, and Ironhide. They all fight off the Decepticons. The Autobot shuttle is sent back to its own time.

===Toys===
* '''''Car Robots'' Build Hurricane''' (2000)
:Grimlock's first toy is actually Japan's '''Build Hurricane''', part of its ''Transformers: Car Robots'' line in 2000.
* '''''Robots in Disguise'' Grimlock''' (2001)
:When Grimlock (the American equivalent) was released in 2001, mold and paint colors were slightly altered. The most noticeable differences are the lack of metallic elements used on the Build Team's American bodies, and the tampographing of Autobot insignias on each Build Team member. (Previously, only Build Boy/Wedge carried an insignia.)
:Grimlock and the rest of the Build Team were redecoed for ''Transformers: Universe'' as the [[Constructicons]], in the characters' traditional purple and green color scheme. Grimlock became '''[[Scavenger (Transformers)|Scavenger]]''', packaged with '''Hightower'''.
* '''''Robots in Disguise'' Grimlock Redeco''' (2003)
:Grimlock was later recolored in yellow by Hasbro in 2003 for a [[Wal*Mart]] store exclusive and was packaged with his team. Although packages as part of ''Robots in Disguise'' many fans consider it to be an unofficial part of the "[[Transformers: Universe]]" toyline by being released during the Universe time period. It is the last released toy of the RiD series before it was changed to Universe. This version of the Build Team appeared in the Transformers: Universe storyline presented at the [[BotCon]] 2005 voice actor play.

Another alternate-universe incarnation of Grimlock entered the fray in the Transformers: Energon line. Grimlock's toy – packaged with the similarly-redesigned Swoop – was a modern updating of his original figure. It still transformed into a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', but had one major change: Grimlock and Swoop could now combine to form a larger robot named "Mega-Dinobot". The characters' joint biography clearly draws on the Generation 1 cartoon incarnation of the original characters, presenting them as Autobots who are simple in speech and thought, but who make up for it in raw strength. Decepticons have been known to flee in fear when faced with the two Dinobots, as Swoop uses his aerial abilities to confuse and distract them, while Grimlock attacks from behind and stomps them flat before they know what hit them. Though heavily armed, the duo's preferred weaponry is their teeth and talons.

===Dreamwave Productions===
It comes as no surprise that longtime Grimlock fan Simon Furman intended to feature the characters in Dreamwave's ''Energon'' comic book, but the company's closure prevented this.

===Fun Publications===
Grimlock appeared in the text story from [[Fun Publications]] called "[[Force of Habit (Transformers)|Force of Habit]]". This story explained where he was during the events of the ''Cybertron'' story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the [[Cyber Planet Keys]]. He also served as captain of the ''Iron Hope'' which was crewed by [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], Grimlock, [[Ironhide]], Knock Out, [[Overcast (Transformers)|Overcast]], [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Quickstrike]], RipTide, [[Skyblast]], [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]], [[Swoop (Transformers)|Swoop]], [[Wreckage (Transformers)|Wreckage]], and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team. Grimlock and Swoop were sent to stop an attack by Predacon on the ship.

In a ''[[USA Today]]'' online fan poll, Grimlock was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, tied for second with 16% of the votes.&lt;ref name="breznican2007"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-18-Transformers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Transformers' fans make some noise for Soundwave | first=Anthony | last=Breznican | date=2007-07-23 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live-action films===
In ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]'', Grimlock and the Dinobots are captured by [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]] as trophies, referred to as legendary knights. After the Autobots escape with the part of the ship holding them, Optimus releases the Dinobots for backup and engages in a battle for dominance with Grimlock which Optimus wins. Submitting to Optimus, Grimlock allows Optimus to ride him into battle in [[Hong Kong]] and aids in destroying the KSI Decepticons and protecting the Seed. After Lockdown is defeated, Optimus releases Grimlock and the Dinobots to go their own way. This Grimlock is larger than previous incarnations and, like the rest of the Dinobots, he isn't referred to by name (although in The Last Knight he is named by Cade Yeager) as he cannot speak, or at least has yet to learn how.

Grimlock returned in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]''. Grimlock is among the Autobots taking sanctuary at Cade Yeager's junkyard. He has taken up the personality of a dog, often eating the local police chief's car. During the TRF and Decepticon invasion of the junkyard, Grimlock attacks a fleet of TRF cars along with Slug, eating the Decepticon Dreadbot. Though he is not seen after this, Grimlock presumably joins the other Autobots in returning to Cybertron on Lockdown's ship.

Mini-Grimlock, a baby Dinobot, also appears in ''the Last Knight'', as one of the Autobots in Cade's junkyard. It gains Grimlock's fire breath, which it uses in Cade's trailer. Mini-Grimlock is seen snuggling with Izabella and around the other Autobots.

===Video Games===
The Sector 7 [[viral marketing]] web site featured several videos recording supposed evidence of Transformers on Earth. These featured cameos by Generation 1 Transformers, including scenes of Grimlock destroying a construction site, as well as scenes of [[Kickback (Transformers)|Kickback]] and [[Laserbeak]] being video taped by people accidentally, and a security video showing bits of a robot looking a lot like Generation 1 [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] transforming in a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Transformers Movie Update: Sector Seven Video Gives Nod To Dinobots, Insecticons, Lazerbeak And Generation One Bumblebee | publisher = Jalopnik | date = 2007-05-17 | url = http://jalopnik.com/cars/robots-in-disguise%27%27%27in-disguise/transformers-movie-update-sector-seven-video-gives-nod-to-dinobots-insecticons-lazerbeak-and-generation-one-bumblebee-261435.php | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimlock's ''Age of Extinction'' incarnation is a playable character in ''[[Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark]]''. In the game, he controls very identical to his counterpart in [[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]].

Grimlock is one of the main playable characters in [[Transformers: Devastation]], and the only one who does not transform into a motor vehicle.

A character named Grimlock appears in ''[[Transformers: Animated]]'', which began airing in 2007. He is similar to his animated Generation 1 incarnation in persona and form, but with his face modified with a feral look. His beast mode now looks more like how an actual ''Tyrannosaurus'' is thought to look and his roar sounds much like the ''T. Rex'''s roar from ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. In robot mode, he wields a flaming battle sword and can breathe fire in beast mode. Grimlock is partnered with fellow [[Dinobots#Transformers Animated|Dinobots]], [[Snarl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Snarl]] and [[Swoop (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Swoop]]. He debuts in episode 6, "Blast From the Past". Grimlock acquired his name while the damaged Megatron's head was surveying the Dinobots at Prof. Isaac Sumdac's laboratory. Megatron said, "And without more substantial robotics for my own body, my prospects are '''grim''', '''lock'''ed in this prison of a lab." He is also the only one of the Dinobots to talk and the first to transform into robot mode.

===Animated series===
In "Blast From the Past" the Autobots visit a dinosaur-themed [[amusement park]] where [[animatronic]] dinosaurs are on display, but Bulkhead accidentally breaks them. Professor Sumdac and [[Megatron (Transformers)#Animated series|Megatron]] rebuild the animatronic dinosaurs as technological wonders named the Dinobots, who go on a rampage under the Deception's influence until the attacks powered Sari's AllSpark key affecting [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Bumblebee]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Ratchet]]'s Electromagnetic blast against the Dinobots by making them conscious. Finding a way to control them, Megatron told Grimlock to attack the city by telling the Dinobots they are "fossil feeders" due to the way Earth vehicles are powered and that the Autobots are even worse. The Dinobots are lured away by the Autobots, with [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Prowl]] secretly placing them at the later named Dinobot Island in hopes that they'll live in peace. However, while expressing his rage at two birds defecating on him, Grimlock accidentally transforms to robot mode and finds his new form to his liking.

In a TFA short, "Bulkhead Plays with Grimlock", Bulkhead throws a tree for no reason. Then Grimlock catches it with his mouth, and brings it back to Bulkhead. Grimlock states he loves fetch and asks to play again. Apparently this is a contradiction to "Human Error Part 2" where he criticized Snarl for willing to become a pet to Scrapper.

The episode "Survival of the Fittest" marks his, as well as the rest of the Dinobots, official side change when they help defeat Meltdown, Cyrus "The Colossus" Rhodes, and Meltdown's experiments.

In "Megatron Rising" Pt. 1, [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]], Prowl, and [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bulkhead]] try to get the Dinobots to help them fight the Decepticons, but they refused saying that robots are their enemies. Upon them being told that they are robots too, Grimlock and the other two Dinobots end up fighting each other.

In "The Elite Guard", Optimus Prime leads [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] and [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Prime]] to the downed ship on Dinobot Island when they run into Grimlock and the Dinobots. Despite Optimus' warnings, Sentinel Prime charged them and got defeated. Ultra Magnus repelled them with the lightning he summoned with his hammer.

In "A Fistful of Energon", Prowl and Bulkhead are sent to the island where the Dinobots are, once again, to investigate the reports of a rampage. Soon enough, Grimlock heads right towards Prowl and Bulkhead, thinking something has made him hostile, but later discovering something is wedged between his foot, and yank it out.

Later, under [[Blackarachnia#Transformers Animated|Blackarachnia]]'s seduction, Grimlock returns in the episode "Black Friday" to break out Meltdown. Out of the Dinobots, Grimlock had the most love for Blackarachnia, refusing to accept that she's using him when she departs, leaving him heartbroken.

In "Predacons Rising" the Dinobots are once again coerced into doing Blackarachnia's bidding, bringing them into conflict with the Autobots. In the ensuing battle, they are overwhelmed and defeated by [[Jetfire#Transformers: Animated|Jetfire]] and [[Jetstorm#Transformers Animated|Jetstorm]], though Jetfire noted Grimlock seemed to have some fight left in him.

During the ''Human Error'' 2-parter, Sari attempted to get the Dinobots' aid only to have a not so warm welcome. Though she managed to convince him not to attack with her techno-organic powers, Grimlock refuses to give the Autobots aid; however, he indirectly led her in looking for Snarl, whom he lost respect towards and considered a 'traitor' for befriending the marooned Scrapper.

===Toys===
* '''''Animated'' Voyager Grimlock''' (2008)
: Grimlock transforms into a mechanical Tyrannosaurus fairly accurate to his ''Animated'' appearance. He comes with a large, transparent orange sword with flame details that spring out when the sword is placed in his right hand and the wrist is twisted clockwise or counter-clockwise. A button on his dinosaur mode neck opens his mouth. The transformation sequence is very close to his original G1 toy, but with more details and a few minor steps added.
: The box packaging and instructions mention the sword also being able to connect to his mouth as a "Jet flame breath attack," though there are no actual connection points in his mouth. This feature was probably dropped during production due to issues with getting the sword to actually fit inside his mouth.

This Grimlock is an evil version of the ''Generation 1'' character. It should also be noted that this Grimlock has Trypticon's colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/convention-exclusives-246/grimlock-1618/ |title=Grimlock - Transformers |publisher=TFW2005 |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Tech Specs Grimlock was created as an experiment in artificial intelligence by the Decepticons which became too violent and Megatron shut him down. Optimus Prime then liberated Grimlock and let him work for the Autobots.

Initially Grimlock is a non-living machine without the ability to transform to a humanoid shape. Once granted an ember by the [[Omega Terminus]] he gains the ability to transform. His transformation seems to be tied to his emotions. When calm intellectual he gains a humanoid mode, but when enraged he is forced into dinosaur mode. Grimlock was reprogrammed by Optimus Prime to not be able to attack anything bearing the purple Autobot symbol, but after being granted an ember he seems to have overcome this limitation.

===Reception===
The Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the "Action Figure Digest Hot Pick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Botcon 2008 Transformers...

===Fun Publications===
Grimlock appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic "[[Shattered Expectations]]" by [[Fun Publications]].

Grimlock appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story "Shattered Glass". He helps defend the Ark from a Decepticon attack, but is overcome by the Predacons.

Grimlock appears in the preview to "[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]", printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine issue #22. Huffer attempts to capture Grimlock, but Grimlock chases him away while following a strange voice into the depths of Cybertron.

Grimlock appears in the text fiction "[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]". The mad Autobot scientist [[Wheeljack]] duplicates Grimlock's design to create an army of Dinobots, which he uses to attack the Decepticons, but sadly the dinobots attack each other in the frenzy of their first battle. Grimlock runs off, being called to the super computer known as the [[Omega Terminus]], Grimlock is granted an ember, superior intelligence and the ability to transform. Followed by the Rodimus, Blurr, Cliffjumper and Sideswipe, he confronts the four with the aid of an army of zombie mechs, including the reanimated bodies of the dead Cliffjumper from his world and Sideswipe's old leader Drench. He bites the left hand off Rodimus during the battle, but thrown off a cliff during the fight. Although presumed dead he appears at the Autobot headquarters offering his services to Optimus Prime of his own free will, secretly planning on helping grant embers the various Dinobots and Dinocons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Dungeons &amp; Dinobots|publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Evan Gauntt]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Do Over" it is revealed that Grimlock had given the Dinobots and Dinocons embers, then returned them to the Autobots and Decepticons.

In ''Reunification'' Grimlock is seen gnawing on the body of Blurr, who was punished by Optimus Prime for failing to stop Rodimus from taking the ''Ark''.

Grimlock is known for not following orders or trusting in Optimus Prime's ability to be an effective leader. As the leader of the Lightning Strike Coalition Force, Grimlock enjoys smashing things first and asking questions later. Due to Shockwave's experiments, Grimlock has been left with a malfunctioning voice processor and alt-mode inspired by a distant primitive world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transfomersgame.com/#!/characters/autobots/grimlock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208034929/http://transfomersgame.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimlock is part of [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]'s new team of Autobots in ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', though his personality is much different then what was seen in ''Fall of Cybertron'' and the ''Aligned'' Continuity Comics, and his character's history seems to apply that this is a different character. Coincidentally, this incarnation also sports green colors similar to the 2001's incarnation from the series also titled ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2001 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. He also speaks properly unlike previous incarnations. It is later revealed by one of the show's producers that there is more than one Grimlock in this continuity.

===Animated Series===
In ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', as one of many Decepticon prisoners aboard the Autobot ship ''Alchemor'', Grimlock was the only one not to escape when the vessel crashed on Earth. The stasis unit on his cell was damaged however, and he was thus awake when the Autobots were engaging his former fellow inmate Underbite in the first pilot episode. He was freed after he insulted Underbite, and subsequently engaged the Decepticon in battle to satisfy his destructive impulses. Grimlock then proved an unlikely addition to Bumblebee's team, and with them witnessed the astonishing reappearance of Optimus Prime. After Underbite was imprisoned, Bumblebee decided to allow Grimlock to join the team on probation, and thus has been a major character in the series since. Later, after bringing the cyber-tick Minitron, he was formally inducted into the Autobot ranks and began to sport Autobot symbols instead of the Decepticon ones he sported in all of the episodes prior. According to Bumblebee, the only reason Grimlock was imprisoned on the ''Alchemor'' was due to severe property damage, which Bumblebee deemed to just be him acting like himself and not being a threat. Some major changes from previous Grimlock incarnations is that along with not having a speech impediment that was shown in series prior, he also has a much more mild manner and a showingly kind personality, though he usually is shown as not the most intellectual character on the team.

===Comics===
Grimlock appears in the ''Transformers: Prime'' spinoff comic series, ''Rage of the Dinobots'', in which he and the other Dinobots remain behind on Cybertron after Optimus Prime departs. Grimlock becomes the leader of a city known as Last Spark, ruling over and protecting the citizens in a monarchial fashion. He and the other Dinobots are forced to contend with the prejudices of other Cybertronians due to their altered states, as well as Shockwave's creations, which include a group of Decepticons known as the Forged.

===Games===
Grimlock appears as a minor character in the portable version of ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron (Nintendo DS)|Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''

Grimlock is one of the main characters of subject in the 2012 game ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/conventions-15/key-images-from-the-transformers-panel-at-nycc-173563/ |title=Key Images From The Transformers Panel at NYCC - Transformers News |publisher=TFW2005 |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he and his team are captured by Shockwave and the Insecticons and taken to a laboratory where Shockwave transforms them into the Dinobots. Grimlock becomes the first to break free following a brief encounter with the disgraced Starscream and proceeds to free three of four (Sludge having been put in stasis lock and left behind after they were captured) other members of his team, discover his Dinobot abilities, and destroy the space bridge Megatron plans to use as a route to a perpetual energy source, Earth.

'''Jean-Gaspard Deburau''' (born '''Jan Kašpar Dvořák''';&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|154801|Jean-Gaspard Deburau}}.&lt;/ref&gt; July 31, 1796&amp;nbsp;– June 17, 1846), sometimes erroneously called '''Debureau''', was a celebrated [[Bohemian]]-French [[Mime artist|mime]].  He performed from 1816 to the year of his death at the [[Théâtre des Funambules]], which was immortalized in [[Marcel Carné]]'s [[Poetic realism|poetic-realist]] film ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (1945); Deburau appears in the film (under his stage-name, "Baptiste") as a major character.  His most famous pantomimic creation was [[Pierrot]]—a character that served as the godfather of all the Pierrots of [[Romanticism|Romantic]], [[Decadent movement|Decadent]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]], and early [[Modernism|Modernist]] theater and art.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Kolín]], [[Bohemia]] (now [[Czech Republic]]), Deburau was the son of a Czech servant, Kateřina Králová (or Catherine Graff), and a former French soldier, Philippe-Germain Deburau, a native of [[Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;Rémy is Deburau's chief biographer.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time before 1814, when he appeared in Paris, Philippe had turned showman, and had begun performing at the head of a nomadic troupe probably made up, at least in part, of his own children.  When the company was hired, in 1816, by the manager of the Funambules for mimed and acrobatic acts, the young Deburau was included in the transaction.

Apparently, as cast-lists indicate, he began appearing as Pierrot as early as the year of his hiring, although it was not until 1825 that he became the sole actor to claim the role.&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2016), p. 18, n. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  His "discovery" by the theater-savvy public did not occur until several years later, when, in 1828, the influential writer [[Charles Nodier]] published a panegyric on his art in ''La Pandore''.&lt;ref name="r&amp;r"&gt;"Deburau", p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nodier persuaded his friends, fellow men-of-letters, to visit the theater; the journalist [[Jules Janin]] published a book of effusive praise, entitled ''Deburau, histoire du Théâtre à Quatre Sous'', in 1832; and by the middle of the 1830s Deburau was known to "''tout Paris''".  [[Théophile Gautier]] wrote of his talent with enthusiasm ("the most perfect actor who ever lived");&lt;ref&gt;''La Presse'', January 25, 1847; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Théodore de Banville]] dedicated poems and sketches to his Pierrot; [[Charles Baudelaire]] alluded to his style of acting as a way of understanding "The Essence of Laughter" (1855).

He seems to have been almost universally loved by his public, which included the high and the low, both the Romantic poets of the day and the working-class "children of paradise", who installed themselves regularly in the cheapest seats (which were also the highest: the "paradise") of the house.  It was before this public of artists and artisans that he found himself in his only true element: when, in 1832, he took his pantomime to the [[Palais-Royal]], he failed spectacularly.  The occasion was a benefit performance of a pantomime performed earlier—with great success—at the Funambules,&lt;ref&gt;The pantomime was ''The Female Goblin''; the evening opened with ''The Sylph'' and three other short pieces: see Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f113.image p. 110.]&lt;/ref&gt; and included actors, not only from the Funambules, but also from the [[Gymnase Dramatique|Gymnase]], the [[Paris Opera|Opéra]], and the bastion of high dramatic art, the [[Théâtre-Français]]. [[Louis Péricaud]], the chronicler of the Funambules, wrote that "never was there a greater disaster, a rout more complete for Deburau and his fellow-artists."&lt;ref&gt;Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f113.image p. 110.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Deburau himself was hissed, and he vowed to play thereafter before no other public than those "naïfs and enthusiasts" who were habitués of the [[Boulevard du Crime]].&lt;ref&gt;Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f113.image pp. 110, 111.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deburau - Père-Lachaise 01.jpg|thumb|Tomb of J.-G. Deburau in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris]]
But some of that public, however admiring, made the mistake of confusing his creation with his character, and one day in 1836, as he was out strolling with his family, he was taunted as a "Pierrot" by a street-boy, with ugly consequences: the boy died from one blow of his heavy cane. Deburau's biographer, Tristan Rémy, contends that the incident throws into relief the darker side of his art.  "The bottle", Rémy writes, "whose label 'Laudanum' he smilingly revealed after Cassander had drained it, the back of the razor he passed over the old man's neck, were toys which he could not be allowed to take seriously and thus put to the test his patience, his reserve, his sang-froid."  And Rémy concludes: "When he powdered his face, his nature, in fact, took the upper hand.  He stood then at the measure of his life—bitter, vindictive, and unhappy."&lt;ref&gt;Rémy, pp. 143, 144; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In court, he was acquitted of murder. Carné remarked, "There ensued a trial which ''le tout Paris'' crowded into, in order to get to hear the voice of the famed Debureau {{sic}}."&lt;ref&gt;Chion and Gorbman, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The composer [[Michel Chion]] named this curiosity about a voice the ''Deburau effect''.&lt;ref&gt;Chion and Gorbman, pp. 102–106.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a Deburau effect has been extended to any drawing of the listener's attention to an inaudible sound—which, once heard, loses its interest.&lt;ref&gt;Augoyard et al., p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he died, his son [[Charles Deburau|Jean-Charles]] (1829–1873) took over his role and later founded a "school" of pantomime, which flourished in the south of France, then, at the end of the century, in the capital.&lt;ref&gt;On Charles Deburau's career, see Hugounet.&lt;/ref&gt; A line can be drawn from that school to the Bip of [[Marcel Marceau]].

Jean-Gaspard Deburau is buried in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

==Pantomime==
===Character roles===
In a review of a pantomime at the Funambules after Deburau's death, Gautier reproached the mime's successor, [[Paul Legrand]], for dressing "half as a comic-opera Colin, half as a Tyrolean hunter", thereby degrading the Pierrot of Baptiste.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''La Gageure'' in ''La Presse'', August 31, 1846; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was answered by a letter from the Funambules' director, who wished to disabuse the poet of his "error": " ... we have some thirty-odd plays performed by Debureau {{sic}} in different costumes, and Paul has simply continued the practice ... ".&lt;ref&gt;Undated letter to Gautier from Charles-Louis Billion, MS C491, f. 529, in the Bibliothèque Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, Chantilly; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 10, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierrot was not Baptiste's only creation.  As Robert Storey, one of the most assiduous students of the mime's repertoire, has pointed out, Deburau performed in many pantomimes unconnected with the [[Commedia dell'Arte]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was probably the student-sailor Blanchotin in ''Jack, l'orang-outang'' (1836), for example, and the farmhand Cruchon in ''Le Tonnelier et le somnambule'' ([The Cooper and the Sleepwalker] late 1838 or early 1839), and the goatherd Mazarillo in ''Fra-Diavolo, ou les Brigands de la Calabre'' ([Brother Devil, or The Brigands of Calabria] 1844).  He was certainly the [[:fr:Jocrisse|Jocrisse]]-like ''comique'' of ''Hurluberlu'' (1842) and the engagingly naïve recruit Pichonnot of ''Les Jolis Soldats'' ([The Handsome Soldiers] 1843).&lt;ref&gt;Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Like [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]]'s various incarnations, all of whom bear some resemblance to the [[Little Tramp]], these characters, though singular and independent creations, must undoubtedly have struck their audiences as Pierrot-like.  For Deburau and Pierrot were synonymous in the Paris of post-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] France.

===Pierrot===
[[Image:J.-G. Deburau as Pierrot Gourmand.jpg|thumb|280px|[[:fr:Auguste Bouquet|Auguste Bouquet]]: ''Pierrot's Repast'': Deburau as Pierrot Gormand, c. 1830]]
[[Image:Two Caricatures of J.-G. Deburau.jpg|thumb|220px|[[:fr:Eugène Lampsonius|Eustache Lorsay]]: Two Caricatures of Deburau in ''Satan, or The Infernal Pact'', c. 1842, from ''Le Musée Philipon, album de tout le monde'', c. 1842]]
The Pierrot of his predecessors at the Funambules—and that of their predecessors at the [[Théâtre de la foire|Foires St.-Germain and St.-Laurent]] of the previous century—had been quite different from the character that Deburau eventually devised.  He had been at once more aggressive in his acrobatics (his "superabundance", in [[Louis Péricaud|Péricaud]]'s words, "of gestures, of leaps") than Baptiste's "placid" creation,&lt;ref&gt;Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f31.image p. 28.]&lt;/ref&gt; and much less aggressive in his audacity and daring.  The Pierrot of ''Saphir the Enchanter, Pantomime in 3 Parts'' (1817) is a typical pre-Deburau type.  Lazy and sexless, he much prefers stuffing his gut to the amorous pastimes of [[Harlequin]] and Claudine.  And when Harlequin's heroics seem on the point of bringing the machinations of the Enchanter to an end, Pierrot's stupid bungling nearly precipitates disaster.&lt;ref&gt;''Saphir l'enchanteur, pantomime en 3 parties'': uncoded MS in the Collection Rondel ("Rec. des pantomimes jouées au Théâtre des Funambules et copiées par Henry Lecomte"), Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even when he summons up the pluck and resourcefulness to initiate actions of his own, as he does in ''The Pink Genie and the Blue Genie, or The Old Women Rejuvenated'' (1817), he shows—in the Pink Genie's words at the end of the piece—"only the signs of an unjust and wicked heart",&lt;ref&gt;D., ''Le Génie rose et le génie bleu, ou les Vieilles Femmes rajeunies'' (Paris: Morisset, 1817), p. 33.  Not all of the characters in pantomime were mute; sometimes Pierrot was the only non-speaking character. According to Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f95.image p. 92], Deburau spoke no more than two words on stage: "''Achetez salade!'' [Salad for sale!]", in ''The Salad Merchant'' (1829).  For a detailed history of the evolution of the speaking roles in the pantomimes at the Funambules, see Nye (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; and so is buried in a cage in the bowels of the earth.

Deburau dispensed with Pierrot's coarseness and emphasized his cleverness.  As theater historian Edward Nye writes, "[[George Sand|[George] Sand]] describes the new Pierrot as if he were a more reflective version of the old, as if Pierrot had somehow intellectually matured and learnt to moderate his worst excesses, or even to turn them into relative virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2014), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  So radical was that maturation that the poet Gautier, though a great admirer of the mime, reproached him after his death for having "denaturalized" the character.  No longer the cowardly stooge, his Pierrot "gave kicks and no longer received them; Harlequin now scarcely dared brush his shoulders with his bat; Cassander would think twice before boxing his ears."&lt;ref&gt;''La Presse'', January 25, 1847; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 102 (names have been anglicized).&lt;/ref&gt;  Deburau restored to Pierrot some of the force and energy of the earlier Italian type [[Pedrolino]] (though he probably never heard of that predecessor).&lt;ref&gt;On the relation between Deburau's Pierrot and Pedrolino, see Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 5–15, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this may have been due to what Rémy calls the vindictiveness of Deburau's own personality; but what seems more likely is that, with the assurance that comes with great talent, Deburau instinctively forged a role with a commanding stage presence.

Nye identifies the source of that presence: it arose from the "semantic clarity" of Deburau's art.  ("Such was the semantic clarity of his body language that spectators ‘listened’ to him and could translate his mime into words and phrases".)&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2014), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nye explains: &lt;blockquote&gt;From the waning world of the commedia dell’arte he took the concept of playing a role, Pierrot, with recurrent characteristics and types of behaviour. ... From the wider world of theatre he took the principle of character acting, of seeking to imitate the physical and psychological manner of social types as realistically as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2014), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  And Nye suggests how these two orders of acting "contributed to the clarity of his mime":  "Firstly, the Pierrot tradition primed the spectator to understand Deburau's mime in certain ways.  Secondly, Deburau's character acting provided a social and psychological context", further sharpening the intelligibility of his performance.&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2014), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressivity of his acting was abetted by his alterations in Pierrot's costume.  His overlarge cotton blouse and trousers freed him from the constraints of the woolen dress of his predecessors, and his abandoning the frilled collaret and hat gave prominence to his expressive face.  A black skullcap, framing that face, was his only stark adornment.

But his real innovations came in the pantomime itself.  His biographers, as well as the chroniclers of the Funambules, contend that his pantomimes were all alike.  The "naive scenarios" that "limited" his acting, according to his Czech biographer, Jaroslav Švehla, "did little more than group together and repeat traditional, threadbare, primitive, and in many cases absurd situations and mimic gags (''cascades''), insulting to even a slightly refined taste."&lt;ref&gt;Švehla, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  And Adriane Despot, author of "Jean-Gaspard Deburau and the Pantomime at the Théâtre des Funambules", agrees: "most of the pantomimes are essentially the same; they share the atmosphere of light, small-scale, nonsensical adventures enlivened with comic dances, ridiculous battles, and confrontations placed in a domestic or otherwise commonplace setting."&lt;ref&gt;Despot, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Despot was familiar only with a handful of the scenarios, those few in print; by far the greater number, which present a picture of the pantomime rather different from Despot's, are in manuscript in the Archives Nationales de France and in the library of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques.&lt;ref&gt;Despot bases her judgment on five scenarios reproduced in Péricaud and on the compilation by Emile Goby: ''Pantomimes de Gaspard et Ch. Deburau'' (1889).  As Storey writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Goby collection, put together from what Deburau's son, Charles, had been able to recall of the pantomimes and reproducing (as Champfleury observes in his "Préface") only "a repertoire easy to perform in the course of many peregrinations through the provinces" (p. xi), is doubly unreliable: it omits the spectacular ''pantomime-féerie'', the most numerous and most admired of Deburau's productions, and it represents the pantomime of Baptiste much less accurately than that of Charles himself.  Comparison of the censor's copy [in manuscript] of ''Pierrot mitron'' [1831] with the Goby version, for example, reveals significant differences in both the conduct of the plot and the character of Pierrot; Goby's scenario for ''Le Billet de mille francs'' (1826) does not agree either with Auguste Bouquet's portrait of Deburau in that pantomime or with a remark by Gautier about a detail of its plot (in a review of Champfleury's ''Pantomime de l'avocat'' at the Fantaisies-Parisiennes: ''Le Moniteur Universel'', December 4, 1865) [''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 11, n. 25].&lt;/blockquote&gt;Storey provides a list of all of Deburau's pantomimes in manuscript at the Archives Nationales de France in his "Handlist of Pantomime Scenarios", and he summarizes a fair number of the scenarios in his text (''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 317–319 and 9–31).  Nye (2016) analyzes,  in very illuminating detail, three scenarios from the collection in the library of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques.  Besides the Goby collection, cited above, a useful compendium for readers of French is Baugé's volume of pantomimes.&lt;/ref&gt;  And Švehla is proceeding along misguided lines by assuming that Deburau "longed to represent a better character" than Pierrot:&lt;ref&gt;Švehla, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Deburau was apparently proud of his work at the Funambules, characterizing it to George Sand as an "art" (see next section below).  "He loved it passionately", Sand wrote, "and spoke of it as of a grave thing".&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire'', cited and tr. in Maurice Sand {{cite web |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/The_History_of_the_Harlequinade_v5_1000264596/235 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112043623/http://www.forgottenbooks.org/readbook_text/The_History_of_the_Harlequinade_v5_1000264596/235 |archivedate=2014-01-12 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact is that four distinct kinds of Commedia-related pantomime held the stage at the Funambules, and for each Deburau created a now subtly, now dramatically different Pierrot.&lt;ref&gt;The discussion in Storey's ''Pierrots on the stage'' (pp. 12-24) provides the basis for this remark as well as for the summary that follows.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Rustic Pantomime''': Gesturing towards Pierrot's roots outside the [[Commedia dell'Arte]], to the peasant Pierrot of bucolic tradition (such as [[Molière]]'s Pierrot of ''Don Juan'' [1665]), the action of these scenarios is set in a hamlet or village.  Pierrot is the hero: he is honest, good-hearted, but poor (and egotistically, comically naïve).  Through an act of courage, he is able to overcome the scruples of the father of his beloved—a Lisette, or Finetta, or Babette—and win her at the dénouement.  Examples: ''The Cossacks, or The Farm Set Ablaze'' (1840); ''Pierrot's Wedding'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cosaques, ou la Ferme incendiée, pantomime villageoise à spectacle en 4 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1085, MS 3035; ''Les Noces de Pierrot, pantomime villageoise en 5 changements'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1088, MS 6650—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Melo-Pantomime''': Finding their inspiration in the popular boulevard [[melodrama]]s having no connection with the Commedia dell'Arte, these scenarios present Pierrot, not as a hero, but as a subaltern—often a soldier, sometimes a retainer working in the employ of the hero of the piece.  They are set in exotic locales—Africa, America, Malta, China—and the action is (or is meant to be) thrillingly dramatic, fraught with villainous abductions, violent clashes, and spectacular rescues and reversals of fortune, often brought about by Pierrot's cleverness and daring.    Examples: ''The Enchanted Pagoda'' (1845); ''The Algerian Corsaire, or The Heroine of Malta'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;''La Pagode enchantée, pantomime chinoise en 7 changements à vue'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1088, MS 6974; ''Le Corsaire algérien, ou l'Héroïne de Malte, pantomime en 7 changements, mêlée de combats'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1088, MS 7032—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Realistic Pantomime''': These are the pieces with which Despot seems most familiar.  They are set in commonplace urban locales (shops, salons, public streets) and are usually peopled with the Parisian bourgeoisie (shopkeepers, merchants, valets).  Pierrot is the center of attention in these scenarios, but it is a Pierrot that is often very different from the character thus-far described.  "Libidinous and unscrupulous," writes Robert Storey, "often spiteful and cruel, he is redeemed only by his criminal innocence."&lt;ref&gt;Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  He steals from a benefactress, takes outrageous advantage of a blind man, kills a peddler to procure the garments in which he presumes to court a duchess.  This is the Pierrot described by Charles Nodier as a "naive and clownish Satan."&lt;ref name="r&amp;r"/&gt;  (Only when the pantomime has been written by Deburau himself, such as ''La Baleine'' [The Whale] of 1833,&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced in Goby, [https://archive.org/stream/pantomimesdegasp00debu#page/28/mode/2up/search/Baleine pp. 29-33]; an English translation appears on the [[Charles Deburau]] Wikipage.&lt;/ref&gt; do we encounter, predictably, a less devilish Pierrot—one in fact deserving of Columbine's hand.)   Examples: ''Pierrot and His Creditors'' (1836); ''Pierrot and the Blind Man'' (1841).&lt;ref&gt;''Pierrot et ses créanciers, pantomime en sept tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1083, MS 750; ''Pierrot et l'aveugle, pantomime comique en 5 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1086, MS 3924—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Pantomimic Fairy-Play''': The grandest and most popular class of pantomimes—it occupied a third of the Funambules' repertoire&lt;ref&gt;Nye (2016), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;—of which there are three subclasses:
**'''The Pantomimic Pierrotique Fairy-Play''': Pierrot is the only Commedia dell'Arte character (except Cassander, who sometimes puts in an appearance).  Like the action in the other subclasses, the plot here unfolds in fairyland, which is populated by sorcerers and sorceresses, ogres and magicians, fairies and enchanters.  Pierrot is usually sent on a quest, sometimes to achieve an amatory goal (for himself or his master), sometimes to prove his mettle, sometimes to redress an injustice.  The settings are fantastic and gothic, the action bizarre and frenetic, and the comedy very broad.  Examples: ''The Sorcerer, or The Demon-Protector'' (1838); ''Pierrot and the Bogeyman, or The Ogres and the Brats'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;''La Sorcière, ou le Démon protecteur, pantomime'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1084, MS 1957; ''Pierrot et Croquemitaine, ou les Ogres et les moutards, enfantillage-féerie, mêlée de pantomime, de dialogue &amp; de chant, en 6 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1085, MS 3357—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''The Pantomimic Harlequinesque Fairy-Play''':  The basis for the pantomimes still performed at [[Dyrehavsbakken|Bakken]] in Denmark.  In the landscape described above (and populated by the same warring spirits), Harlequin, the lover, carries Columbine off, triggering a pursuit by her papa, Cassander, and his serving-man Pierrot.  The end of their adventures is, of course, their union, reluctantly blessed by their pursuers.  Examples: ''Pierrot Everywhere'' (1839); ''The Three Hunchbacks'' (1842).&lt;ref&gt;''Pierrot partout, arlequinade-féerie, en 9 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1085, MS 2692; ''Les Trois Bossus, pantomime arlequinade en 6 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1087, MS 4087—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''The Pantomimic Harlequinesque Fairy-Play in the English Style''': Borrows the "opening" of early nineteenth-century English pantomime: at the rise of curtain, two suitors are in dispute for the same young lady, and her father, a miser, chooses the richer of the two.  A fairy appears to protect the sentimentally more deserving (Harlequin, after his transformation)—and to change all the characters into the Commedia types.  Then begins the chase.  Examples: ''The Ordeals'' (1833); ''Love and Folly, or The Mystifying Bell'' (1840).&lt;ref&gt;''Les Epreuves, grande pantomime-arlequinade-féerie en 13 tableaux, mêlée de danses, travestissements, etc., précédée de: Le Cheveu du Diable, prologue en un acte et en 2 tableaux, en vers libres, mêlée de chants, danses, etc.'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1083, MS 112; ''L'Amour et la Folie, ou le Grelot mystificateur, pantomime arlequinade en 6 tableaux'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1085, MS 2904—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited and described by Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths about Deburau==
===The people's Pierrot===
If the casual theater-goer (from the mid-twentieth century on) knows Deburau at all, it is the Deburau of ''Children of Paradise''.  There, through a brilliant interpretation by [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], he emerges, on-stage and off-, as an exemplar of the common people, a tragic long-suffering lover, a friend of the pure and lonely and distant moon.  Neither Deburau nor his Pierrot was such a figure.&lt;ref&gt;See Nye (2014), pp. 114-117, and all of Nye (2015-2016) for the role that Romanticism played in creating the myths.&lt;/ref&gt;  (That figure is much closer to the Pierrot of his successor, [[Paul Legrand]].)  But the myth sprang into being very early, simultaneous with the emergence of Deburau's celebrity.  It was the product of clever journalism and idealizing romance: Janin's ''Deburau'' first set things in motion.  Deburau, he wrote, "is the people's actor, the people's friend, a windbag, a glutton, a loafer, a rascal, a poker-face, a revolutionary, like the people."&lt;ref&gt;Janin, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204330f/f95.image p. 69]; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Théodore de Banville followed suit: "both mute, attentive, always understanding each other, feeling and dreaming and responding together, Pierrot and the People, united like two twin souls, mingled their ideas, their hopes, their banter, their ideal and subtle gaiety, like two Lyres playing in unison, or like two Rhymes savoring the delight of being similar sounds and of exhaling the same melodious and sonorous voice."&lt;ref&gt;Banville, ''L'Ame de Paris'', p. 28; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, George Sand noted, after Deburau's death, that the "''titis''", the street boys, of the Funambules seemed to regard his Pierrot as their "model";&lt;ref&gt;Sand, "Deburau".&lt;/ref&gt; but, earlier, when she had asked Deburau himself what he thought of Janin's conclusions, he had had this to say: "the effect is of service to my reputation, but all that is not the art, it's not the idea I have of it.  It is not true, and the Deburau of M. Janin is not me: he has not understood me."&lt;ref&gt;Sand, ''Histoire'', II, 136; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The noble Pierrot===
As for Banville's idealized Pierrot, it is best appreciated if set against the figure that we find in the scenarios themselves.  Late in  his life, Banville recalled a pantomime he had seen at the Funambules: Pierrot-baker is confronted by two women—"two old, old women, bald, disheveled, decrepit, with quivering chins, bent towards the earth, leaning upon gnarled sticks, and showing in their sunken eyes the shadows  of years gone by, more numerous than the leaves in the woods."
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Really now! there's no common sense in this!" exclaimed (in mute speech) the wise baker Pierrot: "to allow women to come to such a state is unthinkable.  So why hasn't anyone noticed they need to be melted down, remade, rebaked anew?"  And immediately, in spite of their protestations, he seized them, laid them both on his shovel, popped them right in the oven, and then stood watch over his baking with faithful care.  When the number of desired minutes had elapsed, he took them out—young, beautiful, transformed by brilliant tresses, with snow at their breasts, black diamonds in their eyes, blood-red roses on their lips, dressed in silk, satin, golden veils, adorned with spangles and sequins—and modestly said then to his friends in the house: "Well now, you see?  It's no more difficult than that!"&lt;ref&gt;Banville, ''Mes Souvenirs'', pp. 221–222; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What he is remembering is a scene from ''Pierrot Everywhere'':  Pierrot has just stolen Columbine from Harlequin, and he, Cassander, and Leander, along with the fiancées of the latter two, have stumbled upon an oven with magical powers.  The fiancées have been aged and wizened by Harlequin's magic bat, and the men hope that the oven can restore their youth.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Isabelle and Angelique] refuse to enter the oven, finding themselves fine as they are.  ''Pierrot brings in Columbine and wants to burn her alive, too, if she continues to resist his advances; she struggles'' [emphasis added]; the two others succeed in thrusting Isabelle and Angelique inside; Pierrot helps them.  Meanwhile Harlequin sticks his head up through the emberbox and signals to Columbine to run off with him.  Pierrot sees him; Leander pushes the lid down, hard, and sits on top of it.  But hardly has he done so when the box sinks into the ground, swallowing him up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pierrot tries to put Columbine inside.  He opens the oven door; Isabelle and Angelique come out, young and fresh; they are delighted.  Isabelle looks for Leander.  A moaning comes from the oven.  It is Leander, who has been shut up in it, and who emerges half-baked and furious.  They clean him up.  Meanwhile, Harlequin has come back in; he makes Columbine step down—she was already on the shovel—and seizes Pierrot.  The wicked genie appears and helps Harlequin.  They pinion the poor Pierrot and are going to throw him into the oven, when a gong announces the [good] fairy. . . .&lt;ref&gt;''Pierrot partout'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1085, MS 2692, pp. 15–16, Archives Nationales de France (punctuation and capitalization have been regularized); tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 144, n. 23 (names have been anglicized).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Deburau neither idealized nor sentimentalized his Pierrot.  His creation was “poor Pierrot”, yes, but not because he was unfairly victimized: his ineptitude tended to baffle his malice, though it never routed it completely.  And if Deburau was, in Švehla’s phrase, an actor of “refined taste”, he was also a gleeful inventor, like [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (that artist of ultimate refinement), of sexual and scatological fun.  Of his pantomimes in general, George Sand wrote that “the poem is buffoonish, the role cavalier, and the situations scabrous.”&lt;ref&gt;Sand, "Deburau"; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 24, n. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[Paul de Saint-Victor]] echoed her words several weeks after Deburau’s death: “Indeed, in plenty of places, the poem of his roles was free, scabrous, almost obscene.”&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Victor, "Mort"; tr. Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 24, n. 66.  The censor's copies of the pantomimes do not betray very much of this "obscenity"; it would have been a very foolish theater-director indeed who submitted manuscripts that did.  See the discussion in Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 24, n. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Banville’s sanitized—even sanctified—Deburau survives, while the scenario of ''Pierrot Everywhere'', like the more overtly scabrous of the Funambules “poems”, lies yellowing in the files of the Archives Nationales de France.

===The tragic Pierrot===
At one moment in his career, Deburau—quite inadvertently—contributed to his myths.  In 1842, a pantomime was performed at the Funambules in which Pierrot meets a shockingly tragic end: at the final curtain of ''The Ol’ Clo’s Man'' (''Le Marrrchand d'habits!''), Pierrot dies on stage.  It was an unprecedented dénouement and one not to be repeated, at least at Deburau’s theater.  (Imagine the [[Little Tramp]] expiring at the end of one of [[Charlie Chaplin]]’s films.)&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, incidentally, noted in his ''Autobiography'' that the Little Tramp had been conceived as "a sort of Pierrot" (p. 224).&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also an anomaly for which his Romantic admirers were responsible.  This pantomime had been invented by Théophile Gautier in a “review” that he had published in the ''Revue de Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;Both Péricaud and Rémy regarded Gautier's piece as a bona-fide review, but in 1985 Robert Storey revealed in his ''Pierrots on the stage'' that Gautier's friend [[Champfleury]] had been correct in his avowal that the pantomime under "review" was Gautier's invention.  "Shakspeare [sic] aux Funambules", as Gautier entitled his piece, was published in the ''Revue de Paris'' on September 4, 1842, but the manuscript of ''The Ol' Clo's Man'' that was submitted to the censor for approval before the production at the Funambules (and that can now be found in the Archives Nationales de France as document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1087, MS 4426) bears the note that it had been received on October 17, 1842, more than a month ''after'' the "review" appeared.  The MS also reveals that the librettist felt free to borrow large swatches of Gautier's prose.  For a full discussion, see Storey, ''Pierrots on the Stage'', pp. 41-44.  For a full translation of Gautier's "review" into English, see Storey, "Shakespeare".&lt;/ref&gt;  He conceived it in the “realistic” vein described above: Pierrot, having fallen in love with a duchess, kills an old-clothes man to secure the garments with which to court her.  At the wedding, however, ''à la'' the Commander of ''[[Don Juan]]'', the ghost of the peddler—the murdering sword protruding from his chest—rises up to dance with the bridegroom.  And Pierrot is fatally impaled.

Claiming that he had seen the pantomime at the Funambules, Gautier proceeded to analyze the action in familiarly idealizing terms.  “Pierrot,” he wrote, “walking the street in his white blouse, his white trousers, his floured face, preoccupied with vague desires—is he not the symbol of the human heart still white and innocent, tormented by infinite aspirations toward the higher spheres?”  And this dreaming creature of vague desires is essentially innocent of criminal intent: “When Pierrot took the sword, he had no other idea than of pulling a little prank!”&lt;ref&gt;"Shakspeare [sic] aux Funambules", pp. 65, 66; tr. Storey, ''Pierrot: a critical history'', pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temptation to use such material, devised by such an illustrious poet, was irresistible to the managers of the Funambules, and the “review” was immediately turned into a pantomime (probably by the administrator of the theater, Cot d'Ordan).&lt;ref&gt;On the authorship of the pantomime, see the discussion in Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not a success: it had a seven-night run,&lt;ref&gt;According to Péricaud, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f259.image p. 256.]&lt;/ref&gt; a poor showing for one of Baptiste’s productions.  If he indeed appeared in the piece—the matter is under dispute&lt;ref&gt;Rémy argues that the mime [[Paul Legrand]] appeared in ''The Ol' Clo's Man'', since, after Deburau's court-room acquittal in 1836, none of his superiors at the theater could have asked him "to incarnate a character of an all-too-personal truth" (p. 174).  But, as Storey accurately points out, "murder was ubiquitous" in the scenarios of the Funambules, including those post-1836 (''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 43, n. 18).  See Storey's note in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt;—he did so very reluctantly;&lt;ref&gt;Péricaud ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k204363m/f259.image p. 256]) claims that Deburau appeared in the pantomime but did not like the role: he faked an injured foot that he complained made it difficult for him to perform the physical comedy involved.&lt;/ref&gt; it was decidedly not his kind of play.  It was never revived at the Funambules,&lt;ref&gt;Even when it was revived by Legrand as ''Death and Remorse'' in 1856 at the Folies-Nouvelles, the mime and his co-writer, [[Charles Bridault]], gave it a happy ending: Pierrot pulls the sword from the back of the old-clothes man, restoring him to life—and ensuring Pierrot himself the reward of the duchess' hand (see Lecomte, pp. 65ff).  It would not be until the 1890s that Pierrot's death on the popular stage found sympathetic audiences.&lt;/ref&gt; and it should have survived as merely a footnote in Deburau's career.

But like Banville’s deathless prose, it was Gautier’s “review” that survived—and prospered.  Gautier’s ex-son-in-law, [[Catulle Mendès]], refashioned it into a pantomime in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;See Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', pp. 306–309.&lt;/ref&gt; and when [[Sacha Guitry]] wrote his play ''Deburau'' (1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/deburaucomedy00guit#page/n3/mode/2up|title=Deburau, a comedy :|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; he included it as the only specimen of the mime’s art.  Carné did the same (if we may exempt the obviously fabricated ''The Palace of Illusions, or Lovers of the Moon'', in which Baptiste appears as a moonstruck, loveless, suicidal Pierrot, an invention of Carné's screenwriter, [[Jacques Prévert]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Palace of Illusions, or Lovers of the Moon'' appears nowhere among the titles of Deburau's pantomimes either in Péricaud's chronicle of the Funambules or in Storey's 1985 reconstruction of the mime's repertoire.&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands today, for the nonscholarly public, as the supreme exemplar of Deburau’s pantomime.

===The moonstruck Pierrot===
And what of Deburau and Pierrot-the-friend-of-the-moon?  In the many scenarios in manuscript at the Archives Nationales de France, no connection is visible—save in one, and that, like ''The Ol’ Clo’s Man'', is a clear anomaly.  Performed in 1844, after Gautier’s “review” had—at least in the minds of the lettered public—renewed the luster of the Funambules, it was obviously written by an aspiring ''auteur'', judging from its literary pedigree.  Entitled ''The Three Distaffs'' and inspired by a tale of the [[Madame d'Aulnoy|Comtesse d’Aulnoy]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Storey, though he provides no specific title: ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; it finds, at the end of its action, Harlequin, Pierrot, and Leander all trapped underneath the earth.  When the good fairy appears, she announces that her powers are now useless in the terrestrial realm:
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . it is on the moon that your happiness must be realized.  Poor Pierrot . . . it is you who will be entrusted with the leadership of the celestial voyage that we are about to undertake.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Trois Quenouilles, pantomime dialoguée, en huit tableaux, précédée d'un prologue'': document F&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 1088, MS 5850, sc. 7 (unpaginated)—Archives Nationales de France, Paris.  Cited, with small differences in translation, in Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In none of the other scenarios in the Archives is there mention of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;"To associate the Pierrot of [Deburau's] pantomime with the moon-dreamer of ''Au clair de la lune'' was simply to misread Baptiste's unsentimental art": Storey, ''Pierrots on the stage'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Deburau’s Romantic admirers often made the association.  Banville’s poem "Pierrot" (1842) concludes with these lines: “The white Moon with its horns like a bull/Peeps behind the scenes/At its friend Jean Gaspard Deburau.”  And as the century progressed, the association—rendered inevitable by the universal familiarity of “[[Au clair de la lune]]”—became ever more strong.  With the advent of the Symbolist poets, and their intoxication with everything white (and pure: swans, lilies, snow, moons, Pierrots), the legendary star of the Funambules and what [[Jules Laforgue]] called Our Lady the Moon became inseparable.  [[Albert Giraud]]'s ''[[Pierrot lunaire (book)|Pierrot lunaire]]'' (1884) marked a watershed in the moon-maddening of Pierrot, as did the song-cycle that [[Arnold Schoenberg]] derived from it (1912).  If Carné’s hero had not been moonstruck, his audiences would still be wondering why.

The '''Jungle Cruise''' is a river boat attraction located in [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]] at many [[Disney Parks]] worldwide, namely [[Disneyland]], [[Magic Kingdom]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] (the attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland is named "Jungle River Cruise").  [[Disneyland Paris]] and [[Shanghai Disneyland]] are the only Magic Kingdom-style Disney parks that do not have the Jungle Cruise in their attraction rosters.

The attraction simulates a riverboat cruise down several [[List of rivers by length|major rivers]] of Asia, Africa and South America. Park guests board replica [[tramp steamers]] from a 1930s [[British Empire|British]] explorers' lodge and are taken on a voyage past many different [[Audio-Animatronics|Audio-Animatronic]] jungle animals. The tour is led by a live Disney [[cast member|Cast Member]] delivering humorous narration. This narration is based on a written and practiced script, but generally is largely delivered [[ad-lib]].

==Inspiration and design==
Sources of inspiration for the attraction include a 1955 [[True Life Adventures|''True-Life Adventure'']], "The African Lion," about a pride of lions, and the film [[The African Queen (film)|''The African Queen'']]. [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineer]] [[Harper Goff]] referenced the ''African Queen'' frequently in his ideas; even his designs of the ride vehicles were inspired by the [[African Queen (boat)|steamer]] used in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Imagineers, the. ''Walt Disney Imagineering- A Behind the Dreams Look at Making the Magic Real''. Disney Editions, (c) 1996. pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The project was placed on the schedule to open with the July 17, 1955 debut of Disneyland.

When plans began to develop, Bill Evans, the Imagineer responsible for landscaping Disneyland and most of [[Walt Disney World]], faced the daunting task of creating a convincing [[jungle]] on a limited budget. Aside from importing many actual [[Exotic plants|tropical plants]], he made wide use of "character plants" which, while not necessarily exotic, could give the appearance of exoticism in context. In a particularly well-known trick, he uprooted local [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] trees and "replanted" them upside-down, growing vines on the exposed roots. Disney controls the clarity of the water (known as "turbidity") in order to obscure from guests' view the boat's guidance system and undesirable items like perches and mechanized platforms of the bathing elephants and hippos. Initially, the clean water was dyed brown but after a few years the colorant was changed to a green hue and in recent years a bluish-green has been used. The water of the Jungle Cruise is approximately 5 feet deep and is part of the park's 'dark' water system which circulates southward from the northern end of [[Frontierland]]'s [[Rivers of America (Disney)|Rivers of America]], through [[Fantasyland]] and creates the moat of [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]. The water's journey continues flowing past Frontierland's entrance and into Adventureland where it meanders alongside the [[Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room|Tiki Room]] before entering the Jungle Cruise beside the ride's exit. The water returns to the south end of the Rivers of America via a 37" diameter underground pipe near [[Tarzan's Treehouse]]. Originally, the Jungle Cruise waterway was 1,920 feet in length before being slightly shortened and re-routed in 1994.

Although Goff and Evans can be credited with the creation and initial design of the ride, [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]], recognized for his work on venerable attractions such as the [[Haunted Mansion]] and [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]], added his own style to the ride in later versions and Disneyland updates. The "Indian Elephant Bathing Pool" and "Rhinoceros Chasing Explorers up a Pole" were among his contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Minnick, Nathaniel. ''The Jungle Cruise: Foray into the Faux,'' (University of Michigan, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disneyland==
The attraction was in the opening day roster of the park, and has remained open and largely unchanged in theme and story since then.  The original plan was to use real animals, but these plans were abandoned once Disney realized that the animals would likely sleep during the day.&lt;ref name=ocr20120728&gt;{{cite news|last=Tully|first=Sarah|title=Jungle Cruise closes for week|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=July 28, 2012|page=Local 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from alterations and maintenance changes, four completely new show scenes have been added to date. In 1994 the river channel was rerouted to make way for the queue buildings and entrance courtyard of the [[Indiana Jones Adventure]].

While the current version and most previous instances have made use of a comedic spiel, filled with intentionally bad [[pun]]s, the original intent of the ride was to provide a realistic, believable voyage through the world's jungles. Until 1962,&lt;ref name=ocr20120915/&gt; the original spiel had no jokes and sounded much like the narration of a nature [[Documentary film|documentary]].

===Attraction summary===
The queue and station are themed as the headquarters and [[boathouse]] of the Jungle Navigation Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jungle Navigation Co. Ltd. Skipper Canteen|url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/jungle-navigation-skipper-canteen/|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a river trading company located in a [[British Empire|British]] [[colony]] (as evidenced by the [[Union Jack]] flying above the boathouse) circa 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grad|first1=Shelby|title=Disney Tells Jungle Cruise Jokers to Take a Ride|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/12/local/me-42072|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=12 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The queuing area is cluttered with appropriate [[Theatrical property|props]], such as pinned insects, an old radio on top of a bookshelf, and a [[chess]]board with miniature animals and decorated shotgun shells replacing the [[Chess pieces|pieces]]. The extended queue winds upstairs, underneath an Audio-Animatronic [[hornbill]], and then downstairs again. [[Big band]] music from the 1940s plays overhead, punctuated by jungle-related news bulletins, helping to reinforce the setting and threading together the show scenes and boat.&lt;ref name="omniluxe.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniluxe.net/wyw/jc.htm |title=Widen Your World: The Jungle Cruise |first=Mike |last=Lee |publisher=Omniluxe.net |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20 |archivedate=November  1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101145507/http://www.omniluxe.net/wyw/jc.htm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once aboard the boats, guests are introduced to their [[Skipper (boating)|skipper]] and they head into the jungle, allegedly never to return. The first rivers simulated are the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] and [[Mekong]] rivers, representing tropical Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name = ocr20120728/&gt; The boats sail through a dense rainforest inhabited by large butterflies and a pair of toucans, before passing by the [[Temple of the Forbidden Eye]] and a shrine to the [[Hindu]] monkey deity [[Hanuman]]. Passengers then glide precariously under the first of a pair of stone arches severely damaged by an [[earthquake]] centuries ago. These are part of the ruins of an ancient Cambodian city where a crumbling temple is one of the few things which have managed to avoid tumbling into the river. Here passengers see an [[Indo-Chinese tiger]], giant [[spider]]s, [[king cobra]]s and [[mugger crocodile]]s. Passing a statue of the elephant-headed Hindu deity [[Ganesha]], the boats pass under the second arch and enter the Sacred Indian Elephant Bathing Pool. Here a large herd of Indian elephants frolic and squirt water at the passing vessels.

The theme moves to the [[List of rivers of Africa|rivers of Africa]], and riders see a family of [[baboon]]s, and a [[safari]] camp that has been overrun by [[gorilla]]s. The boats narrowly avoid the dramatic [[waterfall]], Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after [[Albert Schweitzer|Dr. Albert Falls]]), and turn down Africa's Nile river where they pass between two [[African elephant]]s, and large [[termite]] mounds. A tableau of the African [[Veld]]t follows, showing [[zebra]]s, [[wildebeest]], [[giraffe]]s, and [[gazelle]]s watching a pride of [[lion]]s feasting on a zebra beneath a rocky outcropping. Beyond the lion's den, an angry [[rhinoceros]] has chased a safari party up a tree. [[Antelope]] and [[hyena]]s watch from nearby. The skipper then pilots the boat into the Congo river disturbing a pod of [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] that [[Hippopotamus#Behavior#Aggression|signal]] their intent to attack the boat. Armed with a gun filled with blanks, the skipper fires into the air to frighten them away.

Drums and chanting are heard as the boats come to [[headhunting|headhunter]] territory. The vehicles pass a native village before sailing into an [[ambush]] by natives wielding spears, the sound effects for which are usually provided by the skipper.

The boats now pass behind Schweitzer Falls (referred to as "the Backside of Water") to enter the [[Amazon River]]. Skeletal animal remains and warning signs featuring pictures of dagger-toothed fish forewarn the next show scene, where the boats encounter a swarm of leaping [[piranha]].  The guests then pass a couple of [[Bubalus|water buffalo]] and a [[boa constrictor]] before they meet [[shrunken head]] dealer Trader Sam ("He'll trade you two of his heads for just one of yours") before returning to the dock.

===Major changes===
{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}

* 1957 - Addition of rainforest, pair of menacing gorillas, native war party and dancing natives. Trader Sam begins offering his "... two for one deal."
* 1961 - Original two-story boathouse removed; open waterway between Jungle Cruise and Rivers of America filled in to create space for the [[Swiss Family Treehouse]] walk-through attraction (now [[Tarzan's Treehouse]].)
* 1962 - A $7 million enhancement of Adventureland includes the addition of the Indian elephant pool and temple of Ganesha/lost       city/[[Cambodia]]n ruins scenes along the Jungle Cruise.
* 1963 - African elephants re-positioned on the Nile river section; removal of two original lions and pair of 'charging' rhinos.
* 1964 - African Veldt  and Trapped Safari scenes.
* 1976 - Addition and enhancement of several scenes: crocodiles snapping at hornbill, Indo-Chinese tiger and cobras added to Cambodian ruins, safari camp overrun by gorillas, gorilla battling crocodile, baboons on termite mounds,  lions feasting on zebra moved into new rock outcropping/den, python threatening water buffalo calf replacing gorillas threatening from the river banks.
* 1993 - Boats repainted and "weathered" in anticipation of Indiana Jones Adventure
* 1994 - Addition of new two-story [[boathouse]] queue; attraction re-themed to take place in June 1938 to coincide with the construction of [[Indiana Jones Adventure]]. 
* 1997 - Replacement of the original ride boats with slightly longer models with increased capacity.
* 2005 - Various replacements and reconstructions including complete replacement of Schweitzer Falls; addition of piranhas; updates to safari jeep camp scene including 'exploding' gasoline drums
* 2010 - After 55 years of growth and care, Disneyland's man-made jungle is declared "real" and complete with its own ecosystem.
* 2013 - During the Holiday season, the Jungle Cruise turned into the "Jingle Cruise," a new Christmas overlay. This did not see many changes to the jungle itself (other than the skippers using a holiday-themed script), but the boathouse was decorated and the boats were renamed temporarily and covered in [[Christmas lights]].
* 2014 - The holiday "Jingle Cruise" overlay is redone and is a dramatic departure from the previous year. This time, there is very little decoration on the boats and in the boathouse itself, but instead the various show scenes out in the jungle are covered in [[Christmas]] and [[Hanukkah]] decorations. The skippers are given another new script, one that reflects the various holiday-themed show scenes the boat sails through. The Jingle Cruise is also given a new story: A shipment of holiday supplies intended for the skippers crash-landed in the jungle instead, and the skippers are taking their passengers out to go find the decorations. The boats are also given new holiday names, different from the ones used the year before. 
* 2015 - The "Jingle Cruise" overlay from 2014 was reused for the 2015 holiday season, using the 2014 script, boat names, and show scenes. There was one new scene added, involving giant snowmen and snowflakes on the termite mounds by the African Veldt. 
* 2016 - A four-month refurbishment lasting from January until May included a new dock designed to stabilize the boats while loading and unloading, as well as some mechanical animal repairs, replacement of the on-ride audio systems, and tree replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eades|first1=Mark|title=Jungle Cruise reopens with a brand-new dock at Disneyland|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/new-715078-dock-tree.html|accessdate=7 May 2016|newspaper=The Orange County Register|date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Description of specific changes:
The baboons at the safari jeep camp previously sat on the African termite mounds. A total of six lions have been removed since opening day: one that growled when the African Veldt was added, two lionesses from the Veldt that were fighting over a bloody strand of zebra meat, a lion and a lioness that each had a zebra leg in their mouth, and a dead lion hanging on a [[rotisserie|spit]] over a fire in the native village. Also removed from the Veldt were jackals barking at the pride.

===Boats===
There are 12 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time. The boats in 1955 were painted as clean, idealized replicas, but have since been given a more realistic theming reflecting the grunge and wear of actual watercraft due to the addition of [[Indiana Jones Adventure]] and its ruggedness.

==Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland==
[[File:Jungle Cruise entrance at Tokyo Disneyland.jpg|thumb|Jungle Cruise at Tokyo Disneyland]]

===Attraction summary===
The skipper introduces himself or herself, and begins to take the boat full of guests down the tropical rivers of the world. The ride starts out in the Amazon River, where the passengers encounter butterflies with one-foot wingspans, or as the skipper might say, twelve inches. The boat then passes Inspiration Falls, which transitions into the [[Congo River]] in Africa.

The skipper explains that there is a pygmy welcoming party waiting for them, but when the boat arrives at the beach, the canoes are empty, and the place deserted. The skipper wonders what scared off the pygmies, and they soon discover that it was a giant python. The boat then passes a camp that has been raided by gorillas, which transitions the cruise into the Nile River.

After encountering two elephants, the boat passes along the African Veldt, where numerous African animals watch a pride of lions eat their kill. The boat then passes a lost safari group that has been chased up a pole by an angry rhinoceros and are now trapped. The group then passes by another waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls) and heads past the remains of a plane crash.  The boat then encounters a pool of [[hippopotamus|hippos]], about to charge the boat until the skipper scares them off. Ominous drums are heard as the group enters headhunter territory. Natives are seen dancing near the boat and guests soon find themselves in an ambush. They escape and proceed into the [[Mekong River]].

They enter a temple which has been destroyed by an earthquake. Inside, baboons, cobras, giant spiders and a tiger can be found. After they exit, they come across an elephant bathing pool where numerous elephants are relaxing in the water. The boat narrowly avoids being sprayed by water from one of the elephants. The cruise concludes after passing Chief Nami, the head salesman of the jungle, who offers two shrunken heads for one of the passengers'.

===Magic Kingdom===
[[File:Magic Kingdom63.jpg|thumb|A baby elephant has a shower in the elephant bathing pool scene.]]
The Walt Disney World Jungle Cruise is set as a depression era British outpost on the Amazon River, operated by the fictional company, The Jungle Navigation Co., whose advertisement poster is painted on the wall near the exit of the attraction. [[Albert Awol]]'s broadcast is different from that of Disneyland's, being ride specific. Also unlike Disneyland, the queue never extended to a second level.

Near the Hippo Pool, a piece of a downed airplane can be seen along the shoreline. This is the back half of the [[Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior]] found at [[The Great Movie Ride]] at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in the [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] scene.
 
Each variety of plant throughout the attraction was carefully selected by landscape architect Bill Evans to ensure that the foliage would be able to endure Florida's unique climate: hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most difficult aspect of this was making sure these plants had the appropriate look and feel of traditional tropical plants in the equatorial jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyreporter.110mb.com/disneyreporter/transporter/wdw/mk/al/jc.htm |title=110mb.com - Want to start a website? |publisher=Disneyreporter.110mb.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Holiday overlay, Jingle Cruise, runs during the Holiday season at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. This started in the Holiday season of 2013.

A Jungle Cruise themed restaurant, the Skipper Canteen, opened in December 2015 and expanded on the Jungle Navigation Co. storyline, making Dr. Albert Falls into the founder of the company in 1911, with his granddaughter Alberta Falls taking charge of the Navigation Company and the Jungle Cruise in the 1930s.

====Queue====
The queue of the Jungle Cruise is heavily themed with period artifacts, tools, gear, photos and more. It is intended to resemble an outpost where an exploration of the jungle rivers may be booked. It is divided into four main sections which may be opened or closed in sequence to accommodate crowd fluctuation. The queue was designed to wind about extensively so that guests may see all of the different artifacts in the queue. The most notable section of the queue is the office of Albert Awol.

====Boats====
There are 15 vehicles, with a maximum of 10 in operation at any given time.

===Tokyo Disneyland===
The Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland attractions are very similar to each other, with the exception of a few minor differences. While the boats in the Magic Kingdom's attraction travel counter-clockwise, the boats at Tokyo Disneyland travel in a clockwise direction.

In Tokyo Disneyland, the station and surrounding area are themed to a more upscale African city, as opposed to an isolated jungle outpost. This version shares a station building with the park's [[steam train]] ride, [[Western River Railroad]]. The spiels in Tokyo Disneyland are delivered in Japanese.

====Boats====
There are 13 vehicles, with a maximum of 12 in operation at any given time.

All boat names, except Orinoco Ida, are [[alliteration]]s.

==Disneyland Paris==
[[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Paris]] does not have any Jungle Cruise attraction, due to the cold temperature and weather of northern France. Because many copies of the original Jungle Cruise attractions exist in other French theme parks, French guests might be used to the experience and not find it exciting. An indoor [[jeep]] ride called ''Jungle Expedition'' was originally planned at the opening of the park, but was cancelled due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disneyland-tour.com/ALYE/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=167|title=Disneyland Paris Tour Multimedia|publisher=Disneyland-tour.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407104115/http://www.disneyland-tour.com/ALYE/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=167|archivedate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Disneyland==

The shape of Hong Kong Disneyland's route is significantly different compared to the others, and circumnavigates [[Tarzan's Treehouse]]. A grand finale is included with a battle between angry fire and water gods. Three languages are regularly available: Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Each language has a separate queue, allowing visitors to experience the journey in their preferred language.

===Attraction summary===
The queue takes place in a small boathouse of The Jungle Navigation Co. that is less elaborate than the boathouses found at the other parks. After winding through the queue, guests board one of the boats and meet their skipper who speaks either English, Cantonese, or Mandarin, to accompany the park's guests who speak many different languages themselves.

The boats then depart and head down the river, past Tarzan's Treehouse where the skipper tells guests to wave goodbye to the guests traversing the treehouse, for they will never see them again. The boats then drift past an Indian elephant and her calf playing in the water, followed by another elephant showering in a waterfall. A large bull Indian elephant emerges from the water squirting a plume of water at the boats with the guests narrowly avoiding the free shower.

The vessels then drift down a narrow stream past ancient Cambodian ruins which have been claimed by the jungle. Giant spiders and king cobras watch the boats as they move on. Up ahead several crocodiles are seen resting on a small beach, while a school of hungry piranha are jumping in the hopes of attacking the guests. The boats escape into Africa and they pass a large safari camp where several curious gorillas have discovered clothes, guns, hammocks, and books, as the "Trashing the Camp" song from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' plays on a nearby 1930s radio. The African Veldt comes into view where antelope, giraffes, zebras, and African elephants stare at the boats. The vessels then drift into a small pool where a pod of hippos try to tip the boat. Several feet ahead a rhino is seen chasing a safari group up a tree while several hyenas look on laughing.

Skulls and cloth impaled on broken bamboo sticks appears as tribal drums and horns fill the air. The skipper tells guests that they have entered head hunter country and must quietly sneak by. The boats slowly pass through the main village where several upright shields rest in the tall grass. A native notices the boats and all the shields now revealed to have head hunters behind them begin firing spears and poison darts at the boats as they narrowly escape into a rocky canyon. In the rocky canyon, the boats stop near two unusual rock formations that look like faces, revealed by the skipper to be the fire god and the water god who constantly feud over their differences. The fire god sets the river ablaze while the water god vomits a water bomb, causing the flames to die and the whole canyon to become a cloud of steam. The boats escape the canyon and pass a baby elephant before returning to the boathouse.

====Major changes====
* 2006 - Piranha Attack and Trapped Safari scenes added, enhancement of Gorilla Camp, African Veldt, and Headhunter Territory
* 2007 - Temporary scenes added during the "Pirate Takeover" summer event (from May to August); attraction name changed to "Jungle River Cruise, Pirate Takeover!"
* 2015 - Temporary scenes added during Halloween event; attraction name changed to "Jungle River Cruise - Curse of the Emerald Trinity"

* Amazon Annie
* Congo Queen (Wheelchair accessible)
* Ganges Gal (Wheelchair accessible)
* Irrawaddy Irma
* Lijiang Lady

==Albert Awol==
'''Albert Awol''' is a fictional Jungle Cruise boat captain and [[disc jockey]] for the Disney Broadcasting Company. Considered the "Voice of the Jungle", he broadcasts everything from news, to quizzes, reminders, weather, etc. on the DBC (Disney Broadcast Company). He also serves as a period disc jockey for the station, filling the airwaves with music from the 1930s [[Great Depression|Depression era]].

Albert Awol was added in 1991 to the Jungle Cruise during a refurbishment. According to one report:
{{quote|Standing in the Jungle Cruise queue was a somber affair prior to the aforementioned 1991 rehab; once guests crossed the threshold they were faced with a series of twists and turns that led past bare walls, their fellow guests and occasional glimpses of the river. There was no background music at that time either, so if the queue was full it promised a fair amount of shuffling drudgery. Of course DL's Jungle Cruise queue is now closer to the full embodiment of how cool a ride's waiting space can be, but Florida's 1991 upgrade did include queue music interspersed with radio commentary by Albert AWOL, "the voice of the jungle". A considerable array of visual enhancements were also made at that same time, from a series of new destination-based wall murals to the artifact-laden "office" in the center of the queue.&lt;ref name="omniluxe.net"/&gt;}}

Albert's broadcast is projected not just over the Jungle Cruise queuing area, but over [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]] as a whole, setting the time period. In Disneyland, Albert is replaced by "Jungle Radio."  Various air personalities comment on the environment, the luminaries who are in the area (including references to the designers of the attraction - Harper Goff, [[Bob Mattey]], Winston Hibler [True-Life Adventure films, upon which Jungle Cruise is based]).  The music is a good deal slower in pace and tempo than the tracks used at Walt Disney World. The music was previously linked with the outdoor speakers at the Temple of the Forbidden Eye (Indiana Jones Adventure), however, two separate tracks of material with similar tone and some songs now exist. The Jungle Radio at Disneyland does connect the setting with the nearby Indiana Jones attraction, and ties in announcements that reference Indiana Jones, and the temple in which the ride is set.&lt;ref&gt;b Minnick, Nathaniel. "Disney's Lands in the History of Colonial Displays of the Exotic" (University of Michigan, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jingle Cruise==
Since 2013, a Christmas overlay called Jingle Cruise has run during the holiday season in the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland versions of the Jungle Cruise except for 2017 at Disneyland in which the overlay was not installed.

==Redesign==
In April 2017, it was reported that the ride will undergo extensive planning to change the ride. The updated re-engineering and redesign has extended to the future-star of the film adaptation [[Dwayne Johnson]], and his film production company. Johnson is working with Disney to implement the changes for [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] locations worldwide.

==In popular culture==
*There was a tribute to the ride in 2005 on an episode of the podcast [[The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd]], as well as a [[Strong Bad]] E-mail titled "theme park".
*In the sing along songs video [[Disney Sing Along Songs#Disneyland Fun|Disneyland Fun]] during "Following the Leader", Jungle Cruise made an appearance.
*Jungle Cruise was parodied as ''Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari'' on ''[[The Lion King]]'' Special Edition (as their Nighttime Safari Boat Tour).
*A stand up comedy show featuring only Jungle Cruise skippers, called The Skipper Stand Up Show, has been doing shows in Fullerton, California since May 2006.
*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] wrote and recorded a song titled "Skipper Dan" about a failed actor who ended up as a guide on the Jungle Cruise. The song is included on his 2009 digital ''[[Internet Leaks]]'' EP and his 2011 album, ''[[Alpocalypse]]''.
*The cruise boat and the "River Expedition Company" boathouse were incorporated into an original painting and limited edition print offering by artist [[Randy Souders]] titled "Jungle Cruise", created for the 1999 Official Disneyana Convention at [[Disneyland]].

===Soundtrack===
A studio recorded soundtrack of the ''Jungle Cruise'' was released in 1968 by Disneyland Records included as the [[B side]] of the album ''Walt Disney Presents The Enchanted Tiki Room and the Adventurous Jungle Cruise'' (ST-3966).  The Jungle Cruise attraction has always featured narration by a live Disney Cast Member; for the release the narration was provided by [[Thurl Ravenscroft]].  This soundtrack was also used in Disneyland television features as early as 1964.

===Film adaptation===
{{Main|Jungle Cruise (film)}}
For years, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] had been toying with the idea of turning the ''Jungle Cruise'' into a full-length action adventure motion picture, which it would be loosely inspired by the [[theme park]] attraction of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Collura |title= Disney Rides Again! |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/764/764776p1.html |work=[[IGN]] |date=2007-02-14 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, originally scheduled for release in 2007, experienced various delays and changes.  Shooting of the film, originally scheduled for 2006, was postponed.  Moreover, the original [[screenplay]] by Josh Goldstein and John Norville was reportedly rewritten by [[Al Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/intheaters.html |title=Coming to Theaters: New and Upcoming Films from Walt Disney Pictures |accessdate=2007-03-22 |year=2007 |work=Ultimatedisney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film plot follows a group's riverboat journey through a jungle in search of a cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/moviedetail/Jungle_Cruise/3461978 |title=Jungle Cruise |accessdate=2007-03-22 |work=Hollywood.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212181013/http://www.hollywood.com/moviedetail/Jungle_Cruise/3461978|archivedate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially announced to star ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' duo [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=John |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/02/jungle-cruise-tom-hanks-tim-allen/ |title=Disney pairing Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for 'Jungle Cruise' |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new iteration of the project is moving forward with [[Dwayne Johnson]] starring.

The '''Kiel Society for Film Music Research''' was founded by a group of [[Musicology|musicologists]] and film and media scholars in 2006 at Kiel University in [[Germany]].

As an academic society the members organize annual national meetings as well as international conferences mainly on specific topics such as [[Jazz]] in Film (2011), [[Silent film|Silent Film]] Sound (2013), and Music in TV Series (2015).

The society also publishes an open-access online journal entitled [http://www.filmmusik.uni-kiel.de/beitraege.php ''Kieler Beiträge zur Filmmusikforschung''] which includes twelve issues to date (2015). On occasion, articles from specialized conferences are published as proceedings. The Kiel Society for Film Music Research is a renowned institution in German-speaking countries that is promoting the research of [[film music]] issues at its conferences and stimulates the dialogue among practitioners from the realms of [[music]] and [[Film|cinema]].

'''Leonard Harrison Aleshire''' (April 27, 1890 &amp;ndash; October 15, 1987) was a versatile [[United States|American]] [[vaudeville]] and later [[country music]] performer from the 1920s into the 1960s.  A singer, dancer and songwriter, he was also half of a musical comedy duo, '''Lennie and Goo Goo''', with Floyd Rutledge. The pair appeared on local and national radio and television programs originating from [[Springfield, Missouri]] during the 1940s and 50s.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Lennie Aleshire was born April 27, 1890 in [[Christian County, Missouri]], just south of [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]. He was playing the fiddle by age six and learned the guitar, banjo and other instruments by ear. At 15, he lived with the [[Creek (American Indians)|Creek Indians]] near Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, though his mother was half [[Cherokee]]. After his parents died, he lived with his brother and sister near [[Dadeville, Missouri|Dadeville]]. Aleshire and his brother John played the [[fiddle]]; their sister Linda played guitar. The Aleshire Trio staged their first vaudeville shows at a local silent movie theater with Aleshire sometimes performing in blackface.&lt;ref name="Lennie Aleshire"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=11034 | title = Lennie Aleshire | publisher = Hillbilly Music.com | author =  | date = | accessdate = 2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Aleshire was drafted for service in [[World War I]], but was excused because he had lost three fingers on his left hand in a [[sawmill]] accident, which led to his nickname, the One Finger Fiddler. He worked for a Kansas City saddlery, a railroad, and played professional baseball for three seasons; but returned to vaudeville, writing the song "Nixa Fling" after working as a boiler engineer at a [[Nixa, Missouri]] cheese factory in 1926, the same year he met his wife, Mae.&lt;ref name="Lennie Aleshire"/&gt;

Aleshire had a varied vaudeville career: he joined McMae Hill, and the troupe of magician and ventriloquist Professor Sage; and spent two years with the Cauble Brothers Circus traveling through the Midwest. He also appeared with Argentinean magician Dawes the Great, performed as a tap dancer, and toured Oklahoma with saxophonist Roy Wrightsman.&lt;ref name="Lennie Aleshire"/&gt;

===Lennie and Goo Goo===
Aleshire first teamed up with his boyhood friend from Springfield, Floyd Rutledge, in the early 1920s. They developed a [[hillbilly]] musical comedy routine, playing traditional as well their homemade instruments which included [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]] strapped to their shoes. The pair toured with the [[Orpheum Circuit]] and played at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Jonas 2008"&gt;{{citation|first=Loyal|last=Jonas|title=Country Music Humorists and Comedians|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2008|isbn=0-252-03369-8}}, p. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; Aleshire also worked the Bert Levy West Coast vaudeville circuit. In 1928, they joined The Weaver Brothers and Elviry act, based in Springfield, and eventually became known as Lennie and Goo Goo. Aleshire served as straight man for Rutledge's slow-witted Goo Goo.

Aleshire was also a songwriter; his tune "Iva Waltz" was named for his daughter.  His "My Old Saddle Pal" was sung by [[Gene Autry]] in his 1936 film, ''The Singing Cowboy.'' Aleshire also wrote "Sleepy Time Waltz", "Ozark Waltz", "Blackberry Jam" and "Ukulele Melody". In 1939 he co-wrote "Prairie Reveries" with Buddy Starcher.[[File:Lennie and Goo Goo.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Aleshire (right) with Floyd Rutledge as Lennie and Goo Goo on ''Ozark Jubilee,'' 1955]]

In 1937, Aleshire joined [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA-AM]]'s ''Mountaineer Jamboree'' in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] and worked with banjo player Dale Parker as part of the Rhythm Rangers for about a year. He later worked at [[WLW (AM)|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; and in 1939 at [[WMMN (AM)|WMMN-AM]] in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]], where he and Rutledge became close friends with [[Grandpa Jones|Louis "Grandpa" Jones]]. Jones formed an act called Grandpa Jones and his Grandsons consisting of Aleshire, Loren Bledsoe and Harold Rensler.&lt;ref name="Tribe1996"&gt;{{citation|first=Ivan M.|last=Tribe|title=Mountaineer Jamboree: Country Music in West Virginia|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1996|isbn=0-8131-0878-0}}, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Aleshire and Rutledge introduced Jones and Ramona Riggins to cowbells, which they adopted.&lt;ref name="Jonas 2008"/&gt;

The duo returned to Springfield in the early 1940s and appeared on [[KSGF (AM)|KGBX-AM]], and Aleshire toured with Jones. In August 1944, Aleshire, Rutledge and Parker joined [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO-AM]] in Springfield and were featured on ''Korn's-A-Krackin''', carried nationally by [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual Radio]], and other shows. When [[KYTV (TV)|KYTV-TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' moved to ABC in 1955, Aleshire and Rutledge went along as Lennie and Goo Goo and were mainstays on the program for more than five years.

In 1955, [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]] released "Ridin' The Fiddle" featuring Aleshire and Parker with King Ganam and His Sons of the West.

When ''Ozark Jubilee'' was canceled in 1960 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA''), Aleshire and Rutledge retired in Springfield but continued to perform; Aleshire also worked as an expert piano tuner and Rutledge, who years earlier had briefly been a local policeman, was a taxi driver&lt;ref name="Jonas 2008"/&gt; (he died at age 64 in 1970). Aleshire and wife Mae had one son, Kenneth Chessnut; and daughter Iva.

Aleshire died in Springfield, Missouri on October 15, 1987 at age 97 and was interred in Palmetto Cemetery in [[Greene County, Missouri|Greene County]]. His widow, Mae, died September 7, 1996.

Several of Aleshire's and Rutledge's homemade instruments are displayed at the [[Ralph D. Foster|Ralph Foster]] Museum at the [[College of the Ozarks]] in [[Point Lookout, Missouri]] near [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]].

{{Video Games}}
&lt;!--{{Video Games}}--&gt;
A [[video game genre]] is a specific category of games related by similar gameplay characteristics. Genres are not usually defined by the actual content of the game or its medium of play, but by its common challenge.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s1"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 § 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called ''subgenres''. For example, an [[action game]] can be classified into many subgenres such as [[platform game]]s and [[fighting game]]s. Some games, most notably [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game|mobile]] games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 § 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.

== Action ==
{{Main|Action game}}Action games emphasize physical challenges that require [[Hand-eye coordination]] and [[motor skill]] to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.

Action games are classified by many subgenres. [[Platform games]] and [[fighting games]] are among the best-known subgenres, while [[shooter games]] became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="adams2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wolf|2012|p=572}} Action games usually involve elements of [[twitch gameplay]].&lt;ref name="adams2014" /&gt;

=== Platform games ===
{{Main|Platform game}}
[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Platform games are set in an environment with platforms, hence the name ''platform game''.]]
Platform games (or ''platformers'') have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2" /&gt; Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.

''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term ''climbing game'' at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the best-selling games of all time; more than 40 million copies were sold (excluding [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Virtual Console]] sales).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |title=Mario Sales Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jumping Flash!]]'' was the first console platformer to incorporate 3D graphics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-platformer-in-true-3d&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shooter games ===
{{main|Shooter game}}
[[File:Freedoom 0.9 MAP07.png|thumb|This picture shows gameplay of a freely licensed version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', a highly influential first-person shooter.]]
In shooter games (or simply ''shooters''), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2" /&gt; Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as ''[[Splatoon]]'', have non-violent objectives.

Shooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. [[First-person shooter]]s are played within the [[protagonist]]'s perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current [[Health (gaming)|health]] of the protagonist.{{sfn|Call|Whitlock|Voorhees|2012|p=5}}&lt;ref name="adams2015p39"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|2015|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[third-person shooter]]s, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance.&lt;ref name="adams2015p39" /&gt; Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2" /&gt;

[[Hero shooter]]s are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage cooperative play between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other activated abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Such games are inspired by [[multiplayer online battle arena]] games like ''[[Dota 2]]'' and ''[[League of Legends]]'', and popular team-based shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Examples of hero shooters include ''[[Gigantic (video game)|Gigantic]]'', ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', and ''[[Paladins: Champions of the Realm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php | title = Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = May 6, 2016 | accessdate = May 6, 2016 | first = Alex | last = Wawro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Light gun shooter]]s are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name "light gun". The technology has been used as early as the 1920s for shooter games, although electronic video gaming did not exist at that time.

[[File:Gunroar - end of boss.jpg|thumb|This picture shows gameplay of a shoot 'em up.]]
[[Shoot 'em ups]] pit players, who are usually piloting some form of flying vehicle, or flying by some other means, against large waves of opponents; the player is continuously moving and must attack and avoid opponent's attacks as well as obstacles.&lt;ref name="rogers2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, shooters, most notably first-person shooters, have become widely successful in video gaming, accounting for a large percentage of video game sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konnikova|first1=Maria|title=Why Gamers Can’t Stop Playing First-Person Shooters|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-gamers-cant-stop-playing-first-person-shooters|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', created by [[Id Software]] and released in 1992, was credited for pioneering gameplay and graphics elements incorporated by many other shooters.&lt;ref name="bartonloguidice5"&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|Loguidice|2009|loc=ch. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also developed by Id and published one year after Wolfenstein 3D's release, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' is broadly considered to be one of the most influential games in video gaming history.&lt;ref name="bartonloguidice5" /&gt; Other successful shooter series include ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'', a widely acclaimed and commercially successful series noted for its influence on contemporary shooters; and the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' franchise, with more than 175 million sales across all its titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/call-of-duty-franchise-surpasses-175-million-copies-sold-3414623 |title=Call of Duty franchise surpasses 175 million copies sold |publisher=Gamezone |date= April 2015|accessdate=May 5, 2015 |location=America |first=Matt |last=Liebl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fighting games ===
{{Main|Fighting game}}
Fighting games center around close-ranged combat typically one on one fights or against a small number of equally powerful opponents, often involving violent and exaggerated unarmed attacks. Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat,&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2" /&gt; some fighting games such as [[Soulcalibur]] and [[Samurai Shodown]] center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various [[martial arts]] systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as Injustice, Dragonball FighterZ and Super Smash Bros dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=Of Fists and Fatalities: The history of fighting games|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=14 November 2015|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beat 'em up games ===
{{Main|Beat 'em up}}
[[Beat 'em ups]] (or ''brawlers'') are a related, but distinct genre to fighting games. While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few.&lt;ref name="adams2013-c3s2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rogers2014" /&gt; Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be co-operative rather than competitive. Beat 'em ups saw a sudden decline in popularity in the early 90's with the release of fighting games, but 3D beat 'em ups have kept the genre alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Spanner|title=The Tao of Beat-'em-ups • Page 3|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_taoofbeatemups_pt2_retro?page=3|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=14 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack and Slash is a sub-genre often used to refer to weapons based beat 'em ups.

=== Stealth game ===
{{main|Stealth game}}
These games tend to emphasize subterfuge and precision strikes over the more overt mayhem of shooters, for example, the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, and the ''[[Sly Cooper]]'' series. In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as ''[[Dishonored]]'', the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]]'' has an entire perk tree dedicated to "Sneaking", but there few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}

=== Survival games ===
{{main|Survival game}}
[[Survival game]]s start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.

A [[battle royale game]] is a video game genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a [[survival game]] with [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games are ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' and ''[[Fortnite]]''.

=== Rhythm games ===
{{main|Rhythm game}}
'''Rhythm game'''&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;'''rhythm action'''&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;genre&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;[[Music video game|music-themed]]&amp;nbsp;[[Action game|action video game]]&amp;nbsp;that challenges a player's sense of rhythm.&amp;nbsp;The genre includes dance games such as&amp;nbsp;''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''&amp;nbsp;and music-based games such as&amp;nbsp;''[[Donkey Konga]]''&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.

''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''&amp;nbsp;has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include [[Dance Dance Revolution]], [[Maimai (video game)|Maimai]], [[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA|Project Diva]], [[Cytus]], [[Love Live! School Idol Festival|Love Live: School Idol Festival]], [[The Idolmaster]], [[osu!]], [[Taiko no Tatsujin]], [[Crypt of the Necrodancer]], etc.

== Action-adventure ==
{{main|Action-adventure game}}

[[Action-adventure game]]s combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. "Action-adventure" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre.

The first action-adventure game was the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1979). It was directly inspired by the original [[text adventure]], ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer [[Warren Robinett]] created a new genre. Another typical Action-Adventure game is "The Legend of Zelda" by Nintendo, which involves puzzle solving, sword fighting, and item collecting. Because of their prevalence on [[video game console]]s and the absence of typical [[adventure game]]s, action-adventure games are often called "adventure games" by modern gamers.

=== Survival horror ===
[[Survival horror]] games focus on fear and attempt to scare the player via traditional [[horror fiction]] elements such as atmospherics, [[death]], the [[undead]], [[blood]] and gore. One crucial [[gameplay]] element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable [[melee weapons]]. Notable examples include [[Silent Hill]] and [[Resident Evil]].

=== Metroidvania ===
[[Metroidvania]] games (named after its two first well-known franchises, [[Metroid]] and [[Castlevania]]) feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

== Adventure ==
{{main|Adventure game}}

[[Adventure game]]s were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply "Adventure," and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.

Unlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a "purist" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a [[mini game]].

Because they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of ''[[Myst]]'', the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point.&lt;ref name="best-selling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' to declare that the gaming industry had matured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of ''Myst'' also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of ''Myst'' nor of earlier personality-driven adventures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|title=Bring Out Your Dead! Can Nintendo Breathe New Life into Adventure Games? |last=Nixon|first=Scott|date=2007-02-05|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, run by Doublefine Studios, also spoke to the continued interest in Adventure games. The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.

=== Text adventures ===

The earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as [[interactive fiction]]. Games such as the popular ''[[Zork]]'' series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as "get rope" or "go west" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into [[text parser|parsing]] the player's text input.

=== Graphic adventures ===

[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]
[[Graphic adventure game]]s emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of [[computer mouse|mice]] led to the "[[point-and-click]]" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand [[icon (computing)|icon]] and then on a rope to pick up the rope.

=== Visual novels ===
{{main|visual novel}}

A {{Nihongo|[[visual novel]]|ビジュアルノベル|bijuaru noberu}} is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with [[anime]]-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including [[bishōjo game]]s. Visual novels are especially prevalent in [[Japan]], where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510 |title=AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes [[Porting|ported]] to systems such as the [[Dreamcast]] or the [[PlayStation 2]]. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the [[Nintendo DS]], for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series.

=== Interactive movie ===

The [[interactive movie]] genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed [[full motion video|full-motion]] [[cartoon]]s or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the [[game designer|designers]] intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]], FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' games and the more recent ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)]]'',&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3143998 |title=Indigo Prophecy–Developer's Diary |publisher=1UP |date=2005-09-22 |author=Cage, David |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025716/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3143998 |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game [[cut scene]]s, in the form of [[Quick Time Event]]s, to keep the player alert. Games like ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.

=== Real-time 3D adventures ===

Around this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included ''[[Nightfall (video game)|Nightfall]]'' in 1998, ''[[Shenmue]]'' in 1999, ''[[Myst|realMyst]]'' in 2000, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.

== Role-playing ==
{{main|Role-playing video game}}
{{see also|History of role-playing video games}}
[[File:KQ-hitpoints.png|thumb|right|''KQ'' is a role-playing game]]

[[Role-playing video game]]s draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more "adventurers" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or casting [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an [[overworld]], usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable [[home computer]]s coincided with the popularity of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]] role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of [[experience point]]s, have been widely adapted to other genres such as [[action-adventure game]]s. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were [[turn-based game]]s, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the [[strategy game]]'s trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of [[Square Co.|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time role-playing games such as the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], ''[[Soul Blazer]]'' and ''[[Ultima VII]]''. Some throwbacks to older turn-based system did exist such as the [[Golden Sun (series)|''Golden Sun'']] series for [[Game Boy Advance]].

=== Action RPG ===

The [[action role-playing game]] or action RPG is a type of [[role-playing video game]] which incorporates elements from [[action game]]s or [[action-adventure game]]s. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by [[Nihon Falcom]] in the 1980s, such as the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] and [[Ys (video game series)|''Ys'' series]]. Later so-called "''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' clones" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&amp;ID=1007 |title=The Action RPG Revolution |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Turner |first=Brian |date=2004-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101204302/http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&amp;ID=1007 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the "action") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.

=== MMORPG ===
[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, [[graphical game|graphical]] variant of text-based [[MUD]]s, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's [[player character]], but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]'', remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular "pay-to-play" game being ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and the most popular "[[free-to-play]]" games including ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[TERA (video game)|TERA]]'', yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game ''[[EVE Online]]'' being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include [[Second Life]] and [[Ingress (game)|Ingress]].

=== Roguelikes ===
[[File:Nethack screenshot.png|thumbnail|left|''[[Nethack]]'' is a roguelike game.  The text display seen here is common in games in the roguelike genre.]]
The [[roguelike]] video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]''. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional [[dungeon crawl]] with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations, for example: Pixel Dungeon on PC, Android and iOS.

=== Tactical RPG ===
The [[tactical role-playing game]] subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from [[strategy video game|strategy games]] as an alternative to traditional RPG systems.&lt;ref name="EATRPG"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |title=What is Tactics? |publisher=Electronic Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid.&lt;ref name="EATRPG"/&gt; The genre has its origins in [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.

=== Sandbox RPG ===
Sandbox RPG or [[Open world|Open World RPG]] allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series by [[Nihon Falcom]], the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Zelda II]]'' by [[Nintendo]], ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' by [[Interplay Entertainment]], the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' and ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series by [[Squaresoft]], ''[[System Shock 2]]'' by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]], ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' by [[Ion Storm]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]], ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' by [[Lionhead Studios]], the [[Gothic series|''Gothic'' series]] by [[Piranha Bytes]], and the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xenoblade]]'' series by [[Monolith Soft]].

===First-person party-based RPG===
[[File:DOTGv0.31screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Damnation of Gods'', a ''Dungeon Master'' clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective.]]
Also known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned ''Wizardry'', ''Might and Magic'' and ''Bard's Tale'' series; as well as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Elminage]]'' series. Games of this type are also known as "blobbers", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or "blob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |title=The RPGs of 2017 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=December 5, 2016 |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |title=CRPG History Abridged - 21 RPGs that brought something new to the table |last=Pepe |first=Felipe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM |access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most "blobbers" are turn-based, but some titles such as the ''Dungeon Master'', ''[[Legend of Grimrock]]'' and ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an [[automap]] feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Cultural differences ===
RPGs tend towards two sets of characteristics, sometimes referred to as [[History of Western role-playing video games|Western]] and [[History of Eastern role-playing video games|Japanese RPG]] (also referred to as "WRPG" or "JRPG"). The first ("WRPG") often involves the player creating a character and a [[non-linear]] storyline along which the player makes his own decisions. In the second type ("JRPG"), the player controls a party of predefined characters through a dramatically scripted [[linear]] storyline (though there are JRPGs such as ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' which contain action elements and sandbox environments). There are described advantages to—and dedicated fans of—each system, including fans of Western RPG in East Asia and Japanese RPG in Europe/North America. Western RPG include the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'']] series and ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' series, while Japanese RPG include the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series and [[Dragon Quest (series)|''Dragon Quest'' series]].

=== Choices ===
{{See also|Nonlinear gameplay in role-playing games|Nonlinear narrative in video games|Action role-playing game#Choices and consequences}}
Some RPG give the player several choices in how their story will unfold. Typically the player can have an effect on whether the enemies in the game will be taken out lethally or non-lethally. This is very popular because it makes the player have to deal with the consequences of their own choices whenever they fail to save someone or don't get the ending they desired, for example. This makes for a much more interactive experience between gamers and gameplay, also explaining their popularity. Some notable examples include the ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]] series'', ''[[Megami Tensei]]'', ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series.

=== Fantasy ===
Due to RPG origins with ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and other pen and paper role-playing games, the most popular setting for RPG by far is a [[fantasy world]], usually with heavy medieval [[high fantasy]] influences, with series such as ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' and ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' sharing a basic [[fantasy]] setting. However, numerous exceptions exist, with some notable examples including the [[East Asia]]n settings of ''[[Far East of Eden]]'' and ''[[Jade Empire]]'', the [[steampunk]] settings of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Grandia (series)|Grandia]]'', the [[science fiction]] settings of ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect]]'', the [[retro-futurism|retro-futuristic]] setting of ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', and the [[contemporary]] settings of ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]'', ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' and ''[[Alpha Protocol]]''.

== Simulation ==
{{main|Simulation video game}}

[[Simulation video game]]s is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.

=== Construction and management simulation ===
{{main|Construction and management simulation}}
[[File:Lincity-ng.png|thumb|A sample city from ''[[Lincity|Lincity NG]]'']]
[[Construction and management simulation]]s (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.

In [[city-building game]]s the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is ''[[SimCity]]'', which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. ''SimCity'', however, also belongs to the ''God Games'' genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. [[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]] was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.

[[Business simulation game]]s generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.

A [[government simulation game]] (or "political game") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker "[[serious game]]".

=== Life simulation ===
{{main|Life simulation game}}

[[Life simulation game]]s (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.

Biological simulations may allow the player to experiment with [[genetics]], [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] or [[ecosystem]]s, often in the form of an [[Serious game|educational package]]. An early example is ''[[SimLife]]'', while relatively recent ones are ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. In other educational simulations such as ''[[Wolf (game)|Wolf]]'', the player "lives the life" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.

Unlike other genres of games, [[god game]]s often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.

[[Pet-raising simulation]]s (or [[digital pet]]s) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of [[virtual pets]] such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'', the ''[[Petz]]'' series, and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.

[[Social simulation game]]s base their gameplay on the [[social interaction]] between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's ''[[The Sims]]''.

=== Vehicle simulation ===
{{main|Vehicle simulation game}}

[[Vehicle simulation game]]s are a genre of [[video games]] which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.&lt;ref name="Rollings1"&gt;{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=395–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FG-A-10.jpg|thumb|''[[FlightGear]]'' is a flight simulation game.]]

A [[Flight simulation#Flight Simulators at Home|flight simulation]] tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. [[Combat flight simulator]]s are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.

[[Racing game]]s typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games "tend to fall into ''organized racing'' and ''imaginary racing'' categories". Organized racing simulators attempt to "reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: [[Indycar]], [[NASCAR]], [[Formula 1]], and so on." On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve "imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments". These "imaginary" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic "racing simulation" counterparts. Rollings and Adams note that "racing games are often sold in the [[sports game|sports]] category," but "from a [[video game design|design]] standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations".&lt;ref name="Rollings1"/&gt;

[[Space flight simulator game]]s are a subgenre that involve piloting a [[spacecraft]]. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics. However, simulators of real spacecraft do exist: ''[[Orbiter (sim)|Orbiter]]'' is one example.

[[Train simulator]]s simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.

[[Vehicular combat]] or ''car combat'' games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a [[car]] or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy [[CPU]] or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like ''[[Spy Hunter]]'', ''[[RoadBlasters]]'' and ''[[Rock 'N' Roll Racing]]'', but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is ''[[Mecha]]'' combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.

== Strategy ==
{{main|Strategy video game}}

[[Strategy video game]]s focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. In most strategy video games, says Andrew Rollings, "the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command."&lt;ref name="Rollings2"&gt;{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=321–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rollings also notes that "The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games."&lt;ref name="Rollings2"/&gt; Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''' and whether the game's focus is upon '''strategy or tactics'''. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time)  with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's [[EndWar]], are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.

=== 4X game ===
[[File:Freeciv-2.1.0-beta3-sdl slack11.0.png|thumb|150px|''[[Freeciv]]'' is a 4X game.]]
{{Main|4X game}}
[[4X game|4X]] refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. A 4X game can be [[turn-based]] or [[real-time strategy|real-time]]. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history ([[Empire Earth]], Civilization, [[Golden Age of Civilizations]]) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy ([[Master of Orion]], [[Galactic Civilizations]]).

=== Artillery game ===
[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.]]
{{Main|Artillery game}}
[[Artillery game|Artillery]] is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) computer games involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of strategy game, though they have also been described as a type of "shooting game." Examples of this genre are ''[[Pocket Tanks]]'', ''[[Hogs of War]]'', ''[[Scorched 3D]]'' and the ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' series.

=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===
{{Main|Real-time strategy}}
The moniker "[[real-time strategy]]" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say "strategy games") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's ''[[Starcraft]]'' is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the [[Warcraft (series)|''Warcraft'' series]], [[Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'' series]], ''[[Dawn of War]]'', ''[[Command and Conquer]]'', and ''[[Dune II]]'' (essentially the first RTS game). Outside PC world, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are ''[[Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, but at least ''[[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]]'' is an example of such.

=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===
{{Main|Real-time tactics}}
'''Real-time tactics''' (abbreviated '''RTT'''&lt;ref name="ign-stateoftherts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=7 April 2006|accessdate=14 September 2006}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006. RTT is discussed as a new and not yet established genre from the publisher's perspective.)&lt;/ref&gt; and less commonly referred to as '''fixed-unit real-time strategy'''&lt;ref name=gspystrategy2&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Mark |title=Strategy Gaming: Part II |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategy02/ |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626061050/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategy02/ |archivedate=2008-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[video game genre|subgenre]] of [[tactical wargame]]s played in [[real-time game|real-time]] simulating the considerations and circumstances of [[operational warfare]] and [[military tactics]]. It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units&lt;ref name="ign-stateoftherts"/&gt;&lt;ref name=splanet&gt;{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''[[First Queen]]''.

=== Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) ===
{{Main|Multiplayer online battle arena}}
[[File:Vainglory Halcyon Fold map.tif|thumb|200px|''[[Vainglory (video game)|Vainglory]]'' is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.]]
[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA), also known as "action real-time strategy" (ARTS), is a genre of [[strategy video game]]s that originated as a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], in which a player controls a single character in one of two teams. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of periodically [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawned]] computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths. Player characters typically have various abilities and advantages that improve over the course of a game and that contribute to a team's overall strategy. A fusion of [[action game]]s, [[role-playing video game|role-playing games]] and [[real-time strategy games]], players usually do not construct either buildings or units. The genre gained popularity in the 2010s as a form of [[electronic sports]], encompassing games such as the ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', its [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]-developed sequel ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''.

=== Tower defense ===
{{Main|Tower defense}}
[[Tower defense]] games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or "build" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.

=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===
{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}
[[File:Battle for wesnoth version 1.12.0 screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |title=The Battle for Wesnoth |publisher=IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]], [[Advance Wars]]'' and ''[[Master of Orion]]''.

Some recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them. No definite name has been decided for this new genre, but STBS - Simultaneous Turn-based Strategy - seems to be the unofficial name. The first game of the genre was [[Combat Mission]].

=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===
{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}
The gameplay of [[turn-based tactics]] games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'', ''[[Jagged Alliance]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.

=== Wargame ===
{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}
[[Wargame (video games)|Wargames]] are a [[subgenre]] of [[strategy video game]]s that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon [[military strategy]] or [[military tactics|tactics]].

=== Grand strategy wargame ===
{{Main|Grand strategy wargame}}
A [[grand strategy wargame]] is a [[Wargaming|wargame]] that places focus on [[grand strategy]]: military [[strategy]] at the level of movement and use of an entire [[nation state]] or [[empire]]'s resources.

== Sports ==
Sports are video games that simulate [[sports]]. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.

=== Racing ===
One competes against time or opponent using some means of transportation. The most popular subgenre is [[Sim racing|racing simulators]].

=== Sports game ===
[[Sports game]]s emulate the playing of traditional physical [[sports]]. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]''). One of the best selling series in this genre is the ''[[FIFA (video game series)]]'' series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., ''[[Pong]]'') and remains popular today.

=== Competitive ===
Games that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. [[Ball Jacks]]).

=== Sports-based fighting ===

Sports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the [[Fight Night (EA video game series)|Fight Night]] and [[WWE 2K]] series.

== Other notable genres ==
[[File:Fretsonfire4.png|right|thumb|225px|left|''[[Frets on Fire]]'' is a music game.]]

=== MMO ===
{{Main|Massively multiplayer online game}}
A [[massively multiplayer online game]] (also called MMO and MMOG) is a [[multiplayer video game]] which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the [[Internet]]. Many games have at least one [[persistent world]], however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [[personal computer]], [[video game console]], or [[smartphone]]s and other mobile devices.

MMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game [[Minecraft]] which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.

=== Casual games ===
Casual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as Call of Duty and most games on a mobile platform.  This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time.  For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player.  Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back.  Designers of these games should add a lot of "juice" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.

Due to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials.  Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.

=== Party game ===
[[Party games#Party video games|Party games]] are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of [[mini-game]]s that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bash]]'', and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.

=== Programming game ===
A [[programming game]] is a [[computer game]] where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a [[computer program]] or script is written in some [[domain-specific programming language]] in order to control the actions of the characters (usually [[robot]]s, [[tank]]s or [[bacteria]], which seek to destroy each other). In ''[[SpaceChem]]'', for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.

=== Logic game ===
[[Logical video games|Logic games]] require the player to solve [[logic]] puzzles or navigate complex locations such as [[maze]]s. They are well suited to [[Casual game|casual play]], and [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching puzzle games]] are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. ''[[Tetris]]'', labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.

=== Trivia game ===
[[Trivia]] games are growing in popularity, especially on [[mobile phone]]s where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia shows such as Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? or [[Family Feud]].

=== Board game / Card game ===
Many popular [[board game]]s and [[card game]]s have computer versions. [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. [[Computer chess|Chess]], [[Draughts|Checkers]], Othello (also known as [[Reversi]]), and [[Backgammon]] have world class computer programs. [[Mah-jongg]] and related games are immensely popular in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Go (board game)|Go]] is popular in [[East Asia]], though it is infamously difficult to program a [[Computer Go|computer to play Go]] well. [[Magic: The Gathering]] has had computer versions for some time, most notably ''[[Magic: The Gathering Online]]''.

==Idle gaming==
{{Main|Incremental game}}
In an [[IGN]] article, ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |title=Inside Cookie Clicker and the Idle Game Move |last=Davis |first=Justin |publisher=IGN |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word "[[idle]]".

In early 2014, Orteil released an early version of ''Idle Game Maker'', a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |title=Idle Game Maker Documentation |publisher=Orteil.dashnet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video game genres by purpose ==

While most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself—to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.

=== Advergame ===
{{main|Advergame}}
[[Advergame]]s, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the [[Chef Boyardee]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Samsung]] brands,&lt;ref name=gamedaily&gt;[http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 Dunkin' for Advergames]&lt;/ref&gt; while the first cereal box advergame was [[Chex Quest]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | title = Ask Joystiq: Chex Quest, He-Man and broken 360 gamepads | publisher = Joystiq | author = Ross Miller | date = 2008-04-18 | accessdate = 2008-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like [[Pepsiman (video game)|Pepsiman]] for Sony PlayStation.

=== Art game ===
{{main|Art game}}
[[Art game]]s are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-[[ludology|ludological]] reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified ("modded") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as "[[videogame art]]."

=== Casual game ===
{{main|Casual game}}
[[Casual game]]s have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=GDC '08: Are casual games the future? |last=Boyes |first=Emma |date=2008-02-18 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072428/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime. There are comparatively low production and distribution costs for the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6157427.html?tag=result;title;4|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715032203/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6157427.html?tag=result;title;4|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-15|title=Casual gamer gets serious prize|last=Surette|first=Tim|date=2006-09-12|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual games typically are played on a personal computer online in web browsers, although they now are starting to become popular on game consoles. The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.

=== Christian game ===
{{main|Christian video games}}
[[Christian video games|Christian games]] attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games that neither challenge their beliefs nor offend them. Christian video games were first developed by [[Wisdom Tree]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.

=== Educational game ===
{{main|Educational game}}
[[Educational game]]s, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-[[teen]]s;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. [[Calculus]]) that teaching via a game is impractical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.

=== Esports ===
{{main|Esports}}
[[Esports|Esports]] games are [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the "hardcore" gaming audience, and are usually [[first-person shooter]] games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or [[real-time strategy]] games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or [[MOBA]]s, requiring both.

=== Exergame ===
{{main|Exergaming}}
An [[Exergaming|exergame]] ([[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of "[[exercise]]" and "[[video game|game]]") is a video game that provides exercise. "Exergames" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game ''[[Wii Fit]]'' using the [[Wii Balance Board]]) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly "exergames" are a category of "exertainment" (formed from "[[exercise]]" and "[[entertainment]]"). "Exertainment" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.

=== Personalized game ===
{{main|Personalized video game}}
[[Personalized video game|Personalized games]] are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.

=== Serious game ===
{{main|Serious game}}
[[Serious game]]s are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote "education, science, social change, health care or even the military."&lt;ref name=serious&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |title=What's wrong with serious games? |publisher=CNET |date=2006-03-23 |author=Terdiman, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from [[website]]s such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.

== Scientific studies ==

As video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.

An early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, [[Second life|Second Life]] uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2000 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |title=GDC '00: Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World |author=Rees, David |work=Gamasutra |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005902/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[University of Queensland]] study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sweetser|first=Penelope|author2=Wyeth, P. |title=GameFlow: a model for evaluating player enjoyment in games|journal=[[ACM Computers in Entertainment]]|volume=3|year=2005|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253|issue=3|doi=10.1145/1077246.1077253|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.

Statistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres. The maps reproduced some of the commonly identified genres such as first-person shooters and god games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Lewis|first=J|author2=McGuire, M. |author3=Fox, P. |title=Mapping the mental space of game genres|booktitle=ACM Sandbox|year=2007|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1274962}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Michigan State University]] study found that men have a higher preference for genres that require competition and three-dimensional navigation and manipulation than women do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Kristen|author2=Sherry, J. |title=Sex Differences in Video Game Play|journal=Communication Research|volume=31|year=2004|url=http://crx.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/5/499|issue=5|doi=10.1177/0093650204267930|pages=499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literary fiction''' is a term used in the [[Publishing|book-trade]] to distinguish [[novel]]s that are regarded as having [[artistic merit|literary merit]] from most commercial or [[genre fiction|"genre" fiction]].  All the same, a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]] publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. Furthermore, Nobel laureate [[André Gide]] stated that [[Georges Simenon]], best known as the creator of the fictional detective [[Jules Maigret]], was "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Neal Stephenson]] has suggested that, while any definition will be simplistic, there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction. On the one hand, literary authors are frequently supported by patronage, with employment at a university or a similar institution, and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics. On the other hand, Stephenson suggests, genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor ''Slashdot Interview'' from October 20, 2004 with Neal Stephenson]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the distinction is becoming blurred with major writers of literary fiction, like Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]], as well as [[Margaret Atwood]], writing science fiction.  Doris Lessing described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by American composer and writer [[Ned Rorem]] as "one of the five greatest French writers of our century". Rorem placed Simenon in the company of [[Proust]], [[André Gide|Gide]], [[Cocteau]], and [[Sartre]]. 

In an interview, [[John Updike]] lamented that "the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books, and if anybody wanted to read them, terrific, the more the merrier. ... I'm a genre writer of a sort. I write literary fiction, which is like spy fiction or chick lit".{{sfn|Grossman|2006}} Likewise, on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'', Updike argued that this term, when applied to his work, greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing, so he does not really like it. He suggested that all his works are literary, simply because "they are written in words".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 ''The Charlie Rose Show'' from June 14, 2006 with John Updike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203054558/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/356 |date=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Characteristics of literary fiction generally include one or more of the following:
*A concern with [[social commentary]], [[political criticism]], or reflection on the [[human condition]].{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}
*A focus on "introspective, in-depth character studies" of "interesting, complex and developed" characters,{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=7}} whose "inner stories" drive the plot, with detailed motivations to elicit "emotional involvement" in the reader.{{sfn|Coles|2007|p=26}}{{sfn|Coles|2009|p=8}}
*A slower pace than popular fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}} As [[Terrence Rafferty]] notes, "literary fiction, by its nature, allows itself to dawdle, to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way".{{sfn|Rafferty|2011}}
*A concern with the [[style (fiction)|style]] and complexity of the writing: Saricks describes literary fiction as "elegantly written, lyrical, and ... layered".{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=179}}
*Unlike genre fiction plot is not the central concern.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=181-182}} 
*The [[Tone (literature)|tone]] of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction.{{sfn|Saricks|2009|p=182}}

'''MTV Czech Republic''' was a 24-hour music and entertainment television channel which serves the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=1&amp;article=47523 |title=MTV Czech goes to Slovakia |date=10 February 2009 |publisher=[[C21 Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vPi0Fd70?url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp?area=1&amp;article=47523 |archivedate=1 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The channel launched on 29 November 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.tv/article/240112_MTV_Czech_to_Launch.htm | title = MTV Czech to Launch! | date = 7 August 2009 | work = [[MTV European]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204150656/http://www.mtv.tv/article/240112_MTV_Czech_to_Launch.htm|archivedate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a licensing agreement between [[MTV Networks Europe]], a subsidiary of [[MTV Networks]], owned by the current [[Viacom]] from its split of the old [[Viacom (1971-2005)|Viacom]] in 2005 and [[Central European Media Enterprises|CME]], the owner of [[Nova (Czech TV)|TV Nova]].

The channel features local advertising and sponsorship opportunities, along with subtitled or dubbed programming in the [[Czech language]]. The channel uses a similar on-air identity as other MTV channels in Europe and around the world, although it also produces some idents and graphics of its own and has won several awards. It is also one of the few widescreen MTV channels in the world.

MTV Czech broadcasts weekly on average over 100 hours of pure music content, including various blocks, making it the only MTV channel in the world to do so, alongside [[MTV Adria]]. The most music on MTV Czech is played on Saturday's, from noon (12:05 PM) till Sunday morning (09:35 AM). That is 21 hours straight of pure music content, which basically respects and reflects the original concept of MTV - a 24-hour TV channel dedicated only to music.

MTV Czech mostly plays current music videos or videos from the past few years, although occasionally it airs older videos from the early 2000s and mid to late 1990s. The oldest music videos to air on the network are "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" by [[John Lennon]] and "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Unlike most of the other music channels from MTV Networks around the world, MTV Czech usually plays music videos uncut and in full length.

==History==

* MTV Czech was launched on November 29, 2009 at 9 PM, replacing the existing feed of [[MTV Europe]] with the region.
* The channel launched with a 60&amp;nbsp;seconds countdown, playing the instrumental theme of [[We Will Rock You]] in the background.
* The first music video ever played was [[Empire State of Mind]] by [[Jay-Z]].
* During launch, MTV Czech was one of the first widescreen MTV channels in the world.
* Initially, in promotion supporting the launch and during the first months of broadcast, the original first slogan was "Já jsem MTV!" (I am MTV!).
* The channel broadcasts a range of music and popular culture programming, mainly imported from [[MTV US]], [[MTV UK]], [[VH1]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]].
* On November 8, 2010, MTV Czech started airing new channel idents and the station planned to produce and broadcast local idents of its own in the near future.
* On November 18, 2010, MTV Czech was the first station in the world to broadcast the clip for the new single "Sing" by [[My Chemical Romance]] in a 'World Exclusive' television premiere.
* On November 29, 2010, MTV Czech celebrated its first year of broadcast with special party-themed videos, which were featured in between shows and focused around a group of young people at a party, along with the moderators of MTV Czech. These videoclips continued throughout the whole week and varied each day, featuring amongst other guests also the famous Czech band Charlie Straight, who have won two EMA awards for Best Czech &amp; Slovak act.
* Since December 6, 2010, MTV Czech started broadcasting regularly short segments/fillers with the two moderators of the station - Hanka Zajíčková and Dominik Turza. These segments involved different topics each week somehow related to the programming of MTV in the Czech Republic.
* On December 17, 2010, MTV Czech [http://vimeo.com/63438548 debuted] the short film ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'' from [[Kanye West]] in a European television premiere.
* During Christmas 2010, MTV Czech used winter idents, which could be seen for example also on ''[[MTV UK]]''. In comparison with the UK feed, the idents have aired on MTV Czech in their original widescreen aspect ratio and without the channel logo present on screen.
* On January 5, 2011, MTV Czech debuted its first local show called "Backstage". The two moderators of the station - Hanka Zajíčková and Dominik Turza, take viewers behind the scenes of various concerts, parties, festivals and entertainment shows in the Czech Republic. Viewers can also look forward to interviews with popular singers and bands, not only from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but from abroad as well.
* On February 17, 2011, it was reported that Lady Gaga's video to "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" will debut on the channel on February 24 in a 'World Exclusive' television premiere, but this did not happen, as the release date was officially postponed to February 28. The video debuted on MTV Czech at 19:01CET local time, Monday, making it still the first TV channel in the world to broadcast the video because of time zone differences.
* During Spring 2011, MTV Czech used the line "On. On MTV!" in its promos as opposed to previously used "On MTV!". Adding a second "On." emphasized that the shows could be seen only on MTV.
* On March 11, 2011, MTV Czech, along with some other MTV channels around the world, debuted the music video to [[Rope]] of [[Foo Fighters]] in an exclusive premiere.
* On March 14, 2011, MTV Czech debuted a new music video from Czech band [[Charlie Straight]] in a 7-day exclusive premiere, showing support also for Czech artists.
* On May 1, 2011, MTV Czech removed the one-hour music block "MTV Basechart" from its programming, most probably due to lower ratings. This was the first and also last time the amount of music content on the channel was slightly reduced.
* Instead, later that month, MTV Czech launched two new music blocks titled "Home Sweet Home" and "In Love With MTV", which focus on music from local artists and love songs.
* On May 29 it was announced that MTV Czech will rebrand on July 1, 2011, along with other international MTV channels, adopting the US on-screen logo and new graphics.
* On June 30 the channel started using the new logo on its website and programming guide, although the structure of the website has remained the same.
* On July 1, 2011, 06:00 AM, MTV Czech rebranded and started using the new logo on-air (exactly same as in the US), along with new idents and graphics. They are a unique blend between the previous branding by Universal Everything and the current branding of MTV US by Popkern.
* On July 1, 2011, MTV Czech also changed the words used in the programme progress info bar, highlighting what the viewer is watching, from 'Right Now' to 'You're Watching', making it more simple and personal.
* The third change during the first day of rebrand was the introduction of 'SMS Live' - a service where viewers could text short messages to MTV and see them appear live on-air. It has been limited to the music blocks 'Party Zone' and 'In Love With MTV', which air regularly once a week. 'SMS Live' lasted until December 1, 2011, when it was removed.
* On July 29, 2011, MTV Czech updated its opening theme for 'MTV Menu', replacing the old MTV logo with the new one, confirming that music will remain an important part of its programming even in the future.
* On August 5, 2011, MTV Czech updated also its opening theme for 'MTV Hits', replacing the old MTV logo with the new one, confirming once again that music will remain an important part of its programming even in the future.
* On August 8, 2011, MTV Czech started airing a 1m20s long video using the song 'Youth' by MGMT, with scenes from various music videos and reality shows, to promote the youth. The end of the video features the headline ''"Youth Is Amazing"''.
* On August 9, 2011, MTV Czech updated another opening theme with the new logo, this time for the rap/r'n'b block 'Urban'. This is the third opening theme for a music block to be updated after the July rebrand. Eventually all music blocks later updated their themes with the new logo.
* On September 1, 2011, the channel updated its "Coming Up Next - Menu" bumper and started using small image slides (thumbnails) on the side to improve communication with its viewers. It was the first and only MTV channel in Europe to do so.
* In September 2011, MTV Czech premiered the new series '''[[Awkward. (TV series)|Awkward.]]''' 2 days ahead of the UK premiere on [[MTV UK]]. Apart from that, season 4 of [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]] premiered on the Czech feed 5 days prior to the European premiere on [[MTV Europe]].
* On October 1, 2011, MTV Czech started using a new, third, slogan ''"MTV - Máš To V Sobě"'' (It's in you!). The previous, second, slogan ''"MTV Jsi Ty!"'' (MTV Is You!) was used from Summer 2010 till September 30, 2011.
* In mid-October MTV Czech started using several other headlines, along with the new slogan, in short 5-second bumpers. These headlines consist of the letters of MTV:
*''Má To Vyřvaný'' (Amp It Up!)
*''Musíš To Vidět'' (You Must See This!)
*''Má To Vnady'' (It Has Bossom!)
*''Máme Tady Večírek'' (We Have A Party!)
*''Můžeš To Vyhrát'' (You Can Win This!)
* The last headline ''Můžeš To Vyhrát'' (You Can Win This!) refers to a competition launched by MTV Czech to accompany its second birthday. Viewers could send their own headlines in the upcoming four weeks. Each week a winner was picked, receiving VIP tickets to MTV's private birthday party and the option to see their headline included on-air.
* During Christmas 2011, MTV Czech celebrated the Holidays with themed programming and mainly aired music videos related to Christmas. There were also numerous TOP 10 countdowns, including 'Best of the Decade', 'Best of Urban 2011', 'Best of Europe 2011', 'Best Singer of 2011', 'Best Alternative of 2011' and more. MTV also aired several special bumpers, similar to those of 2010. The Christmas-centred programming lasted from December 24, 2011 to January 1, 2012. The oldest music video to air during the week was '''[[Last Christmas]]''' by British pop duo '''[[Wham!]]'''
* From February 9 to February 14, 2012 MTV celebrated Valentine's Day with several new bumpers depicting love between two animated characters. The idents incorporated mainly pink, purple, white and red colours.
* On February 15, 2012, MTV commemorated the death of '''[[Whitney Houston]]''' and paid tribute to the singer by airing blocks of her music videos throughout the day, a 5-minute segment about her tragic death, a special bumper and running text at the bottom of the screen, a crawler, which stated the following: ''"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Whitney Houston, who died on Saturday in Los Angeles at age of 48."''
* On March 8, 2012, MTV Czech started using short subliminal messages during broadcast as promotion for the upcoming premiere of '''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'''. These animated messages were only 1 to 3 seconds long and involved Beavis and Butt-head randomly appearing on the screen, usually beating each other. Another variant of these messages uses colourful silhouettes of their figures. These messages overlay the channel's logo and on-air graphics and have been used exclusively in the past only on [[MTV US]] throughout October 2011 to highlight the series premiere. The messages have evoked interest in viewers, causing them to discuss this curiosity online.
* On March 23, MTV Czech officially started promoting the series premiere using the same teasers that have aired in the U.S. These promos have been localized into Czech and it was the first time that MTV Czech has decided to import original MTV US promos instead of producing their own. Apart from that, 6 new bumpers to promote the series have been produced.
* On April 8, 2012, the controversial original uncut version of Michael Jackson's [[Black or White]] (without graffiti) was aired on MTV Czech at 4PM during a Michael Jackson 'Top 10' countdown. Due to the fact the channel decided to air also uncut versions of Michael Jackon's other videos, such as 'Bad' and 'Thriller', it ended up being 22 minutes behind schedule.
* On April 9, 2012, MTV Czech received a refresh and started airing a new set of idents by MTV World Design Studio/Staat/Buck - ''Group Hug'', ''Chameleon'' and ''Party Animal''.
* Caged premiered on May 14, 2012.
* In mid-June, MTV rolled out a set of new summer idents by company "123 Klan". They include similar characters, along with a tiger, that have been present in bumpers used for Valentine's Day. MTV Czech produced also several bumpers of its own and headed out to all of the major summer festivals and events. Footage from these events was later shown in "Backstage". 
* Throughout the first week of September 2012, MTV updated and started airing new promos for all of its main music blocks - including 'Alternative Nation', 'Home Sweet Home', 'In Love With MTV', 'MTV Rocks!', 'Party Zone', 'Urban' and 'Wishlist'. After a short break, a set of new local DJ's returned to put together the 'Party Zone' playlists.
* On October 1, 2012, MTV Czech received another refresh and started airing a new set of idents by MTV World Design Studio/Buck - ''Brodown'', ''Dream Big'' and ''Infectious''.
* At the end of October 2012, MTV Czech rolled out a set of three Halloween-themed bumpers that included characters from similar idents used during summer and spring. These were once again produced by company "123 Klan". 
* On November 28, 2012, MTV Czech [http://mtv.nova.cz/clanek/backstage/backstage-narozeniny-mtv.html celebrated its 3rd Birthday], accompanied by a party at local popular club ROXY. The event was open also for the public.
* Throughout December 2012, MTV aired a set of Christmas themed bumpers that followed in footsteps of the previous ones used during Autumn, Summer and Spring. They featured the same characters and depicted them in a snow-covered holiday environment. This was the final set of idents by studio "123 Klan". During the holidays, MTV Czech broadcast again several themed musical blocks and charts, although to a lesser extent than in the previous year. 
* By February 2013, MTV Czech began dropping its current on-air branding and adopting parts of the branding of MTV US. Most new promos produced and aired after February 1 use the on-air identity and style of MTV US.
* Underemployed premiered on February 1, 2013 at 9PM. 
* The L.A. Complex premiered on April 17, 2013 at 9PM.
* From May 5, 2013 to May 26, 2013, Chill Out Zone was put on hiatus in favor of Geordie Shore seasons one to three marathon re-runs.
* Ke$ha: My Crazy Beautiful Life premiered on May 27, 2013 at 10PM.
* Since late May 2013, MTV Czech has started airing a weekly night block titled "A Night With...", each week focusing on a different artist.
* Washington Heights premiered on June 9, 2013 at 9PM.
* In July MTV started airing two new idents (''Adrenaline Rush'' and ''Underdog'') and most of the music blocks (In Love With MTV, Party Zone, Urban, Wishlist) once again received new promos.
* As of November 2013, MTV Czech Republic still broadcasts music videos in a content ratio of 50% music and 50% reality shows, something not seen in other territories where all of the music content was replaced and moved to other MTV channels or removed completely - as for example in the US, UK, Latin America and Russia. Currently, the only MTV channel with more music content than MTV Czech is [[MTV Adria]], with a content ratio of 70% music and 30% reality shows. MTV Czech also remains one of the few widescreen MTV channels in the world even after the global July 2011 rebrand, though it was expected for the majority of other MTV channels to switch to 16:9 by that time as well.
* In late November 2013 CME announced it will not renew its current licence with MTV Networks for operating the channel and MTV brand in the Czech and Slovak market due to increased debts and will hand over the licence back to Viacom.
* On the same day Viacom has stated it will take charge of MTV Czech Republic as of January 1, 2014, and re-launch the channel in the region on that date, promising more shows, more local content and earlier premieres.  
* On November 21, 2013, Viacom announced that MTV Czech will cease operations on December 31, 2013.
* On January 1, 2014, [[MTV Europe]] will once again become officially available to viewers in Czech Republic and Slovakia. The channel will continue to be run from London, UK, and will feature additional subtitles and soundtracks in Czech, Hungarian, Romanian and other languages relevant to countries where local MTV feeds have ceased or are planning to cease operations. [[MTV Europe]] currently features US-imported longform shows throughout most of its daily schedule, with very little music content appearing late in the night and during the early morning hours. Unlike MTV Czech, it no longer features any specialist music shows.

'''''Mastergate''''' is a play by [[Larry Gelbart]], which he describes as "A Play On Words". The title refers to a fictional political scandal enacted on "Master Pictures Studios", a fictional movie company that is actually a cover for arms trading. The title of the play also references other real-life political scandals, such as [[Watergate]] and others subsequently given the suffix [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]].

==Plot summary==
The play is set in the Sherman Adams Room at the [[Watergate scandal|John Mitchell Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The "Select Joint Congressional Committee Investigating Alleged Covert Arms Assistance to Alleged Other Americas" investigates the CIA's attempt to divert arms to Central American guerrillas through a motion picture company's high-budget action film, entitled "Tet." (a reference to the [[Tet Offensive]])

''Mastergate'' is a [[satire]] on congressional investigative committee hearings that took place during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]], on the Watergate investigation, and on the [[Iran-Contra affair]]. In his opening address, the chairman explains that the purpose of the hearings is to find out what the president knew and if he had any idea of the affair.
The satire employs many aspects of [[rhetoric]] and word-play, including puns, [[malapropism]], [[mixed metaphors]], [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] and Washington double-speak.The playwright said of his work that it is "First and foremost...a play about language. It's not for me to discover that politicians are corrupt or full of hot air. It's really about what they and television have done to the way we speak and the way we listen."&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-01/news/tv-1363_1_hot-air|title=Washington's Language Gridlock :  Larry Gelbart's 'Mastergate' on PBS Dissects the Art of Doublespeak|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play uncovers aspects of the absurd in the working life of government employees; for example, it portrays a non-meeting, a non-discussion, and people being present in the minutes of the meeting despite not attending.

It has been argued &lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; that several of the characters have real-life counterparts, for example, Major Manley Battle may be based on [[Oliver North]].

==Characters==
* ''The committee:'' 
** Merry Chase, a reporter for TNN (Total Network News)
** Archer Bowman, the committee chairman
** Oral Proctor, a congressman who had been elected for thirty terms
** Shepherd Hunter, the chief general counsel for the Combined Permanent Sub-Committee
** Representative Byers

The play was recorded by [[L.A. Theatre Works]] during their 1991-1992 season with a cast including [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Harold Gould]].

== Reviews of ''Mastergate'' ==
Positive reviews included that of [[Jack Kroll]] in ''Newsweek'', who wrote, "If George Orwell were a gag writer, he could have written ''Mastergate''. Larry Gelbart's scathingly funny takeoff on the Iran-Contra hearings is a spiky cactus flower in the desert of American political theatre." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mastergate_and_Power_Failure.html?id=HgpaAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Mastergate and Power Failure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Frank Rich]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "When ''Mastergate'' is funny, it is very funny. When it is not, it still stands up for a patriotic integrity beyond the understanding of the clowns who parade across its national stage."&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/-Mastergate-Political-Satire-by-Larry-Gelbart-Opens-on-Broadway/id-44e147423bd17722513357555666c470|title='Mastergate,' Political Satire by Larry Gelbart, Opens on Broadway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Howard Kissel of the ''Daily News'', wrote "If you think the title is funny, you'll probably enjoy ''Mastergate.'' If you find it adolescent, which I'm afraid I do, stay home and read Mark Twain on politics."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; Likewise, Linda Winer of ''Newsday'' wrote, "''Mastergate'' is a one-joke extended sketch that, unfortunately, never manages the leap to dramatic - much less philosophical - revelation of much we didn't already know. Nevertheless, the joke is a very good one, performed with deadpan delight by deft imitators."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

== Awards ==
* Outer Critics Circle 1990 Special Award: Larry Gelbart - (Winner)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outercritics.org/award-results/awards-for-1989-1990/|title=AWARDS FOR 1989-1990|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
A film was made in 1992 based on the play. The film was directed by [[Michael Engler]] and written by [[Larry Gelbart]] and produced by [[David Jablin]].&lt;ref name="Mastergate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/470153/Mastergate/|title=Mastergate|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1311">'''MicroTuner MT2060''' is a single-chip, microprocessor-based [[television tuner]] capable of receiving analogue and terrestrial TV by [[Microtune]], Inc. It is commonly used in USB [[digital television]] receivers due to its small size and power consumption.  A number of internal PCI dual tuner [[TV tuner card]]s also use the MT2060 because it allows a dual-tuner card to be produced that is no larger than a single tuner card.

The MT2060FC is a variant for the China market.

==Technical specifications==
* ''Supply Voltage (DC)'' '''3.3V'''
* ''Noise Figure at max gain'' '''8&amp;nbsp;dB'''
* ''Image rejection'' '''60&amp;nbsp;dB'''
* ''AGC range'' '''30&amp;nbsp;dB''' &lt;ref&gt;[The AGC range of the MT2060 is more limited than Xceive's XC3028 (30dB vs 80dB) which means that products based around the MT2060 typically include a separate low-noise amplifier (LNA) before the signal reaches the MT2060.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Frequency range'' '''48 - 860&amp;nbsp;MHz'''
*Fully compatible with NTSC, PAL, SECAM, DAVIC, DVB-C, DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, EuroDOCSIS, and other standards

[[File:Ball-bin-P1080178.jpg|thumb|A MUGA surrounded by noise reducing earth walls.]]
A '''Multi Use Games Area''' (abbreviated MUGA) is usually a steel anti vandal outdoor fenced area with built in goal post units for various types of sports games, such as [[football pitch|football]], [[basketball]] or [[tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/new-multi-use-games-area-1711810|title=New sports area for football, basketball and tennis opens in Harlow|first=Charlotte|last=Page|date=26 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer fencing makes it easier to keep the ball in play. MUGAs are often installed at [[school]]s. MUGAs can be supplied in Half court (Open one end with one combination goal unit), Full court (Fully enclosed with two end goal units) and Key area (Open single goal end with key line markings).

[[File:Multipurpose Sports Court.PNG|thumb|A multi use games area with line markings for sports.]]
MUGAs are often supplied as ready-made solutions by various manufacturers. Sports MUGAs usually consist of a steel goal post and basketball goal post combination. This can be senior, junior or match quality for basketball. Sports played on MUGAs are varied, hence the term Multi Use. Basketball, football, hockey, netball, volleyball are usually provided for with appropriate floor line markings for each sport, which are lined in different coloured paints. Multi Use Games Area MUGAs are placed into the ground around a sports surface area including natural grass, artificial sports surfaces, sports tiles, tarmac or concrete. Some MUGAs are open ended, partially closed or fully enclosed. Sizes vary from Key Area 6m x 7.5m. Tarmac key lined. Half Court 7.5m x 15m. Full Court 15m x 30m.

The intense activity in a MUGA can increase [[noise pollution|noise]] and complaints from neighbours. The noise level depends on the material used for the fencing, and by the location. Positive results from United Kingdom local authorities can provide good evidence &lt;ref&gt;Citation?&lt;/ref&gt; that placements of anti vandal Multi Use Games Areas can reduce anti social behaviour and increase fitness within early teen age groups in both cities and parish localities.

'''Octocon''' is the name given to the National Irish Science Fiction and [[fantasy]] Convention, held (almost) annually in October. It was not held in 2014 when Ireland hosted that year's [[Eurocon]], Shamrokon, in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurocon 2014 / Shamrokon|url=http://www.shamrokon.ie/|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Kristian Nairn and George R. R. Martin at Octocon.jpg|alt=Kristian Nairn and George R. R. Martin at Octocon|thumb|Game of thrones actor Kristian Nairn (Hodor) and Writer George R. R. Martin at Octocon in Dublin, 17th October 2010.]]

*1989/1990: The convention was initiated by members of the [[Irish Science Fiction Association]], and named by artist [[Peter McCanney]], who created the convention's first logo.
*1990: [[Terry Pratchett]] was the first Guest of Honour of the convention.
*1995: Advertised Guest of Honour [[Mary Gentle]] had to cancel her appearance at the last minute, leading to the appointment of [[Kim Newman]] in her place.
*1997: This was also the year's official Eurocon, and consequently the largest Octocon to date.
*1998: The only one-day Octocon to date.
*2003: The convention took a break for a year.
*2004: For the first time, Octocon was held outside Ireland's capital of [[Dublin]], in [[Maynooth]], [[Co. Kildare]], where it was held for 3 further years.
*2008: The convention returned to [[Dublin]].
*2009: The first Golden Blaster was awarded.
*2014: There was no October convention this year. Instead a lot of the regular organizers helped run the official Eurocon, Shamrokon, in August.

== Golden Blasters ==
The Golden Blasters are the National Irish Science Fiction Awards for short science fiction, fantasy or horror films. Submissions can and have come from anywhere in the world, and the winners are selected by audience vote and a panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Blasters|url=http://www.goldenblasters.com/|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards now include the Golden Blaster, The Silver Blaster and the award for the best script.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14816">The '''penetron''', short for '''penetration tube''', is a type of limited-color [[television]] used in some military applications. Unlike a conventional [[color television]], the penetron produces a limited [[gamut|color gamut]], typically two colors and their combination. Penetrons, and other military-only [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), have been replaced by [[LCD]]s in modern designs.

==History==

===Basic television===

A conventional black and white television (B&amp;W) uses a tube that is uniformly coated with a [[phosphor]] on the inside face. When excited by high-speed [[electron]]s, the phosphor gives off light, typically white but other colors are also used in certain circumstances. An [[electron gun]] at the back of the tube provides a beam of high-speed electrons, and a set of [[electromagnets]] arranged near the gun allow the beam to be moved about the display. The television signal is sent as a series of stripes, each one of which is displayed as a separate line on the display. The strength of the signal increases or decreases the current in the beam, producing bright or dark points on the display as the beam sweeps across the tube.

In a color display the uniform coating of white phosphor is replaced by dots or lines of three colored phosphors, producing red, green or blue light (RGB) when excited. These [[primary color]]s mix in the human eye to produce a single apparent color. In order to produce the same resolution as the B&amp;W display, a color screen needs to have three times the number of pixels. This presents a problem for conventional electron guns, which cannot be focussed or positioned accurately enough to hit these much smaller individual patterns.

A number of companies were working on various solutions to this problem in the late 1940s. At the same time, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) had set aside a block of the [[UHF]] spectrum for new television channels, and later decided these new channels would be used to broadcast color signals. After extensive tests they found that the only usable system was one developed by [[CBS]] that broadcast three B&amp;W images in turn, a full frame of red, then green, then blue. This concept was known as "field-sequential" broadcast. CBS built sets that produced color by spinning a color-filter disk in front of a conventional B&amp;W set, timed to follow the frames. To reduce flicker, the frame rate was increased from 60 to 144 frame/s. This made the CBS system incompatible with existing B&amp;W broadcasts, but since it was being used only on the new UHF frequencies this was not considered to be a serious problem.

The disk, often called a color wheel, comprised three sectors, each a transparent color filter. The colors were red, green, and blue. Because a given sector had to cover the whole screen, image size was limited. Furthermore, any fast motion created primary-colored trailing edges of the objects that were moving. Some recent projection TVs employed color wheels.

===Penetron===

The penetron was original designed by Koller and Williams while working at [[General Electric]] (GE).&lt;ref&gt;2,590,018&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially developed as a novel way to build a single-gun color television with the simplicity of a conventional B&amp;W set. Like the B&amp;W tube, it used a uniform coating of phosphor on the display with a single electron gun at the rear. However, the phosphor coating is applied in layers of different colors, red on the inside closest to the gun, and blue on the outside closest to the front face of the tube. Colors were selected by increasing the power of the electron beam, which allowed the electrons to flow through any lower layers to reach the proper color.

In a conventional set, voltage is used to control the brightness of the image, not its color, something that the new design also had to achieve. To address these competing needs, the color selection was provided by an external mechanism. The gun was modulated as it would be in a B&amp;W set, with increasing power producing a brighter spot on the screen. A set of fine wires placed behind the screen provided the extra energy needed to select a particular color layer. Since the phosphors were relatively opaque, the system required very high accelerating voltages, between 25 and 40 kV. An improved version was introduced that used transparent phosphor layers and thin insulating layers between them that reduced the required voltages.&lt;ref&gt;2,958,002&lt;/ref&gt; The dielectric ensured that stray electrons, either off-voltage from the guns or [[secondary emission]] from the phosphors themselves, were stopped before they reached the screen.

The penetron was ideally suited for use with the CBS system. The same timing that caused the mechanical wheel of the CBS sets to turn was instead used to change the voltage of the color selection grid, to the same end. The low switching rate, 144 times a second, meant that the changing high-voltage was not a major source of high-frequency noise. Unlike the mechanical CBS system, the penetron had no moving parts, could be built at any size (which was difficult to do with the disk), and had no problems with flicker. It represented a major advance in display technology.

===NTSC===

It was not long after the introduction of CBS's system that a new system was introduced by RCA that eventually won out. Unlike CBS's field-sequential system, RCA directly encoded the color for every spot on the screen, a system known as "dot-sequential". The advantage to the RCA system was that the primary component of the signal was very similar to the B&amp;W signal used on existing sets, which meant the millions of B&amp;W televisions would be able to receive the new signal while newer colors sets could see these in either B&amp;W or color if that additional signal was provided. This was a huge advantage over the CBS system, and a modified version was selected by the [[NTSC]] as the new color standard in 1953.

The major disadvantage was the difficulty in correctly focussing the beam on the correct color, a problem RCA solved with their [[shadow mask]] system. The shadow mask is a thin metal foil with small holes photoetched into it, positioned so the holes lie directly above one triplet of colored phosphor dots. Three separate electron guns are individually focussed on the mask, sweeping the screen as normal. When the beams pass over one of the holes, they travel through it, and since the guns are separated by a small distance from each other at the back of the tube, each beam has a slight angle as it travels through the hole. The phosphor dots are arranged on the screen such that the beams hit only their correct phosphor. To ensure the holes line up with the dots, the mask is used to create the dots using photosensitive material. 

The new broadcast system presented a serious problem for the penetron. The signal required the color to be selected at high speeds "on the fly" as the beam was being drawn across the screen.  This meant the high voltage color selection grid had to be rapidly cycled, which presented numerous problems, notably high-frequency noise that filled the interior of the tube and interfered with the receiver electronics. Another modification was introduced to address this issue, using three separate guns, each fed with a different base voltage tuned to hit one of the layers. In this version no switching was required, eliminating the high-frequency noise.

Producing such a system proved difficult in practice, and for home television use GE instead introduced their "[[Porta-Color]]" system, a dramatic improvement on RCA's shadow mask system. Other developers continued working with the basic system attempting to find ways of solving the high frequency switching issues, but none of these entered commercial production.

===Use in avionics===

For other uses, however, the advantages of the penetron remained. Although it was not well suited to the dot-sequential method of color broadcast, that was only important if one was receiving over-the-air broadcasts. For uses where the signal could be provided in any needed format, like in computer displays, the penetron remained useful. When a full color gamut was not needed, the complexity of the penetron was further reduced and it became very attractive. This lent it to custom applications like military avionics, where the nature of the input signal was not important and the developer was free to use any signaling style they wished.&lt;ref name=c&gt;''Cockpit'', pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

In the avionics role the penetron had other advantages as well. Its use of phosphors in layers instead of stripes meant that it had higher resolution, three times that of the RCA system. This was very useful for [[radar]] display and [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] systems, where the images were often overlaid with textual cues that required high resolution to be easily readable. Additionally, since all of the signal reached the screen in a penetron, as opposed to 15% of it in a shadow mask tube, for any given amount of power the penetron was much brighter. This was a major advantage in the avionics role where power budgets were often quite limited, yet the displays were often hit with direct sunlight and needed to be very bright. The lack of the shadow mask also meant the penetron was much more robust mechanically, and didn't suffer from color shifting under [[g-forces|g-loads]].&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

Penetrons were used from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, mostly for radar or IFF systems where two-color displays (green/red/yellow) were commonly used. Improvements in conventional shadow masks removed most of its advantages during this period. Better focusing allowed the size of the holes in the shadow mask to increase in proportion to the opaque area, which improved display brightness. Brightness was further improved with the introduction of newer phosphors. Problems with doming were addressed through the use of [[invar]] shadow masks that were mechanically robust and attached to the tube using a strong metal frame.&lt;ref&gt;''Life Story'', pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Penetron displays were also offered as an option on some [[graphics terminal]]s, where the high speed color-switching was not required and the penetron's limited gamut was not a concern. IDI offered such displays as an $8,000 option on their IDIgraph and IDIIOM series teminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carl |last=Machover |title=Computer graphics terminals - A backward look |journal=Spring Joint Computer Conference |date=1972 |pages=443-444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tektronix, a major manufacturer of oscilloscopes, offered a limited gamut of color in some of its CRT 'scopes, using Penetron-type technology.

==Description==
In most versions of the penetron the tube has an inner layer of red and outer layer of green, separated by a thin dielectric layer. A complete image is produced by scanning twice, once with the gun set to a lower power that is stopped in the red layer, and then again at a higher power that travels through the red layer and into the green. Yellow can be produced by hitting the same location on both sweeps.

In a display where the colors are either on or off and various brightness levels do not have to be created, the system can be further simplified by removing the color selection grid and modulating the voltage of the electron gun itself. However, this also causes problems because the electrons will reach the screen faster when accelerated with higher voltages, which means that the deflection system has to be increased in power as well to ensure the scanning creates the same screen size and line widths on both passes.

Several alternative arrangements of the penetron were experimented on to address this problem. One common attempt used an electron multiplier at the tube face instead of the selection grid. In this system a low-energy scanning beam was used, and magnets were set to cause the electrons to strike the sides of the multipliers. A shower of higher-energy electrons would then be released and travel to the layered phosphors of a normal penetron arrangement. It was later noticed that the beams emanating from the multipliers landed in rings, which allowed a new arrangement of phosphors in concentric rings instead of layers.&lt;ref&gt;4,612,483&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage to the penetron is that it lacks the mechanical focusing system of a shadow mask television, which means that all of the beam energy reaches the screen. For any given amount of power, the penetron will be much brighter, typically 85% brighter. This is a major advantage in an aircraft setting, where power supply is limited but the displays need to be bright enough to be easily read even when directly lit by sunlight. The system is guaranteed to produce the correct colors in spite of external interference or the [[g-force]]s of maneuvering &amp;ndash; a very important quality in aviation settings. The penetron also offered higher resolutions because the phosphor was continuous, as opposed to the small spots in a shadow mask system. Additionally, the lack of the shadow mask makes the penetron much more robust mechanically.

'''Ruby Romaine''' is a fictional character portrayed by [[Tracey Ullman]] on her show ''[[Tracey Takes On...]]''.  The character became so popular, that [[HBO]] commissioned a pilot for the character which resulted in the one-off special, ''[[Tracey Ullman in the Trailer Tales]]''. Ruby is a self-professed "star maker."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ruby's family hails from [[Wisconsin]]. When her family moved out to [[North Hollywood]], they lived in a trailer. Her parents were extremely obese: "I don't think I ever saw them put anything in their mouths that didn't have milk, butter, and cheese in it." Ruby's space in the trailer was whatever was left over after they sat down.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby was an early bloomer. She developed triple D-cup breasts and "hair in all four locations." Sometime before age 15, Ruby's uncle Rosco came to live with her and her family. Rosco made sexual advances towards her, an act for which he stood trial. The judge made him join the navy and sent him to [[Guam]] where he died. "God rest his sweaty paws," says Ruby.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''[[Tracey Takes On (book)|Tracey Takes On]]'', Ruby had a short-lived marriage to entertainer Tubby Lapels, "chairman emeritus of the [[Hermosa Beach]] [[Friars Club of Beverly Hills|Friars Club]]." This produced her daughter Desiree.&lt;ref name="pxxv"&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the episode "Tracey Takes On... America," Desiree was the product of an affair with Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]].&lt;ref name="america"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... America |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "He was the first guy I did it with in a blimp."

Besides Desiree, Ruby also as a son, Buddy.&lt;ref name="p59"&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby gave birth to her children six months apart, "That way I could spend a lot of time with them and make sure that they were growing up right."&lt;ref name="p59"/&gt; Desiree steals from the morgue where she works.&lt;ref name="mothers"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Mothers |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddy was the product of incest.&lt;ref name="hype"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Hype |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 3, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby had an affair with her uncle, Shep. She was able to conceal her pregnancy by telling her mother that she was "nursing kids for the county." Buddy didn't meet his "Uncle Daddy" until he was an adult competing in a car show contest. Shep took the car Buddy won and disappeared from his life yet again.&lt;ref name="hype"/&gt;

Buddy was a child star. He starred as the "Tasty Bread Boy" in television commercials.&lt;ref name="p203"&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seventeen, Buddy decided that he wanted to fight in the [[Vietnam war]].&lt;ref name="p203"/&gt; Buddy returned a shell-shocked veteran.&lt;ref name="p203"/&gt; He lives with Ruby to this very day. Even with his harrowing experience, Buddy still misses Vietnam. To fill the void, Buddy adopted a pot bellied pig, Oinky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Age |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Ullman in the Trailer Tales |series=Tracey Ullman in the Trailer Tales |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=August 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby makes sure that Buddy takes his anti-psychotic medication&lt;ref name="mothers"/&gt; daily, although he seemingly has lapses. Buddy acted as Secretary of State for the secessionist group, Army of Armageddon.&lt;ref name="marriage"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Marriage |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group called for their mobile home to be declared a separate state. Buddy has a history of selling his body parts. He used part of the money to send away for a "slender [[Filipino people|Filipino]] fiance".&lt;ref name="marriage"/&gt; Buddy proposed marriage as was mandatory contractually. However, upon his "fiance's" arrival, Buddy was held up with the Armageddon group. His fiance ultimately decided to marry the sergeant who was awaiting Buddy's surrender.&lt;ref name="marriage"/&gt;

Desiree's daughter, Karen, Ruby's niece, married and had a child with an [[African-American]] man. They named the child Whitney. Ruby never knew of the child. She also didn't attend the wedding. Ruby ran into her daughter in a food market. She was shopping with her granddaughter, Ruby's great-grandchild. This mini-reunion resulted in a reconciliation for mother and daughter, and an introduction for Whitney and Ruby. Ruby takes her great-grandchild to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], and uses her to get out of jams when she gets caught making off-color remarks to store employees.&lt;ref name="mothers"/&gt;

Ruby stocked up on what she calls "vintage dinners" - frozen [[TV dinners]] that were taken off the market when health experts discovered that some of the additives were causing cancer.  She still serves them on special occasions like Thanksgiving for her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Food |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 8, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighborhood==
Ruby resides in [[East Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]] ([[North Hollywood]] according to Ruby herself in a home shopping call in&lt;ref name="money"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Money |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=April 9, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Her address is, 264 1/2 Fernando Venezuela Boulevard, (formally Appleby), Hollywood, California, 90036.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt; She dubs her neighborhood "Boomshakalaka Town".&lt;ref name="pxxv"/&gt; The majority of Ruby's neighbors are [[Hispanic]]. "It used to be a real elegant neighborhood, but now all the children have earrings and you can smell the rice and beans in the air."&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Death |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate= March 13, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby's relationship with her neighbors is nothing short of tumultuous. Ruby was raped by her neighbor's dog, Raging Bull. Taking matters into her own hands, Ruby had her friend Dean castrate the dog with bricks as to not have her attacked again.&lt;ref name="bestfriend"/&gt;

[[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] frequently turn up on Ruby's doorstep. She quickly turns them away. Ruby is not a religious person.&lt;ref name="religion"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Religion |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frozen blocks of urine have crashed through Ruby's bathroom ceilings from space shuttles.&lt;ref name="endof"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... The End of the World |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood makeup career==
Ruby's makeup career began when a motion picture came to her hometown called "Pirate of the Plains" starring actor [[Errol Flynn]]. Flynn took a liking to underage Romaine and slept with her. Ruby, threatening to make a scandal out of the affair, was offered a job doing makeup which kicked started her fifty-year career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Childhood |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the oldest working Hollywood Makeup Union member. "I've been working here fifty years, hell, I'm almost out of [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]!"&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Hollywood |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby choose to make her makeup the old-fashioned way: in a blender. She has over 720 film and television shows to her credit.

Ruby has worked on such stars as [[Barbara Eden]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Clark Gable]]&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Sex |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Mogambo]]''), [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Debra Paget]] and [[Dennis Weaver]] (in ''Seven Angry Men'', they didn't have the budget for twelve&lt;ref name="sex"/&gt;), [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Jane Kaczmarek]], [[Jane Seymour]], [[Jane Wyman]] (who never said more than a few words to her), [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Kirk Douglas]] (''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]''), [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Mickey Rooney]] (she cut out fresh orange peel teeth for him for his Japanese character [[I.Y. Yunioshi]] in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast At Tiffany's]]''), [[Nick Nolte]], [[Ronald Reagan]] ('powered his nose' for [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield]] cigarette ads), [[Rose Marie]], [[Spencer Tracy]], the cast of ''[[Bonanza]]'', and has applied putty to [[Candice Bergen]]'s neck.&lt;ref name="hollywood"/&gt; She also worked for legendary actress, [[Joan Crawford]].&lt;ref name="hollywood"/&gt; "My job was to draw her eyebrows in five minutes before the alarm went off."&lt;ref name="hollywood"/&gt; Crawford's two adopted children implored Ruby to help save them from their mother who was "strapping them to the bed and giving them enemas".  Ruby went on the side of the woman who "signed her paychecks".&lt;ref name="hollywood"/&gt;

Ruby has related that she put actor [[Tony Curtis]] in a [[diaper]] since the director wouldn't let him climb down for bathroom breaks in the movie ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]''.&lt;ref name="hype"/&gt;

Ruby got to make amends with actress Vivian Biltmore, the woman who got her fired off the (film) set claiming that she was drunk. Ruby did Biltmore's makeup for her Oscar-winning performance in ''Faded Splendor''. Ruby reconciled with the star while acting as makeup mortician.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Ruby also worked on actress [[Jayne Mansfield]]. "I got to the scene of the accident where Jayne Mansfield's head rolled along the side of that highway. Sad thing was, I had done her roots only three days prior. Can you believe her luck?"&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Smoking |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby worked on ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (which was the closet thing she ever had to a religious experience).&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt; Actress [[Angela Lansbury]] accused her of drinking the wine for the [[Last Supper]] scene.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;  Ruby was subsequently fired.

She has worked on such motion pictures as ''[[Showgirls]]'', doing makeup for actress [[Elizabeth Berkley]]. Ruby used ice-cubes on Berkley's nipples before every take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Vegas |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby has also done makeup for the [[pornography|porn]] industry. Her work can be seen in "[[Plymouth Rock|Plymouth]] Cock."&lt;ref name="sex"/&gt; "I never needed a 'beaver brush' when I worked with [[Vincente Minnelli|Minnelli]]!"&lt;ref name="sex"/&gt;

Ruby has had multiple affairs. The list includes: Anthony Quinn, [[Cornel Wilde]],&lt;ref name="bestfriend"/&gt; [[John Garfield]],&lt;ref name="agents"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Agents |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Welk]],&lt;ref name="fantasy"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On...

Man's Best Friend |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Edgar Hoover|John Edgar Hoover]],&lt;ref name="agents"/&gt; Joe McCarthy.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt; Ruby swears that when she worked with [[Rock Hudson]] he was "all hands."&lt;ref name="obsession"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Obsession |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 10, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby worked on ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' starring Hudson and Jane Wyman.&lt;ref name="obsession"/&gt;

She has only been arrested once in her life. "It was on one of those low-budget shows. It was all about people turning into rats." A half-pound of [[cocaine]] was found in the hair and makeup trailer on the set of a [[B movie]] Ruby was working on. She was innocent, but years prior she did let a gaffer rub some on one of her nipples and lick it off. "He got a bigger kick out of it than I did. That's for sure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Crime |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby's favorite film is ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]''. She helped [[Ray Milland]] research his role. "[I]t took more than a weekend, I can tell ya!"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood insider==
Ruby is adamant that [[Liberace]] was not gay. She saw him and [[Carol Burnett]] "canoodling" in a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Lies |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She rejects the reported life story of [[Grace Kelly]]. "She slept with every leading man she ever worked with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Royalty |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate= February 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby tried to cover up the bruises on actress [[Lana Turner]], given to her by abusive boyfriend [[Johnny Stompanato]]. "He smacked her around, and she liked it!"&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

Ruby worked on actress [[Hedy Lamarr]]. In response to [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The War Of The Worlds]]'' radio broadcast, Lamarr and Ruby dove underneath the makeup trailer, "with our kissers in the dirt for six hours." "Hedy was so mad, she put a gypsy curse on Orson, which is why he got so fat," says Ruby.&lt;ref name="endof"/&gt;

==Key player==
Unbeknownst to the public, Ruby was the "[[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]" that brought 1970s actress Linda Granger's career to halt. This brought an end to both Linda's hit television series ''VIP Lounge'', and to her character Vicki Starr, who was killed off in the program. Ruby leaked that Linda was a drug addict who tried to snort the translucent power from her makeup kit. The last straw was when Ruby took it away from her, and Linda slapped her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... 1976 |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=February 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda also, at some point, got Ruby fired from the set of ''Vegas Vixens''.&lt;ref name="roadrage"/&gt;

Back in the 1950s, Ruby had the opportunity to become a secret agent for the [[FBI]]. A listening devise was transplanted in Ruby's back molar to spy on possible [[communist]] Hollywood movie stars. While spying on [[John Garfield]], Garfield misinterpreted Ruby's (drunk) facial expressions, and thought she was coming onto him. After a brief liaison, Ruby worked every John Garfield picture.&lt;ref name="agents"/&gt;

Ruby took it upon herself to spy on possible communist sympathizers in Hollywood for her then lover, Senator Joseph McCarthy.&lt;ref name="america"/&gt; Being in the makeup business, she had prime access to spy on the stars.

==Alien abduction==
Driving home after a day of doing makeup on a [[George Schlatter]] comedy show, Ruby was startled when her [[Buick]] began shaking violently. Ruby jumped out of her car thinking it was another California earthquake. Suddenly, a beam of bright light shone in front of her. A green figure emerged from a metallic [[mobile home]]-shaped spacecraft. The creature led Ruby aboard. There she drank and danced with the creature she called, "Mayor of the Moon" and "the top alien back home." She was then probed by the creature. Soon after, she was led back to her car which had been washed and [[simoniz]]ed. Ruby went to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to tell them of her encounter.&lt;ref name="fantasy"/&gt;

==Alcoholism, smoking, and overall health==
Ruby's brand of [[cigarette]] choice is [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ullman|Ullman]], pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt; She began smoking as early as seven years old.&lt;ref name="smoking"/&gt; She has what many would describe as an alcohol problem, but Ruby would never admit to this. She sometimes refers to her alcohol as "medication",&lt;ref name="movies"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Movies |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=April 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a purifier.&lt;ref name="marriage"/&gt; She is not one to refrain from taking medication for her artificial hip, (which was put in backwards), with beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Drugs |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=January 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is keen on not missing [[Happy Hour]] at Smog Cutters,&lt;ref name="sex"/&gt; which she frequently drives to in her blue Buick. She enjoys [[champagne (wine)|champagne]] music&lt;ref name="fantasy"/&gt; and [[wine tasting]].&lt;ref name="pxxv"/&gt; Ruby is known to call into The Family Spending Channel, a home shopping network, when she's had "a few too many."&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;

Ruby only gets mammograms as to ensure that she doesn't get dropped by Artist Guild's health insurance program. "Even if I get a lump out here on the [[Matterhorn]], by the time it gets to base camp, I'll be 105."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tracey Takes On... Health |series=Tracey Takes On |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=March 13, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby has had a hysterectomy.&lt;ref name="movies"/&gt;

'''''Saputangan''''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for ''Handkerchief'') is a 1949 romance film from what is now Indonesia.{{efn|The film was released during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], in which time Indonesia had declared itself independent while the [[Dutch East Indies]] was still formally in existence.}} Directed by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]] and starring Chatir Harro, Noorsini, and [[Astaman]], it follows a young doctor who, after his fiancée is blinded in an automobile accident, becomes an [[optometrist]] and restores her sight.

==Plot==
As a sign of his love, the medical student Hardjono has given his fiancée Karnasih his handkerchief. After Hardjono finishes his final exams, his parents give him a new car, with which Hardjono takes Karnasih on holiday to Mega Mendung, near [[Bogor]]. However, during their excursion the car crashes into a log. Though Hardjono receives only minor injuries, Karnasih is blinded in the accident.

In the weeks afterwards, Karnasih&amp;mdash;hoping to conceal her loss of sight and thus preserve his love for her&amp;mdash;refuses to meet with Hardjono. Undaunted, Hardjono continues to contact her. When they do meet, Karnasih pretends that she can still see, a ruse which fails after Hardjono attempts to give her a handkerchief which has fallen to the ground.

Hardjono, hoping to become an [[optometrist]] and restore Karnasih's vision, decides to go abroad and receive further training. Karnasih, meanwhile, dedicates her time to educating poor children at her own school, the Taman Karnasih.

Six years pass, and Hardjono&amp;mdash;having received the training he sought&amp;mdash;returns. He operates on Karnasih. Six weeks pass, and Karnasih's vision is restored, allowing her to see her beloved again.{{sfn|Bintang Soerabaja, Saputangan|loc=Reverse}}

==Production==
''Saputangan'' was directed by [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]] as the second film for his company Bintang Soerabaja, following ''Sehidup Semati'' (''One in Life, One in Death'').{{sfn|Biran|2009a|p=368}} Young initially wrote the story as a stage play for his theatrical troupe, also named Bintang Soerabaja.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saputangan}}{{sfn|''De Vrie Pers'', Indonesische film}} The story was adapted into a screenplay by [[Tan Tjoei Hock]],{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saputangan}} who had joined the company together with financier and film producer [[The Teng Chun]].{{sfn|Biran|2009b|p=58}} Production began in September 1949 and was, at the time, estimated to require two months of filming.{{sfn|''De Vrie Pers'', Indonesische film}}

Though the film was shot in [[black-and-white]], the titular handkerchiefs in ''Saputangan'' were [[Film colorization|hand-tinted]]. The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that this hand tinting, done owing to references to the handkerchiefs' colour, was done poorly, such that the colour was jittery.{{sfn|Biran|2009a|p=368}}

[[File:Scene from Saputangan 5 (pamphlet; obverse).jpg|thumb|A scene from the film]]
The film starred Chatir Harro, Noorsini, and [[Astaman]]. It also featured [[Netty Herawaty]], [[Darussalam (actor)|Darussalam]], Ribut Rawit, Mohammad Jusuf, Sukarsih, R.A. Sri Mulat, Pak Kasur, and [[Lilik Sudjio]].{{sfn|Bintang Soerabaja, Saputangan|loc=Obverse}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saputangan}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lilik Sudjio}} Its soundtrack featured seven songs, including "Inilah Laguku" ("This is My Song"), "Asmara Kelana" ("Love of the Wanderer"), "Saputangan" ("Handkerchief"), "Pulau Bali" ("The Island of Bali"), and "Saputangan Tanda Kasih" ("Handkerchief, Sign of Love").{{sfn|Bintang Soerabaja, Saputangan|loc=Obverse and Reverse}}{{sfn|Biran|2009a|p=368}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saputangan}}

==Release and reception==
A novelisation of ''Saputangan'' was published by Gapura in 1949; the publishing house, owned by [[Andjar Asmara]], had novelised all Indonesian films produced or in production since independence up to that point.{{sfn|''Java Bode'', Gapura}} The film was in theatres by February 1950, when it was screening in [[Jakarta]].{{sfn|''Java Bode'', Waar Gaan We Heen?}} The film was exported to [[Singapore]], where it was banned by the film censor Jack Evans in May 1950 for being "not up to standards";{{sfn|Behague|1950|p=17}} J. B. Kristanto, in his ''[[Katalog Film Indonesia]]'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue''), suggests that the issue was [[Communism]]-inspired dialogue.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Saputangan}} This ban was lifted on 1 June 1950,{{sfn|''The Straits Times'', Censor's Ban}} and ''Saputangan'' was soon screened to popular success at the Alhambra Theatre.{{Sfn|''The Straits Times'', 'Three Came Home'}}

The reviewer for the ''Sunday Courier'' received ''Saputangan'' warmly, writing that the film was "unlike any other"{{efn|Original: "''Laen daripada jang laen.''"}} and was the first Indonesian film to not feature any fighting.{{sfn|Biran|2009a|p=368}}

''Saputangan'' may now be [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, Kristanto records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009a|p=351}}

'''Suspense''' is a state of mental [[uncertainty]], [[anxiety]], of being [[Decision-making|undecided]], or of being [[Doubt|doubtful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[Drama|dramatic work]], suspense is the [[anticipation]] of the [[wikt:outcome|outcome]] of a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the solution to an uncertainty, [[puzzle]], or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as it affects a character for whom one has [[sympathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.

== In drama ==
In literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest.  It may be of several major types:  in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of ''who, what, or how''; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of ''when''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about ''what'' will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don’t know ''how'' it will happen.  It would be difficult (and perhaps pointless) to write a piece of fiction in which there were not some issue the reader had a burning wish to find out about.  Consequently, even in [[historical fiction]], with characters whose life stories are well known, the ''why'' usually brings suspense to the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adjunct to suspense is [[foreshadowing]], as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in [[Isabel Allende]]’s ''[[House of the Spirits]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* In [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (429 B.C.), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father.  During the play, the spectators, aware that Oedipus will eventually make the discovery, share the hero's uncertainties and fears as he pursues the truth of his own past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[George Washington Cable]]'s story "Jean-ah Poquelin" (1875), the reader wants to know the cause of the strange smell and the unexplained disappearance of a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1895), the reader anticipates the outcome of the switching of a black infant with a white infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradox of suspense ==
Some authors have tried to explain the "paradox of suspense", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yanal|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name ''rappel'' this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (''suspense par contradiction'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007|pp=279–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Swedish Cottage, Central Park, New York City 2018.jpg|thumb|Swedish cottage, Central Park, New York City]]

The '''Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre''' was imported to the U.S. in 1876 as Sweden’s exhibit for the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia. The Swedish architecture and craftsmanship of the structure, suggestive of a model schoolhouse, caught the eye of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who brought it to [[Central Park]] in 1877.

Beginning in 1947, the cottage served as the home of a marionette theater troupe that traveled across the city performing on playgrounds and school auditoriums. Under the direction of [[City Parks Foundation]], citywide puppet shows in parks continue to this day through the CityParks PuppetMobile, the oldest continually operating company of its kind in the country, which presents free performances and puppet-making workshops in neighborhood parks, recreation centers and schools throughout New York City.

In 1973 a permanent theater was constructed inside the cottage designed for marionette performances. Since then, hundreds of thousands of children and families from around the world have enjoyed its original marionette productions. The cottage is a member of the [[Historic House Trust of New York City]]. The Swedish Cottage is located in Central Park at 79th Street and the West Drive, just south of the Delacorte Theater.

== Marionette performances at the Swedish Cottage ==

The Swedish Cottage and its performances are managed and presented by the [[City Parks Foundation]]. Master puppet makers and puppeteers create and present the marionette productions, which have included "Hansel and Gretel", "Gulliver's Travels", "Sleeping Beauty", "Alice in Wonderland", "Jack and the Beanstalk", “The Secret History of the Swedish Cottage" and many others.

'''TOLO''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]/[[Pashto]]: {{lang|fa|طلوع}}) is a commercial [[television station]] operated by [[MOBY Group]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Launched in 2004, it became one of the first commercial stations in the country and laid the foundation for an accessible media outlet by offering a large library of shows. It is a [[Persian language|Persian]]-language channel and is currently Afghanistan's most popular television channel.

TOLO was first launched in [[Kabul]] but as of November 2007, has broadcasts in 14 cities in [[Afghanistan]] on [[free-to-air]] and throughout the region by terrestrial and satellite. Its [[sister channel]]s are [[TOLOnews]], which broadcasts news all day, and [[Lemar TV]], which is a [[Pashto]]-language channel.

TOLO was the subject of documentary film in 2012 called ''The Network'', by [[Eva Orner]]. The film saw limited international release in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Network|url=http://dogwoofglobal.com/films/the-network|publisher=Dogwoof Films|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan’s landmark drama series, ''Raaz Hai Een Khana'' ("The Secrets of This House") took the Special Award at the Seoul Drama Awards in October 2008. Screened on Tolo and produced by Kaboora Productions, ''Raaz Hai Een Khana'' is the first drama series ever entirely written, acted, filmed, produced and broadcast by Afghans, for Afghans in Afghanistan. It was selected for a Special Prize amongst 152 entries from 33 countries around the world.

Tolo TV broadcasts ''[[Afghan Star (TV series)|Afghan Star]]'', a singing competition and one of Afghanistan's most popular television series. The show was the subject of the 2009 documentary film, [[Afghan Star (film)|'Afghan Star']], which won two awards at the 2009 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

In 2010 Tolo TV began broadcasting ''[[Eagle Four]]'', a police drama often compared to the American series [[24 (TV series)|24]], and partially funded by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="Nordland"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/world/asia/21kabul.html|title=On TV, an Afghan Unit Challenges Tradition And Tackles the Taliban|last=Nordland|first=Rod|author2=Sharifullah Sahak Contributed Reporting |date=21 November 2010|work=The New York Times|page=12|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-cop-show-20101208,0,6019051.story |title=Afghan TV police drama delivers message with zest |date=2010-12-08 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=16 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120012009/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-cop-show-20101208,0,6019051.story |archivedate=January 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/07/131857237/afghan-tv-show-aims-to-burnish-police-reputation|title=Afghan TV Show Aims To Burnish Police Reputation|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703628204575618573846693534|title=U.S. Courts Afghans Through Television|publisher=WSJ.com|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=16 June 2011|location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
On 21 January 2016, a [[Taliban]] suicide car bomber detonated explosives near a bus carrying staffers from TOLO in Darulaman Road in Kabul, killing at least 7 staff members – including 3 female employees - and wounding 26 others. The attack drew widespread global condemnation, with various world countries, activists and media organizations denouncing it as an attack on Afghanistan's freedom of press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amiry|first1=Sharif|title=Seven TOLO TV Employees Killed in Wednesday Attack|url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/23401-seven-tolo-tv-employees-killed-in-wednesday-attack|publisher=TOLO News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">'''Tala-Maddale''' is an ancient form of performance dialogue or debate performance in [[Southern India]] in the coastal [[Malnad]] regions of [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]]. The plot and content of the conversation is drawn from popular mythology but the performance mainly consists of an impromptu debate between characters involving sarcasm, puns, philosophy positions and humour. The main plot is sung from the same oral texts used for the yakshgana form of dance- drama. Performers claim that this was a more intellectual rendition of the dance during the monsoon season.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prabhu|first1=ganesh|title=Swarajya Vijaya’ in Tala Maddale on eve of I-Day|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/swarajya-vijaya-in-tala-maddale-on-eve-of-iday/article8971119.ece|accessdate=11 August 2016|publisher=The Hindu|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art form is popular in [[Uttara Kannada]], [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Udupi]] and [[Shimoga]] districts of Karnataka and [[Kasaragod district]] of Kerala. It is a derived form of [[Yakshagana]]—a classical dance or musical form of art from the same region.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashton|first1=Martha Bush|title=Yakshagana.

==Performances==

A typical Tala-Maddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata (the singer, with "Tala" or pair of small hand [[cymbal]]s) and a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffVpD5pG9lg "Maddale" (a type of drum)] player. Artists play the roles of characters in stories, typically, from [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and other [[purana]]s. Some consider the as a good presentation of oratorial skills.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

Artists are normally well versed with the [[Hindu]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]]s and [[puranas]]. [[Kannada]] language is the normal medium of communication. Tala-Maddale performances are mostly held during the night, the traditional reason being that in ancient times, people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale. It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

As is common in many Indian art forms, A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to [[Lord Ganesh]] (the [[Hindu]] God of knowledge, learning and art) with a prayer song by Bhagavatha. Usually this song is "Gajamukhadavage ganapage".&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt; This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as [[ex tempore]] [[debates]] between the artists. Hence, while the average length of a performance is about three hours, it can extend depending upon the debate. Due to the latter, artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too. In ancient times, Tala-Maddale performances often took the form of all-night performances, from 7 pm right up to 6 am.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

Subjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of [[Bhagavata]] and [[Puranas]]. However, episodes have also been created on other more current issues, some of which include the [[Second World War]], the [[Tashkent Agreement]], the [[Indian freedom struggle]] ''(Swarajya Vijaya)'' and computerisation ''(Ganakasura Kalaga)''.&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

Some of the popular Tala maddale artists are [http://www.ourkarnataka.com/shenigopalakrishnabhat/sheni_main.htm Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat], [[Pandit Krishna Bhat, Kerekai|Kerekai Krishna Bhat]], [[Kerekai Umakant Bhat]], [[Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri]], [[Shankaranarayana Samaga]], Vasudeva Samaga, Prabhakara Joshi, M.V. Hegde, Kumble Sundar Rao, M.L. Samaga, Padekallu Vishnu Bhat, Sadashiva Alva Talapady, Appu Nayak Athrady, Ramana Acharya and Prashanth Belur. Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas (audience).&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;

In August 2016, the story of the [[Indian Freedom Struggle]], Swarajya Vijaya, was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri [[Anandeshwaram Mahadeva Temple|Ananteshwara Temple]] at Rajangana, Karnataka. The episode (prasanga) had been written by M.V. Hegde. A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from [[British Colonial]] powers.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

Founded in 2002 by its artistic director [[Ignacio Varchausky]], '''TangoVia Buenos Aires''' is a [[non-profit organization]] for progressive arts - focused on preservation but dedicated to creation - that brings together artists, researchers, producers and cultural institutions for the preservation, development, and promotion of the art of [[tango (dance)|tango]] in [[Buenos Aires]] and around the world. Since TangoVia Buenos Aires understands tango as a constantly evolving living art form, it promotes all of its formats as contemporary and alive.

==Goals==
The organization's main goal is the development and implementation of educational and preservation projects linked to tango, especially the recovery of original sheet music, recordings, films and all other historical material related to the genre. TangoVia Buenos Aires also produces festivals, concert seasons, books and educational tools, documentaries and CDs.

==Teaching Activities==
Since its inception, TangoVia Buenos Aires has worked with the [[Orquesta Escuela de Tango Emilio Balcarce]] (“Emilio Balcarce” Tango Orchestra School), created by artistic director [[Ignacio Varchausky]] and directed today by the prestigious maestro [[Néstor Marconi]]. The award-winning documentary&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfUmNsOZhY&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Si Sos Brujo: A Tango Story]]”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com/festival2006/details.php?id=15132&lt;/ref&gt; — directed by [[Caroline W. Neal]] and co-produced by TangoVia Buenos Aires — traces the birth and development of this pedagogical programme based on oral transmission, thanks to which young musicians learn the orchestral styles of tango, its language and secrets, directly from great musicians who played in the orchestras of the 1940s and 1950s and remain active today.

==Digital Tango Archive==
Officially presented on 17 June 2009, the Digital Tango Archive is TangoVia's exhaustive and almost archaeological effort to recover lost materials relating to the history of tango recordings. Unique in the world&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-5351-2009-06-09.html&lt;/ref&gt; - the Digital Tango Archive already houses over 700 original arrangements for the tango orchestra ([[orquesta típica]]) and more than 600 for [[bandoneon]] solos. Through the digitalisation of high quality recordings, high resolution digital scanning of photographs, scores, musical arrangements and the correct transcription of video archives, a security copy is being created of the enormous amount of existing material. Its classification according to multiple criteria enables this material, once reserved to a few scholars, to be offered to everyone for free consultation. In Argentina there are at least one hundred thousand tango recordings made between 1902 and 1995 (end of the analogical era). However, less than 20% of this material is available on CD. There are already three thousand recordings that appear in catalogues, and thousands of hours of radio and TV programmes, which no longer exist in any format and have been lost forever.

==Artistic Productions==
Through a series of activities, TangoVia Buenos Aires has contributed to the promotion, preservation and first-hand enjoyment of the art of one of the most influential Argentine musicians in history: [[Horacio Salgán]]. One example is the artistic production of the CD “Raras Partituras 4” featuring Salgán’s unknown compositions and arrangements for both tango orchestra (recorded by the [[Gran Orquesta TangoVia Buenos Aires]]) and for piano solo (recorded by [[Andrés Linetzky]]). The CD was produced in collaboration with the Biblioteca Nacional de [[Argentina]] (Argentina's National Library) and was followed by the book “Arreglos para [[orquesta típica]]: Tradición e innovación en manuscritos originales” (Arrangements for a Typical Tango Orchestra: Tradition and Innovation in Original Manuscripts), co-published with the National Library and offering for the first time Salgán’s original arrangements for tango orchestra, as well as an analysis, bibliography and catalogue of Salgán’s work.

Since TangoVia Buenos Aires believes the tango tradition continually reinvents itself, it produces new recordings and festivals every year, featuring today’s most notable artists in contemporary tango. Since 2003 TangoVia Buenos Aires has been the artistic producer of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival in [[Paris]], in conjunction with the National Theater Palais Chaillot; 2008 marked the fourth edition of this festival. Other productions include the Festival Montpellier Danse 03, the Festival Buenos Aires Tango in the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome in both 2006 and 2008, and the Festival TangoVia Buenos Aires in both [[Genoa]], Italy and [[Lille]], France in 2005.

In the field of CD production, TangoVia Buenos Aires has launched two series. One of them is "El arte del bandoneón" (The Art of the Bandoneon). This series intends to create and preserve a kind of musical memory: a unique register of the most outstanding contemporary bandoneon players, recorded intimately playing solos on the bandoneon. The series began with the CD “Instantaneas” by [[Julio Pane]] and continued in 2008 with the CDs “Tiempo Esperado” by Néstor Marconi, “Mi Fueye Querido” by [[Leopoldo Federico]], which won the 2009 Latin Grammy Award for Best Tango Album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latingrammy.com/nominados/13-traditional |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924182312/http://www.latingrammy.com/nominados/13-traditional |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and “Mi Refugio” by [[Walter Rios]].  The second series “El arte de la orquesta típica" (The Art of the Tango Orchestra) began with “Amanecer Ciudadano” featuring an orchestra directed by the renowned bandoneonist [[Víctor Lavallén]].

==Support==
TangoVia Buenos Aires is supported by numerous public and private institutions, both in Argentina and abroad, including The Government of the City of Buenos Aires, la Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música (SADAIC), la Asociación Argentina de Intérpretes Musicales (AADI), Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Biblioteca Nacional de la Republica Argentina, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), Festival de Tango Buenos Aires, IICES, Jazz at [[Lincoln Center]], CODARTS (Conservatory of Rotterdam), [[Sydney Youth Orchestra]], Fondazione Musica per Roma and Parco della Musica, Publishing Houses [[Warner/Chappell Music]] and Epsa Publishing, and the Foundation “La Casa del Tango”.

'''Transatlantic Records''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent record label]]. The company was established in 1961, primarily as an importer of American folk, blues and jazz records by many of the artists who influenced the burgeoning British folk and blues boom. Within a few years, the company had started recording British artists. The company's philosophy was intentionally eclectic.

== History ==
The label was founded by Englishman [[Nathan Joseph|Nat Joseph]] who started the company at the age of 21 after visiting the US and realizing that there was a wealth of music that was not being made available in the UK to British music fans. Transatlantic imported labels from the US such as the jazz labels [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] and [[Riverside Records|Riverside]] and the [[Tradition Records|Tradition]] folk music label. From the outset, many of the covers included photography and design by Brian Shuel. Transatlantic were also instrumental in the importation of MK records (a Russian classical label), which were then issued with the original Russian labels, but with an English printed sleeve.

The company's first commercial success came not from music but from three [[sex education]] albums. The controversy over these records led to sales approaching 100,000 and the resulting financial lift gave the company money to develop its musical base.

Some of their early records included artists as diverse as [[The Dubliners]], actress [[Sheila Hancock]], jazz singer [[Annie Ross]], actresses [[Jean Hart]] and [[Isla Cameron]], and Shakespearean actor [[Tony Britton]]. They managed to mix the folk music interest with the money making capacity of the sex education records by issuing ''When Dalliance was in Flower'' – a series of bawdy songs performed by [[Ed McCurdy]] and licensed from the American [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] label. As often happened, these were issued first on the Transatlantic label in the UK and then on the subsidiary label XTRA. The catalogue numbers often contained "TRA" within the prefix, thus MTRA, XTRA, and LTRA were all used. The latter prefix was used with a series of LPs produced by Bill Leader (who worked with Nat Joseph from the outset as an engineer). Amongst these "Leader" records were recordings by Nic Jones, Martin Simpson, Mick Ryan, Bandoggs (another Nic Jones group), Andrew Cronshaw, and Al O'Donnell.

With the advent of [[psychedelia]] and [[flower power]] the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved greater success, culminating in the formation of the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]]. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist [[Ron Geesin]], and [[The Purple Gang]], whose "Granny Takes A Trip" was banned by the [[BBC]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/jan/22/obituary-stuart-pevitt/print|title=Stuart Previtt|date=22 January 2009|author=Alex Gunningham|accessdate=2011-08-11|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Columbia Records|CBS]] had  released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with [[The Rock Machine Turns You On]] in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released ''[[Listen Here!]]'' early in 1968. Like 'Rock Machine' the record was priced at 14/11d ([[£]]0.75) – but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price. The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members [[Bert Jansch]] and [[John Renbourn]]. ''Listen Here!'' also served to introduce a new group [[The Sallyangie]], with siblings [[Mike Oldfield|Mike]] and [[Sally Oldfield]].

In 1975, Joseph sold a 75% share of his company to [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]]'s [[Granada Ltd.|Granada Group]] and the company became part of Granada. There was a culture clash between the independent-spirited Transatlantic and the corporate sensibilities of Granada and two years later Granada sold its share in Transatlantic to the [[Marshall Cavendish]] publishing company, which also acquired Joseph's 25% share. The new company was renamed [[Logo Records]]. In the 1990s, Logo Records and the Transatlantic Records catalogue was sold to [[Castle Communications]] (now [[Sanctuary Records]]).

'''''Xenosaga: Pied Piper'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー|Zenosāga: Paido Paipā|lead=yes}}}} is a [[role-playing video game]] co-developed by [[Monolith Soft]], [[Bandai Namco Entertainment|Namco Mobile]], and Tom Create. The game was published by [[Namco]] in 2004 for [[mobile devices]]. A spin-off of the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' trilogy and forming part of the ''[[Xeno (series)|Xeno]]'' metaseries, the storyline follows the human life of cyborg Ziggurat 8—a key character in the ''Xenosaga'' trilogy—a century before the events of ''[[Xenosaga Episode I]]''. Gameplay follows a similar system to the mainline ''Xenosaga'' games but adjusted for mobile devices.

The storyline of ''Pied Piper'' was planned from an early stage, and was incorporated as a mobile title after Monolith Soft was approached by Namco's mobile division. The storyline was written by series creators [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and [[Soraya Saga]]; ''Pied Piper'' would be Saga's last project for the ''Xenosaga'' series. The game's title is a reference to the German legend of the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]. Originally released through Vodafone Live, it would later be released through [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Xenosaga Pied Piper screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A battle in ''Xenosaga: Pied Piper''; while adjusted for mobile devices, several mechanics were carried over from the main ''Xenosaga'' games.]]
Similar to the rest of the ''[[Xenosaga]]'' series, ''Xenosaga: Pied Piper'' is a [[role-playing video game]] in which the player controls a party of characters to progress through environments linked to the main narrative. The player, taking the role of main protagonist Jan Sauer, explores environments from a 2D overhead perspective, with a combination of conversations and cinematic cutscenes advancing the narrative; battles take place in a virtual space tied to the story. Enemies encountered during exploration are fought using a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] battle system carrying over mechanics from ''[[Xenosaga Episode I]]''; characters can save "Boost" points to interrupt an enemy's turn to perform an early action. Each character has specific actions they are specialized at, such as Jan being skilled with knife-based attacks. Actions include standard attacks and special attacks triggered using points accumulated by death blows dealt to enemies in previous battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenosaga.jp/xenosaga1_2/products/piper.html|script-title=ja:ゼノサーガ - ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー|language=Japanese|publisher=Xenosaga Portal Site|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524213143/http://www.xenosaga.jp/xenosaga1_2/products/piper.html|archivedate=24 May 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/mobile/2004/xenosaga/first/|script-title=ja:Mobile - ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー|language=Japanese|publisher=ITMedia|date=2004|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530080332/http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/mobile/2004/xenosaga/first/|archivedate=30 May 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PiedMonolith"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Pied Piper'' is set a century before the events of ''Xenosaga Episode I''; taking place 4000 years in the future, humanity has left Earth and established civilization in another part of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy under the rule of the Galaxy Federation. The story follows Federal Police Special Operations member Jan Sauer investigating a series of terrorist attacks on the Federation's hyperspace transport network U.M.N..&lt;ref name="PiedMonolith"/&gt; The man behind the terrorist attacks is a mysterious figure called Voyager, whose U.M.N.-based crimes are accompanied by cruel attacks on civilian women and children. As he continues to investigate, Jan is forced to navigate sensitive political negotiations between the Federation and the Immigrant Fleet theocracy, who worship an ancient artifact called the Zohar. Jan's investigations reveal Voyager's identity as Erich Webster, a member of their team whose addiction to information led him to become what he is in search of the god-like entity U-DO. On the point of death after his Congress contact Dmitri Yuriev stops providing him with the drugs necessary to counter U-DO's influence, Erich manipulates the Immigrant Fleet to communicate with U-DO through the Zohar. Rejected by U-DO, he is instead granted a new life as a being called a Testament by Wilhelm, immortal CEO of Vector Industries. Having killed everyone close to Jan including his wife and son, Voyager asks him to choose between eternal life as a Testament or being killed by him; Jan instead shoots himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index2.html|script-title=ja:Monolith Soft - ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー - 第1章|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Monolith Soft]]|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060726023503/http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index2.html|archivedate=26 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index3.html|script-title=ja:Monolith Soft - ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー - 第2章|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Monolith Soft]]|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060726160944/http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index3.html|archivedate=26 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index4.html|script-title=ja:Monolith Soft - ゼノサーガ パイド パイパー - 第3章|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Monolith Soft]]|accessdate=9 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725141347/http://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/left/special/pied-piper/index4.html|archivedate=25 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan is later resurrected as the cyborg Ziggurat 8, playing a key role in the events of the ''Xenosaga'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="PiedMonolith"/&gt; Ziggurat 8's history with Voyager is alluded to when the characters cross paths throughout the series, but it is not explained fully until ''[[Xenosaga Episode III]]'', which includes an extensive plot summary of ''Pied Piper'' and major character profiles.

==Development and release==
The story of Ziggy was always part of series creator [[Tetsuya Takahashi]]'s plan for the ''Xenosaga'' project, but Monolith Soft had yet to decide in what form it should be presented.&lt;ref name="Xeno2guide"/&gt; Takahashi later stated that Ziggy's story was originally part of the planned scenario for ''[[Xenosaga Episode II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/xenosaga1_2/interview/index.php|script-title=ja:ゼノサーガ I・II / 原案・監修高橋氏・脚本竹田氏スペシャル対談！|language=Japanese|publisher=Xenosaga I &amp; II Website|accessdate=10 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121185218/http://bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/xenosaga1_2/interview/index.php|archivedate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team were then contacted by the mobile development division of series publisher [[Namco]], asking whether Monolith Soft could work with them on a mobile property. The team decided to use the mobile game to communicate Ziggy's story and agreed to the collaboration. Namco Mobile developed the game, while Monolith Soft handled the story development.&lt;ref name="Xeno2guide"&gt;{{cite book|date=27 July 2004|script-title=ja:ゼノサーガ エピソード2 [善悪の彼岸] 公式コンプリートガイド|trans-title=Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Official Complete Guide|publisher=[[Namco]]|isbn=4-9023-7203-7|pages=358-363}}&lt;/ref&gt; External studio Tom Create helped develop the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomcreate.co.jp/k_rireki.htm|script-title=ja:トムクリエイト　開発履歴|language=Japanese|publisher=Tom Create|accessdate=10 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314193654/http://www.tomcreate.co.jp/k_rireki.htm|archivedate=14 March 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of ''Pied Piper'' formed part of a move by the newly-established lead developers of ''Xenosaga'' to expand the series into other media following the release of ''Episode I''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2004|script-title=ja:週刊ゼノサーガ|journal=Weekly Xenosaga Episode II|issue=3|pages=6-12|publisher=[[SoftBank Group|SoftBank Creative]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's script was co-written by series creators [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] and his wife [[Soraya Saga]].
