The game offers a search feature for books in a number of different ways, including genre, author, and length. Also, players can access introductions for the books, and read about the authors themselves.&lt;ref name="riley"/&gt; An in-game quiz features asks players personality-related questions and recommends certain novels depending on the answers given.

==Reception==
''100 Classic Book Collection'' debuted on UK sales charts at number 17 during its week of release, and moved up to number 8 the following week.&lt;ref name="charts1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jenkins, David | date=January 13, 2009 | title=UK Charts: Wii Fit Sprints Back To Number One | url=http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21828 | work=Gamasutra.com | accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content was well received but critics felt the DS was not a suitable platform. Prior to the advent of [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]], The Guardian newspaper reviewed the game as part of the "minority fad" of e-readers, declaring it bland and impersonal but good value for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anderiesz, Mike | date=January 6, 2009 | title=Guardian review | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/06/classic-book-collection-nintendo-ds | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurogamer magazine criticised Nintendo for only using texts that were out of copyright and for not spending the extra for modern classics. It also found the text difficult to read due to the size of the screen, with unhelpful hyphenations, a low word number per page and distracting animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gibson, Ellie| date=February 9, 2009 | title=Eurogamer review | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/100-classic-book-collection-review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telegraph newspaper agreed that the game offered good value for money but also criticised the size of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Hoggins, Tom| date=January 6, 2009 | title=Telegraph review | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/4142077/100-Classic-Book-Collection-review.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“I don’t feel vindicated, nor do I think I ‘won.’ The cops who committed crimes that night were never tried, arrested, fired, disciplined, or even reprimanded. Instead, Norma and I were charged with a total of six crimes we did not commit, and it took nearly three years to make them disappear. And I still have three more trials coming up for the ‘crime’ of filming the police. The city had eight prosecutors in the courtroom trying this case, and about a dozen police officers were in there to intimidate the jury. When cops and prosecutors are willing to expend such tremendous resources to prosecute a Class C Misdemeanor for political purposes, all Americans should fear their government.”

Despite a half dozen witnesses, two videos and audio evidence of what happened on New Year's Day, the District Attorney did not convene a grand jury in 2012.

They instead indicted him on four Class C misdemeanors. Three for "failure to obey a lawful order" related to his New Year's Day incident, and two follow on arrests. The fourth indictment was for "interfering" in an incident in which he was never arrested. The grand jury also indicted Norma Pizana for resisting arrest.

On December 31, 2013, Buehler, while awaiting trial, sued the [[Austin Police Department]], Police Chief Art Acevedo, Officer Patrick Oborski, Officer Robert Snider, SGT Adam Johnson and Officer Justin Berry for allegedly violating his civil rights beginning with his January 1, 2012 arrest and two additional arrests which occurred on August 26 and September 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-stream-officialblog/2014/1/8/activist-sues-austinpoliceforrighttofilmarrests.html |title=Activist sues Austin police for right to film arrests |publisher= Al Jazeera America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/crime-law/local-activist-antonio-buehler-sues-austin-police-/nccCL/ |title=Local activist Antonio Buehler sues Austin police, officers... |publisher= www.statesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxaustin.com/story/24387637/founder-of-peaceful-streets-project-files-suit-over-right-to-film-arrest Peaceful Streets Project Founder files suit over right to film a] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092704/http://www.myfoxaustin.com/story/24387637/founder-of-peaceful-streets-project-files-suit-over-right-to-film-arrest |date=January 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197418972/Peaceful-Streets-Complaint |title=Peaceful Streets Complaint Traffic Stop Damages|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“We’re in this for the long haul.

On June 2, 2014 the National Press Photographers Association filed an Amicus Brief&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.nppa.org/advocacy/files/2014/06/Buehler-v-City-of-Austin-Amicus-Brief-Filed-06-02-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in support of Buehler's civil lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nppa.org/advocacy/2014/06/02/nppa-files-amicus-brief-supporting-right-to-photograph-and-record-police-in-public/|title=NPPA files Amicus Brief Supporting Right to Photograph and Record Police in Public NPPA Advocacy Committee|date=2 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2014, Federal Judge Mark Lane denied motions by the City of Austin to dismiss the case, finding that private citizens have the right to record officers in public places as they perform their official duties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/crime-law/federal-judge-upholds-activist-antonio-buehlers-ri/ngnbp/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cloudfront-assets.reason.com/assets/db/14063077544714.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Lane also said the officers were not personally immune from allegations that they had arrested and searched him without probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/25/federal-judge-to-camera-shy-austin-cops|title=Federal Judge to Camera-Shy Austin Cops: People Have a Right to Record You.

On February 20, 2015, Judge Mark Lane dismissed the lawsuit based on a Fifth Circuit precedent which stated that an indicted defendant lost their standing to sue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kxan.com/2015/02/20/charges-against-antonio-buehler-dropped-as-well-as-civil-suit-against-apd-dropped/ |title=Charges against Antonio Buehler dropped as well as civil suit against APD|first=Calily|last=Bien|date=21 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to the dismissal, Buehler stated, “We have waited three years for justice, and we are willing to wait even longer to expose APD for the crime they have covered up.” He also noted that the Fifth Circuit precedent provided an incentive for prosecutors to protect corrupt and criminal law enforcement officers through the simple expedient of indicting an otherwise innocent defendant.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/civil-rights-suit-over-filming-austin-officers-dis/nkGDb/ |title=Civil rights suit over filming Austin officers dismissed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buehler and his attorney appealed the decision on February 25, 2015.&lt;ref name="austinchronicle.com"/&gt;

On June 2, 2016, the Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans upheld Judge Mark Lane's decision to dismiss Buehler's lawsuit against the City of Austin and four Austin Police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/appeals-court-rejects-lawsuit-by-filmer-of-austin-/nrYnJ/ |title=Appeals court rejects lawsuit by activist who filmed Austin police|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2016, Buehler filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to have the case heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://certpool.com/dockets/16-729|title=Antonio Francis Buehler v. Austin Police Department, et al., 16-00729 |website=certpool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2017, the National Association for Public Defense, [[Cato Institute]], [[National Press Photographers Association]], and five media organizations filed Amicus briefs in support of Buehler's petition to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/when-you-sue-police-you-should-get-day-court|title=When You Sue the Police, You Should Get Your Day in Court|date=4 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nppa.org/news/nppa-cato-institute-file-scotus-brief-rights-record-police-activity|title=NPPA, Cato Institute File SCOTUS Brief on Rights to Record Police Activity|date=5 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, SCOTUSblog, the leading Supreme Court news site, listed Buehler's lawsuit as the Petition of the Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/02/petition-of-the-day-1085/|title=Petition of the day SCOTUS blog|date=2 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court ultimately did not grant a writ of certiorari for Buehler's suit.

On August 2, 2017, Buehler sued the City of Austin and Austin Police Department employees Randy Dear, Aljoe Garibay, Quint Sebek, Wesley Devries, John Leo Coffey, Monika McCoy, Ryan Adam, Allen Hicks, and Reginald Parker for allegedly violating his civil rights and stemming from his August 2, 2015 arrest in downtown Austin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/news/local/cop-watching-activist-antonio-buehler-sues-city-austin-police-officers/8ytXGa2GxysDC7huPJFjHO/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kxan.com/2017/08/02/founder-of-peaceful-streets-project-files-suit-against-austin-9-officers/|title=Founder of Peaceful Streets Project files suit against Austin, 9 officers|first=Calily|last=Bien|date=2 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent arrests and charges==

===August 24, 2012===
In the early morning hours of August 24, 2012, while cop watching with members of the Peaceful Streets Project in downtown Austin, Buehler recorded an undercover officer, Justin Berry, helping uniformed police officers arrest women for underage drinking. Although Buehler wasn't arrested for filming Berry, he was later indicted on a Class C Misdemeanor charge of "interference with public duties." Buehler was scheduled to stand trial on January 6, 2015.  On January 2, 2015, the City of Austin requested the trial judge dismiss all charges against Buehler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelibertybeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10738827_389967334496076_2129256336_n.pdf State vs. Antonio Buehler]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} thelibertybeat.com, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of September 21, 2012, while cop watching with members of the Peaceful Streets Project in downtown Austin, Buehler was again arrested, this time with fellow police accountability activist Sarah Dickerson&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaltexan.net/2012/austin-local-news/peaceful-streets-project-leader-antonio-buehler-arrested-recording-austin-police/article40293/ Activist Antonio Buehler arrested again by Austin police] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101215628/http://digitaltexan.net/2012/austin-local-news/peaceful-streets-project-leader-antonio-buehler-arrested-recording-austin-police/article40293/ |date=November 1, 2013 }} digitaltexan.net&lt;/ref&gt; Video indicates that both Buehler and Dickerson were silently filming and were further back than APD's self-described desired distance from a scene. According to Buehler and other witnesses, after refusing an order to walk toward the arresting officer and the suspect in order to join other members of the Peaceful Street Project, and despite continually asking how far he needed to move back, and continuing to move back away from the scene, Buehler was given an ultimatum to either join other members of the Peaceful Streets Project, or leave. When Buehler said he was leaving, he was arrested. As Dickerson filmed Buehler's arrest, she too was arrested. Both were charged with "interfering with public duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailytexanonline.com/news/2012/09/25/a-new-lense-for-arrest A new lense for arrest] [[The Daily Texan]], September 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.firedoglake.com/kitoconnell/2012/09/24/peacefulstreets-project-more-unconstitutional-copwatching-arrests-in-austin/ More Unconstitutional Copwatching Arrests in Austin], MyFDL, September 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copblock.org/21415/activists-response-to-arrests-of-herself-and-antonio-buehler/|title=Activist's Response to Arrests of Herself and Antonio Buehler - Cop Block|date=24 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XT2kqBlr5k The THIRD False Arrest of Antonio Buehler (Founder, Peaceful Streets Project)] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Austin Police Department confiscated both Buehler and Dickerson's cameras and have not yet returned them.

That trial was postponed at the request of the prosecutor. A new trial was then scheduled for May 20, 2015.

===Austin, TX charges dropped===
Between jury trials scheduled for January and February 2015, the outstanding criminal charges stemming from the August 24, 2015, August 26, 2015, and September 21, 2015 incidents were dropped.  On January 5, 2015, the state's motion to drop one set of charges was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2015-01-05/buehlers-case-dismissed/ Buehler's Case Dismissed], austinchronicle.com, January 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The final set of charges pending against Buehler were similarly dropped on February 19, 2015, "clearing the way for a meeting between city prosecutors and the police accountability activist in federal court" on March 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2015-02-19/final-charges-dropped-for-buehler/ Final Charges Dropped], austinchronicle.com, March 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 20, one day after the last of the charges were dropped, "Judge Mark Lane dismissed Buehler’s federal civil lawsuit against the Austin Police Department and its officers." &lt;ref&gt;[http://kxan.com/2015/02/20/charges-against-antonio-buehler-dropped-as-well-as-civil-suit-against-apd-dropped/ Charges against Antonio Buehler dropped as well as civil suit against APD], kxan.com, February 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/civil-rights-suit-over-filming-austin-officers-dis/nkGDb/ Civil rights suit over filming Austin officers dismissed] statesman.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 2, 2015===
On August 2, 2015, Buehler was cop watching with members of the Peaceful Streets Project and Film the Police-Portland in downtown Austin. At multiple points throughout the night, Austin Police officers approached him and told him to step back while he was filming them. At approximately 1:45&amp;nbsp;a.m., SGT Randy Dear called his subordinate officers into a huddle, and when he emerged he approached Buehler again and told him that "the next time we go to a disturbance and y'all get in the way ... the next time you're interfering, you're going to be arrested." When Buehler asked for a clarification on how what the cop watchers were doing qualified as interference, Dear said, "You've been warned, sir." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ktkUingcOs APD arrests Antonio Buehler &amp; Mike Bluehair (Camera 1)] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Buehler then turned to CPL Quint Sebek and Officer Aljoe Garibay to get clarification, and Sebek responded by filming Buehler with his phone, and Garibay stated that Buehler was interfering by being in their way when they were rushing toward disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIFItJeCM5c APD arrests Antonio Buehler &amp; Mike Bluehair (Camera 2)] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; Dear then came back, positioned himself inches away from Buehler, and ignored Buehler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvE8qGIUPm0 APD arrests Antonio Buehler &amp; Mike Bluehair (Camera 3)] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; A little over one minute later, Dear turned to Buehler and told him that he had to step back because they were about to go on patrol. While protesting what he believed was an illegal order, Buehler stepped away from Dear, but was still arrested. He was later charged with "interference with public duties" and "resisting arrest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/news/crime-law/austin-police-arrest-activist-antonio-buehler-afte/nnBph/ Austin police arrest activist Antonio Buehler after recording officers] Austin American-Statesman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2015/08/austin-police-arrest-peaceful-streets-founder-antonio-buehler-again-for-recording-cops-in-public/ Austin Police Arrest Peaceful Streets Founder Antonio Buehler Again for Recording Cops in Public] PINAC&lt;/ref&gt; As Buehler was trying to hand off his cameras to other Peaceful Streets Project members, Mike "Bluehair" Smith from Film the Police-Portland was also arrested for "interference with public duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keyetv.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/Austin-Activist-Antonio-Buehler-Arrested-179462.shtml Austin Activist Antonio Buehler Released from Jail] KEYE TV&lt;/ref&gt; In the days following the arrest, Buehler and the Peaceful Streets Project publicly disputed the claims made by the Austin Police Department.

==Public Safety Commission==

In May 2015, Buehler was nominated to serve on the Austin Public Safety Commission by Council Member Don Zimmerman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/activist-antonio-buehler-nominated-for-austin-publ/nk8ff/ [Activist Antonio Buehler nominated for Austin Public Safety Commission], www.statesman.com, May 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kxan.com/2015/05/04/antonio-buehler-nominated-for-public-safety-commission/ [Police critic Antonio Buehler nominated for Public Safety Commission], KXAN, May 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Austin Police Association immediately began lobbying the city council to keep Buehler off of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101638642668753&amp;set=a.863957480123.2357161.200034&amp;type=1 [APA email] Facebook, May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while Buehler claimed that his place on the commission was needed in the interest of diversity of thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myfoxaustin.com/clip/11468311/antonio-buehler-in-studio-interview [Antonio Buehler in-studio interview] myfoxaustin.com, May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing from nearly a dozen community member supporting the nomination, Buehler said that City Council ultimately buckled under the pressure from the Austin Police Association and refused to vote on his nomination by not approving a waiver to his residency status.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/austintexasgov/status/596356185277800448 www.twitter.com/austintexasgov, May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2015-05-08/council-says-no-to-buehler/ [Council Says "No" to Buehler, Refuses to waive residency requirement to sit on commission], austinchronicle.com, May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://video.statesman.com/Antonio-Buehler-speaks-after-City-Council-vote-29033627?playlistId=15517 [Antonio Buehler speaks after City Council vote], www.statesman.com, May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Eight minutes later the City Council approved the same waiver for another commission nominee.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/austintexasgov/status/596358128209403905 www.twitter.com/austintexasgov, May 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Immediately following the killing of a Deputy in Houston, TX, Buehler used the Peaceful Streets Project Facebook page to post a controversial statement that read, "Pig executed in Houston. Probably shouldn't have joined a criminal gang. His bad decisions caught up with him. Blame his parents. Or the scores of thousands of pigs who abuse people every month in America. #thuglife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/PeacefulStreets/posts/965572003502696|title=Peaceful Streets Project|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin Police Chief Hubert Art Acevedo reposted a screenshot of the post on his Twitter account with the commentary, "This is how mind of so-called peaceful activist works &amp; why police officers don't want him inches from their face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/artacevedo/status/637638327814897664|title=Chief Art Acevedo on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acevedo's statement repeated the narrative that was used to justify Buehler's arrest earlier that month, that Buehler claims were later disproven by video that the Peaceful Streets Project released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacefulstreets.com/2015/08/press-release-breaking-videos-austin-police-affidavit-proven-false-by-peaceful-streets-project-videos-video-proves-illegal-and-unconstitutional-arrests/|title=BREAKING VIDEOS: Austin Police Affidavit Proven False by Peaceful Streets Project Videos; Video Proves Illegal and Unconstitutional Arrests|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the media ran multiple stories questioning Buehler's choice of words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/herman-peaceful-streets-unpeaceful-tweets/nnWcB/&lt;/ref&gt; Buehler argued that he was using the same rhetoric police used after they killed suspects to highlight their hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacefulstreets.com/2015/08/the-hypocrisy-of-the-police-and-their-supporters-perpetuate-violence/|title=The hypocrisy of the police and their supporters perpetuate violence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buehler and the Peaceful Streets Project would repeatedly tweet Chief Hubert Art Acevedo over the following months to highlight that Deputy Goforth was killed while cheating on his wife with a mistress at a gas station while he was supposed to be on duty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/miles-goforth/article/Defense-Goforth-was-meeting-a-mistress-at-the-6519432.php|title=Defense: Goforth was meeting a woman at the time of his death|date=21 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2439959/darren-goforth-deputy-slain-at-gas-station-was-with-his-mistress-when-killed-affidavit-shows/|title=Darren Goforth: Deputy Slain At Gas Station Was With His Mistress When Killed, Affidavit Shows|date=22 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3241974/Mistress-slain-Houston-police-deputy-car-murdered-gas-station.html|title=Police deputy's 'mistress' was in the car with him when he was shot|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Deputy Goforth did indeed make a series of bad decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PeacefulStreets/status/676855112225034240|title=Peaceful Streets on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PeacefulStreets/status/676856822288941056|title=Peaceful Streets on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bgreymatter/status/668847811169943553|title=Baron of Greymatter on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Hubert Art Acevedo would later go to the media to again complain about Buehler's words after he responded to an Austin Police Officer getting shot in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvue.com/news/local/acevedo-blasts-peaceful-streets-comments/119479965|title=APD Chief Acevedo blasts Peaceful Streets comments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buehler has repeatedly claimed that "all cops are cowards," and that "cops are terrorist scum." His repeated use of these phrases has irked his critics, including Austin Police Chief Acevedo and Austin Police Association President Ken Casaday.  On July 8, 2016, the German paper Kurier ran an article about Buehler calling cops terrorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurier.at/chronik/weltchronik/copwatcher-in-texas-polizisten-sind-terroristen/208.626.122 |title=Copwatcher in Texas: "Polizisten sind Terroristen"|first=Thomas|last=Trescher|language=German|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the high-profile police killings of [[Alton Sterling]] and [[Philando Castile]], and the killing of five Dallas Police Officers by Micah Xavier Johnson.

==Accolades==

'''Bentley Schaad''' (1925–1999), was a California modernist and art educator.

Bentley Schaad was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Moure, Nancy ''California Art: 450 Years of Painting &amp; Other Media''&lt;/ref&gt; As an art student, he attended [[Jepson Art Institute]], the [[Art Center College of Design|Art Center]] in Pasadena and the [[Claremont Colleges]]. A pupil, and later a colleague, of [[Henry Lee McFee]], Schaad learned the principles of line, color and form. His proficiency as an artist and his technical aesthetic innovations enabled him to begin teaching art at [[Otis College of Art and Design|Otis Art Institute]]. Schaad spent the majority of his career as an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Schaad, ''The Realm of Contemporary Still Life Painting''&lt;/ref&gt;

Schaad was a prolific artist in the West Coast modernist movement along with [[Henry Lee McFee]], [[Rico Lebrun]] and [[Richard Haines]]. Schaad utilized many concepts of the modernist aesthetic in his work. His paintings were often composed of many broken planes of color — with a concentration on shape, form and structure of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Alissa J., ''Bentley Schaad: California Modernist''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">'''Bright Flight''' is a [[Missouri]] merit-based scholarship with a current maximum amount of $3000 per annum to Missouri's qualifying graduating high school seniors who enroll in a Missouri accredited college or university. The actual amount of the scholarship is determined based upon state funding and is sometimes less than the maximum amount.  From June 2004 to July 2005, 8390 students were enrolled in the Bright Flight program, which totaled over $15 million in state expenditures.

==Qualifications and renewal==
*To qualify for the Bright Flight maximum award of $3000 per year, a student must be in the top 3% of his or her statewide high school class as determined by normalized tests, the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] and [[SAT]] composite scores. To date and for several years, a score of 31 or above on the ACT or an SAT-equivalent score qualifies, but the score can change each year.  A composite score of 31 will be needed to qualify for the college freshmen in the 2017-2018 school year.
*The law also qualifies students in the 4th and 5th percentiles to receive a $1000 per year maximum scholarship; however, the Missouri Legislature has not funded this award in recent years, and these students have received no actual financial award.  An ACT composite score of 30 (or above) qualified for the 4th and 5th percentile for college freshmen in the 2017-2018 school year and recent years.
*To continue receiving the scholarship, students must maintain at least a 2.5 [[GPA]] in college and maintain full-time student status to renew the scholarship, which can be renewed for up to five years.
*Students must not be pursuing a degree in [[theology]] or [[divinity]].  
*Bright Flight students must attend school continuously.  They cannot cease attending school, except to work for a non-profit organization, hold a government job, or serve in the armed services. Academic interruption must not exceed 27 months.

==History==
Appropriated by the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1986, students initially received a statutory maximum of $2000 per year.  Many students and higher education officials have observed that tuition expenses at the [[University of Missouri]], for example, were below $2000 in 1987 and thus were '''fully covered''' by Bright Flight at its introduction. In 2017, following a period of increases in tuition expenses that easily outpaced [[inflation]], Bright Flight covered only a fraction of the more than $11,000 a typical student spent on tuition at the University of Missouri.

==Recent developments==

On August 12, 2010, state budget cuts reduced the amount from $2000/year to $1500/year for that year.

On November 25, 2013, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced at a college preparatory school in Kansas City, Missouri that he included a proposal in Missouri's 2015 budget that would offer an option to receive up to $5,000 extra per year if recipients stayed in Missouri after finishing college for the number of years they received Bright Flight. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksmu.org/article/nixon-new-bright-flight-scholarship-deal-students-who-stay-work-missouri-72779 |title=Archived Document |accessdate=2013-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003855/http://ksmu.org/article/nixon-new-bright-flight-scholarship-deal-students-who-stay-work-missouri-72779 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CASPA''' or the '''Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistants''' is an application service for graduate-level [[Physician assistant|PA]] programs. Similar to the [[Common Application]] used by some undergraduate institutions and the [[American Medical College Application Service]] used by medical schools, CASPA allows students to submit one application to multiple schools. The CASPA application platform is a service offered by the [http://paeaonline.org/ Physician Assistant Education Association] (PAEA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pafocus.org/caspa/ PA Focus: CASPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CASPA application service launched in 2001 with 68 participating physician assistant programs, and mailed over 16,000 applications to its member schools. The original service consisted of the CASPA Applicant Portal, which interfaced with students, and the CASPA Admissions Portal, or PA Admit, an admissions software which interfaced directly with PA schools. Completed applications were printed and mailed to programs via postal mail. In 2011, CASPA moved from the PA AdMIT admissions software to WebADMIT, a web-based admissions application which allows schools to receive and review applications online rather than receiving them by mail. Today, over 180 PA programs use CASPA, which accounts for 90% of ARC-PA accredited physician assistant programs in the United States. CASPA annually processes over 100,000 applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paeaonline.org/ The Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, CASPA moved its Applicant Portal to an entirely new software platform, called  CAS 3.0. New aspects of the platform included a visual, image-based user interface as opposed to the previous text-based interface, and all payments and fee waiver submission forms moved to an entirely electronic format. The platform also included the addition of "Program Materials," a section of the application in which PA programs could configure and collect specific documentation and other information for their program directly through the CASPA application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQvZ9BjjdF0 The Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA) 3.0 CASPA Demo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member Programs==
PA Programs must be accredited by ARC-PA and be a member of PAEA in order to participate in CASPA as full-fledged programs. New PA programs who have applied for, but not yet received accreditation from ARC-PA may participate for one application cycle as a "developing program." All programs which participate in CASPA are graduate-level programs which require that students have completed at least some college-level coursework prior to applying. The small number of bachelor's degree-level PA programs which accept students straight from high school study do not use the CASPA application. Applicants may determine whether or not the programs they are interested in applying to use CASPA by searching the [http://directory.paeaonline.org/ PA Program Directory].&lt;ref&gt;[http://directory.paeaonline.org/ PA Program Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
CASPA is open for applicants to apply to PA programs for roughly eleven months each year. Its open period, called an "application cycle," runs annually from mid-April through March 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.caspaonline.org/caspaHelpPages/about-caspaoverview/ CASPA Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; To use the application, applicants must register a user account and fill out standard blocks of application material which is sent to all programs to which they apply. Standard application information includes personal information, academic history, work experience, health care certifications, awards and honors received, professional memberships, references, standardized test scores, and a personal essay documenting an applicant's interest in the physician assistant profession. Applicants must also submit official academic transcripts to CASPA and request at least three letters of reference in order to submit their applications to a PA program. All of this information is provided once and accessed by each school to which the applicant chooses to apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.unicas.com:8888/caspaHelpPages/frequently-asked-questions/index.html CASPA Instructions and FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PA programs themselves have varying deadlines which occur during each application cycle. Those deadlines also have varying requirements based upon the individual PA program, which the applicants must research and adhere to in order to be considered by the school. PA programs also document their additional requirements on the "Program Materials" section of the CASPA application, where they have the ability to require additional documents to be uploaded, questions to be answered, and/or prerequisite courses to be marked as completed in order for an applicant to submit their application to that program specifically. Applying to PA programs via CASPA costs $177 for an application to be submitted to one school, and an additional $51 for each subsequent school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://portal.caspaonline.org/caspaHelpPages/frequently-asked-questions/school-information/submitting-paymentsfee-waivers/index.html CASPA Fees and Payments FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some PA programs charge supplemental application fees or require applicants to submit supplemental documentation.

'''Children's Discovery Museum''' is a [[museum]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].

The museum, which is targeted at children, opened in 2001 on the northern edge of the [[Chatuchak Weekend Market]]. The museum has eight different sections in three buildings, providing hands on experience into science, nature, culture and society.

In the first building "Tortawan Building", there is the Body and Mind Gallery which provides children with the knowledge about their own physiology and mechanics of the [[human brain]] and body.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailandguidebook.com/childrensmuseum.html|title=Bangkok:Children's Discovery Museum|publisher=Thailand Guidebook|accessdate=September 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511181353/http://www.thailandguidebook.com/childrensmuseum.html|archivedate=May 11, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Culture and Society Gallery,there are realistic displays of traditional [[drum]]s, languages and folk music from Thailand and other parts of the world. There is a small music room for practice. The Technology Gallery demonstrates technology such as [[electricity]] and appliances, auto [[engine]]s, and [[radio]] and [[television]] production.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

In the second building "Sairoong", is the big backyard, creative library and auditorium.

In the third building "Chakkravan", the Nature and Environment gallery which teaches children about living species and biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

On Sunday, 19 Sept, 2010, the Museum was closed, due to financial and operational management issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/302392/children-museums-getting-back-on-track|accessdate=16 August 2012|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive redevelopment and modernisation has been recommended by a working committee set up by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] with a target of reopening parts of the Museum in late 2012/early 2013. Financing for the redevelopment project is currently being sought.

'''Daniel Harold Casriel''' (March 1, 1924 &amp;ndash; June 7, 1983) was an American [[psychiatrist]], [[psychoanalyst]] and writer from [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;The New York Times; Obituary June 10, 1983, Friday Late City Final Edition, Section D, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today. His novel road map to happiness evolved into a framework for the field of [[relationship education]] as the [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] relationship roadmap for couples.&lt;ref name="BuildingRelationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMaria|first1=Rita|title=Building Intimate Relationships|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1135454396|pages=28-31|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Casriel also founded the [[Daytop]] treatment centers.

==Early life and education==
Daniel Harold Casriel was born in New York City on 1 March, 1924.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Cincinnati]] College of Medicine in 1949 at age twenty-five. In 1950, he began his residency at the Kingsbridge Veterans' Administration Hospital in the [[Bronx]]. Eight months into his residency he was drafted by the military and sent to [[Okinawa]] where he served as an Army psychiatrist for a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry In The U.S. Army: Lessons for Community Psychiatry By Albert Julius Glass, Franklin D. Jones, p.189 http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA434841&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Professional training===
Casriel was a trainee at the Columbia Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research between 1949 and 1953 and spent 7½ years in analysis Dr. Abram Kardiner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/kardiner-abram |title=Abram Kardiner: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date=1981-07-20 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the founder of the first psychoanalytic institute in the United States and a former analysand of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Casriel was also a past president of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians.

===Private practice===
In the winter of 1953 Casriel began private practice as a psychiatrist in New York City.  Shortly thereafter he was appointed as a psychiatric consultant to the Metropolitan Hospital in East Harlem and the Court of Special Sessions in Manhattan where he became active in the treatment drug addicts.

===Writer===
In July 1962 Casriel visited the famous [[Synanon]] therapeutic community on the US West coast. So impressed with what he saw there, he moved into the community for a “closer look” and wrote a book about the experience ( "So Fair A House: The story of Synanon"). In February 1963, Casriel gave $2000 to seven members of Synanon to start a community on the East Coast. The result was a house on Greens Farm Road, [[Westport, Connecticut]] directed by Jack Hurst, former president of Synanon in Santa Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jFcmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EQEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1854%2C803173 |title=Sunday Herald; Oct 6, 1963, Page 25 "Synanon Work Extolled by Mag" |publisher=News.google.com |date=1963-10-06 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultancy===
In the summer of the same year, Casriel became the psychiatric consultant for the [[Daytop| Daytop Lodge]] project on Staten Island, a kind of half-way house for the rehabilitation of convicted felons who were addicts. Later, he became cofounder, psychiatric director and medical superintendent of Daytop Village, now one of the world’s largest therapeutic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytop.org/history.html |title=The History of Daytop New York In Substance Abuse Treatment |publisher=Daytop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222234947/http://www.daytop.org/history.html |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;November 21, 1968, Vol. XIV, No. 6 Schism on 14th Street: The Daytop Explosion

Below, left, Casriel, assists a patient in expressing his anger and feeling of pain ''The New Identity Process'', 1973.]]

===Experiments===
In the fall of 1963, Casriel, now age 39,  began experimenting with group therapy in his private practice in New York.  He began leading groups alone and with peer group leaders like  David A. Deitch, the Synanon director at Westport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |title=David Deitch, Ph.D |publisher=Psychiatry.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055018/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/ddeitch.html |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 he released his findings to the public in a book titled "A Scream Away From Happiness" where he describes [[bonding psychotherapy|The New Identity Process]], a group psychotherapy that uses screaming, hugging and affirmations of basic needs.

===Methods===
By the late 1960s, Dr Casriel had extended his private practice to include a small [[therapeutic community]] on the top four floors of his office building. This program he called AREBA, short for ''A''ccelerated ''R''e-education of The ''E''motions, ''B''ehavior and ''A''ttitudes. It consisted of about a dozen beds for young addicts who came to live, "work" and participate in the "New Identity Process". When Casriel died in 1983,  former patient [[Steven Yohay]] expanded the program and became president of AREBA Casriel, Inc.,  today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States.

In the late 1970s, Casriel began teaching his method in several European centers. The German psychiatrist Dr. Walther H. Lechler became one of his students and later employed the ideas extensively in the development of the Herrenalb Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klinik-bad-herrenalb.com/en/content.php?Cont=therapie_konzept&amp;Navi=therapie |title=Celenus Kliniken - Gesundheit als Aufgabe |publisher=Klinik-bad-herrenalb.com |date=2011-12-28 |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of psychotherapy used at the hospital of the same name in South Germany. Another trainee was the Danish psychoanalyst, [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] sanyassin and mystic, Shanti Kristian Dahl-Madsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418125732/http://www.uniomystica.se/meetShanti.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-18 |title=uniomystica.se/index.html |publisher=Uniomystica.se |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He incorporated the new identity process into a life-affirmative approach to spirituality he called  'Spiritual Hedonism',

Casriel's method of [[group psychotherapy]] is continued today through the efforts of the International Society of Bonding Psychotherapy which has members in 8 European cities as well as North and South America.

==Influence==

Casriel's novel concept of a "Relationship Road Map" became the foundation of [[PAIRS Foundation|PAIRS']] approach to [[relationship education]]. Expanding on [[Horace Mann]]'s focus on the pursuit of happiness as a universal human desire, Casriel theorized that the emotion of love comes from the anticipation of pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=DeMaria, Rita |title=Building Intimate Relationships |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn= 978-1583910764 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Casriel's theory, "bonding," which he defined as "the unique combination of emotional openness and physical closeness with another human being," is central to sustaining healthy, intimate relationships. Casriel taught that symptoms of bonding deprivation include: "illness, fatigue, depression, rigidity, constriction, isolation, and the range of anti-social behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse, gambling and sex addictions." Casriel considered bonding a biologically-based need similar to the need for food, water, air, and shelter, yet unique as the only biologically-based need people cannot meet for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eisenberg, Seth |author2=PAIRS Foundation |title=PAIRS Essentials |publisher=PAIRS Foundation |location=Florida |year=2007 |pages=72 |isbn= 0985427817 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casriel_web"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casriel|first1=Daniel|title=Quest for Emotional Health|url=https://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/20/quest-for-emotional-health/|website=www.danielcasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Casriel died at his home in Manhattan on 7 June 1983 age 59 from a form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ([[ALS]]). He is survived by his wife, the former Olivia Cohen; two sons, Seth, a film editor and producer,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0143885/&lt;/ref&gt; and Lyle, a financial adviser.&lt;ref&gt;https://financialservicesinc.ubs.com/fa/lylecasriel/{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''e-engineering''' is a concept that results from the concatenation of two previous ideas: [[distance learning]] and [[remote laboratories]].
Distance learning education has been around since the XIX century when the development of the mail services in England enabled the delivering of correspondence courses by mail. In the second half of the XX century, audio and television players where the first technological means used to deliver new, more engaging distance learning courses. And despite keeping the same way to communicate with students, the now more fast and reliable postal services, the materials were then much more diversified, ranging from carefully constructed texts and audio and video records to conventional broadcast radio and television, in this case, open to all, students and non-students. These were complemented by live individual or group sessions over the phone, between instructor and students, or among students, enabling real interactive teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "Combining E-Technologies &amp; E-Pedagogies to Create Online Undergraduate Courses in Engineering – an Example of a Successful Experience". ''Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies'', Barcelona, July 2016, pp 4209-4218.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the breakthrough that represents a true turning point in distance learning was the introduction of the concept of e-learning during the 90s, boosted by the two most significant advances in the telecommunications area – the Internet network and the invention of the World Wide Web. With the Internet a fast, reliable and interactive channel of communication between instructor and students or among students was now available, enabling a degree of interaction never achieved before in distance learning and comparable to face-to-face classes. On the other hand, the World Wide Web with its hypertext links enabled the construction of much more diversified and engaging materials, supported by audio, image, and video, readily available and highly interactive. This revolution was accompanied by the massification of personal computers, which made them accessible and affordable. In a decade, from 1990 to 2000, these very expensive machines, complicated to operate and whose access was almost restricted to scientist and engineers and to technical university students, became an indispensable household equipment.
In spite of all these advances, the undergraduate courses on offer were nevertheless restricted. Engineering courses which require the access to specific chemistry, physics, mechanics, electrical machines, electronics or optics laboratories and real-time interaction with equipment and instrumentation, where not available at distance.
This reality is changing due to the creation of remotely accessible laboratories that enable students to perform hands-on lab work remotely, with a level of interactivity and realism never achieved before. A lot of work is being done in the past decade in the area of remote laboratories. In the specialized literature, it is possible to find many examples of different labs for different areas of physics and electrical engineering,&lt;ref&gt;Farah, S., A. Benachenhou, G. Neveux and D. Barataud. "Design of a Flexible Hardware Interface for Multiple Remote Electronic Practical Experiments of Virtual Laboratory". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 8(2), pp. 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priem,F., R. De Craemer, J. Calu, F. Pedreschi, T. Zimmer, S. Saïghi and J. Lilja. "E-Learning in Science and Technology via a Common Learning Platform in a Lifelong Learning Project". ''European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning'' (1), 24 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, N., G. R. Alves and M. Gericota. "An Integrated Reusable Remote Laboratory to Complement Electronics Teaching". ''IEEE Trans. on Learning Technologies'' 3(3), pp. 265-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gravier, C., J. Fayolle, B. Bayard, M. Ates and J. Lardon. "State of the Art About Remote Laboratories Paradigms – Foundations of Ongoing Mutations". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 4(1), pp. 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawfik, M., E. Sancristobal, S. Martin, G. Diaz and M. Castro. "State-of-the-art remote laboratories for industrial electronics applications". ''Proc. Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching'', pp. 359-364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albu, M. M., K. E. Holbert, G. T. Heydt, S. Dan Grigorescu and V. Truşcă. "Embedding Remote Experimentation in Power Engineering Education". ''IEEE Trans. on Power Systems'' 19(1), pp. 139-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hercog, D., B. Gergič, S. Uran, K. Jezernik. "A DSP-Based Remote Control Laboratory". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 54(6), pp. 3057-3068.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restivo, M. T., J. Mendes, A. M. Lopes, C. M. Silva and F. Chouzal. "A Remote Laboratory in Engineering Measurement". ''IEEE Trans. on Industrial Electronics'' 56(12), pp. 4836-4843.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García-Zubia, J., I. Angulo, J. Irurzun, P. Orduña, J. Ruiz, U. Hernández, M. Castro and E. Sancristobal. "Easily Integrable Platform for the Deployment of a Remote Laboratory for Microcontrollers". ''International Journal of Online Engineering'' 6(3), pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, A. and P. Gil. "Online Learning in Engineering Courses Using Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks". ''International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy'' 3(1), pp. 76-80.&lt;/ref&gt; each one allowing different degrees of freedom in the configuration of the experiment by the remote user. 
The integration of these remote laboratories as part of fully online undergraduate programs in engineering areas enabled the creation of e-engineering courses. These are e-learning courses in engineering areas where students perform their hands-on laboratory work remotely interacting in real-time with equipment and instrumentation available online 24/7.
The first example of one such course is the L3-EOLES (Electronics and Optics e-Learning for Embedded Systems) course, an entirely online English-taught 3rd year bachelor's degree in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Gericota M. et al. "EOLES course - The first accredited online degree course in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems". ''Proceedings of the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference'', Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia, March 2015, pp 410-417.&lt;/ref&gt; The course, that started being offered in the school year 2014/15, is currently in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu G. et al. "Overview of the first year of the L3-EOLES training", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation'', Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, Madrid, February 2016, pp 396-399.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed as a specialization year, this course is oriented towards a currently expanding field in the electrical and computer engineering area, the field of electronics and optics for embedded systems. This area of knowledge requires students to be able to perform experimental work to acquire the expected technical experimental skills. The execution of laboratory assignments over the Internet required the development of remotely accessible experimental laboratories enabling students to interact in real-time with real experimental setups. This innovative training has been accredited by the educational authorities in Tunisia, Morocco, and France.&lt;ref&gt;E-learning tools. L3-EOLES - The university of future at home!

Following independence from the [[Soviet Union]], a major economic depression cut "public financing" for '''education in Kazakhstan''', "which dropped from 6% of [[gross domestic product]] in 1991 to about 3% in 1994, before rising to 4% in 1999." Elementary- and secondary-school teachers remain badly underpaid; in 1993 more than 30,000 teachers (or about one-seventh of the 1990 teaching staff) left education, many of them to seek more lucrative employment.

In 1994 [[Kazakhstan]] had 8,575 elementary and secondary schools (grades one through eleven) attended by approximately 3.2 million students, and 244 specialized secondary schools with about 222,000 students. In 1992 about 51 percent of eligible children were attending some 8,500 preschools in Kazakhstan. In 1994 some 272,100 students were enrolled in the republic's sixty-one institutes of higher learning. Fifty-four percent of the students were Kazakh, and 31 percent were Russian.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Kazakhstan's 1995 constitution provides mandatory, socialized secondary school education. Citizens compete for socialized institutions of higher learning. Private education is increasing in the country, with about 5% of students enrolled in the private schools that remain largely under arbitrary state control.

In 2000, the Government of [[Kazakhstan]] joined the governments of the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]] and [[Tajikistan]], and [[Aga Khan IV|the Aga Khan]] to establish the world’s first internationally chartered institution of higher education, the [[University of Central Asia]] &lt;small&gt;[http://www.ucentralasia.org (UCA)]&lt;/small&gt;. The UCA will have three campuses of equal size and stature in each of the founding countries. The Kazakh campus is under construction in [[Tekeli, Kazakhstan|Tekeli]] in the [[Zhetysu]] region, 35 minutes east of the regional capital [[Taldykorgan]], and three hours by car from [[Almaty]]. The UCA will benefit from the resources of the [[Aga Khan Development Network]] to offer an internationally recognized standard of higher education in [[Central Asia]]. Currently, the University operates a [[University of Central Asia#School of Professional and Continuing Education|School of Professional and Continuing Education]] &lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061019184742/http://ucentralasia.org/spce.htm (SPCE)]&lt;/small&gt;, with a [[University of Central Asia#School of Undergraduate Studies|School of Undergraduate Studies]] and a [[University of Central Asia#Graduate School of Development|Graduate School of Development]] in the process of being established.

In 2002 [[Asian Development Bank]] provided technical assistance to Kazakhstan to identify key issues and priorities in the education sector and to contribute to strengthening the government's education sector development strategy.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;[http://www.adb.org/projects/34460-012/details 34460-012: Education Sector Development Strategy] Asian Development Bank&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] provided 137 [[Peace Corps]] members to "work in education and [[NGO]] development" in 2004.&lt;ref name=PEACECORPS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/fs/35987.htm U.S. Assistance to Kazakhstan - Fiscal Year 2004] U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazakhstan has a 99.1% literacy rate for males and 97.7% for females as of 1999.&lt;ref name=LITERACY&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html Kazakhstan] CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] visited [[Kazakhstan]] from 12–13 October 2006, she said "The future of any state depends on its level of education. This is my fourth visit to Kazakhstan, I have already been to [[Atyrau]] and [[Almaty]] and I have been able to see for myself the high level of education of your nation, which is a key to success of any country."&lt;ref name=STANDARDS&gt;[http://www.kazind.com/newsarchives/newsvol44.html Official visit of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Kazakhstan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310222930/http://www.kazind.com/newsarchives/newsvol44.html |date=2007-03-10 }} Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the Republic of India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process of education==

===Kindergarten===
The [[Constitution]] of the Republic of [[Kazakhstan]] protects the right to access to [[kindergarten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlam.kz/en/constitution|title=Официальный сайт Парламента Республики Казахстан|author=|date=|website=www.parlam.kz|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children typically start [[kindergarten]] at age 5. As of 2004, there were 100 [[kindergartens]] in the nation (83 public, 4 directly under the Ministry of Education, and 13 private) and 135 856 children enrolled in kindergartens (or 63% of the 5- and 6-year-olds). All [[kindergartens]] are expected to teach Kazakh and Russian, and most emphasize one language over the other.

One major problem has been the reduction of the number of [[kindergartens]], due to the lack of state funding and virtually non-existence of private sources of money. There are also reported declines in the quality of [[kindergartens]] including a lack of hot meal or low quality food served and buildings in poor repair.&lt;ref name="
UNDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kz.undp.org/content/kazakhstan/en/home/404.html|title=404|author=|date=|website=UNDP in Kazakhstan|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary school===
[[Primary school]] in [[Kazakhstan]] typically starts at age 7 (some parents send their children to school, when they turn 6, very rarely - 8) and runs from years 1 – 4. Classes typically run in two sessions, from 8 until 1 and from 2 until 7, with students either going to class in the morning or in the afternoon. All [[primary schools]] are state-owned and primary and secondary education are constitutionally protected rights.

The curriculum for both primary and [[secondary school]] is established by the Ministry of Education, with little choice left up to the individual schools. Textbooks are published by independent retailers and must be bought by the students themselves. 

[[Primary school]] is provided free to all citizens and residents of [[Kazakhstan]] and parents typically pay only for extra-curricular activities such as sports programs, music programs, and sometimes lab equipment or other special equipment.

===Lower secondary school===
Students continue in lower secondary school from grade 5 to year 9. This roughly corresponds to what is called in the USA, junior high school, or middle school. Typically a student in year 8 is 14–15 years old. The curriculum is a general education curriculum covering subjects like literature, student's first language, Russian or Kazakh language (depending on the language of the school in general), history, physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, foreign language, and so on.

===Higher secondary school===
Once leaving lower [[secondary school]], there are three tracks available. Students are free to choose any track of higher secondary education but are required to pursue one. Graduates of all tracks are eligible to enter university.
 
The first track is a general secondary school which covers grades 10-11 and provides general education.

In addition, there are two curriculum tracks for vocational education: initial vocational education which is provided by training schools and lycees, and secondary vocational education provided by colleges and trade schools.

'''Initial training schools''' are designed to train students in a skilled profession. The program is usually two or three years, (typically ages 16–18), but for some professional training four-year programs are required. Students who graduate can go on to colleges for advanced vocational training or attend university. The state pays the costs of education.

'''Lycees''' provide basic vocational education to prepare students for skilled professions and includes general academic education. The course of study is three years. The state pays the costs of education.

'''Colleges''' give a program that provides both academic general education and advanced vocational education. Colleges, if licensed, can provide initial vocational education. Programs last for three or four years (grades 10–12, 13). Accelerated programs exist for students who have already completed general secondary education and initial vocational training in the same field. Graduates may go on to university or may begin working. As of the 1999 Budget Law, colleges are state-owned and self-financed. In principle, however, all compulsory education (primary and secondary) is provided free of charge.

The curriculum for primary and [[secondary school]] is established by the Ministry of Education, with little choice left to the individual schools. Textbooks are sold in bookstores and are purchased by the students themselves.

Like [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] is subsidized by the government. Parents only pay for extracurricular activities such as sports programs, music programs, and sometimes lab equipment or other special equipment.

===Tertiary institutions===

The universities, following the Russian system, focus entirely on teaching and do not engage in research. Students who are accepted to university at any level apply under a specific major, and the curriculum is set by the university (according to State legislation) for each major. For example, economics majors will all study in the same courses in the same order, separate from English majors who have a different curriculum. Some courses are required for a variety of majors and there is a possibility of switching majors but typically classes do not transfer to the new major and the student is expected to reenter in the new major as a first year.

The government is currently pursuing a program to adopt a credit-system which would allow students to study more easily internationally, and to add the possibility of a curriculum with electives and student-chosen courses.

There are four levels of tertiary education in Kazakhstan:
*Bachelor's degree — typically a four-year degree
*Specialist Degree — typically a five-year degree and more intensive than the Bachelor's
*Master's degree — typically a two-year degree, roughly corresponding to the Western master's.
*Doctoral Degree — typically a five-year program

Universities are usually headed by a rector, appointed by the President of Kazakhstan, who wields considerable authority over the institution, approving all decisions including those regarding curriculum, personnel, and admission. Thus Kazakhstan universities are more centralized than their Western counterparts.

The flagship research university in Kazakhstan is [[Nazarbayev University]].  Two other prominent universities in [[Kazakhstan]] are [[al-Farabi Kazakh National University]] in [[Almaty]] and [[L. N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University]] located in Astana.

In addition, there are a few international universities such as [[Kimep|KIMEP]], which is a joint program, 40% owned by the government of Kazakhstan, but education is based on the Western system. The [[Kazakh-British Technical University]]  and the [[Kazakh-American University]] represent joint projects between [[Kazakhstan]] and the UK and the USA, respectively. In all three institutions, the language of instruction is English. The [[University of Central Asia]], founded jointly by the Governments of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]] and by [[Aga Khan IV|the Aga Khan]], is affiliated with the [[Aga Khan Development Network]]. Its Kazakhstan campus is located in [[Tekeli, Kazakhstan|Tekeli]]. A number of specialty universities also exist. As of, there were public universities and private universities.

Private universities, typically for-profit institutions, are subject to the same regulations regarding curriculum but are free to set tuition and salaries as they see fit. Public universities are subject to the same regulations as other government-owned organs, regarding not only fees and salaries, but also administrative structure, contracting and subcontracting, and ownership of property.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Decree of President of the Republic of [[Kazakhstan]], Nursultan Nazarbayev of November 9, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

State owned universities receive funding if their enrollment reaches 86,000 students or 34%.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt; A small number of universities are financed through a budget line in the Republic budget, such as art academies or international universities.

==Public funding of education==
Students who have not received general upper secondary education have the academic portion of their program financed by the state. As for the vocational track, some students pay fees and others are financed through the state order program, where state authorities request a certain number of trained workers and specialists in certain fields. These students are chosen through a merit-based competition based on grades and recommendations from teachers or public officials.

Education for the nation as a whole made up

*14.4% of public expenditures in 1999
*12.1% in 2000
*11.9% in 2001
*12.6% in 2002
of which the lion's share went to general education:

==Projects and programs==

===Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools===
Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools (NIS) was founded in 2008 (as ''Orken'') with a mission "to enhance the intellectual capacity" of Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nis.edu.kz/en/about/|title=Назарбаев Интеллектуальные школы|author=|date=|website=www.nis.edu.kz|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the organisation develops, pilots and disseminates programmes for use in the national system of primary and secondary education, through its network of primary and secondary schools, professional development centres (Centres of Excellence), international schools, and associated organisations. The recent curriculum reforms were initiated by the NIS working in partnership with the National Academy of Education. 

===Bolashak===
The Bolashak Scholarship of the President of the Republic of [[Kazakhstan]], was created in 1993 by the decree of the President: “In [[Kazakhstan]]’s transition toward a market economy and the expansion of international contacts, there is an acute need for a workforce with advanced western education, and so, it is now necessary to send the most qualified youth to study in leading educational institutions in foreign countries”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Scholarship is merit-based and the selection process includes not only academic credentials, but also competence in the language of study, psychological testing and an interview process. Commitment to development of [[Kazakhstan]] and patriotism are factors as well. The final decision is made by the Republican Commission, chaired by the State Secretary and composed of the Ministers, members of Parliament, and members of the Office of the President. The Republican Commission also approves the country of study and program of study.

The Scholarship requires that all recipients return to [[Kazakhstan]] after graduating and work for five years in [[Kazakhstan]]. The Scholarship pays for all costs related to education, including tuition and fees, costs of travel, and a living stipend. Scholars are expected to maintain academic excellence. In the US, this translates to a 3.0 GPA.

There are currently about 1,800 scholarship recipients studying abroad in 24 countries. About 1,700 were awarded the Scholarship in 2005. The most popular countries are the USA (about 700 students chosen in 2005), the UK (about 400 students chosen last year) and Russia (about 300 students chosen in 2005). Australia and Malaysia are two countries represented for the first time in 2005 and host 2 Bolashak Scholars each.
Nazarbayev University started his work from 2010, and it covers Bolashak system, therefore, Bolashak program has been closed for bachelors only.

===Bologna Process===
The Government is in finishing stage of implementing a credit system with Western academic three-levels (Bachelor-Master-PhD) which allows Kazakh students to study internationally without any understanding issues. Kazakh National educational system also allows the possibility of a curriculum with electives and student-chosen courses.

==Problems==
In connection with a lack of school facilities or a lack of teachers, some primary and [[secondary school]]s run three, instead of two sessions, so one group of students attends from 8 to 1pm, a second from 1pm to 6. This results in overworked teachers, students who are kept up late, and overused facilities.&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt;

The [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) published a report on financing of public education in Kazakhstan in 2004, which mentions widely agreed upon criticisms of the public education system reported elsewhere. According to this report, financing of public education is low, and mechanisms to introduce private financing have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, the Budget Code and the law 'On education' fail to clearly delineate responsibilities of local and central government, nor do they include sufficient mechanisms for monitoring budget expenditures.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

The [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] published a report in 2014 on the education system in Kazakhstan. According to the report, Kazakhstan achieved significant improvements in the quality of education and increased access to primary and secondary education. The report also indicated that Kazakhstan had embarked on profound reforms to improve the quality of the education system and was increasingly looking to international standards and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OECD REVIEWS OF SCHOOL RESOURCES: Kazakhstan |url=http://www.oecd.org/education/school/OECD%20School%20Resources%20Review_Kazakhstan_FINAL_CRC_with%20cover.pdf |website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq''' ({{lang-he|אלעזר בן צדקה בן יצחק}}) (January 16, 1927 &amp;ndash; February 3, 2010) was the [[Samaritan High Priest]] from 2004 until his death. He was born in [[Nablus]]. He succeeded his cousin [[Saloum Cohen]] in 2004. According to tradition he is the 131st holder of this post since [[Aaron]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-orIXqXsSUYC&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Elazar%20ben%20Tsedaka%22&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elazar%20ben%20Tsedaka%22&amp;f=false |title=Palestine |author=Sarah Irving |page=226 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in office, he would lead the Samaritan community in their annual Passover ritual sacrifice of sheep. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/Re-enacting-Passover-Exodus-at-Mt-Gerazim |title=Re-enacting Passover Exodus at Mt. Gerazim - Travel - Jerusalem Post |website=Jpost.com |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/samaritans-honour-rituals-of-their-3000yearold-faith/2007/05/04/1177788399268.html |title=Samaritans honour rituals of their 3000-year-old faith - World |website=Theage.com.au |date=2007-05-05 |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before retirement he worked as a [[mathematics]] teacher. His funeral in February 2010 was attended by Israeli and Palestinian officials, who noted his major efforts in helping to guide his community, and to serve as a bridge between Israeli and Palestinian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Hartman |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=168154 |title=Samaritans mourn their high priest |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council''' ('''EPSRC''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]] that provides [[UK government|government]] funding for grants to undertake [[research]] and postgraduate degrees in [[engineering]] and the [[physical sciences]] (including [[mathematics]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]]), mainly to [[university|universities]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The head office is in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]] in the same building ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120501173538/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/pages/findus.aspx Polaris House]) that houses the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]], [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council|BBSRC]], [[Economic and Social Research Council|ESRC]], [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|MRC]], [[Natural Environment Research Council]], [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]], [[Technology Strategy Board|TSB]], [[Research Councils UK]] and the [[UK Space Agency]].

==History==
EPSRC was created in 1994. It was formerly a part of the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC).

==Structure==
Paul Golby, Chair of [[EngineeringUK]], was appointed as the Chairman of the EPSRC from 1 April 2012 for four years. He succeeded Sir [[John Armitt]].

From 2007 to March 2014, the chief executive and deputy chair of EPSRC was [[David Delpy]] [[Royal Academy of Engineering|FREng]] [[Royal Society|FRS]], a [[medical physics|medical physicist]] and formerly vice provost at [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;New Chief Executive for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,
30 May 2007, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0705/07053002&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded in April 2014 by Philip Nelson, former University of Southampton pro vice-chancellor for research and enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2014/Pages/newceo.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132351/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2014/Pages/newceo.aspx |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 Professor Tom Rodden was appointed as the Deputy CEO of EPSRC, a new position created to work alongside Philip Nelson while he also acts as Chair of RCUK Strategic Executive. Rodden joins the EPSRC on secondment from the University of Nottingham where he is currently Professor of Computing and Co-Director of Horizon Digital Economy Research.

==Functions==
In addition to funding academic research projects, the EPSRC also funds [https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/centres/ Centres for Doctoral Training] (CDTs). These deliver four-year doctoral training programmes to cohorts of [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] students and [[Engineering Doctorate|EngD]] research engineers studying within UK universities, and are funded to target specific areas of research for which there is recognised need. In 2008, the EPSRC announced funding for 44 new CDTs spanning its entire remit.&lt;ref name=NewDTCs&gt;[http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/multimedia/2008/Pages/cdt.aspx New Centres for Doctoral Training - December 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130706204045/http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/multimedia/2008/Pages/cdt.aspx |date=2013-07-06 }}, from EPSRC's site&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPSRC also funds or joint-funds 'Innovation and Knowledge Centres'. Innovation and Knowledge Centres are university based [[business incubator]]s established in order to support [[Commercialization|commercialisation]] of emerging technologies. Between 2007 and 2016, the EPSRC has funded 7 Innovation and Knowledge Centres:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/innovation/business/opportunities/ikcs/|title = Innovation and knowledge centres - EPSRC website|website = www.epsrc.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|The '''Fundamental Law of Education'''|教育基本法|kyōiku kihonhō}} is a [[law of Japan|Japanese law]] which sets the standards for the [[education in Japan|Japanese education]] system.

== Summary ==
The '''Fundamental Law of Education''', as the name suggests, is a law concerning the foundation of Japanese education.  Because it acts as the basis for the interpretation and application of various laws &amp; ordinances regarding education, it is also known as {{Nihongo|"'''The Education Constitution'''"|教育憲法|kyōiku kenpō}} and {{Nihongo|"'''The Charter of Education'''"|教育憲章|kyōiku kenshō}}. MEXT translations into English entitle it the '''Basic Act on Education'''.

The Fundamental Law of Education contains a preamble and 18 Articles. The law sets out the purposes and objectives of education and provides for equal opportunity in [[education]], [[compulsory education]], [[mixed-sex education|coeducation]], [[social pedagogy|social education]], [[Citizenship education (immigrants)|political education]], [[religious education]], [[academic administration|educational administration]], etc. According to the [[law]], the purpose of education is {{Nihongo|"the full development of personality"|人格の完成|jinkaku no kansei}}. Article 1 states that the law
:shall aim for the full development of personality and strive to nurture the citizens, sound in mind and body, who are imbued with the qualities necessary for those who form a [[peace]]ful and [[democracy|democratic]] [[state (polity)|state]] and [[society]].

The current Fundamental law was enacted on December 22, 2006, replacing the previous 11-article Act of March 31, 1947 (the 'old fundamental law of Education').

==Original 1947 enactment==

The old law was created under the auspices of [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]], enacted by the 90th session of the Imperial Japanese Diet, which would be the last Imperial Diet conducted under the [[Meiji Constitution|Imperial Japanese Constitution]]. It is often said that the old Fundamental Law of Education was written in the spirit of the new [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]], representing a radical means of [[education reform]], and replacing the [[Education in the Empire of Japan|pre-World War II]] [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], which was based on [[Japanese imperialism|Imperialist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucianist]] [[thought]].

During the debate about constitutional reform, it was argued that provisions regarding education should be included in the national constitution itself.  However, the Minister of Education at that time, [[Kōtarō Tanaka (judge)|Kōtarō Tanaka]], proposed the creation of a separate law regarding education.  The Ministry of Education then created an Educational Reform Committee, which deliberated over the contents of the Fundamental Law.  The law was approved by the Imperial Diet as was written in the original draft, without revision.

== 2006 Revisions ==

Soon after the passing of the Fundamental Law, there were numerous arguments suggesting its revision.  Some suggested that ideas of [[patriotism]] and regard for Japanese traditions were lacking, and others maintained that such provisions could lead to renewed feelings of nationalism and subservience to the state.  Such arguments have been brought up repeatedly since the law was first passed.

On April 28, 2006, the Cabinet drafted a reformed version of the law which was submitted to the 164th ordinary session of the [[National Diet]] (sitting from January to June 2006).  The draft is composed of a preamble and 18 articles.  The new preamble does not include the phrase "the realization of the ideals laid forth in the constitution depend on the education of the people", as is stated in the current law, and includes some additions, such as the phrases "community spirit" and "the inheritance of tradition".  In addition, the "purpose of education" has been divided into five items, containing such moral provisions as "to nurture an attitude[...]to love our country and our home".

On May 2, 2006, the Ministry of Education announced that they had established a "Fundamental Law of Education Reform Promotion Headquarters" under the direction of [[Kenji Kosaka]], the Minister of Education.  The first meeting was scheduled for May 8, and a project team was established.  The objective of this group is not only to regulate argument in the Diet, but also to assist in initiatives to explain the educational reforms to the public and decide on basic programs promoting education.

On December 22, 2006 the complete revision of the Fundamental Law of Education passed and was implemented. It now contains 18 Articles.

=== Main points of contention ===

Opinion was divided on whether students should receive education "according to individual ability" or "equally". The new Law does not contain the word "equally" any longer.

There was also debate about whether the absolution of school fees at public universities should be limited only to tuition costs, or should also include textbook fees, food costs, commutation costs, etc.

There was debate concerning the topic of political neutrality, namely, what kind of political education should be forbidden, and how to harmonize this with the promotion of political interest amongst students. In 1954, the Japanese government, aiming to curb political activity by the [[Japan Teachers Union]], passed a law designed to ensure "political neutrality" in Japanese public schools. In 2004, Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] refused to accept a petition—written by Japanese high school students—against the deployment of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] to [[Iraq]]
, said to be due to the prohibition on political education.

=== Political Debate ===

On March 20, 2003, based on the discussions of the People's Educational Reform Council (a consultative body to the Prime Minister dissolved in Dec. 2000), the Central Education Council reported to Minister of Education [[Atsuko Toyama]] on the necessity of reform to the Fundamental Law.

According to the report, the concepts expressed in the Fundamental Law should continue to be valued; however, in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century, the following reforms would be necessary.
#the establishment of a trustworthy schooling system
#promotion of university reform, to become leaders in the information age
#to restore the educational ability of the family, and to promote a society in which the school, family, and local community cooperate
#to foster attitudes to take part in community planning
#to foster respect for Japanese traditions and culture, to encourage love for the homeland, and promote the spirit of membership in the international community
#the realization of a society based on lifelong learning
#to decide on a master plan to encourage education

In April 2004, the ruling [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic]] and [[New Clean Government Party|Komei]] Parties reached an agreement on the meaning of the term "patriotism" ("to value customs and culture, and to love our country, from which they have developed") and submitted a reform proposal to the Diet, the first such proposal to be submitted to the Diet since the end of World War II.

The proposed reforms reflect three influential lines of thinking.

#Educational reform is necessary to nurture an educational elite and in order for Japan to continue to be a leader in developing cutting-edge technology.
#Problem children responsible for the disintegration of Japanese society (including such problems as youth crime, bullying and truancy) can be dealt with through home discipline, the strengthening of moral education, and community service.
#The expansion of the Ministry of Education's realm of authority is critical.  The reformed law would give the Ministry of Education a virtually free hand with regards to educational administration.

== Moral education ==

The extent and nature of moral education is a frequent point of debate in government and academia.

The old Fundamental law did not contain provisions regarding moral education, although moral education features in the curriculum overseen by the Ministry of Education.  Along with other provisions in order to "broaden" the scope of the law, there were added provisions regarding moral education. For example, the objective in Article 2(5)
{{quotation |
:"to foster an attitude to respect our traditions and culture, love the country and region that nurtured them, together with respect for other countries and a desire to contribute to world peace and the development of the international community"}}
is designed to satisfy both conservative views on patriotism and progressive views on global integration and/or focus on individualism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">The '''Hamas–UNRWA Holocaust dispute''' erupted on  31 August 2009 following a perception in the [[Gaza Strip]] that the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) planned to include a course on human rights that speaks about the [[Holocaust]] in the eighth-grade curriculum of preparatory schools it runs in the territory. Militant Islamic movement [[Hamas]], which controls the [[Gaza Strip]], protested, calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the [[Zionist]]s" and demanding the removal of the offending content from the curriculum. Some officials of the United Nations agency initially responded by denying that it teaches the subject of the Holocaust in its schools or that it plans to teach it in its new curriculum.&lt;ref name=argue&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm | title=Hamas, UNRWA argue over "Holocaust" lessons in Gaza | publisher=[[Xinhua News]] |location=Gaza| date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Saud Ramadan, Emad Drinly| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231647/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm| archivedate=March 14, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=caught&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newsday.com/news/world/un-caught-in-gaza-dispute-over-study-of-holocaust-1.1430963 | title=UN caught in Gaza dispute over study of Holocaust | work=[[Newsday]] | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Laub, Karin | agency=[[Associated Press]] | location=Gaza City, Gaza Strip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slams&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE57T1JW20090830 | title=Hamas slams UN over "Holocaust classes" in Gaza | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Nidal al-Mughrabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial drew criticism from various groups and individuals.

==Background==
UNRWA runs 221 of more than 600 primary and secondary schools in the Gaza Strip, educating some 200,000 children between the ages of 6 and 15.&lt;ref name=argue/&gt; The Gaza Strip has been ruled by Hamas since it seized control of the enclave in June 2007 by defeating Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' security forces. According to the Associated Press, "Hamas has been trying to cement control over Gaza, while the U.N. agency is increasingly emerging as a shadow government, providing services to some 1 million of Gaza's 1.4 million people".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The Holocaust is not taught in U.N.-run schools for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, nor is it taught in Palestinian government schools in the West Bank or Gaza.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt; There is also no evidence that it was taught in Palestinian schools when these were under Israeli control between 1967 and 1994.

==Hamas protest==
Protesting what it said were plans to teach eighth-graders in U.N. schools about the Holocaust, the Hamas-affiliated [[Popular Committee of Palestinian refugees]] sent an open letter to the chief of UNRWA offices calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the Zionists" and demanding it "immediately" erase the part that speaks about the Holocaust from the Palestinian pupils' curriculum. Husam Ahmed, the Popular Committee's coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said the material, which was to be included in a course on [[human rights]], "was formed in a way that shows sympathy with the Jews".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

The interior ministry of the Hamas de facto government in Gaza expressed astonishment over the UNRWA curriculum's acknowledgement of the Holocaust." "We reject teaching our pupils such thoughts that contradicts with our Palestinian beliefs," said the interior ministry statement, which called on the ministry of education "to check if such news is right."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The head of Hamas' education committee in Gaza, [[Abdul Rahman el-Jamal]], said that the Holocaust was a "big lie".&lt;ref name=condemns&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8230483.stm Hamas condemns Holocaust lessons], BBC News 31-08-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hamas Education Minister Muhammad Askol criticized UNRWA, saying it was not respecting Hamas's "sovereignty" over Gaza. He said he planned to ask for a meeting with agency officials to "assure the necessary coordination".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Hamas spiritual leader [[Yunis al-Astal]] said teaching children about the Nazi genocide of Jews would be "marketing a lie", and characterized the possible introduction of the subject into Gaza schools as a "war crime".&lt;ref name=objects&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090102496.html?hpid=sec-world | title=Hamas Objects to Possible Lessons on Holocaust in U.N.-Run Schools in Gaza | work=[[Washington Post]] September 2, 2009| accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Schneider, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas spokesman [[Sami Abu Zuhri]] said that Hamas rejects any attempt to introduce the Holocaust into the curriculum as "a kind of normalization with Israel and an attempt to bridge the psychological gap between Israel and the Palestinians".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

[[Jamila al-Shanti]], a Hamas [[Palestinian Legislative Council|legislative official]], said: "Talk about the Holocaust and the execution of the Jews contradicts and is against our culture, our principles, our traditions, values, heritage and religion".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Mustafa al-Sawwaf, editor of the Hamas-run newspaper [[Filastin (newspaper)|Filastin]], said the U.N. "should also be prevented from implementing this destructive policy that harms our history and civilization as well as our people's culture."&lt;ref name=learn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/08/hamas-and-the-holocaust/ | title=EDITORIAL: Hamas and the Holocaust | work=Washington Times | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNRWA response==
UNRWA denied that it teaches the Holocaust in preparatory schools or that the Holocaust is included in the pupils' curriculum. Adnan Abu Hasna, UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said: "Such reports are totally untrue. The current curriculum that is taught to pupils at UNRWA schools doesn't contain any indication to the subject of the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

Similarly, according to the [[Ma'an News Agency]], UNRWA Commissioner-General [[Karen Abu Zayd]] said at a press conference on 1 September, "I can refute allegations that UN school curriculum includes anything about the Holocaust. Anyone can have a look at the school books. Really we focus on human rights in [the] curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=222848 UNRWA chief: Gaza school curriculum does not include Holocaust], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 01-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of this report was later contested by UNRWA.

The agency also denied that it was planning to include the subject in its new curriculum. Mahmoud al-Hemdeyat, director of education department of UNRWA in the Gaza Strip, said: "UNRWA hasn't finished yet from finalizing the new curriculum... As far as I know, the curriculum doesn't include anything about the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP), Karen Abu Zayd suggested information about the Holocaust could be included in later years, but the curriculum being developed was still in draft stage. AP also wrote that UNWRA's website mentioned general plans to include the Holocaust in lessons on the "historical context" that gave rise to the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;
 
UNRWA chief in Gaza [[John Ging]] said he believed the dispute over the syllabus had more to do with attempts by Hamas to meddle in the U.N. organization's affairs than with the Holocaust. Ging added that he felt any human rights course is incomplete without discussing the Holocaust, but it would exceed UNWRA's mandate to write texts about the Holocaust and the Palestinian uprooting. According to one UN source, the lessons had been under consideration for the 2009-10 human rights course.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

===Disputed quotes===
A statement by UNRWA on 4 September denied unspecified quotes which it said the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] had attributed to Karen Abu Zayd and John Ging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=434 Statement by UNRWA on Holocaust Education], UNRWA, 4 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center had previously quoted Abu Zayd as saying "we focus on human rights in curriculum" and "the murder of 6 million Jews and 5 million other undesirables ... is not a human-rights issue", and Ging as saying "There is no intention to integrate materials and topics [on the Holocaust] that are inconsistent with the desire of Palestinian society." According to one journalist, Abu Zayd's quotes were "untraceable" and Ging's quote was "based on a computer-generated translation of an Arabic-language report by PalToday, a Gaza Strip-based news agency with Islamist sympathies, quoting a Hamas official who purported to quote Ging".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19543/ UNRWA Denies Holocaust Quotes WASHINGTON (JTA)], Jewish Exponent 10-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of UNRWA==
The United Nations agency was criticized by various parties following initial reports that it would not be introducing discussion of the Holocaust in its human rights education:

United States Congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R-Fla.) said in a statement that "by disconnecting the Holocaust from human rights, (the U.N. agency) is highlighting the [[antisemitic]] bias that pervades the U.N. system."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] called for the dismissal of Abu Zayd and Ging and demanded the United States and Canada suspend funding for the U.N. agency pending the resolution of the issue. The United States was the second-largest donor to the agency in 2008, providing nearly $96 million of its $541.8 million budget.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[American Jewish Congress]] said in a statement: "It is... discouraging... that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency did not criticize Hamas for denying the children of Gaza knowledge of one of the central events of the 20th century. Instead, it rushed to deny that the Holocaust was being taught in its schools or that it was contemplating teaching it in the future".&lt;ref name=asked&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200909082049/UNRWA-asked-to-teach-Holocaust-defy-Hamas.html UNRWA asked to teach Holocaust, defy Hamas], Jewish Tribune 08-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other responses==
Jihad Zakarneh, the deputy education minister in the [[West Bank]], said teaching Palestinian children about the Holocaust has to wait until there is a peace agreement with Israel. "When Israel ends its occupation of our land and our people and gives us our right of independence and self-determination, then we discuss this issue with them".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In October 2009, John Ging told ''[[The Independent]]'' that he was "confident and determined" that the Holocaust would feature in the curriculum, saying, "no human-rights curriculum is complete without the inclusion of the facts of the Holocaust, and its lessons". At the time, the curriculum was expected to be completed within weeks and then put out for consultation with parents and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-to-teach-children-about-holocaust-in-gaza-schools-1797763.html "UN to teach children about Holocaust in Gaza schools]," The Independent, 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Ging confirmed in an interview that the Holocaust was being discussed in UNRWA schools in Gaza, noting "we enrich the curriculum with our human rights program, for all ages. We teach the children about the history of the human rights movement. We grounded our program in the universal declaration of human rights, which is borne out of the horrors of the Second World War. So we teach the children the horrors of the war, including the Holocaust. We are also teaching the kids about the unanimously adopted resolution on Holocaust remembrance, which is a 2005 UN resolution proposed by the state of Israel adopted in the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz, "[http://www.adi-schwartz.com/unrwas-existence-failure/ UNRWA’s existence is a failure]" (interview with John Ging), Adi Schwartz blog, 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNRWA efforts brought continued criticism from some Palestinian Islamists. One writer for the pro-Hamas [[Palestine Information Center]] warned that "some circles within UNRWA... have been trying to introduce 'the holocaust' {{sic}} into Palestinian school curricula in the Gaza Strip". He suggested that these efforts indicated "a virulent Zionist propensity to brainwash Palestinians, particularly young generations, into accepting or at least understanding Zionism, a hateful fascist political ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Khalid Ameyreh, "[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7uHZEh0iPWAeNUyBMO4MjFv9Au5eS55O7W1IUimwfbTHIB1SRXbZ6ivf8O4STvfR%2fDU2rfcRzzUiB8PGCHwJfENvTsdBBw26fNjv1YTwCB2o%3d We must not accept holocaust propaganda in our schools]," Palestine Information Center, 5 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy erupted when it became known that UNRWA, as part of a project that brought its top human rights students from Gaza to the United States for a visit, had taken them to an exhibit on the Holocaust at UN headquarters in New York.&lt;ref&gt;No Sharp Objects (documentary, 2010), video excerpts available on "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2010/dec/10/gaza-boys-no-sharp-objects-documentary Documentary follows 15 boys from Gaza on trip to US]," ''The Guardian'', 10 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/19/hamas-un-palestinian-trip-holocaust Hamas in dispute with UN over school trips for Palestinian pupils]," The Guardian, 19 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://prrnblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/hamas-unrwa-and-human-rights-education/ Hamas, UNRWA, and Human Rights Education]," Palestinian Refugee ResearchNet blog, 20 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement issued by the Hamas refugee department, "We denounce this suspicious act in hopes that UNRWA education officials in the Gaza Strip will not repeat it; and we hope the Palestinian Authority will take a national stand to put a stop to ideological corruption on Palestine's youth."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/En/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7BHZU4scReZyDBxFz4OdzpiDXqBEyPlODlakAb9ziW3S81rjt02%2fmxJPu3m89trJ5utY7XE1dAj0jhK7WY4wVYVRCVKLHQ2WK0978wpmpSDM%3d Hamas castigates UNRWA for taking students to sightsee holocaust centers]," Palestine Information Center, 18 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harriet Newell Noyes''' ({{zh|c=那夏理|p=Nà Xiàlǐ}}; March 5, 1844 – January 16, 1924) was an American [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] educator, writer, and [[missionary]] for fifty years. She founded the True Light Middle School, the first women's school in [[Guangdong Province]], China, and is credited with establishing the first generation of professional women of that province.&lt;ref name=woc/&gt;

==Biography==
Noyes was born on March 5, 1844, in [[Guilford Township, Medina County, Ohio|Guilford, Ohio]]. Her father, Varnum Noyes (1804 - 1888) was a Presbyterian [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]. She was her parents sixth child&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; and one of three of the children who were Chinese missionaries. She was named for [[Harriet Newell]] who was a famous missionary.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web|last1=Covell|first1=Ralph R.|title=Margaret Newell Noyes|url=http://www.bdcconline.net/en/stories/n/noyes-harriet-newell.php|website=Bio Dictionary of Chinese Christianity|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1868, the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church of the United States]] (PCUSA) sent her as a missionary to [[Fangcun, Guangzhou]], China (广州市芳村区) where she learned to speak fluent [[Cantonese]]. On June 16, 1872, she founded the first school for women in [[Guangdong Province]] &amp;ndash; the True Light Academy in [[Shaji, Guangzhou|Shakee]].&lt;ref name=sch&gt;[http://www.gzzxws.gov.cn/gxsl/zts/rwcq/201503/t20150310_36553.htm 那夏理：创办真光学堂的洋女子] [Noyes: Founder of the True Light Academy], retrieved 1 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; She had spent two years preparing to open the school and she used $1000 she had collected. Noyes was surprised to find the resistance there was to the education of women in the area. She had sufficient resources to supply free education to thirty females and ten of these would be married. When the school first opened, there were only six students and three of them were married.&lt;ref name=woc/&gt; The school that she started was a primary school, but it grew from offering three years of education to offering nine despite having an early disastrous fire. The school broke the 100-student barrier in 1887 and in 1894 had 200 students. The Women's School and the Bible Women's School were moved to Paak Hok Tong, Guangzhou and were merged and renamed as "True Light Middle School". Dr. J.W. Creighton was named the principal. In 1919, the first graduation ceremony was held.

In 1919, Noyes published ''A Light in the Land of Sinim: Forty-Five Years in the True Light Seminary, 1872&amp;ndash;1917''.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noyes|first1=Harriett Newell|title=A Light in the Land of Sinim: Forty-Five Years in the True Light Seminary, 1872-1917|date=1919|url=http://library.alibris.com/A-Light-in-the-Land-of-Sinim-Forty-Five-Years-in-the-True-Light-Seminary-1872-1917-1919-Harriet-Newell-Noyes/book/3942892?qsort=c&amp;matches=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noyes returned to the United States in May 1923 when she received a letter from [[Eugene Chen]], the secretary to [[Sun Yat-sen]], thanking her for helping with the education of 6,000 pupils at the "True Light" Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Letter located in the Department of Special Collections at [[The College of Wooster]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
She is credited with establishing the first generation of professional women of that province. Women who were educated during her 50 years at the school went on to become 286 teachers, 114 doctors, and more than 30 nurses.&lt;ref name=woc&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheng|first1=Eileen|title=Harriet Newell Noyes: Foreign Pioneer of Women's Education in Guangdong|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/people/history/1502/159-1.htm|website=WomenOfChina.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book, titled ''History of the South China Mission of the American Presbyterian Church, 1845&amp;ndash;1920'', was published posthumously in 1927.&lt;ref name=noyes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noyes|first1=Harriet Newell|title=History of the South China Mission of the American Presbyterian Church, 1845-1920|date=1927|publisher=Presbyterian Mission Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_South_China_Mission_of_th.html?id=Oo0vGQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] forced the headmistress of Noyes' school to move the school to [[Hong Kong]]. The school became the [[Kowloon True Light Middle School]].&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; The "True Light" schools also include the [[Hong Kong True Light College]], [[True Light Girls' College]], and [[True Light Middle School of Hong Kong]].

The school that remained in Bai He Dong was taken over by the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which renamed it the Number 22 Middle School during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. As of 2012, the school is called the [[Guangzhou True Light Middle School]] and Harriet Newell Noyes is credited as its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teach-in-china.net/rencai/company/company-show.php?id=619|title=Guangzhou True Light High School|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=3 May 2015|publisher=teach-in-china.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233701/http://www.teach-in-china.net/rencai/company/company-show.php?id=619|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Harvard University Herbaria''' and Botanical Museum  are institutions located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] at 22 Divinity Avenue, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. The Botanical Museum is one of three which comprise the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]].

The [[Herbaria]], founded in 1842 by [[Asa Gray]], are one of the 10 largest in the world with over 5 million specimens, and including the Botany Libraries, form the world's largest university owned herbarium. The Gray Herbarium is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huh.harvard.edu/pages/gray-herbarium-gh|title=Gray Herbarium (GH)|publisher=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUH hosts the  Gray Herbarium Index (GCI) as well as an extensive specimen, botanist, and publications database. HUH was the center for botanical research in the [[United States of America]] by the time of its founder's retirement in the 1870s. The materials deposited there are one of the three major sources for the [[International Plant Names Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.ipni.org/about_the_index.html  | title = About the Index  | accessdate =   | author =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =  | date =   | year =  | month =   | work =   | publisher = [[IPNI]]  | quote = IPNI come from three sources: ..., the Gray Card Index (GCI)  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Botanical museum was founded in 1858.  It was originally called the ''Museum of Vegetable Products'' and was predominantly focused on an interdisciplinary study of useful plants (i.e. [[economic botany]] and [[horticulture]]).  The nucleus of materials for this museum was donated by Sir [[William Jackson Hooker|William Hooker]], the Director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Garden]]. Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]] became the museum's first director in 1888; under his direction the building was completed in 1890 and provided both research facilities and public exhibit space, which were the botanical complement to the "[[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]]" [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]]. Three successive directors substantially enlarged the collections of economic products, [[medicinal plants]], [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[archeological]] materials, [[pollen]], and [[photographs]].

[[Faculty (university)|Faculty]] and [[student]]s continue to add significantly to the extensive [[Paleobotany|paleobotanical]] collections, particularly [[Precambrian]] material containing early life forms.

The [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]] Collection of Economic Botany, the Paleobotanical Collection (including the Pollen Collection), and the [[Margaret Towle]] Collection of Archaeological Plant Remains are housed in the Botanical Museum building. The Botany libraries and various herbaria are located in the Harvard University Herbaria building. The Botany Libraries collectively are a founding member of the [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]].

The Ware Collection of Glass Models of Plants, popularly known as the "[[Glass Flowers]]," are considered one of the University's great treasures. Commissioned by Goodale, sponsored by  Elizabeth C. Ware and her daughter [[Mary Lee Ware|Mary]] (Goodale's former student), and created by [[Leopold Blaschka|Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]] from 1887 through 1936, the collection comprises approximately 4,400 models including life-size and enlarged parts for over 840 [[species]]. This is the only collection of its type in the world.

The Botanical Museum of Harvard University and the other museums that comprise the Harvard Museum of Natural History are physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] and one admission grants visitors access to all museums.

The Herbaria publishes the journal ''[[Harvard Papers in Botany]]''.

'''Horst Willhelm Jakob Rittel''' (14 July 1930 &amp;ndash; 9 July 1990) was a design theorist and university professor. He is best known for coining the term ''[[wicked problem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Churchman, C. W. (1967). Wicked problems. Management Science, 14(4), B-141 and B-142.&lt;/ref&gt; but his influence on [[design theory]] and practice was much wider.&lt;ref&gt;Rith, C and Dubberly, H, "Why Horst W J Rittel Matters", Design Issues, Vol 23, No 1, pp. 72-91&lt;/ref&gt;

His field of work is the science of [[design]], or, as it also known, the area of design theories and methods (DTM), with the understanding that activities like planning, engineering, policy making are included as particular forms of design.

In response to the perceived failures of early attempts at systematic design, he introduced the concept of "second generation [[design methods]]"&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, H., 1984, "Second-Generation Design Methods", in "Developments in Design Methodology", N. Cross (Editor), John Wiley &amp; Sons, UK pp. 317-327.&lt;/ref&gt; and a planning/design method known as [[issue-based information system]] (IBIS) for handling wicked problems.

==Early career==
Rittel was born in [[Berlin]].  From 1958 to 1963, he was Professor of Design Methodology at the [[Ulm School of Design]] in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm).&lt;ref name=Ulm1&gt;[http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/ ''Ulm School of Design | HfG Ulm Archive'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ulm2&gt;Lindinger, H., (1991), ''Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects'', Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
* 1963 — 1990 Professor of the Science of Design at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], College of Environmental Design, Department of Architecture and Department of City and Regional Planning
* 1967 Visiting Associate Professor for Architecture and Operations Research at [[Washington University]], St. Louis, Missouri
* 1973 — 1990 Director and Professor at the [[University of Stuttgart]], Faculty for Architecture and Town Planning.
He died in [[Heidelberg]], aged 59.

==Wicked problems==
Rittel coined the term ''[[wicked problem]]'' in the mid-1960s to describe the ill-defined problems of planning. Rittel and Melvyn Webber published the seminal paper on Wicked Problems in the journal Policy Sciences in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf Rittel and Webber, Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subject of Wicked Problems is sometimes considered to have originated in the Social Sciences, as a professor in a department of architecture Rittel was clear that architectural design problems were also wicked problems.

==IBIS==
IBIS (for [[issue-based information system]]) is the instrumental version of the understanding of design as argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Rittel, Horst W.J., Annual Report of Faculty Achievement, UC Berkeley.  1988. These paragraphs on IBIS were written in first person by Horst Rittel and adapted to third-person narrative by the Wikipedia contributor.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a method to guide the design process and to reinforce deliberation and argumentation. A number of computer-based versions of IBIS have been and are being developed for various computer systems (personal computers and workstations).

The idea of IBIS was conceived in 1968. It has served as a regular teaching tool, in order to demonstrate the typical difficulties of design and the different ways of dealing with them. IBIS was an idea "waiting for an appropriate technology" in order to become more effective and attractive. The various previous applications have been more or less successful, but have suffered from bureaucratic clumsiness. The recent availability of "hypertext" data-structures and user interfaces—even on small microcomputers and moderately priced workstations—has allowed the design of IBISes which are much more "user-friendly" than their predecessors. Today, we have a number of IBIS-programs, developed and implemented on a variety of machines by PhD-students, most recently by Ph.D. candidate [[Douglas E. Noble]]. In addition, there is an implementation ([[gIBIS]]), developed by MCC, an [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] corporation in Austin, Texas, run by a consortium of 25 leading US-computer companies and dissolved in 2004.

There are considerations to make the concept of IBIS the basis of operating systems for future generations of computers. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} At present, large scale tests of gIBIS as a tool for supporting hard- and software development are under way in several corporations. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The use of IBIS as a management tool and as a means for argumentative treatment of technology assessment is also being considered by several companies in Europe and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Some crucial old weaknesses of IBIS remain the same: the danger of getting lost in the web of cross-references, the lack of a "synoptic" overview of the state of resolution, and the "logic of the next question", i.e. the problem of prestructuring the possibilities for guiding the designers' deliberations into plausible directions.

[[File:HowToReadABook.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]])]]
'''''How to Read a Book''''' is a 1940 book by [[Mortimer Adler]]. He co-authored a heavily revised edition in 1972 with [[Charles Van Doren]], which gives guidelines for critically reading good and great books of any tradition. The 1972 revision, in addition to the first edition, treats genres ([[poetry]], [[history]], [[science]], [[fiction]], et cetera), inspectional and [[wikt:syntopical|syntopical]] reading.

==Overview of the last edition==
''How to Read a Book'' is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters.

===Part I: The Dimensions of Reading===
Adler explains for whom the book is intended, defines different classes of reading, and tells which classes will be addressed. He also makes a brief argument favoring the [[Great Books]], and explains his reasons for writing ''How to Read a Book''.

There are three types of knowledge: practical, informational, and comprehensive. He discusses the methods of acquiring knowledge, concluding that practical knowledge, though teachable, cannot be truly mastered without experience; that only informational knowledge can be gained by one whose understanding equals the author's; that comprehension (insight) is best learned from who first achieved said understanding — an "original communication".

The idea that communication directly from those who first discovered an idea is the best way of gaining understanding is Adler's argument for reading the Great Books; that any book that does not represent original communication is inferior, as a source, to the original, and that any teacher, save those who discovered the subject he or she teaches, is inferior to the Great Books as a source of comprehension.

Adler spends a good deal of this first section explaining why he was compelled to write this book. He asserts that very few people can read a book for understanding, but that he believes that most are capable of it, given the right instruction and the will to do so. It is his intent to provide that instruction. He takes time to tell the reader about how he believes that the educational system has failed to teach students the art of reading well, up to and including undergraduate, university-level institutions. He concludes that, due to these shortcomings in formal education, it falls upon individuals to cultivate these abilities in themselves. Throughout this section, he relates anecdotes and summaries of his experience in education as support for these assertions.

===Part II: The Third Level of Reading: Analytical Reading===
Here, Adler sets forth his method for reading a non-fiction book in order to gain understanding. He claims that three distinct approaches, or readings, must all be made in order to get the most possible out of a book, but that performing these three levels of readings does not necessarily mean reading the book three times, as the experienced reader will be able to do all three in the course of reading the book just once. Adler names the readings "structural", "interpretative", and "critical", in that order.

'''Structural Stage:''' The first stage of analytical reading is concerned with understanding the structure and purpose of the book. It begins with determining the basic topic and type of the book being read, so as to better anticipate the contents and comprehend the book from the very beginning. Adler says that the reader must distinguish between practical and theoretical books, as well as determining the field of study that the book addresses. Further, Adler says that the reader must note any divisions in the book, and that these are not restricted to the divisions laid out in the table of contents. Lastly, the reader must find out what problems the author is trying to solve.

'''Interpretive Stage:''' The second stage of analytical reading involves constructing the author's arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms that the author uses. Once that is done, Adler says that the reader should find and work to understand each proposition that the author advances, as well as the author's support for those propositions.

'''Critical Stage:''' In the third stage of analytical reading, Adler directs the reader to critique the book. He asserts that upon understanding the author's propositions and arguments, the reader has been elevated to the author's level of understanding and is now able (and obligated) to judge the book's merit and accuracy. Adler advocates judging books based on the soundness of their arguments. Adler says that one may not [[intellectual honesty|disagree]] with an argument unless one can find fault in its reasoning, facts, or premises, though one is free to dislike it in any case.

The method presented is sometimes called the ''Structure-Proposition-Evaluation (SPE)'' method, though this term is not used in the book.

===Part III: Approaches to Different Kinds of Reading Matter===
In Part III, Adler briefly discusses the differences in approaching various kinds of literature and suggests reading several other books. He explains a method of approaching the Great Books – read the books that influenced a given author prior to reading works by that author – and gives several examples of that method.

===Part IV: The Ultimate Goals of Reading===
The last part of the book covers the fourth level of reading: syntopical reading. At this stage, the reader broadens and deepens his or her knowledge on a given subject—e.g., love, war, particle physics, etc.—by reading several books on that subject. In the final pages of this part, the author expounds on the philosophical benefits of reading: "growth of the mind", fuller experience as a conscious being.

'''Inodai Waldorf School''' in [[Andheri West]], [[Mumbai]], India, is based on the Waldorf curriculum. It was established in 2011 by the Education of Emancipation Trust.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid-day.com/news/2011/jun/100611-Waldorf-Education-training-workshop-Inodai-Rudolf-Steiner.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steiner Waldorf curriculum is holistic and spans the age range from 3–18 years. It places emphasis on integrating nature, art, crafts, drama and music into all academic learning including science &amp; mathematics. It addresses all the multiple intelligences, including emotional literacy and kinesthetic learning. 

In addition to developing analytical, logical and reasoning skills as education has always done, it focuses on the development of imagination, creativity, memory and flexible thinking skills. 

The Steiner curriculum is based on understanding the development of a child and how children learn at different ages. It encourages the development of each child’s sense of truth, beauty, and goodness, and inspires in each child a lifelong love of learning. 
&lt;!--YOU CAN'T SAY THIS WITHOUT A REFERENCE THAT SAYS SO!!......With more than 1000 kindergartens and nurseries and more than 900 Waldorf high schools in 83 countries, Waldorf education is the fastest growing independent education movement in the world.--&gt;

The '''International Indonesia Forum''' ('''IIF''') is an organisation which holds annual [[interdisciplinary]] seminars in Indonesia in an attempt to "facilitate interactive engagement and participation of students and educators"{{sfn|MacMillan Center 2008, Indonesia International Conference}} both inside and outside of Indonesia. Originally developed as an offshoot of the [[Yale Indonesia Forum]], it is now maintained independently. The seminar was first held in 2008 at [[Atma Jaya University, Yogyakarta]]; the eighth conference was held at [[Sebelas Maret University]] in [[Surakarta]]. The forum has published five books and hosts a [[working paper]] series on its website.

==Overview==
The International Indonesia Forum is run on a voluntary basis. It does not charge fees for presenters.{{sfn|IIF, History}} Audience members may be from academia or the general public, including non-academic organisations.{{sfn|Fathoni 2012, UGM dan Yale}} {{As of|August 2014}}, five books have been published based on papers presented at the conferences. The chairman of the IIF is Frank Dhont.{{sfn|Pikiran Rakyat 2014, Dinamika}} The forum hosts a [[working paper]] series on its website.{{sfn|IIF, Working Paper Series}}

==History==
In 2003, [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], established an interdisciplinary discussion forum for academics with a professional interest in Indonesia and related topics. This forum was established by three students, Frank Dhont, YoonSeok Lee, Thomas Pepinsky, with a member of the faculty, Indriyo Sukmono, as adviser. Initially meant for "members of the Yale community", this forum grew in size, until in 2006 it was capable of holding conferences.{{sfn|IIF, History}}{{sfn|Yale, YIF 2004}} Discussions began in 2007 about having another conference, this time in Indonesia so as to facilitate the attendance of Indonesianists from outside the United States, particularly those in Indonesia.{{sfn|IIF, History}} This second conference was hoped to "facilitate interactive engagement and participation of students and educators" from both Indonesia and abroad.{{sfn|MacMillan Center 2008, Indonesia International Conference}}

The first such conference was held at [[Atma Jaya University, Yogyakarta]], in mid-2008: Atma Jaya handled financial issues related to hosting, whereas Yale handled the cost of publication.{{sfn|IIF, History}} The conference, with the theme "Towards An Inclusive Democratic Indonesian Society: Bridging the Gap Between State Uniformity and Multicultural Identity Patterns",{{sfn|Yale, YIF 2008}} a theme which reviewer Alexander Claver described as "timely" owing to the issues of managing diversity and "societal heterogeneity and homogeneity".{{sfn|Claver|2010|p=116}} Claver wrote that the resulting book, though it did "not paint a coherent picture" and was uneven, was still "a rich source of ideas" and that most readers would find something of interest within.{{Sfn|Claver|2010|p=118}}

[[File:Frank Dhont of the International Indonesia Forum at the 7th IFF Conference, 2014-08-20.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Dhont, chairman of the IIF, at the 2014 conference]]
The second forum, hosted at [[Sanata Dharma University]] (also in Yogyakarta), dealt with [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]], Indonesia's national ideology, and its role in the [[Post-Suharto era|Reformation]] era.{{sfn|O'Shannassy 2009, Reimagining}} Claver writes that this was a development on the themes explored in the first conference.{{sfn|Claver|2010|p=116}} By this point half of attendees were Indonesian academics, with the remainder from various international institutions.{{sfn|Dhont 2009, Report}} An academic review of the conference's proceedings (published the following year) was highly negative: reviewer R. E. Elson wrote that the book was "disappointing", with "far too much airy and meaningless blather about identity and too much vacuous wordy and unproductive theorising" regarding its subject matter.{{sfn|Elson|2012|pp=131–32}}

Various universities hosted the program in succeeding years, mostly in Yogyakarta but also in nearby [[Semarang]]. The number of participants increased yearly, and in 2011 the international conferences (increasingly separate from their parent organisation) were branched off under the title International Indonesia Forum.{{sfn|IIF, History}} That year's conference, taking the theme of education for the future, was held at [[Yogyakarta State University]] and drew a crowd of 150 audience members and presenters.{{sfn|Unjianto 2011, Pendidikan}}

In 2012 the conference, which received 171 submissions and saw nearly 100 speakers, was held at [[Gadjah Mada University]] in Yogyakarta; speakers originated from a number of international and Indonesian universities, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Sydney University|Sydney]], [[Leiden University|Leiden]], and the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Fathoni 2012, UGM dan Yale}} The rector of Gadjah Mada University, Pratikno, stated that the conference was relevant to both Indonesia and the university as education was necessary to combat [[Corruption in Indonesia|corruption]].{{sfn|Andayani 2012, Pemerintah}} This was the last IIF conference with Yale support; a new, independent, organisational body was established so that the conference could continue independently.{{sfn|IIF, History}}

The sixth conference was held at [[Sunan Kalijaga Islamic University]], Yogyakarta, in 2013; over fifty individuals presented presenters. Of the conferences theme regarding change and continuity in the country, director of Sunan Kalijaga's post-graduate program Khoiruddin Nasution stated that changes were rapidly developing in the country and, as such, it was hoped that the IIF could provide recommendations to the Indonesian government regarding the correct path to take.{{sfn|Purwata 2013, UIN Sunan Kalijaga}}

[[File:Ravik Kardisi addressing 8th IIF Conference speakers, 2015-07-29 02.jpg|thumb|Ravik Kardisi, rector of [[Sebelas Maret University]], addressing the 8th conference]]
A seventh conference was held in 2014 at the Puri Khatulistiwa Hotel in Jatinangor, outside [[Bandung]], in collaboration with the [[Sunan Gunung Djati State Islamic University Bandung]]. The two-day conference consisted of six sessions, with three panels in each session, and each panel consisting of four speakers. The sixty-four speakers came from such institutions as the [[University of Freiburg]], [[Australian National University]], and [[Charles Darwin University]], and originated from countries such as Malaysia, Australia, and the United States. Topics discussed involved various aspects of Indonesian society, including law, history, culture, and economics. Ali Ramadhani, third vice president of Gunung Djati, stated that Indonesianists, such as those at the IIF, needed to stay confident in researching contemporary issues.{{sfn|Pikiran Rakyat 2014, Dinamika}}{{sfn|Ruslan 2014, Indonesia}}{{sfn|Ruslan 2014, Rayakan}}

The eight IIF conference was hosted by [[Sebelas Maret University]] in the city of [[Surakarta]] between 29 and 30 July 2015.{{sfn|IIF, Home Page (2015)}} Seventy speakers, representing such universities as [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina]], Berkeley, and [[University of London|London]], attended the conference. Panel themes included Art and Tradition in Indonesia, Wayang: Traditional Puppetry in Modern Times, and Tradition and Economy.{{sfn|Kurniati|2015}}{{sfn|Sinar Harapan 2015}} The following year, the ninth IIF conference was held at [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]]. More than fifty speakers presented papers with the theme "In Search of Key Drivers of Indonesian Empowerment". The keynote speaker, {{Interlanguage link multi|Sri Adiningsih|id}} of the Presidential Advisory Council, used the conference to call on Indonesianists and other academics to support the Indonesian government's efforts to promote empowerment.{{Sfn|UCAN 2016, Unika Atma Jaya}}

'''John W. Semple''' is a Canadian Scientist at [[St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto)|St. Michael's Hospital]] and a Professor of Pharmacology at the [[University of Toronto]].  He was born in [[Windsor, Ontario]] in 1959 and received his PhD in Immunology at [[Queen's University]] at [[Kingston, Ontario]].  In 1991, Semple, along with John Freedman, discovered a [[T helper cell]] defect in patients with the bleeding disorder called immune thrombocytopenic [[purpura]] (ITP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ITP is the condition of having a low [[platelet]] count (thrombocytopenia) and most causes appear to be related to [[antibodies]] against platelets. Very low platelet counts can lead to a bleeding diathesis and purpura. The T cell defect was initially shown to be an exaggerated [[interleukin-2]] response when T cells were cultured with platelets in vitro.  Subsequently, this [[cytokine]] abnormality was shown by others to be responsible for many of the [[autoimmune]] mechanisms causing the disorder.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The importance of understanding the T cell defects in ITP is that novel therapies aimed at these cells may significantly benefit patients with ITP.

'''Julia Abigail Fletcher Carney''' ([[pen name]]s, '''Julia''', '''Minnie May''', '''Frank Fisher''', '''Sadie Sensible''', '''Minister's Wife''', '''Rev. Peter Benson's Daughter'''; April 6, 1823 – November 1, 1908) was an American educator, poet, author, and editor. Remembered for her poem "[[Little Things (poem)|Little Things]]", many of her poems were set to music and published in school [[textbook]]s, and used in church hymn-books for more than half a century.{{sfn|Herringshaw|1904|p=194}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnary.org/person/Carney_JuliaAbigailFletcher|title=Mrs. T. J. Carney|publisher=Hymnary|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died November 1, 1908, in [[Galesburg, Illinois]].

Carney had charge of the "Poet's Corner" in the [[Boston]] ''Trumpet''. She furnished articles, both prose and verse, for the ''Christian Freeman'' when it was established. Something by her appeared in almost every number of the ''Rose of Sharon'', and also in the ''Lily of the Valley''. In the ''Universalist Miscellany'', her articles bore the pen name of "Rev. Peter Benson's Daughter". In 1840, she commenced writing for the ''[[The Universalist and Ladies' Repository|Ladies' Repository]]'', under the signature of "Julia." She was a regular contributor to the ''Boston Olive Branch''.{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}} She also wrote two volumes, published by J. M. Usher, entitled ''Gifts from Julia'', and a series of Sunday school [[Question books|question books]]. ''Poetry of the Seasons'' was published by Abel Tompkins.{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}}

==Early years and education==
Julia Abigail Fletcher was born April 6, 1823 in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]]. She inherited patriotism from [[American Revolution|Revolutionary]] ancestors, being a granddaughter of Major Timothy Fletcher, of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts]], and of Major Moses Warren, of [[Jay, Maine]]. She had no recollection of a time when she did not express her thoughts in verse. Her older brothers and sister were happy to write down her rhymes many years before she learned to do it herself. Her earliest sorrow was the opinion of a maiden aunt, freely expressed to her mother, that "if she let that child go on writing verses, she would never be good for anything else." This advice led to a maternal injunction, "Never let me see any more of your poetry." Subsequently, the mother found her daughter's rhymes hidden in the attic and repealed the injunction.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}}  

Several years of invalidism, the result of [[scarlet fever]] at the age of eight years, interfered with her education, but from her couch, she read through the libraries of the neighborhood. Her first works of verse were published in the Lancaster and [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] local papers at the age of fourteen.{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}} Educated at Lancaster Academy, her school compositions, chiefly in verse, were sent regularly to several papers and magazines in [[Boston]], whose editors were pleased with the youthful effusions, and constantly encouraged her to write.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}} 

==Career==
When seventeen, she went to [[Philadelphia]], where her married sister resided, and there remained two years, teaching in a private school. Returning to [[Massachusetts]] to the home of her parents, she served a summer's apprenticeship in the district school, where she attracted commendation from the committee by keeping a formerly unruly school in good order without corporal punishment. During her life as a teacher, she wrote many poems and sketches, most of them for radical papers with reform ideas, and also a series of [[Sunday school]] instruction books, which were used for many years in liberal churches, until Lesson Papers superseded the use of [[textbook]]s. In 1844, she was elected teacher of one of the primary schools in Boston, where she continued to teach until her marriage in the spring of 1849.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}}  

From 1849, her writing was chiefly prose, and for the ''Phrenological Journal'', ''Science of Health'', ''Midland Monthly'', and our various denominational papers, especially the ''New Covenant''. In 1869 and 1870, she conducted the "Home and Fireside" department of the ''New York National Agriculturist'', and the ''Bee-Keepers′ Journal''. As she was expected to fill several columns with continued novelties, she surprised her readers with a variety of signatures, including: "Minnie May," "Frank Fisher," "Sadie Sensible," and "Minister's Wife".{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}} Her signature of "Julia," however, though known to her friends, was usually dropped by those who copied her articles, and so it happened that those finding favor with the public went the rounds of paper, magazine, and schoolbook, many of them in the books from which she herself taught, without credit, some of them marked "Anon." As a writer, using too many signatures became a serious mistake, not only taking parts of her real name, sometimes her husband's, but fictitious ones. This was done, partly to give variety, when under engagement to fill a certain number of columns of "Home and Fireside" department in a [[New York City]] monthly, and partly as a minister's wife, who wanted to criticise the relations of pastor and people without giving offense.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}} 

She was deeply interested in the reform movements of the time, and often wrote on their behalf. She was also actively engaged in Sunday school work, and was well known as a writer for children. In later life, she wrote chiefly in prose, short sketches of real life, or essays upon [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]], and other serious subjects.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}} 

==Personal life==
In 1849, she married Rev. Thomas J. Carney (1818–1871), a [[Christian Universalism|Universalist]] minister. After a year's residence in [[Maine]], and another in [[Cooperstown, New York]], they took up their home in the West. Here, amid the many duties of pioneer life, and the care of little children, she seldom had time for writing.{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}} 

In 1871, the family had removed to Apple Creek Prairie, [[Illinois]] where the people had commenced a church under his ministry. He left home on horseback, and was returning to observe their wedding anniversary, when he was thrown from his horse. At first, it was supposed the injury would detain him at home for a few weeks, and he was sure of a speedy recovery; but soon, the lesion of a vein in his back caused unconsciousness from which he never recovered. He died May 4, 1871, and was buried at [[White Hall, Illinois]]. The widow was still in mourning when her son William, age 20, died suddenly of [[sunstroke]]. Four other children had died in infancy,{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}}{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litvin, Martin. Papers on Julia Fletcher Carney, 1843-1988: A Finding Aid.|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:DIV.LIB:div00669|publisher=[[Harvard Divinity School#Andover-Harvard Theological Library|Andover-Harvard Theological Library]]|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving one daughter and three sons still with her.{{sfn|Hanson|1884|p=170-}} She moved in with her oldest son, Fletcher Carney, an attorney of [[Galesburg, Illinois]], but made frequent visits to her younger son, Rev. James W. Carney, of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Moulton|1891|p=441}}

In 2013 he was recognised as "a pioneer in higher education transformation",&lt;ref name=" A Pioneer in Transformation "&gt;{{cite news |title=Media statement by the Chancellor of the National Orders, Dr Cassius Lubisi |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=35913&amp;tid=105146 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218132609/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=35913&amp;tid=105146 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by being awarded the [[Order of Mapungubwe]] in Silver, but has also generated extensive controversy during that process.

==Academic career==
Makgoba received an [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MBChB]] degree from the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal|University of Natal Medical School]] in 1976 with merit in medicine. In 1979 he was named the first black Nuffield Dominion Fellow to the [[University of Oxford]],&lt;ref name="nuff"&gt;{{cite news |title=A benefaction and its benefits.

He went on to become the first senior registrar to fellow expatriate South African and President of Royal College of Physicians of London, Sir [[Raymond Hoffenberg]], in 1983.

He was Reader in Molecular Endocrinology at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School London (1990–94)
He was the first black South African to be selected to the prestigious [[National Institute of Health]]'s Fogarty Visiting Programme in the late 1980s.
  
Makgoba was appointed the first black deputy vice-chancellor at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="wits1996"&gt;{{cite news |title=To Wit: a culture clash |author=Karen MacGregor |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=92445&amp;sectioncode=26 |newspaper=Times Higher Education |date=9 February 1996 |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makgoba left Wits University to join the [[South African Medical Research Council]]. He was appointed the first black Chairperson of the MRC Board(1995-1998). He thereafter served as President of the South African Medical Research Council between 1999 and 2002 and was involved in developing South Africa's AIDS strategy and the SA AIDS Vaccine Initiative.&lt;ref name="NRF"/&gt;

Professor Makgoba joined the former [[University of Natal]] as its Vice-Chancellor in 2002, and oversaw its merger with the [[University of Durban-Westville]] into the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]].

==Transformation-related debates and controversies==

===Clashes with "inbred elite" at the University of the Witwatersrand===
Shortly after his appointment as deputy vice chancellor of Wits, Makgoba announced to ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' that it was his intention to replace the university's "dominant eurocentrism", and called the university leadership a "small inbred elite"&lt;ref name="wits1996"/&gt; In response, 13 senior staff compiled a dossier contradicting claims made in his [[curriculum vitae]].&lt;ref name="wits1996"/&gt; Makgoba responded with his own accusations, based on the personal files of the 13, of tax evasion, inconsistent salary scales, nepotism, lack of qualifications and misrepresentation of credentials.&lt;ref name="wits1996"/&gt; Makgoba was temporarily suspended by the university for abusing his position to access the academics' personal files.&lt;ref name="wits1996"/&gt;

Journalist and biographer [[Mark Gevisser]] commented that "No intellectual debate defines our times more than that which racked the University of Witwatersrand in 1995"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevisser|first=Mark|title=Portraits of Power: Profiles of a Changing South Africa|publisher=David Phillips|url=http://www.kalahari.com/books/Portraits-of-Power-Profiles-of-a-Changing-South-Africa-Profiles-in-a-Changing-South-Africa/632/234840.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127103842/http://www.kalahari.com/books/Portraits-of-Power-Profiles-of-a-Changing-South-Africa-Profiles-in-a-Changing-South-Africa/632/234840.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahmood Mamdani]] stated that "Makogba was a victim of the 'racialised power' entrenched at Wits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mamdani|first=, M|title=Makgoba: victim of the 'racialised power' entrenched at Wits|journal=Source: SOCIAL DYNAMICS-A JOURNAL OF THE CENTRE FOR AFRICAN STUDIES UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN|year=1997|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–5|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=UA&amp;search_mode=Refine&amp;qid=2&amp;SID=X1mhMK7nN@PEO9pJojG&amp;page=1&amp;doc=6|doi=10.1080/02533959708458629}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Makgoba published a book about his experiences at Wits, entitled ''Mokoko – The Makgoba Affair''.&lt;ref name=makoko&gt;{{cite book|title=Mokoko: the Makgoba Affair : a reflection on transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mokoko.html?id=RMdCAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Vivlia Publishers, 1997|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he affirmed his commitment to the idea of an [[African Renaissance]] and to "transforming the higher education landscape". Guy Martin, professor at the School of Government of the [[University of the Western Cape]], referred to the book as "a personal account of the recent process of transformation occurring at Wits."&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Guy|title=Crisis in the Great Lakes|journal=African Studies Quarterly|year=1997|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/3/v1i3.pdf|accessdate=13 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216233020/http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/3/v1i3.pdf|archivedate=16 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin noted that, while Makgoba was "justifiably proud of his considerable achievements as an African scientist", the force with which he defends his credentials in the book "leads him to sound intellectually pompous and arrogant and utterly self-centered, if not downright egocentric".&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Martin also questioned Makgoba's "resort to some unorthodox--and, possibly, unethical--methods of struggle", and noted his own "uneasiness in attempting to disentangle objective reality from opinion, and fact from fiction" while reading the book.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Deputy President at the time, Thabo Mbeki, wrote: "The publication of this book demonstrates that it is possible to succeed in the struggle for change, despite the continuing exercise of power by powerful forces which owe their dominance to the very antithesis of "liberalism", however defined."&lt;ref name="makoko"/&gt;

In 2005, ''The [[Mail and Guardian]]'' newspaper published an opinion piece by Professor Makgoba entitled "The wrath of the dethroned white male"  which compared the behaviour of [[white South African]] males in post-Apartheid South Africa to "baboons or bonobos" who had lost their [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha status]], and were in need of "treatment and proper African rehabilitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2005-03-25-wrath-of-dethroned-white-males|title=Wrath of dethroned white males|publisher=''Mail and Guardian''|author=Malegapuru Makgoba|date=25 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article was debated heavily in the press, and provoked a response the following week from Robert Morrell, a professor in the Faculty of Education at UKZN under Makgoba.&lt;ref name="morrell"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Morrell|title=White, male, democrat, African|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2005-04-01-white-male-democrat-african/|publisher=''Mail and Guardian''|date=1 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that article, Morrell argued that Makgoba's article could rightfully be interpreted as "bullying managerial practice".&lt;ref name="morrell"/&gt; Later that year, Morrell brought a [[defamation]] case against Makgoba, primarily citing claims made about Morrell in an email sent out to staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=204881&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Alpha baboon article leads to libel case|author=Karen MacGregor|publisher=''Times Higher Education''|date=18 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell dropped the case three years later, following the death of his wife, and citing concern for his "own health and well-being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/morrel-drops-defamation-case-1.448779|author=Noelene Barbeau|title=Morrel drops defamation case|date=7 July 2009|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of stifling academic freedom at UKZN===
The Committee for Academic Freedom in Africa issued a statement in 2006 in protest against alleged infractions of academic freedom at the University of KwaZulu-Natal under Makgoba.&lt;ref name="ifex2006"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ifex.org/en/content/view/full/78144
|title=Lecturer faces disciplinary committee, possible dismissal, as free expression declines at university
|accessdate=18 November 2007

This partly arose from his treatment of critics, particularly those involved with the shack dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]], of his ordering the eviction of shack dwellers living on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/171|title=Shack dweller's press release}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he brought disciplinary action against one of the critics, UKZN academic Fazel Khan, for "bringing the university into disrepute", after Khan had answered questions put to him by the media after he was airbrushed out of a picture and removed from the text of an article on a film he had made that was printed in the University newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://squattercity.blogspot.com/2006/11/betrayal-and-colour-of-heart.html&lt;&lt;|title=Letter in support of Khan- 1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year ''The Mercury'' newspaper reported that Makgoba had threatened to, at the request of the mayor of Durban, bring evidence from the National Intelligence Agency to the Council and to charge academics who had been working with the shack dweller's movement Abahlali baseMjondolo with "incitement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abahlali.org/node/167&lt;&lt;|title=Mercury article}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff were also banned from speaking to the media during a two-week strike in February 2006. Strikers wore T-shirts that read: "We Demand Academic Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukzn.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?3,43,10,2347&lt;&lt;|title=Pictures and text of the UKZN 2006 strike}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the university senate invited faculties to make submissions on academic freedom.&lt;ref name="MGSubmission"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2008-04-15-ukzn-academics-question-senate-probe|author=Primarishni Gower|title=UKZN academics question senate probe|publisher=''Mail and Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation of the faculty of science and agriculture's submission was led by Professors Nithaya Chetty and John Van den Berg, who spoke to the press in April 2008 after Makgoba, as chairperson of the senate, blocked the submission several times, claiming that it was "self-serving and contributed nothing to the debate."&lt;ref name="MGSubmission"/&gt; Van den Berg and Chetty also voiced their frustrations that the submissions were to be investigated only by a one-man subcommittee of the senate, consisting of former education minister [[Sibusiso Bengu]], rather than being discussed in senate itself.&lt;ref name="MGSubmission"/&gt; 
Makgoba, as chair of the senate, blocked discussions of academic freedom. When Van den Berg criticised this, Makgoba accused him racism, cowardice, insubordination and lack of academic productivity.&lt;ref name="Dell"&gt;http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=4944&lt;/ref&gt;
Van den Berg voiced his frustrations in the press, and sent a letter to Makgoba which he also read out at a senate meeting.&lt;ref name="Dell"/&gt;

In response, in August 2008, the university brought disciplinary action against the two professors for having spoken to the press, in part for their criticism of Makgoba. They were charged with breaches of confidentiality, dishonesty and "gross negligence", and threatened with dismissal.&lt;ref name="MGDisciplinary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2008-11-06-ukzn-carpets-critics|title=UKZN carpets critics|author=Primarishni Gower|publisher=''Mail and Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the matter had initially been resolved by [[mediation]], this was rejected by university lawyers, who instead required that Chetty and Van den Berg sign admission of guilt forms, which they refused to do.&lt;ref name="IOLPressure"/&gt; Prof Alan Rycroft, representing the two professors, said of the matter, "As a labour lawyer, I have to question what kind of advice the legal team is giving to the vice-chancellor. If there has been misconduct, workplace discipline is meant to be corrective, not punitive."&lt;ref name="IOLPressure"/&gt;

Professor Van den Berg reached an agreement with the university's lawyers.&lt;ref name="vin"/&gt; The terms included that the agreement would stand before the university council, that Van den Berg would express his regret and apologise unreservedly to the university, council, senate and to Makgoba for any harm that he may have caused, "reputationally or otherwise" and accept that senate had resolved that Makgoba was entitled to remove "academic freedom" from the senate agenda.&lt;ref name="vin"/&gt; The university agreed that Van den Berg had not been grossly negligent in claiming to the press that Makgoba had no right to do so.&lt;ref name="vin"/&gt; Van den Berg was also issued a final written warning and agreed never to make "disparaging remarks" about Makgoba in the media.&lt;ref name="vin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=111944&amp;sn=Detail|title="You have been vindicated" - Omar Moosa SC to Makgoba (personal communication)|author=Omar Moosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Chetty resigned,&lt;ref name="vin" /&gt; citing concern for himself and his loved ones.&lt;ref name="IOLChettyResigns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/physics-professor-quits-ukzn-1.427056|title=Physics professor quits UKZN|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|date=27 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the Freedom of Expression Institute, said of the resignation, "I think he was forced into a position where he felt he had to resign. The disciplinary process, with such expensive legal counsel, was set up so that the professors would lose."&lt;ref name="IOLChettyResigns"/&gt;

The disciplinary proceedings were condemned by several prominent national organisations, including the South African National Editors Forum,&lt;ref name="IOLSanef"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/silencing-of-staff-worries-sanef-1.424169|title=Silencing of staff worries Sanef|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]],&lt;ref name="CleanUp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/clean-up-your-act-ukzn-warned-1.428164|title=Clean up your act, UKZN warned|author=Agiza Hlongwane|publisher=Independent Online (South Africa)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Freedom of Expression Institute and the SA Mathematical Society.&lt;ref name="IOLPressure"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/ukzn-under-pressure-to-halt-action-on-profs-1.423961|title=UKZN under pressure to halt action on profs|publisher=Independent Online (South Africa)|author=Latoya Newman|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African Education minister at the time, [[Naledi Pandor]] raised concern over the "persistent negative publicity" the situation had generated.&lt;ref name="CleanUp"/&gt;

A Council Committee on Governance and Academic Freedom (GAFC) including former Public Protector Advocate Selby Baqwa was set up internally by the University. In 2009 it found that, although there were problems dealing with academics who spoke to the media and with the manner of conduct of disciplinary hearings, Makgoba and the university had not threatened academic freedom.&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blaine|first=Sue|title=Varsity invites staff to join ‘freedom’ debate|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/Articles/Content.aspx?id=72264|accessdate=8 February 2012|newspaper=Businessday|date=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in spite of "two years of repeated criticism, both locally and abroad, of its commitment to academic freedom.".&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

In 2012, Makgoba,Karim and Coovadia stated  in an [[advertorial]] published by the ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]'' that UKZN had "followed a protracted legal struggle mounted to protect its scientific autonomy against official impediments to legitimate AIDS research"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gate5.co.za/qv/pr/15425028/17967946/9221/t|newspaper=Sunday Times Zulu|title=University of KwaZulu-Natal successfully defends Scientific Autonomy in AIDS Research|date=5 February 2012|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False allegations of sexual harassment==
Makgoba, along with the council chairman, stepped aside from their positions on 28 November 2006, after a scandal emerged involving claims of sexual harassment and victimisation levelled by the dean of the Faculty of Management Studies, Pumela Msweli-Mbanga.

'''Marion Koogler McNay''' (7 February 1883 – 13 April 1950), was an American [[Painting|painter]] and art teacher who inherited a substantial oil fortune upon the death of her father. She later willed her fortune to be used to establish San Antonio's first museum of [[modern art]], which today [[Marion Koogler McNay Art Museum|bears her name]].&lt;ref name="mcnay001"&gt;Burkhalter, Lois Wood. ''Marion Koogler McNay: A Biography, 1883-1950'' (San Antonio: Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Marion was born in [[Ohio]] to Marion and Clara Koogler. A year after her birth, the family moved to [[El Dorado, Kansas|El Dorado]], [[Kansas]], where her parents purchased a large tract of pasture land. This land later proved to contain substantial oil reserves, and made the family wealthy.&lt;ref name="mcnay001" /&gt; This allowed Marion to attend the [[University of Kansas]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

== Marriages ==
Marion married her first husband, railway manager Don McNay, in 1917. The marriage only lasted 10 months, ending with Don's death from [[influenza]]. Although Marion went on to marry (and [[divorce]]) four more times, she eventually reverted to using the name McNay for the remainder of her life.&lt;ref name="mcnay001" /&gt; She married and financially supported artist [[Victor Higgins]] in 1937, but the two separated only two years later and divorced in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Dean|title=Taos Artists and Their Patrons, 1898-1950|date=1999|publisher=Snite Museum of Art|location=Notre Dame, Indiana|isbn=0826321097|pages=144–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
In 1915, while she was living with her parents, the superintendent of city schools of [[Marion, Ohio]] wrote that she &lt;blockquote&gt;''is one of the best qualified art teachers I have ever known. She teaches art in a manner that arouses and develops the child’s observation and enlarges his aesthetic nature.''&lt;ref name="trc001"&gt;Biography. "Dedicated to the Advancement and the Enjoyment of Modern Art." Teacher Resource Center at the McNay Art Museum. [http://www.mcnaytrc.org/history.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Art collection ==
In 1926, after the death of her father, Marion moved to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] with her mother and married Dr. Donald Atkinson. On his property, she began to construct a Spanish Mediterranean style mansion (she designed some of the tilework and ceiling stencils herself),&lt;ref name="mcnay001" /&gt; which was completed in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=3&amp;artist=3564&amp;bio=1 Marion Koogler McNay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015205311/http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=3&amp;artist=3564&amp;bio=1 |date=2006-10-15 }}, Fine Art Dealers' Association.  Accessed 2007-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt; She also began to accumulate a significant collection of artwork. The first oil painting she purchased was [[Diego Rivera]]’s ''Delfina Flores''. She collected a large number of French [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] works of art, early 20th-century [[modernists]] including [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], and [[Chagall]]. She also bought a number of Southwestern [[Santo (art)|santos]] and [[retablos]].&lt;ref name="trc001" /&gt;

== Pueblo Indian patronage ==
Marion was a significant patron of the arts among the [[Pueblo Indians]] of [[New Mexico]], where she made frequent trips.&lt;ref name="trc001" /&gt; In 1943, [[United States Congress|Congress]] proposed a bill providing for the exploration of Pueblo lands with the ultimate goal of building a dam on the [[Rio Grande]]. Marion, in conjunction with other [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s, was instrumental in defeating this proposal.&lt;ref name="mcnay001" /&gt;

== Death and art museum establishment ==
Upon Marion's death, caused by pneumonia in 1950, she willed her fortune, her art collection, and her home to a trust to convert her home into a modern art museum. This was the first museum of its kind in San Antonio and the Southwest region of the United States. The museum was named after her, and has been expanded to include galleries of [[medieval art|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] artwork and a larger collection of 20th-century European and American modernist work. A large theatre arts library and gallery were also added, as well as an art reference library and an auditorium. More recently, the [[McNay Art Museum]] recently added the Stieren Center, built by internationally renowned architect [[Jean-Paul Viguier]], to display their Modern collection.

==History==
The Maurice-Tièche primary school was founded in 1936 by Maurice Tièche, a graduate from the historic [[University of Paris]] (commonly referred to as [[La Sorbonne]]). In October 1946, the first year 7 (6ème) class was opened. In October 1948, the rest of the [[junior high school]] was opened and the school was renamed ''Le Cours Complémentaire du Séminaire Adventiste''.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1953, the [[junior high school]] became a [[secondary school]] under the name ''le Cours Secondaire''. Over 100 pupils were enrolled at that time.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1973, the [[secondary school]] adopted the name ''Cours Privé Maurice Tièche'', then some years later, it became ''Lycée Privé Maurice Tièche''. 

The [[Primary school|primary]] and [[secondary schools]] merged into a combined school in 2003 which is now known as ''Ensemble Scolaire Maurice Tièche''.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.m-tieche.net/groupe-scolaire-prive/fondement.php "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408192102/http://www.m-tieche.net/groupe-scolaire-prive/fondement.php |date=2009-04-08 }}. Maurice Tieche Combined School. Retrieved 2009-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Pupils at the school have access to [[Adventist University of France – Collonges#Alfred Vaucher Library|Bibliothèque Alfred Vaucher]] (Alfred Vaucher Library) which it shares with the [[Adventist University of France – Collonges|Saleve Adventist University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibavaucher.net/ "About Alfred Vaucher Library"]. Alfred Vaucher Library. Retrieved 2009-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Section Etudes et Sports de Montagne'' (Studies and Mountain Sports section) of the school allows pupils to combine their high school studies and their passion for mountain sports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maurice-tieche.fr/esm "Section Etudes et Sports de Montagne"]. Maurice Tieche Combined School. Retrieved 2009-07-19&lt;/ref&gt; Preparatory classes start at year 9 but it is possible for students to take up the cycle in senior high school.

==Academics==
The school has three [[Baccalauréat]] général streams in which students can specialise in:
* '''S''' Scientifique (sciences)
* '''ES''' Sciences économiques et sociales (economics and social sciences)
* '''L''' littéraire (literature)

Since 2002, the pass rate for the [[Baccalauréat]] scientifique (Sciences) stream has been around 77% while in the littéraire (literature) stream, is around 95%.&lt;ref name="Senior High School"&gt;[http://www.m-tieche.net/groupe-scolaire-prive/college-lycee/lycee.php "Lycée"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417004138/http://www.m-tieche.net/groupe-scolaire-prive/college-lycee/lycee.php |date=2009-04-17 }}. Maurice Tieche Combined School. Retrieved 2009-07-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The students in première (Year 12) and terminale (Year 13) are generally in classes of 12 in each of their respective streams. In certain subjects such as French where the programme is joint, students come together to form classes of a maximum of 24 students. This allows teachers to track individual students and address many of their questions.&lt;ref name="Senior High School"/&gt;

[[File:Escola Politécnica de Lisboa.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|Façade of the National Museum of Natural History and Science, at Rua da Escola Politécnica, Lisbon]]
The '''National Museum of Natural History and Science''' in  [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Museu Nacional de História Natural e da Ciência}}) is the country's main museum focusing on nature. Established in 1926, the museum functions under the [[University of Lisbon]].

Its rich collections, gathered over more than 250 years, span [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[geology]] and [[botany]].

The museum has activities for the promotion of natural history and science awareness, with space for artistic exhibitions, conferences, debates, workshops and courses.

==History==

Its public designation is "MUjHNAC - National Museum of Natural History and Science". It was founded in October 2011. This unit incorporated the former National Museum of Natural History and the [[University of Lisbon]] Science Museum, integrating their collections, the old buildings of the Polytechnic School, the Lisbon Botanical Gardens and the Lisbon Astronomical Observatory (this one since July 2012):&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhnc.ul.pt|title=History of the National Museum of Natural History and Science|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MUjHNAC began in the Royal Natural History Museum and Botanical Garden, created in the second half of the eighteenth century, in [[Ajuda]] (western Lisbon). It was then housed for a short period in the Royal Academy of Sciences and transferred to the Polytechnic School (1858), first denominated as the National Museum of Lisbon (1861).

The Botanic Gardens of Lisbon officially opened in 1878.

In 1911, with the creation of the University of Lisbon, the Museum was attached to the Faculty of Sciences, taking the name of National Museum of Natural History in 1926.

In March 1978 a devastating fire destroyed much of the building of the former Polytechnic School, as well as the zoology collection and part of the geology collection. The Faculty then moved to other premises.

The Science Museum of the University of Lisbon was created in May 1985, sharing the building with the National Museum of Natural History.

Both museums were given new bylaws in 2003, becoming autonomous from the Faculty of Sciences and under the direct administration of the Rector of the University of Lisbon.

'''Patient education''' is the process by which [[health professional]]s and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|title=iv. Patient Education and Counseling for Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064558/http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training.

[[Health education]] is also a tool used by [[managed care]] plans, and may include both general [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] education or [[health promotion]] and disease or condition specific education.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved.It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. 

The value of patient education can be summarized as follows:
*Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability.
*Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition.
*Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them.
*Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply.
*Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications.
*Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need.
*Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits.
*Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krames.com Krames Patient Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient-education.com/?p=editorial&amp;s=xplainresearch&amp;ver=~2 Patient Education Institute, Research evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competencies of a [[health educator]] include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastable|first=Susan B.|title=Health Professionals as Educator|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Learning, LLC|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others.
*Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care.
*Practice preventative health care.
*Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families.
*Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care.
*Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society.
*Use technology appropriately and effectively.
*Be current in the field and continue to advance education.
There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment.
* For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantera|first=E.|last2=Pourtier-Piotte|first2=C.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=L.|last4=Coudeyre|first4=E.|title=Patient education after amputation: Systematic review and experts’ opinions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877065714000165|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=143–158|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving  overall patient health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zangi|first=Heidi A.|last2=Ndosi|first2=Mwidimi|last3=Adams|first3=Jo|last4=Andersen|first4=Lena|last5=Bode|first5=Christina|last6=Boström|first6=Carina|last7=Eijk-Hustings|first7=Yvonne van|last8=Gossec|first8=Laure|last9=Korandová|first9=Jana|date=2015-06-01|title=EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/954|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=954–962|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206807|issn=1468-2060|pmid=25735643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silver-McLean teaching-methodology.png|thumb]]
'''Pete Silver &amp; Will McLean''' are two British architectural practitioners, educators, writers, and technical theorists who work together as a duo. They have taught at the [[Architectural Association]], [[The Bartlett]] ([[University College London]]), and The [[University of Westminster]]'s School of Architecture and the Built environment, thus gaining a privileged position in the contemporary London architectural scene.

==Background==
Will McLean is a Doctor of Philosophy and artist [[Bruce McLean]]&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McLean has been engaging with architecture for over twenty years through an ongoing collaboration with [[Will Alsop]] on such buildings as the proposed 151 City Road, London: http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=866&lt;/ref&gt;'s son. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under [[Will Alsop]] OBE RA and Professor [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]]. McLean has worked on a series of projects with Bruce McLean, most notably Dalry Primary School in North Ayrshire completed in 2007 (www.primaryspace.net), and with US architect and artist Adam Kalkin,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectureandhygiene.com (free download)&lt;/ref&gt; working on such projects as 'Quik Build' container housing. He has had a regular feature, covering technical innovations, in Architectural Design magazine - McLean's Nuggets, and is an Editor of Construction History - the International Journal of the Construction History Society[[File:Dalry.jpg|thumb|Dalry Primary School]]
Pete Silver worked for Solon [[Housing Association]] in South London with architects such as [[Patrick Keiller]], [[Edward Cullinan]] and [[Walter Segal]]. He trained at the [[Architectural Association]] under Professors [[John Frazer (architect)|John Frazer]] and [[Gordon Pask]], and became a researcher in the Land Use Research Unit at [[King's College London]], gaining a unique insight into Professor [[Alice Coleman]]'s groundbreaking, if controversial work, on post-war housing [[urban regeneration|regeneration]]. Silver is a director of the Chartered Practice Architects (CPA) Ltd. His current work involves prototyping new structural (diagrid) frameworks from torsional elastic helixes.
[[File:R0018207.JPG|thumb|Torsional Diagrid]]

==Collaborative career==
In 2001, Silver and McLean joined the School of Architecture and the Built environment at the [[University of Westminster]] where they jointly head the Technical Studies Department.&lt;!-- TEACHING ETHOS. --&gt; 
They have co-authored four architecture books: ''Fabrication: the designer's guide'' (Architectural Press), ''Introduction to Architectural Technology'' (Laurence King Publishing - available in 7 languages), ''Structural Engineering for Architects: A Handbook'' (Laurence King Publishing, co-authored with engineer Peter Evans - available in 4 languages) and Air Structures (Laurence King Publishing).
They co-curate a highly successful public lecture series,

It has been ranked the best private university in Ghana and third best after the [[University of Ghana]] and [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology|KNUST]] by world university ranking website [http://www.webometrics.info/en/Africa/Ghana webometrics].

== History and background ==
Per historical accounts, the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana]] established Ghana's first elementary school in the country in 1843 which resulted in the institutionalization of [[Formal learning|formal education]] in the country.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presbyuniversity.edu.gh/site/|title=Presbyterian University College, Ghana {{!}} Discipline in Leadership|website=www.presbyuniversity.edu.gh|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912011629/http://www.presbyuniversity.edu.gh/site/|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, the church founded a teacher-catechist seminary, the Basel Mission Seminary, later known as the Presbyterian Training College (PTC) at [[Akropong]] as the second higher educational institution in West Africa after [[Fourah Bay College]] in [[Sierra Leone]]. This development led to the establishment of several primary and secondary schools and colleges of education through a strategic partnership with the [[Government of Ghana|Ghanaian government]]; specifically, 1,886 schools made up of 490 kindergartens, 973 primary school, 388 junior secondary schools, 25 senior secondary schools, five vocational institutes and five colleges of education.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The church has also been instrumental in providing agricultural and health services for citizens.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The initial plan was to upgrade the Presbyterian Training College at Akropong to a full-fledged university like [[Fourah Bay College]] but that did no come into fruition.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  More than a century and a half later, the Synod of the Presbyterian Church during its 1996 conference voted to establish an actual university culminating in the setting up of an Implementation Committee in 1998.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The university sought to augment higher education services to meet to increasing demand for college education.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite its religious affiliation, the university college welcome students of all backgrounds, ethnicity, religion and geography.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The school runs a fee-paying, multi-campus, residential or hostel system in partnership with private enterprise.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Its academic programs are in humanities and social sciences, particularly theology, language and mission studies.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The school also offers programs in science and technology including health sciences, medicine, dentistry and nursing.&lt;ref name="est" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Priscilla Baird''' (1828-1904) was a pioneering teacher in Missouri and Illinois and an advocate for girls' education. She began her career in [[Shelbyville, Missouri]] in 1851. She then taught at Liberty Female College and Lancaster schools before relocating to Illinois during the civil war and teaching at the Springfield High School. Returning to Missouri, she taught at Ingleside College in [[Palmyra, Missouri]] and at Hardin College in [[Mexico, Missouri]]. After completing nearly thirty years of teaching, she founded the [[Baird College]] in 1885, where she remained until her retirement in 1897.

==Early life==
Priscilla A. Davis was born in 1828 in [[Shelby County, Kentucky]] to Harriet M. (née Bell) and Samuel E. Davis.{{sfn|''The Christian Evangelist''|1904|p=26}}{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}} She studied with private tutors in her youth and attended [[Julia A. Tevis]]'s [[Science Hill School (Shelbyville, Kentucky)|Science Hill Female Academy]] in [[Shelbyville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Eagle|1894|p=414}} At the age of fourteen, she was converted to the Baptist faith through her grandfather Francis Davis and an elder, George Waller.{{sfn|Duncan|1882|p=884}} Waller also performed Davis' marriage ceremony on March 12, 1846, when she married Jesse K. Baird in Shelby County.{{sfn|Kentucky Marriages 1797-1954|1846|p=584}} Five years after their marriage, the couple moved to Missouri,{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}} along with their three children: M. Belle (born 1847), Thomas D. (born 1849) and Itonia J. (born 1851).{{sfn|U.S. Census|1850|p=280}}{{sfn|U.S. Census|1860|p=3}}

==Career==
Baird began teaching at a private school in [[Shelbyville, Missouri]] around 1851 and remained at the school for four years.{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}} The institution was a Baptist school and she taught under the direction of elders W. F. Broadus and John L. Waller.{{sfn|Duncan|1882|p=884}}  The family then moved to [[Liberty, Missouri|Liberty]] in [[Clay County, Missouri]], where Baird taught at the Liberty Female College, which was affiliated with the [[William Jewell College]]. She and her brother, John T. Davis each served as associate president of the college for four years, before Baird moved to [[Lancaster, Missouri|Lancaster]], [[Schuyler County, Missouri]]. She taught from 1860 to 1863 in Lancaster, but as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] moved [[Missouri in the American Civil War|west]], the family moved to [[Springfield, Illinois]]. Baird taught at the [[Springfield High School (Illinois)|Springfield High School]] for seven years, while her husband, a surveyor by trade, served in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Jesse's exposure to the conditions during the war of camp life and long marches, caused health problems. Though he survived the war, he died at the age of 49 in 1871.{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}}

While in Springfield, Baird was recruited to become the president of Ingleside College in [[Palmyra, Missouri]], where she began work in 1873.{{sfn|''The Marion County Herald''|1904|p=3}} She hired an ex-slave, Sina Banks as her cook. Banks would remain with her for the next thirty years.{{sfn|Baker|Baker|1996|p=41}} The business manager of the college was Homer T. Baird,{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}} with whom Baird would marry on April 25, 1875.{{sfn|Missouri Marriages 1750-1920|1875}} In addition to administering the school, Baird taught arithmetic and history, though the fees charged were inadequate to cover the costs of running the establishment, according to one of her former pupils, [[Robert Coontz]], who would become a rear admiral in the United States Navy.{{sfn|Coontz|1930|p=39}} She remained at Ingleside for six years and tendered her resignation when she was appointed president of [[Hardin College and Conservatory of Music]].{{sfn|''The Marion County Herald''|1904|p=3}} The couple moved to [[Mexico, Missouri]] to take up the post and continued with Homer as business manager and Baird serving as the school principal and teacher. During her tenure at Hardin, the school grew from a small number of enrollees to having several hundred students{{sfn|''The Marion County Herald''|1904|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Mexico Weekly Ledger''|1885|p=3}} and both of her daughters taught at the school.{{sfn|Duncan|1882|p=885}}

In 1885, the family moved to [[Clinton, Missouri]], where they began operating a school they had founded known as [[Baird College]].{{sfn|''The Mexico Weekly Ledger''|1885|p=3}} Within 2 years of its opening, the school had around 100 boarding students and 300 attendees, being taught art, elocution, languages, and music.{{sfn|''The Daily Arkansas Gazette''|1887|p=5}} Though it was a Christian-based school, it operated as non-denominational.{{sfn|Anderson|1896|p=16}} Baird ran the school until 1897,{{sfn|Speer|1897|p=12}} when she decided to close it due to poor health.{{sfn|Baker|Baker|1996|p=41}} In 1903, the Bairds moved to Denver, Colorado, where her daughter Itonia was teaching French at [[West High School (Denver)|West High School]].{{sfn|''The Marion County Herald''|1904|p=3}}

In addition to teaching and administrating schools, Baird was active in church work and organized many Sunday school and Bible classes. She served as Secretary of the Missouri Baptist State Women’s Association for many years.{{sfn|''The Marion County Herald''|1904|p=3}} She also was a staunch supporter of education for women and girls and presented a paper at the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]] in Chicago in 1893, which received wide support.{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}}{{sfn|Eagle|1894|p=414}}

==Death and legacy==
Baird died on October 13, 1904 in [[Denver]], Colorado.{{sfn|''The Christian Evangelist''|1904|p=26}} Her three children all became prominent professionals. Her son Thomas D. Baird became a physician and at one time was the president of the Colorado State Board of Medical Examiners. Her two daughters, Belle True and Itonia J. Baird both became educators.{{sfn|''Portrait and biographical record of the state of Colorado''|1899|p=685}}

The '''Sabah Foundation''' ({{lang-ms|Yayasan Sabah}}) or '''Yayasan Sabah Group (YSG)''' is a state sanctioned organisation that was developed to promote educational and economic opportunities for its people. It was founded by [[Mustapha bin Harun|Tun Mustapha Harun]] and manages a diverse portfolio of resources and issues.

==History==
[[File:KotaKinabalu Sabah MenaraTunMustapha-01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tun Mustapha Tower]], Sabah Foundation headquarters&lt;br&gt;Opening on 1977]]
The [[Kota Kinabalu]]-based [[think-tank]] was allowed to be established by 1966 Sabah State Legislative Assembly Enactment No. 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawnet.sabah.gov.my/Lawnet/SabahLaws/StateLaws/SabahFoundationEnactment1966.pdf State of Sabah - 1966 Enactment for Sabah Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was created in 1966 by [[Mustapha bin Harun|Tun Mustapha Harun]] create educational opportunities for the country's [[Malaysian people]]. Four years later its scope was expanded to include economic and social advancement. It also coordinates distribution of resources in the event of a natural disaster to those in need. It was Tun Mustapa Harun's further goal "to promote [[Malayisation]] consciousness amongst the people of Sabah."&lt;ref name="ysnet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ysnet.org.my/ | title=Introduction | publisher=Yayasan Sabah Corporation | accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Ascher|title=Why Governments Waste Natural Resources: Policy Failures in Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNN6-zkm5M8C&amp;pg=PA104|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6096-6|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966–1975===
In 1967, coinciding with the formation of the Sabah Foundation, the Ministry of Natural Resources was abolished. The government gave the foundation 3,300 acres of land and a grant of 1 million [[Malaysian ringgit|ringgit]] to fund the start-up of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Regina Lim|title=Federal-state Relations in Sabah, Malaysia: The Berjaya Administration, 1976–85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM4HifRARgYC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-812-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Sabah Foundation was tasked, through a 100-year lease, of managing the 855,000 hectares of [[virgin forest]]. Nineteen years later their total holdings were 1.07 million hectares. Sabah's total [[land area]] is 7.4 million [[hectacre]]s.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; Tun Mustapha withheld earnings is should have paid to the state and used the fund for political purposes, providing proceeds to the electorate and to support his political associates.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

[[Harold Crouch]] wrote of Tun Mustapha's resulting political power:
{{Quotation|...only in Sabah during the rule of Tun Mustapha (from 1967 to 1975) were violations of democratic practices so flagrant that elections lost their meaning. When Sabah participated for the first time in a national election in 1969, opposition candidates managed to file nominations in only six of the sixteen constituencies, the rest being disqualified for one reason or another. In 1974 only one opposition candidate succeeded in being nominated. The leaders of an opposition party were said to have been bribed to abandon their challenge while supporters of another party, the peninsula-based Pekemas, were physically intimidated by Mustapha's men.|[[Harold Crouch]]&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;}}

In late 1975 Tun Mustapha was forced by the government to resign. The Sabah State government then pulled the foundation under the authority of the government.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; The foundation over-harvested its timber natural resources to fund its political agenda.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

===1975−1985===
Although the foundation was no longer a private entity, the state government, led by the [[Sabah People's United Front|Berjaya]] political party, did not have the control that they expected because financial investments continued to be controlled by Innoprise, an entity and within the foundation responsible for managing its investments.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; The Sabah Foundation's large budget allows it to continued to manage a diverse range of activities, including [[reforestation]], [[hospitality industry|hospitality]] and [[tourism industry]], agro-plantation, [[shipping industry|shipping]], [[real estate development]], [[biotechnology]], [[horticulture]], [[fisheries]] and [[food industry]], and the [[oil and gas industry]].&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; It continued to wield political power, including state elections between 1978 and 1990.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

===1985−present===
After the Berjaya and until 1994, the [[Parti Bersatu Sabah]] (PBS) political party gained control of the government, "in opposition to the national government".&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; In 1991 Jeffrey Kitingan, Sabah Foundation head, was detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] for 31 months for "plotting the secession of Sabah from the Malaysian Foundation" and then fired from his position at the foundation. Charges of corruption were dropped when Jeffrey Kitigan left the PBS political party.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) had political control. During this time Sabah Foundation continued its developmental efforts with little governmental intervention.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; In 1994 a [[Price Waterhouse]] audit revealed that Sabah Foundation accounts were missing more than $1 billion, evidence of accusations of corruption. At that time, Innoprise had more than a dozen subsidiaries with little oversight. Based upon the audit results, Sabah Foundation was reorganised, governmental officials were to site on its board of trustees and Chief Minister [[Salleh Said Keruak|Datuk Salleh Tun Said]] chaired the board.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

In 2012 allegations were brought against the foundation's former Chief Minister Musa Aman for embezzling over $90 million from the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondialisation.ca/foreign-ngos-and-malaysias-logging-scandal/5304696|title=Foreign NGOs and Malaysia’s Logging Scandal  {{!}}  Mondialisation - Centre de Recherche sur la Mondialisation|website=www.mondialisation.ca|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Shafie Apdal, Sabah Foundation chairman, ordered a full investigation into the financial affairs of Rakyat Berjaya, which is fully owned by the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2018/05/29/shafie-shocked-over-huge-losses-suffered-by-sabah-foundation-subsidiary/|title=Shafie shocked over huge losses suffered by Sabah Foundation subsidiary|date=2018-05-29|work=Free Malaysia Today|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=124107|title=Shafie must explain, says Umno {{!}} Daily Express Newspaper Online|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
From the start, one of its goals was to attain opinions from local and international sources. The foundation has a wide [[Borneo]] focus and aims to find ways to draw the investment needed for "peninsula regeneration and prosperity". The organisation is intended to make a worthwhile contribution to economic growth in [[Kuala Lumpur]]-based interested in setting up government policy platforms for economic development.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The foundation also sent a number of its staff of lecturers at the [[Universiti Malaysia Sabah]], [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]], [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] which has carried out a campaign of [[Islamisation]] throughout the state, together with the Federal government assistance to ''infuse Islamic values'' into government administration and civil services, funding Islamic religious establishments and launched a massive [[Malayisation]] program to realise its goal. The people who opposed to this were considered “extremist or deviant,” and some people were detained under the Malaysian [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Organisation==
Sabah Foundation is now under the Sabah Government with three organisational divisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ysnet.org.my/corporate.asp?p=c&amp;l=bi | title=Structure | publisher=Sabah Foundation | accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research library===
Within Sabah Foundation's [[Tun Mustapha Tower]] headquarters complex is the Fuad Stephens Borneo Research Library, named for former Chief Minister [[Tun Fuad Stephens]]. It was established with the support of the [[National Library of Malaysia]], [[Universiti Teknologi MARA|Mara Institute of Technology]] Library, [[Sabah State Library]], [[Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia]] Library and the [[Sabah State Museum]] Librarian. It is a three-level building with a total area of 3,135.48 square metres. Its objective is to "undertake strategic initiatives to function as a primary information resource center - contributing towards establishing a [[knowledge economy|knowledge-economic]] society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ms&amp;u=http://www.kborneo.com/directory.cfm%3FShow%3DSabah%2520Foundation&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DSabah%2BFoundation%26sa%3DN%26hl%3Den | title=Sabah Foundation | publisher=KBorneo.com | accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Foundation trustees and staff are appointed by the [[List of Chief Ministers of Sabah|chief minister]]. The foundation likened to [[Indonesia]]n President [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|administration]] and "heavily criticised for its partisan nature" assuming that it "was a device for imposing mainstream [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] culture onto [[Dayak people|Dayak]] (and in particular [[Iban people|Iban]]) youth".&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt; One year after the organisation's creation, Sabah Foundation's founder, Tun Mustapha Harun, became president of Sabah.&lt;ref name="Ascher1999"/&gt;

===Environmental issues===
In the 1970s, logging increased in its concession area.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/a_desperate_effort_to_save_the_rainforest_of_borneo/2540/|title=A Desperate Effort to Save the Rainforest of Borneo by Rhett Butler: Yale Environment 360|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabah Foundation has a 100-year logging concession.

'''Saint Louis University - Madrid Campus''' (SLU-Madrid), founded in 1967, is a 4-year American university in Spain. Saint Louis University is a highly ranked [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] institution with campuses in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, and [[Madrid]], Spain. SLU-Madrid offers fully accredited American undergraduate and graduate degrees that can be completed in Spain or combined with studies at the St. Louis campus.

The student body at SLU-Madrid comprises approximately 750 students from over 65 different countries. English is the language of instruction, with selected courses offered in Spanish. The average class size is 14.8, and the student to faculty ratio is 11:1.

==Accreditation==

Saint Louis University is [[higher education accreditation|accredited]] by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and has been continuously accredited since 1916. The most recent accreditation approval was issued in 2012 following a three-year intensive self-study carried out by a set of university-wide committees, including a subcommittee of the Madrid Campus. The Institutional Actions Council (IAC) of the HLC voted to continue the accreditation of Saint Louis University, with the next comprehensive evaluation set for 2021-22.

The university has also attained accreditation from appropriate professional bodies for specific programs; for example, the [[John Cook School of Business]], through which the Madrid campus offers its International Business program, is accredited by AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), the premier business school accrediting body. Engineering degrees are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

==History==
The Madrid campus was founded in 1967 by Raymond L. Sullivant as a study abroad program. Classes were offered in conjunction with the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, a Spanish Jesuit institution. The success of the study abroad program led Sullivant to develop an independent, permanent program, with administrative offices and classrooms located between Madrid's [[Complutense University]] and the city center.

Shortly thereafter, a number of Spanish students, attracted to the university's [[liberal arts]] curriculum, enrolled in classes. Within a decade, SLU-Madrid was home to hundreds of students. As the programs expanded, students were able to complete the first two years of their undergraduate studies in Madrid. By 2005, students were able to complete all four years of their degree and graduate in Madrid.

In 1990, SLU-Madrid acquired Padre Rubio and Padre Arrupe Halls. In 1996, the university became the first U.S. institution to receive official recognition from the ''Consejería de Educación y Deporte'', Madrid's higher education authority. In 2011, the university expanded the Madrid Campus further with the acquisition and renovation of San Ignacio Hall, providing additional space to support students and faculty, including a new library, cafeteria and auditorium.

Today, students from more than 65 countries pursue undergraduate and graduate courses at SLU-Madrid. The campus offers four-year undergraduate degrees and graduate degrees, and hosts [[student exchange program|study abroad]] students from more than 150 universities in the U.S. and worldwide. Recognized as a center of international education in Spain, SLU-Madrid remains committed to the ideals of service and leadership that the university, its students, faculty, and staff have upheld since 1818, when the St. Louis Campus was founded.

==Facilities==
[[File:Fachada Arrupe.jpg|thumb|Façade of SLU Madrid Campus, Padre Arrupe Hall]]

Padre Arrupe Hall houses administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, and biology, chemistry, computer, nursing and physics labs. Padre Rubio Hall, the main academic building, features additional classrooms, the Office of Student Life, student lounges, the bookstore and St. Timothy's Chapel. San Ignacio Hall, acquired in 2011, is home to an auditorium, art, dance and music studios, additional classrooms, a full-service cafeteria and dining room, the library, faculty offices and a rooftop terrace.

In addition to over 10,000 volumes that are available in the Madrid library, students in Madrid have access to the vast collection of electronic resources and databases owned by Saint Louis University.

==Billiken==

The [[Billiken]] is Saint Louis University's distinctive mascot and has been for 100 years. The SLU mascot is a representation of the one-of-a-kind educational experience students receive during their time as SLU students.

==Undergraduate degree programs==

The courses offered at SLU-Madrid fulfill degree requirements for the nearly 100 undergraduate majors available through Saint Louis University. Students may complete all 120 credits hours for the following degrees on the campus in Madrid:

*Art History
*Business Administration/Economics
*Business Administration/International Business
*Communication
*Economics
*English*
*History*
*International Studies
*Political science/International Relations
*Psychology
**This degree is not valid if you want to pursue a psychology degree in Spain. At least two additional years of education in a Spanish institution are required to validate your degree.
*Spanish

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;One semester required at the St. Louis Campus.

Students pursuing other majors including engineering, computer science, and nursing can complete the first two years of study in Madrid before transferring to the St. Louis Campus to finish their degree.

SLU-Madrid also hosts visiting students from over 150 different universities across the United States and around the world. Study abroad students choose from more than 200 courses each semester, including classes in engineering, health sciences and other non-traditional study abroad fields.

==Postgraduate education==
[[File:Padre Rubio Hall.jpg|left|thumb|Padre Rubio Hall]]
SLU-Madrid offers two M.A. programs:

*English literature
*Spanish language and literature.

Students may fulfill all requirements for the M.A. programs in Madrid, or through a combination of study at the Madrid Campus and the St. Louis Campus.

The M.A. in Spanish program focuses on Spanish and Latin American language, culture and literature. The program can be completed over the course of three or four summers, or during the academic year. The program is designed for holders of a B.A. in Spanish or a related field, language educators, and literary scholars.

Additionally, the Madrid Campus hosts the SLU Summer Law School.

==Campus life==

The [https://www.slu.edu/madrid/campus-life/student-life-office Office of Student Life] sponsors a wide range of extracurricular activities, both on and off campus, including trips that deepen students’ cultural understanding of Spain or that complement their studies by taking them to destinations around Spain, Europe, and Africa. Clubs include the Student Government Association, the Gay-Straight Alliance, the International Relations Society, Poker Club, the Glee Club, Film Club, Debate Club, among others.

Campus Ministry organizes a program of activities for exploring faith and a commitment to social justice. Each semester, the university sponsors a retreat to [[Sanctuary of Loyola|Loyola]], the birthplace of [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]], the founder of the Jesuit order. The Ignatian Community Council organizes panel discussions, service projects, documentary film viewings, and interfaith activities to encourage dialogue within the diverse religious community on campus and address the tough issues of social justice the world faces today.

In keeping with the Jesuit mission of the university, SLU-Madrid offers its students, faculty and staff opportunities for living out their identity as "men and women for others" through community service and outreach. Volunteers collaborate with dozens of local NGOs. Projects include teaching English to hearing-impaired children, serving meals in a soup kitchen, and raising money for the Red Cross.

SLU-Madrid offers career counseling, practice interviews, résumé critiques and workshops/ networking events on campus.

'''Science Learning Centres''' are a [[UK Government]] initiative to address the need for improved [[science education]] and development for teachers in England.

==Origins==
In 2001, the House of Lords Science &amp; Technology Select Committee Report&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldsctech/47/4702.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; identified an urgent need for subject specific Continuing Professional Development for Science Teachers. In response to this and numerous other calls for action, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] and the [[Wellcome Trust]]  invested £51 million in the creation of the '''national network of Science Learning Centres'''.  After a competitive tendering process the first Science Learning Centre opened its doors in October 2004. Today the Centres are more than just a location for training courses, they are rapidly becoming the focus for all science education activity in the UK.

==Continuing professional development==
'''Science Learning Centres''' run courses that provide continuing [[professional development]] for ''anyone'' involved in the teaching of science, from those working with reception aged children to post 16 students, including primary and secondary teachers, technicians, teaching assistants and FE lecturers.

The aim of all '''Science Learning Centres''' is to reconnect teachers with the frontiers of their subject and the latest techniques for teaching it. Teachers who attend courses are given the opportunity to renew and extend their teaching skills by mixing with and learning from colleagues who face similar challenges to their own, and have access to the UK’s leading experts in science educational research.

==Centres==
There are '''10 Science Learning Centres''' around the country.  One to serve each of the nine English government regions and a '''National Science Learning Centre''' (based in the University of York) which provides training for anyone from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  Each Centre is run by a consortium of organisations, which vary from local councils and professional bodies to universities, schools, science centres and industry partners.

*The National Science Learning Centre, located in York
*Science Learning Centre East of England, located in Hertfordshire
*Science Learning Centre East Midlands, located in Leicester
*Science Learning Centre London
*Science Learning Centre North East, located in Durham
*Science Learning Centre North West, located in Manchester
*Science Learning Centre South East, at the University of Southampton is now the [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mslc Mathematics and Science Learning Centre] (MSLC)
*Science Learning Centre South West, located in Bristol
*Science Learning Centre West Midlands, located in Keele
*Science Learning Centre Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, located in Sheffield

==Courses==
The courses offered at the regional Centres usually feature one day’s training at the Centre, together with ongoing support through classroom exercises and online materials.  The '''National Science Learning Centre''', based at the [[University of York]], offers residential courses for teachers, providing access to the facilities for teachers of two or more days, often spread across more than one term.

==Ambitions==
The national network of Science Learning Centres has been created with ambitious goals in mind; not least to help British teachers, lecturers, technicians and classroom assistants to lead the world in science education by 2015.

The '''Senior Cambridge''' examinations were [[General Certificate of Education]] examinations held in [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[India]], and [[Jamaica]]. They were preceded by the [[Junior Cambridge]] and [[Preliminary Cambridge]] examinations.

==History==
===India===
The first school in [[Delhi]] to offer the Senior Cambridge examination was the Cambridge School at [[Daryaganj]]. After 1972, the Senior Cambridge examinations were largely superseded by the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and the Indian School Certificate(ISC) examinations conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), an autonomous body established in 1958.

===Malaysia===
During the [[Japan]]ese occupation of Malaysia in [[World War II]], pupils who sat their Senior Cambridge examinations at some schools in 1941 had to wait until 1946 to learn their results. It was replaced with the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]] during the late 1970s.

===Pakistan===
At its independence from British India in 1947, Pakistan inherited a number of schools that offered Senior Cambridge examinations. But one of the first schools to offer Senior Cambridge was Cathedral School Hall Road Lahore. Since then, the number of schools with a Senior Cambridge curriculum expanded greatly, and Cambridge schools are prominent among the premier educational institutions of Pakistan.

===Singapore===
Prior to the introduction of the [[O Levels]] examinations by [[UCLES]], students sat for the Senior Cambridge examinations at the end of their four-year secondary school studies. This is equivalent to the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (or GCSE) in England. The Higher School Certificate (HSC) examinations were replaced by [[A Levels]] (roughly equivalent to the present British "[[sixth form]]") in 1973.

==Subjects==
===Textbooks===
At the Victoria Institution in 1933, the following list of school textbooks was issued to pupils preparing to study for the Senior Cambridge examinations:
* ''New School Arithmetic''
* ''Algebra'', Baker and Bourne
* ''Geometry Parts I - VI''
* ''Logarithm Tables''
* ''English Exercises'', [[Henry Watson Fowler]]
* ''Expansion of the British Empire''
* ''Historical Atlas''
* ''Essentials of World Geography''
* ''Geography''
* ''General Course in Hygiene''
* ''Contouring and Map-Reading'', Bertie Cotterell Wallis
* ''St Matthew''
* ''King's I''
* ''She Stoops to Conquer'', [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]
* ''Essay on Sir William Temple'', [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay]]
* ''"Q" Poison Island''

'''Sreevalsan J. Menon''' is an [[India]]n [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] vocalist and a [[music composer]] from [[Kerala]].

==Biography==

After initial training under Rajalakshmi Krishnan (disciple of [[Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar]]) and violinist T.V. Ramani at [[Thrissur]], Menon had much of his advanced tutelage under the late [[Neyyattinkara Vasudevan]]. Menon is an 'A' grade artist of [[All India Radio]] and has given concerts all over the country including the National Concerts of AIR and [[Doordarshan]]. He has received several awards including Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi Award 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-sangeetha-nataka-akademi-announces-kalashri-awards/article5335032.ece&lt;/ref&gt;  from the [[Madras Music Academy]], and a title from Krishna Gana Sabha, also in Chennai, besides such institutions of repute in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. He has also participated in Music Transcends, a symphony held at Washington, D.C. in 2004, integrating [[Western world|Western]] and Indian classical music. His [[jugalbandi]]s with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] vocalist [[Ramesh Narayan]] and late [[Kathakali]] musicians [[Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri]] and [[Kalamandalam Hyderali]] have been widely appreciated.

Menon's two songs ("I Be Here" and "I Have Secrets") and background score for Saint Dracula has been qualified for songs and original score categories of 85th Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/carnatic-musician-sreevalsan-work-in-saint-dracula-nominated-for-oscars/1/237832.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The background score by Sreevalsan for the film [[Ottaal]] which won the crystal bear at the Berlin festival 2016 was praised for its laid back music in the award citation. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_generation/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for the spiritual quality of his renditions, Sreevalsan's carnatic music style is marked by a majestic sweep in Krithi rendering, brevity in alapana, meaningful Niraval elaborations; all in sync with a perfect alignment to Sruthi.

Sreevalsan has also carved a niche area for himself through his thematic musical productions on the Rains, Seasons, Rasas and Temples of Kerala.  

==Personal life==

Menon is married to Indu since 8 September 1996 and they have a daughter Subadra and a son Narayanan who are also known for their musical talent.&lt;ref&gt;http://shevlinsebastian.blogspot.in/2014_01_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Sreevalsan J. Menon.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right]]
Menon's music albums are fresh and innovative. They include Vanaprastham, a musical interpretation  of the  famous short story by [[M.T. Vasudevan Nair]]; ''Monsoon Anuraga'' a musical experience on [[monsoon]] rains. ''Vismaya'', a fantasy video album featuring ''Artist Namboodiri'', M T Vasudevan Nair and menon himself. He has given Carnatic vocal performances and lecture demonstrations throughout India, the Middle East, UK, US, Canada and Africa.

Menon works as Professor at the Kerala Agricultural University in Thrissur, and has a Ph D in Agricultural Extension from IARI, New Delhi. (He earned his doctorate with research on the social impact of rubber cultivation.) A native of Kunissery in [[Palakkad]] district, Menon lives in the temple town of [[Tripunithura]] off [[Kochi, India|Kochi]].

'''Teacher in role''' is a method of teaching that utilizes techniques of [[drama]] to facilitate [[education]]. It is a [[holistic]] teaching method designed to integrate [[critical thought]], examination of [[emotion]] and [[moral]] values and factual data to broaden the learning experience and make it more relevant to [[everyday life]] situations. 
[[File:Kindergarten or Special Education teacher - US Census Bureau.jpg|thumb|alt=text|[[Teacher]] in role with student on computer]]

If the role of a [[teacher]] is to teach, the role of a [[student]] must be to learn. However, it has been agreed that learning is not only an exercise in reading and reciting facts, but in gaining a deeper insight of events and situations. This is where drama becomes an invaluable tool. Through the use of drama and [[dramatic convention]]s a teacher does not only teach and learn the "what" but also the "why" and "how".

Drama techniques in education allows students to take a step back out of usual teaching techniques. Students are able to communicate better in conceptual, personal and social levels as they  are able to be a listener and speaker and reviver of knowledge. By using [[role-play]], the teacher gives them a way to view and think about a situation using the "implied" behaviour for the role they are given. In turn, the teacher can allow the students to become in charge of their own learning and facilitate them in it. We empower the individual making their [[expertise]] greater than our own. Through role-playing, they gain knowledge of what the role entails.

"Teacher in role" strategy allows students to build there imaginary further while questioning,challenging and  processing their thoughts. Whilst gaining knowledge it also improves personal social techniques in students like  eye contact and gestures. They adopt to different characters personalities and communicate that to the class, teachers are able to protect any sense of failure by encouraging and supporting any type of work and what they came up with, as every student has a different mind.

One of the best teacher in roles practices in a TV talk show interviewing various people from educational books/stories. Whilst students are teaching they are also learning themselves whilst getting a complete different way of learning. Children like when things are interesting, fun and different, drama techniques in education provides fun although still educational purposes.

==What is a role?==
We each adopt different '[[role]]s' in everyday situations, these roles change with the situation, we all have numerous roles in life. We can imagine those roles as hats that we wear at appropriate times (e.g. son, brother, teacher, employee). These roles have "implied" behaviour, which we all know. It is this implied [[social psychology|social behaviour]] which we can use in drama and dramatic situations to create deeper understanding and meanings.
The role of a teacher in society is both significant and valuable.It has far-reaching influence on the society he lives in and no other personality can have an influence more profound than that of a teacher. Students are deeply affected by the teacher's [[love]] and [[affection]],  character,  [[competence (human resources)|competence]], and  [[moral]] [[Promise|commitment]]. A popular teacher becomes a model for his/her students. The students try to follow their teacher in his/her [[manners]], [[costumes]], [[etiquette]], style of [[conversation]] and his/her get up. He/she is their ideal.

During the early [[education]], the students tend to determine their aims in life and their future plans, in consultation with their teachers. Therefore, a good and visionary teacher can play a prominent role in making the future of his/her students while as a [[corrupt]] teacher can only harm his/her students much more seriously than a class of corrupt and perverted judiciary, army, police, bureaucracy, politicians or technocrats. A corrupt and incompetent teacher is not only a bad individual, but also an embodiment of a corrupt and incompetent generation. A nation with corrupt teachers is a nation at risk.

==Teacher's importance==
The importance of a teacher as an architect of our future generations demands that only the best and the most  and competent members of our intelligentsia be allowed to qualify for this noble profession. It is unfortunate to find that generally the worst and the most incapable people of the society find their way into this profession. Anyone who fails to find an opening in any other walk of life, gets into this profession and recklessly plays with the destiny of the nation. An important reason for this is understood to be the poor salaries of our primary and secondary teachers which are no better than that of clerks. A large number of our teachers is, therefore, frustrated and uninterested. A currently relevant example is prevalent in South Africa where teachers are resigning or taking early retirement options en masse between 2012 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2015-04-08-motshekga-blocks-re-employment-of-thousands-of-teachers|title=Motshekga blocks re-employment of thousands of teachers.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have to go for part-time jobs to meet their basic needs. Again, the teaching profession also does not enjoy due respect in the society. The primary and secondary teachers are particularly at a disadvantage. Their status is lower than that of doctors, engineers, advocates, civil servants; even lower than that of semi literate and illiterate traders. It would therefore require great commitment for an intelligent individual, however fond of education and training he may be, to forsake the career of a doctor or engineer in favour of teaching. Therefore, while selecting good teachers, it must be borne in mind that better opportunities, prospects and perks are offered to the teachers.

==Expectations of teachers==
When we speak of good teachers, it means that a teacher must be a model of faith and piety and should have a fairly good knowledge . A teacher should consider it his duty to educate and train his students and should feel responsible for it. He should feel that his students have been entrusted to him and he should avoid any breach of the trust the society has reposed in him, he should be able to be a sociable person with his roots in the society, people should take him as their well-wisher and a sincere friend who cares for their children. It should be ascertained at all cost that a candidate for this profession has a natural acumen and aptitude for teaching.

Teachers need to actively participate in the social activities in a positive way and know the art of teaching with a deep insight into child psychology. Always dealing with the students in a just manner not losing any self-control is an important part of being a teacher, respecting their students, feelings, ego and trying to understand and resolve their difficulties with grace is important in being a teacher. He should be able to smile in the face of bitter criticism on his opinions, and should not feel ashamed or humiliated to accept his mistakes wholeheartedly. He should be proud of his culture, his national dress and his national language.He should be a missionary, a mentor, a reformer and a guide besides being a dedicated tutor. In other words, he should be a perfect teacher and a perfect education.

==Mantle of the expert==
[[Mantle of the expert|Mantle of the Expert]] is a drama in education device designed by Dorothy Heathcote. In Mantle of the Expert, students are in-role as experts in any given area. They cannot be simply told that they are experts, they have to really take on the role, and feel as if they are experts. This can be done through a number of character development games or exercises. The teacher is generally in-role in Mantle of the Expert, and provides a structure upon which the students can build to gradually progress to more independent learning. Mantle of the Expert is described, explained and exemplified in the book ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education'', by Dorothy Heathcote and Gavin Bolton.

'''The African Children's Educational Trust''' ('''A-CET''') is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that helps to support [[Education in Africa|education of African children]] through provision of [[scholarship]]s and upgrading community [[Elementary school|elementary]] rural schools.  By 2012 A-CET had built or upgraded nine schools in Northern [[Ethiopia]].  The charity was founded in 1997 by David Stables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Feed the World: Birhan Woldu and Live Aid |author=Oliver Harvey |isbn=1-84773-845-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Innovation Summit for Education]]  is an international initiative aimed at transforming education through innovation. WISE was established by [[Qatar Foundation]] in 2009 under the patronage of its chairperson, Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser.

Each year the WISE Awards recognize and promotes six projects that address global educational challenges. A pre-jury composed of education experts assesses submissions and selects a shortlist of fifteen finalists. Following this, a jury chooses the six award-winning projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/455191/Al-Bairaq-is-among-six-WISE-Awards-winners|title=Al-Bairaq is among six WISE Awards winners|date=15 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners receive a cash prize of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.org/en/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Events/2013/WISE-2013#.V6THkpMrKb8|title=WISE 2013: Call for Applications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first WISE Awards were handed out in 2009.

{{Antisemitism}}

Universities in many countries have been the site of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies and practices at different times in their history. Several universities have restricted the admission of Jewish students, as well as the hiring and retention of Jewish faculty. In some instances, universities have supported antisemitic government policies and condoned the development of an antisemitic culture on campus. In most democratic countries, officially sanctioned university antisemitism was phased out in the years after [[World War II]].

In recent years, accusations of antisemitism have sometimes been made in relation to the activities of pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] organizations on university campuses. These accusations are controversial and have almost always been rejected by the organizations in question.

==20th century==

===Canada===

Historian Gerald Tulchinsky has written that [[Canada|Canadian]] universities were "rife with antisemitism" in the early twentieth century. Some universities restricted Jewish admission, Jews were banned from many fraternities and sororities, and many Jewish medical students were unable to find placements in Canada after graduation. (Despite this, Tulchinsky has also written that Canadian universities were "not hotbeds of antisemitism" in general and, indeed, that they played a significant role in the development of a Canadian Jewish culture.)&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews: A People's Journey'', (Toronto: University of Toronto Press), 2008, p. 132-133, 319-321.&lt;/ref&gt;

;McGill University and the University of Toronto

[[McGill University]] imposed strict [[Jewish quota|quotas on Jewish students]] in 1920. Before the quotas were introduced, Jewish students represented 25 per cent of arts students and 40 per cent of law students. These percentages fell significantly in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified Jewish graduates sometimes faced discrimination when applying for positions at both McGill and the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', pp. 319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGill continued to impose a 10 per cent quota on Jewish medical students until the 1960s; it was sometimes noted that the francophone [[Université de Montréal]], unlike McGill, did not restrict Jewish admission after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Toronto's medical school also required higher marks of Jewish students until the 1960s, and Toronto's Jewish [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto|Mount Sinai Hospital]] was denied status as a teaching hospital until 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Queen's University

In 1912, despite strong protests from Canada's Jewish community, the [[Government of Ontario]] approved a new constitution for [[Queen's University (Kingston)|Queen's University]] that included a phrase affirming that "the trustees shall satisfy themselves of the [[Christianity|Christian]] character of those appointed to the teaching staff." In 1919, newly appointed principal [[R. Bruce Taylor]] made antisemitic statements at a meeting of university alumni, saying that "[t]he presence of many Jews tended to lower the tone of Canadian Universities." At least one graduate protested against this statement to the university's chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding these developments, Tulchinsky has written that Queen's was "mildly more liberal" than McGill and the University of Toronto in accepting Jewish students and hiring Jewish faculty. Unlike the other universities, Queen's admitted [[Germany|German]] Jewish refugees as students in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Tulchinsky, ''Canada's Jews'', pp. 320-321.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Moshe Y. Herczl has written that universities were part of a larger phenomenon of antisemitism that took place in [[Hungary]] after [[World War I]]. Christian university students, sometimes joined by their professors, took part in violent demonstrations against Jewish student enrollment during the autumn of 1919. The authorities were forced to temporarily close the universities as a result of the disruption. Shortly thereafter, the Hungarian government prepared a law limiting Jewish enrollment to about six per cent of the total university population.

Several departments at [[Peter Pazmany Catholic University]] in [[Budapest]] supported the proposed quota, as did the administration at the [[Technical University of Budapest]]. Some professors called for Jews to be banned from Hungarian universities entirely. After some debate, the Hungarian parliament passed the quota legislation by a vote of fifty-seven to seven. It came into effect at the beginning of the 1920 academic year, coinciding with another round of antisemitic rioting on campuses. The number of Jews in Hungarian academic institutions fell dramatically in this period; at the [[University of Budapest]], the numbers declined from 4,288 in 1917–18 to only 459 in 1920–21. Several European Jewish organizations opposed the Hungary quota law, arguing that it created a precedent that would be followed by other governments.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Y. Herczl, ''Christianity and the Holocaust of Hungarian Jewry'', (New York and London: New York University Press), 1993, 43-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitic rioting continued at Hungarian universities into the 1930s; Jewish students were ostracized and often physically attacked. Christian student associations introduced a petition in 1933 that called for a strict enforcement of government quotas, while other groups passed antisemitic manifestos. The disruption once again led to a temporary closing of the universities.&lt;ref&gt;Herczl, ''Holocaust of Hungarian Jewry'', pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further antisemitic legislation was passed by the Hungarian parliament in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]]. Among many other things, this legislation further restricted Jewish enrollment in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Herczl, ''Holocaust of Hungarian Jewry'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations related to the Israel-Palestinian conflict==
{{further information|Academic boycotts of Israel}}
Evidence of antisemitic incidents on university campuses across North America, Europe, and Australia since 2000 have been recorded by a number of sources. Though the circumstances surrounding the reported incidents are disputed, some maintain that campus activism supportive of the Palestinians and critical of Israel has created an atmosphere of anti-Jewish intimidation that erupts periodically in hate speech and even violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/93495/university-students-quit-after-toxic%E2%80%99-antisemitism-edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zoloth1/3"&gt;Zoloth, Laurie. "Fear and Loathing at San Francisco State" in Rosenbaum, Ron. ''Those who forget the past''. Random House, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&amp;context=wmborj&lt;/ref&gt; Others acknowledge that antisemitic incidents have occurred, but dispute the extent of them, and contend that commentators have conflated political anger with ethnic or religious hatred in an attempt to chill legitimate debate.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n16/butl02_.html "No, it's not anti-semitic"], ''The London Review of Books'', August 21, 2003.  "Here, it is important to distinguish between antisemitic speech which, say, produces a hostile and threatening environment for Jewish students—racist speech which any university administrator would be obliged to oppose and regulate—and speech which makes a student uncomfortable because it opposes a particular state or set of state policies that he or she may defend. The latter is a political debate, and if we say that the case of Israel is different, that any criticism of it is considered as an attack on Israelis, or Jews in general, then we have singled out this political allegiance from all other allegiances that are open to public debate. We have engaged in the most outrageous form of 'effective' censorship."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MearsheimerHWP&gt;[[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer, John J.]] and [[Stephen Walt|Walt, Stephen]].

===Australia===
In Australia, Daniel Wyner of the [[Australasian Union of Jewish Students]], says that the "vilification we feel as students on campus ... [is] coming almost entirely from the left." Grahame Leonard, president of the [[Executive Council of Australian Jewry]], says July 2006 had the most antisemitic incidents since records began in 1945, and that many of the incidents were on campus. In Sydney, some Jewish students have started to wear hats over their [[kippah]]s. Deon Kamien, former Victorian president of the [[Union of Jewish Students]], told ''The Age'': "It's not something I can put in words. A lot of students who would feel very comfortable wearing a kippah or T-shirt with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words on it now feel they are being targeted as Jews — not supporters of Israel, but Jews. When they walk past socialist stalls (on campus) they are called f---ing Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Zwartz, Barney &amp; Morton, Adam. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/an-unholy-alliance/2006/09/03/1157222010013.html "An unholy alliance"], ''The Age'', September 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In September 2002, then-former Israeli prime minister [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] was prevented from delivering a speech at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]] after a student protest turned violent.  Some protesters harassed the predominantly Jewish audience that had arrived for the speech, and there were reports of [[Holocaust]] survivors being assaulted.&lt;ref name="Graeme Hamilton 2002"&gt;Graeme Hamilton, "Nazi-hunter criticizes actions of Concordia", ''National Post'', 16 October 2002, A2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures such as [[World Jewish Congress]] secretary Avi Beker described the incident as indicative of an "anti-Semitic campaign" on North American campuses,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Dawson, "Canada accused of failing to fight anti-Semitism", ''National Post'', 19 November 2002, A9.&lt;/ref&gt; while journalist Lysiane Gagnon accused the university's pro-Palestinian students union of "refus[ing] to blame those who broke windows, threw chairs around, spat at and shoved the Jewish students who wanted to hear Mr. Netanyahu".&lt;ref&gt;Lysiane Gagnon, "Here's to you, Mr. Robinson", ''Globe and Mail'', 2 December 2002, A19.&lt;/ref&gt; The student union's vice-president of communications rejected Gagnon's charge, saying that his organization had on many occasions "publicly condemned any acts of physical violence [...] especially those acts that were anti-Semitic or anti-Arab in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Engler, Letter, ''Globe and Mail'', 5 December 2002, A26.&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of Concordia's [[Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights]] organization claimed that only a small minority of protesters had engaged in violent acts and argued that the protest itself was justified.&lt;ref name="Graeme Hamilton 2002"/&gt;

The author [[Rick Salutin]] argues that accusations of a "[[new anti-Semitism]]" in contemporary Canada are usually unspecific, and do not include verifiable names or quotations. He has also written that incidents of "name calling and group hate" at protests are not indicative of a new wave of antisemitism, which is universally regarded as unacceptable within mainstream Canadian discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/article974960.ece Rick Salutin, "Israel, apartheid, anti-Semites"], ''Globe and Mail'', 6 March 2009, A19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, [[Patrick Klugman]], President of the Union of French Jewish Students (UEJF), wrote in ''[[Le Figaro]]'': "On some university campuses like Nanterre, Villetaneuse and Jussieu, the climate has become very difficult for Jews. In the name of the Palestinian cause, they are castigated as if they were Israeli soldiers! We hear 'death to the Jews' during demonstrations which are supposed to defend the Palestinian cause. Last April, our office was the target of a [[Molotov cocktail]]. As a condition for condemning this attack, the lecturers demanded that the UEJF declare a principled position against Israel!"&lt;ref name=Gerstenfeld&gt;Gerstenfeld, Manfred. [http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-gersten-f03.htm "The Academic Boycott Against Israel"], ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 15:3-4 (Fall 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" reported that "when left wing or pro-Palestinian discourse is manipulated and used as a vehicle for anti-Jewish language and themes, the anti-Semitism is harder to recognize and define ..."&lt;ref name=APP38&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |title= "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" |access-date= 2007-02-14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033520/http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |archive-date= 2007-06-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(430&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, September 2006, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquiry heard that members of the Islamist party [[Hizb-ut-Tahrir]] had been invited to [[University College, London]] to give presentations. Hizb-ut-Tahrir was also active at [[Queen Mary, University of London]]; [[Kingston University]]; and [[Birmingham City University]].&lt;ref name=APP39&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |title= "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" |access-date= 2007-02-14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033520/http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |archive-date= 2007-06-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(430&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, September 2006, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report describes how "tensions and incidents on campus often peak around students' union votes concerning Israel and Zionism," listing by way of example several incidents precipitated by a 2002 [[University of Manchester]] students' union motion to declare that anti-Zionism was not antisemitism, and that Israeli goods should be boycotted. During the voting phase, according to the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester, a leaflet from the General Union of Palestinian Students quoting a [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] forgery entitled "[[The Franklin Prophecy|Prophecy of Benjamin Franklin in Regard of the Jewish Race]]", was handed out to students lining up to vote.&lt;ref name=APP39/&gt; The leaflet described Jews as [[vampire]]s, and said that if they were not expelled from the United States, they would "enslave the country and destroy its economy."&lt;ref name=APP40&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |title= "Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism" |access-date= 2007-02-14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614033520/http://thepcaa.org/Report.pdf |archive-date= 2007-06-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(430&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, September 2006, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; When the motion was defeated, a brick was thrown through the window of one Jewish student residence while a poster with the words "Slaughter the Jews" was stuck to its front door, and a knife was stuck in the door of another.&lt;ref name=APP40/&gt;

A survey published in February 2015 by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] and the [[Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights under Law]] found that 54% of the participants had been subject to or witnessed antisemitism on their campus. The survey had a 10-12% response rate, does not claim to be representative, and included 1,157 self-identified Jewish students at 55 campuses nationwide. The most significant origin for antisemitism, according to the survey was "from an individual student" (29%). Other origins were: In clubs/societies, in lecture/class, in student union, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Kosmin | first1 = Barry A. | last2 = Keysar | first2 = Ariela | title = National Demographic Survey of American Jewish College Students 2014 ANTI-SEMITISM REPORT | url = http://www.brandeiscenter.com/images/uploads/articleuploads/trinity-Anti-Semitism.pdf | publisher = The Louis D.

'''The Wayne B. Nottingham Prize''' is awarded annually at the Physical Electronics Conference (PEC), a conference that focuses on new research results in the field of [[surface science]] and in the sub-fields of physics and chemistry of interfaces. The Nottingham Prize was established from contributions given in memory of Professor Wayne B. Nottingham of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] by many of his friends and associates. It was first given in March 1966 at MIT and in March thereafter until February 1974 when the PEC was held at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ.{{efn|according to information from a private communication from Torgny Gustafsson, 1974 co-winner{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}} This was to avoid overlap in time with the American Physical Society "March" meeting which in the 1970s was about 30 times larger than the PEC. Due to the February weather leading to icy roads and delays in the scheduled events, in 1975 the PEC was moved to June where it still is today. The prize currently consists of a certificate and in 1974 was $200 but has increased recently to $1,500, and is awarded to the best student paper presented at the conference. A student paper is defined as a paper based on a Ph.D. thesis whose date of submission to the faculty is no earlier than one year before the meeting at which the Prize is given.
