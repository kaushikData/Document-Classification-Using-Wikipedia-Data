The stroke had resulted in him acquiring cerebral palsy and having limited limb functionality on his left side, making it substantially weaker than his right side.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; To address these physical issues, Ballou had regular physical therapy as a result until he was around a 13-year-old.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ballou attended [[Norfolk Christian High School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], graduating from there in 2011.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maxpreps.com/athlete/adam-ballou/O-Hhw_TtEeKZ5AAmVebBJg/default.htm|title=Adam Ballou|last=|first=|date=2011|website=MaxPreps|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on from there to study International Affairs and Spanish at [[James Madison University]].

In April 2016, he gave a workshop on Paralympic sport at his alma mater's [[Godwin Hall]] in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ballou speaks Spanish and English.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; He is 5 foot 8 and weighs 155 pounds.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Sports ==
Ballou started playing soccer when he was a 3-year-old, playing for a team that included his sister and which his father was the coach of.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He was able to compete in sports after he had a tendon transfer on his left foot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Many people in his life encouraged him to participate in sports.  Because of his disability, he trained harder on that side of the body and sometimes feels he performs better on that side as a result.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He played varsity soccer for Norfolk Christian High School.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In 2012, his soccer coaches were  Jay Hoffman and Mike Haas.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Cerebral palsy football ==
Ballou is a CP7 footballer and a regular fixture on the [[United States national cerebral palsy football team|US National Paralympic Team]],&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=rostersalou/&gt;  where he plays in the midfield.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theoriginalwinger.com/2012/08/video-u-s-paralympic-soccer-team-ready-for-london-games/|title=Video :: U.S. Paralympic Soccer Team Ready For London Games|last=Dunny|first=|date=August 28, 2012|work=The Original Winger|access-date=June 18, 2016|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923153442/http://theoriginalwinger.com/2012/08/video-u-s-paralympic-soccer-team-ready-for-london-games/|archive-date=2016-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballou started playing CP football in 2007 after getting invited to train with the national team in March.  At the time, he was a 14-years-old. He came to the attention of national selectors after the head coach of the Virginia Beach Mariners asked his coach if he knew of any players with cerebral palsy and his coach replied with Ballou's name and contact details. Because of the rules for CP football, he was not able to earn his first national team  cap until he was a 16-years-old.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The United States tried but failed to qualify for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].  If they had been successful, Ballou would likely have made the roster.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  He continued his national team career, and was part of the US team that finished 11th at the 2009 World Championships.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  He continued to get national team calls ups, and was with the US team that finished second at the 2010 Americas Championship.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  The following year, he participated in the 2011 CPISRA World Championships with the national team.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/la-mesa-athlete-goes-dutch-play-japan-june-19th|title=LA Mesa Athlete Goes Dutch to Play Japan on June 19th|last=Logan|first=Ron|date=June 2011|work=East County Magazine|access-date=May 17, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2015/June/16/US-Paralympic-National-Team-heads-to-cerebral-palsy-soccer-world-champs|title=U.S. Paralympic National Team heads to cerebral palsy football world championships|last=U.S. Soccer|first=|date=June 16, 2015|work=U.S. Soccer|access-date=May 21, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An eighth-place finish at this tournament qualified the United States for the London Games.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/13/09/us-paralympic-national-team-head-coach-jay-hoffman-selects-roster-for-paralympic-games|title=U.S. PARALYMPIC NATIONAL TEAM HEAD COACH JAY HOFFMAN SELECTS 12-PLAYER ROSTER FOR 2012 PARALYMPIC GAMES|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2016|work=US Soccer|access-date=May 21, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballou spent a lot of time preparing for the [[Football 7-a-side at the 2012 Summer Paralympics|2012 Summer Paralympics]]. When not with the national team, he trained at the [[Virginia Beach Sportsplex]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Having taken a semester off to prepare for the Games, he spent a lot of time in 2012 training with the national team in [[Chula Vista, California]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and was formally chosen by national team head coach Jay Hoffman to be on the London bound national team.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lacancha.net/2012/08/31/u-s-paralympic-national-team-paralympic-games-riverbank-arena-london-england-sept-1-9-2012/|title=U.S. Paralympic National Team&amp;nbsp;– Paralympic Games Riverbank Arena; London, England Sept. 1-9, 2012|last=Robbins|first=Gerard|date=August 31, 2012|work=La Cancha|access-date=May 17, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestarnews.com/sports/let-the-games-begin-london-calls-to-chula-vista-olympic-training-center-athletes/|title=Let the Games begin!

'''August Kanitz''' (25 April 1843, [[Lugoj|Lugos]] &amp;mdash; 12 July 1896, [[Cluj-Napoca|Kolozsvár]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[botany|botanist]]. 

While a student at the [[University of Vienna]] he wrote ''Geschichte der Botanik in Ungarn'' (Hanover and Budapest, 1863), and soon after, ''Versuch einer Geschichte der Ungarischen Botanik'' (Halle, 1865). In 1866 he published a work on the flora of [[Slavonia]], in 1877 he published a work  on the flora  of [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia]], and [[Serbia]] and in 1879 one on that of [[Romania]]. For the last-named work he was elected (1880) a member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], and was made Knight of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown of Romania]]. He converted to [[Christianity]].

In 1872 Kanitz was appointed professor of botany at the [[Franz Joseph University]]. In 1877 he founded the ''Magyar Növénytani Lapok'' (''[[Hungarian Journal of Botany]]''), which he edited until 1892.

'''François Marie Charles Fourier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊr|i|eɪ|,_|-|i|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Fourier}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl fuʁje|lang}}; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French [[philosopher]], influential early [[socialist]] thinker and one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]]. Some of Fourier's social and moral views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream thinking in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word "[[feminism]]" in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's social views and proposals inspired a whole movement of [[intentional communities]]. Among them in the United States were the community of [[Utopia, Ohio|Utopia]], [[Ohio]]; [[La Reunion (Dallas)|La Reunion]] near present-day [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]; the [[North American Phalanx]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], [[New Jersey]]; [[Brook Farm]] in [[West Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]]; the [[Community Place]] and [[Alasa Farms|Sodus Bay Phalanx]] in New York State; [[Silkville, Kansas]] in [[Kansas]]; and several others. Fourier later inspired a diverse array of revolutionary thinkers and writers.

==Life==
Fourier was born in [[Besançon]], France on 7 April 1772.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Reference-idSerenyi1967|Serenyi 1967]], p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a small businessman, Fourier was more interested in architecture than in his father's trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; He wanted to become an engineer, but the local military engineering school accepted only sons of noblemen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Fourier later said he was grateful that he did not pursue engineering, because it would have consumed too much of his time and taken away from his true desire to help humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father died in 1781, Fourier received two-fifths of his father's estate, valued at more than 200,000 [[francs]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This inheritance enabled Fourier to travel throughout Europe at his leisure. In 1791 he moved from [[Besançon]] to [[Lyon]], where he was employed by the merchant M. Bousquet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier's travels also brought him to Paris, where he worked as the head of the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|Office of Statistics]] for a few months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; From 1791 to 1816 Fourier was employed in Paris, [[Rouen]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], and [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt; As a traveling salesman and correspondence clerk, his research and thought was time-limited: he complained of "serving the knavery of merchants" and the stupefaction of "deceitful and degrading duties." He took up writing, and his first book was published in 1808 but it only sold few copies. Surprisingly, after six years the book fell into the hands of Monsieur Just Muiron who eventually became Fourier's patron. Fourier produced most of his writings between 1816 and 1821. In 1822, he tried to sell his books again but with no success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=NcO7t8G-yQ8C&amp;pg=PA535&amp;lpg=PA535&amp;dq=Fran%C3%A7ois+Marie+Charles+Fourier's+first+book+was+published+in+1808&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cyeU5UqsNO&amp;sig=l2HxUzbNBtMhQykL8q8bycArXqE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ-9uU5b3XAhWQF-wKHeHKAnAQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marie%20Charles%20Fourier's%20first%20book%20was%20published%20in%201808&amp;f=false|title=Faces in the Street|last=Wilson|first=Pip|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781430300212|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier died in Paris in 1837.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Reference-idPellarin1846|Pellarin 1846]], p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier declared that concern and [[cooperation]] were the secrets of social success. He believed that a society that cooperated would see an immense improvement in their productivity levels. Workers would be recompensed for their labors according to their contribution. Fourier saw such cooperation occurring in communities he called "phalanxes," based upon structures called [[Phalanstère]]s or "grand hotels". These buildings were four-level apartment complexes where the richest had the uppermost apartments and the poorest had a ground-floor residence. Wealth was determined by one's job; jobs were assigned based on the interests and desires of the individual. There were incentives: jobs people might not enjoy doing would receive higher pay. Fourier considered [[trade]], which he associated with Jews, to be the "source of all evil" and advocated that Jews be forced to perform farm work in the phalansteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Richard H.| last= Roberts| title= Religion and the Transformations of Capitalism: Comparative Approaches| publisher= Routledge| year= 1995| page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his life, Fourier advocated the return of Jews to Palestine with the assistance of the [[Rothschilds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard L., and John K. Roth. Approaches to Auschwitz: The Legacy of the Holocaust. London: SCM, 1987,
 p.71&lt;/ref&gt; [[John K. Roth]] and [[Richard L. Rubenstein]] have seen Fourier as motivated by economic and religious antisemitism, rather than the [[racial antisemitism]] that would emerge later in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Rubenstein, Richard L., and John K. Roth. Approaches to Auschwitz: The Legacy of the Holocaust. London: SCM, 1987, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attack on civilization===
Fourier characterized poverty (not inequality) as the principal cause of disorder in society, and he proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and by a "decent minimum" for those who were not able to work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idCunliffe2001|Cunliffe 2001]], p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier used the word civilization in a negative sense and as such "Fourier's contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order, a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fourier's attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Johnathan| last= Beecher| title= Charles Fourier: The Visionary and His World| publisher= University of California Press| year= 1986| pages= 195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work and liberated passions===
For [[Herbert Marcuse]] "The idea of libidinal work relations in a developed industrial society finds little support in the tradition of thought, and where such
support is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fourier's giant
socialist utopia."&lt;ref name= Eros&gt;{{cite book| first= Herbert| last= Marcuse| title= [[Eros and Civilization]] | publisher= Beacon Press| place= Boston| year= 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|217}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=Fourier insists that this transformation requires a complete change in the social institutions: distribution of the social product according to need, assignment of functions according to individual faculties and inclinations, constant mutation of functions, short work periods, and so on. But the possibility of "attractive labor" (''travail attrayant'') derives above all from the release of libidinal forces . Fourier assumes the existence of an ''attraction industrielle'' which makes for pleasurable co-operation. It is based on the attraction passionnée in the nature of man, which persists despite the opposition of reason, duty, prejudice. This ''attraction passionnée'' tends toward three principal objectives: the creation of "luxury, or the pleasure of the five senses"; the formation of libidinal groups (of friendship and love); and the establishment of a harmonious order, organizing these groups for work in accordance with the development of the individual "passions" (internal and external "play" of faculties).&lt;ref name= Eros /&gt;{{rp|217}}}}
He believed that there were twelve common passions which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have exactly 1620 people. One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world "[[omniarch]]", or (later) a [[World Congress of Phalanxes]]. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of ''fairies'' who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the card-index of ''personality types'' for suitable partners for [[casual sex]]. He also defended [[homosexuality]] as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist [[Hakim Bey]] describes Fourier's ideas as follows: "In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion—this is the famous theory of "attractive labor." Fourier sexualizes work itself—the life of the [[Phalanstery]] is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts."&lt;ref name= Lemonade&gt;{{cite web| authorlink= Hakim Bey| first= Hakim| last= Bey| url= http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Hakim_Bey__The_Lemonade_Ocean___Modern_Times.html |title= The Lemonade Ocean &amp; Modern Times|year= 1991| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
Fourier was also a supporter of [[women's rights]] in a time period when influences like [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] were prevalent. Fourier believed that all important jobs should be open to women on the basis of skill and aptitude rather than closed on account of gender. He spoke of women as individuals, not as half the human couple. Fourier saw that "traditional" marriage could potentially hurt woman's rights as human beings and thus never married.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDenslow1880|Denslow 1880]], p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing before the advent of the term 'homosexuality', Fourier held that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and ''androgénité''. He argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused, and that "affirming one's difference" can actually enhance social integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Charles| last= Fourier| title= Le Nouveau Monde amoureux| year= 1967| postscript=. written 1816–18, not published widely until 1967. | place= Paris| publisher= Éditions Anthropos| pages= 389, 391, 429, 458, 459, 462, and 463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's concern was to liberate every human individual, man, woman, and child, in two senses: education and the liberation of human passion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idGoldstein1982|Goldstein 1982]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children and education===
On [[education]], Fourier felt that "civilized" parents and teachers saw children as little idlers.&lt;ref name="historyguide.org"&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/fourier.html Charles Fourier, 1772-1837 -- Selections from his Writings] Retrieved November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier felt that this way of thinking was wrong. He felt that children as early as age two and three were very industrious. He listed the dominant tastes in all children to include, but not limited to:

#Rummaging or inclination to handle everything, examine everything, look through everything, to constantly change occupations;
#Industrial commotion, taste for noisy occupations;
#Aping or imitative mania.
#Industrial miniature, a taste for miniature workshops.
#Progressive attraction of the weak toward the strong.&lt;ref name="historyguide.org" /&gt;

Fourier was deeply disturbed by the disorder of his time and wanted to stabilize the course of events which surrounded him. Fourier saw his fellow human beings living in a world full of strife, chaos, and disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idSerenyi1967|Serenyi 1967]], p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier is best remembered for his writings on a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]] based on unity of action and harmonious collaboration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; He is also known for certain Utopian pronouncements, such as that the seas would lose their [[salinity]] and turn to [[lemonade]], and a coincidental view of [[climate change]], that the [[North Pole]] would be milder than the Mediterranean in a future phase of Perfect Harmony. {{Failed verification|date=May 2016}} &lt;ref name="historyguide.org" /&gt;

==Influence==
{{Libertarian socialism|People }}
The influence of Fourier's ideas in French politics was carried forward into the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|1848 Revolution]] and the [[Paris Commune]] by followers such as [[Victor Considerant]].

*Numerous references to Fourierism appear in [[Dostoevsky]]'s [[political fiction|political novel]] ''[[The Possessed (novel)|Demons]]'' first published in 1872&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Postoutenko|first1=Kirill|title=The Influence of Anxiety: Figures of Absolute Evil in French Socialists and Dostoevsky| website= academia.edu| url= https://www.academia.edu/9262238/The_influence_of_Anxiety_Figures_of_Absolute_Evil_in_French_Socialists_and_Dostoevsky| year= 2009| accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fourier's ideas also took root in America, with his followers starting phalanxes throughout the country, including one of the most famous, [[Utopia, Ohio]].
*[[Kent Bromley]], in his preface to [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', considered Fourier to be the founder of the [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] branch of [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as opposed to the authoritarian socialist ideas of [[François-Noël Babeuf|Babeuf]] and [[Philippe Buonarroti|Buonarroti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Peter| last= Kropotkin| title= The Conquest of Bread| place= New York and London| publisher= Putnam| year= 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the mid-20th century, Fourier's influence began to rise again among writers reappraising socialist ideas outside the [[Marxism|Marxist]] mainstream. After the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] had broken with the [[French Communist Party]], [[André Breton]] returned to Fourier, writing ''Ode à Charles Fourier'' in 1947.
*[[Walter Benjamin]] considered Fourier crucial enough to devote an entire "[[konvolut]]" of his massive, projected book on the Paris arcades, the ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'', to Fourier's thought and influence. He writes: "To have instituted play as the canon of a labor no longer rooted in exploitation is one of the great merits of Fourier", and notes that "Only in the summery middle of the nineteenth century, only under its sun, can one conceive of Fourier's fantasy materialized."
*[[Herbert Marcuse]] in his influential work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' praised Fourier saying that "Fourier comes closer than any other utopian socialist to elucidating the dependence of freedom on non-repressive [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]."&lt;ref name= Eros /&gt;{{rp|218}}
*In 1969, [[Raoul Vaneigem]] quoted and adapted Fourier's ''Avis aux civilisés relativement à la prochaine métamorphose sociale'' in his text ''Avis aux civilisés relativement à l'autogestion généralisée''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Charles| last= Fourier| url= http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/12.selfman.htm |title= Notice to the Civilized Concerning Generalized Self-Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Phalanxary colt nj.jpg|thumb|200px|[[North American Phalanx]] building in New Jersey]]
*Fourier's work has significantly influenced the writings of [[Gustav Wyneken]], [[Guy Davenport]] (in his work of fiction ''[[Apples and Pears (book)|Apples and Pears]]''), [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]].
*In [[Whit Stillman]]'s film ''[[Metropolitan (1990 film)|Metropolitan]]'', the idealistic Tom Townsend describes himself as a Fourierist, and debates the success of social experiment [[Brook Farm]] with another of the characters. Bidding him goodnight, Sally Fowler says, "Good luck with your furrierism." {{sic}}
*[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in the appendix to his book ''Spaces of Hope'', offers a personal utopian vision of the future in cities citing Fourier's ideas.
*[[Libertarian socialist]] and environmentalist thinker [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote that "The Greek ideal of the rounded citizen in a rounded environment — one that reappeared in Charles Fourier’s utopian works — was long cherished by the anarchists and socialists of the last century...The opportunity of the individual to devote his or her productive activity to many different tasks over an attenuated work week (or in Fourier’s ideal society, over a given day) was seen as a vital factor in overcoming the division between manual and intellectual activity, in transcending status differences that this major division of work created, and in enhancing the wealth of experiences that came with a free movement from industry through crafts to food cultivation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-the-meaning-of-confederalism| authorlink= Murray Bookchin| first= Murray | last= Bookchin| title= The Meaning of Confederalism| year= 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in Chapter 7 of his novel ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' gently mocks Fourier saying, {{quote|"When, as a consequence of human improvement", said I, "the globe shall arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in Fourier's time. He calls it limonade a cedre. It is positively a fact! Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide of this delectable beverage!" &lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idHawthorne1852|Hawthorne]], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*Writers of the [[post-left anarchy]] tendency have praised the writings of Fourier. [[Bob Black]] in his work ''[[The Abolition of Work]]'' advocates Fourier's idea of attractive work as a solution to his criticisms of work conditions in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| quote= The secret of turning work into play, as Charles Fourier demonstrated, is to arrange useful activities to take advantage of whatever it is that various people at various times in fact enjoy doing. To make it possible for some people to do the things they could enjoy it will be enough just to eradicate the irrationalities and distortions which afflict these activities when they are reduced to work.| authorlink= Bob Black| first= Bob |last= Black| url= http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__The_Abolition_of_Work.html |title= The Abolition of Work| year= 1985| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hakim Bey]] manifested that Fourier "lived at the same time as De [[Marquis de Sade|Sade]] &amp; [[William Blake|(William) Blake]], &amp; deserves to be remembered as their equal or even superior. Those other two apostles of freedom &amp; desire had no political disciples, but in the middle of the 19th century literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on fourierist principles".&lt;ref name= Lemonade /&gt;

'''David Brearley''' (often misspelled for ''Brearly'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/hist-404pinsker/2010/09/15/david-brearley-quiet-and-supportive-delegate-from-new-jersey/|title=David Brearley: Quiet and Supportive Delegate from New Jersey {{!}} History 404:  US Constitution Seminar|website=blogs.dickinson.edu|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (June 11, 1745 – August 16, 1790) was a delegate to the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] and signed the [[U.S. Constitution]] on behalf of [[New Jersey]].

==American Revolution==
[[File:Coat of Arms of David Brearley.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of David Brearley]]
With the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], Brearley was at first a captain in the [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] [[militia (United States)|militia]] after having spent many years speaking out against the Parliamentary absolutism.&lt;ref name = soldierState&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/brearly.htm| title =  Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution | id =CMH Pub 71-25| chapter = David Brearly| location = Washington D.C.| publisher = United States Army Center of Military History| first1 =Robert K.| last1 = Wright, Jr.|first2= Morris J.| last2 = MacGregor Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually rose to the rank of colonel in Nathaniel Heard's New Jersey militia brigade. From 1776 to 1779 he served in the [[New Jersey Line]] of the [[Continental Army]], seeing action at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]], and [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]].

==Government service==
Brearley resigned from the army in 1779 to serve as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] Chief Justice, succeeding [[Robert Morris (judge)|Robert Morris]].  He decided on the famous ''Holmes v. Walton'' case where he ruled that the judiciary had the authority to declare whether laws were unconstitutional or not.&lt;ref name=soldierState/&gt; He held the seat until 1789.

While at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he chaired the Committee on Postponed Parts, which played a substantial role in shaping the final document.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, David. "The Summer of 1787". p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The committee addressed questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the house. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, David. "The Summer of 1787". p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; They adopted the earlier plan for choosing the president by electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be "nineteen times out of twenty". The committee also shorted the president's term from seven years to four years, freed him to seek reelection, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created the vice president, whose only role was to succeed the president and preside over the senate. This also transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, who was given the power (which had been given to the senate by Rutledge's committee) to make treaties and appoint ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, David. "The Summer of 1787". p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; After signing the Constitution in 1787, he headed up the New Jersey committee that approved the Constitution.  In 1789, he was a [[Presidential elector]] and on September 25, 1789, he was nominated by President [[George Washington]] to be the first federal district judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey]], a newly created seat. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 25, 1789, and received his commission the following day. He died in that office a few months later.&lt;ref name=soldierState/&gt;

==Legacy==
Brearley was the first Grand Master of the New Jersey Masonic Lodge.

He is buried in the churchyard of [[St. Michael's Church, Trenton, NJ|Saint Michael's Episcopal Church]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and a [[cenotaph]] was placed there in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|4725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Brearley High School in [[Kenilworth, New Jersey]], was named in his honor.

Brearley Street in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Brearley Crescent in [[Waldwick, NJ]] is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Waldwick, New Jersey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Brian Dougherty''' (1967 – 20 April 2017) was a New Zealander who was convicted in 1993 on charges of [[Child abduction|abduction]] and the [[rape]] of an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_national_story_skin/47392|title=Apology and money for Dougherty}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, when new [[DNA evidence]] ruled him out of the charge, Dougherty was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] after serving over three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/1387410/Falsely-imprisoned-David-Doughertys-story|title=Falsely imprisoned: David Dougherty's story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0908/S00125.htm|title=Forensic Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a public apology in 2001 along with $868,728 in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Dougherty - Locked up in a nightmare|url=http://www.peterellis.org.nz/FalseAllegations/2001-0713_Herald_DavidDoughertyLockedUpInANightmare.htm|author=Catherine Masters|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3504996|title=10 years of guilt over for rape victim | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=31 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the real offender, Nicholas Reekie, was found guilty and convicted of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3524028|title=Apology but no compensation for rape victim | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=18 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dougherty's case was the subject of the 2008 [[New Zealand]] telemovie ''Until Proven Innocent'' which documents the [[miscarriage of justice]] that had Dougherty imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kiwicrime.blogspot.com/2009/08/dvd-review-until-proven-innocent-david.html|title=DVD Review: Until Proven Innocent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Dougherty pleaded guilty to a [[burglary]] charge. He admitted going to a [[Palmerston North]] property in October that year to collect money he was owed. He smashed open a ranch slider door and stole beer and [[DVD-Video|DVDs]] before being caught by the home owner. He claimed he did not realise the previous owner had moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/david-dougherty-pleads-guilty-burglary-3909138|title=David Dougherty pleads guilty to burglary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dougherty was meant to face court on [[theft]] and burglary charges in May 2011, but instead was arrested shortly before his case was called and sentencing did not go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest Interrupts Sentencing|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10728300 | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered by the court to undergo a drug and alcohol assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man falsely accused of rape remanded on burglary charges|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/rape-falsely-accused-remanded-burglary-charges-4190065}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2011 Dougherty was sentenced to 300 hours of [[Community_work#Alternative_sentencing|community work]] and nine months of supervision.&lt;ref name=rollercoaster&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/5255113/Rollercoaster-Dougherty-gets-to-go-home |title='Rollercoaster' Dougherty gets to go home |author=Ellingham, Jimmy |date=8 July 2011 |work=[[Manawatu Standard]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamza Ali Al-Khateeb''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|حمزة علي الخطيب}}}}) (October 24, 1997 – May 25, 2011) was a 13-year-old Syrian boy who died while in the custody of the Syrian government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/torture-of-boy-invigorates-syrias-protest-movement/2011/05/29/AGPwIREH_story.html |title=Apparent torture of boy propelled Syria’s protest movement |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2011-05-29|accessdate=2011-06-02 |first=Ernesto |last=Londo}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Daraa]]. On April 29, 2011, he was detained during a protest.  On May 25, 2011, his body was delivered to his family, having been badly bruised, along with burn marks, three gunshot wounds, and 
severed genitals.  Hamza's family distributed photos and video of his body to journalists and activists.  Shocked by what was depicted, thousands of people showed their support for Hamza online and in street protests.

== Background ==

Hamza lived with his parents in the village of [[al-Jiza|al-Jeezah]] in [[Daraa Governorate]].&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sonia Verma |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/how-a-13-year-old-became-a-symbol-of-syrian-revolution/article4260803/ |title=How a 13-year-old became a symbol of Syrian revolution |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He enjoyed watching his homing pigeons fly above his house since drought had left him unable to enjoy swimming.  He had a reputation for being generous.  "He would often ask his parents for money to give to the poor. I remember once he wanted to give someone 100 Syrian Pounds ($2), and his family said it was too much. But Hamza said, 'I have a bed and food while that guy has nothing.' And so he persuaded his parents to give the poor man the 100," his cousin told [[Al Jazeera]].&lt;ref name="Hugh Macleod and Annasofie Flamand"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hugh Macleod and Annasofie Flamand |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/05/201153185927813389.html |title=Tortured and killed: Hamza al-Khateeb, age 13 - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Torture==
Al-Jazeera reported that he was not interested in politics, according to an unnamed cousin, but on April 29, 2011, he joined his family in a rally to break the siege of the city of [[Daraa]]. "Everybody seemed to be going to the protest, so he went along as well," said his cousin. Hamza walked with friends and family 12&amp;nbsp;km along the road from al-Jeezah north-west to Saida. Firing began almost as the protesters reached Saida. Hamza's cousin reported: "People were killed and wounded, some were arrested. It was chaotic we didn't know at that point what had happened to Hamza. He just disappeared."  One source says that Hamza had been among 51 protesters detained by [[Air Force Intelligence Directorate|Air Force Intelligence]], which detainees allegedly described as having a reputation for brutal torture.&lt;ref name="Hugh Macleod and Annasofie Flamand"/&gt;

==Mutilation==
[[File:Hamza Postmortem.jpg|thumb|left|A still image from the video Hamza's relatives made chronicling his various wounds, following the return of his body to them by the Syrian government, one month after Hamza was detained]]
A video of his body filmed several days after his death showed numerous injuries, including broken bones, gunshot wounds, burn marks, and mutilated genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sundby |first=Alex |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20067582-503543.html |title=Syrian boy's brutal death rouses protesters |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' summarized: "His jaw and both kneecaps had been smashed. His flesh was covered with cigarette burns. His penis had been cut off. Other injuries appeared to be consistent with the use of electroshock devices and being whipped with a cable."&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

Following the broadcast, by Al Jazeera, of a video showing Hamza's body there was widespread outrage, both online and amongst the protesters in Syria.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

In response to Al Jazeera's story, the chief of Syria's medical examiners association, Dr. Akram El-Shaar, denied that Hamza was tortured.  El-Shaar said that he supervised the autopsy in Damascus and that the boy did not have any sign of torture.  He also claimed that Hamza had been shot in the Daraa riot and that all signs of disfigurement were due to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/814DF5FF-A6CC-4C04-A549-5BE82204F108.htm |title=حريات وحقوق - أخبار - تعذيب حتى الموت في سوريا |publisher=Aljazeera.net |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-614030?ref=feeds%2Flatest |title=The story of Hamza a 13-year-old boy - CNN iReport |publisher=Ireport.cnn.com |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/torture-of-boy-reinvigorates-syrias-protest-movement/2011/05/29/AGPwIREH_story.html |title=Torture of boy reinvigorates Syria’s protest movement |publisher=The Washington Post |date= 2011-05-29|accessdate=2011-06-02 |first=Ernesto |last=Londo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Syrian Arab News Agency: SANA, Damascus Syria - syria news |url=http://sana.sy/eng/337/2011/06/01/350065.htm |title=The True Story of Hamza al-Khateeb's Death Belies Media Fabrications |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604140542/http://www.sana.sy/eng/337/2011/06/01/350065.htm |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backlash and impact ==
[[File:Hamza Ali Al-Khateeb.gif|thumb|upright|Hamza Ali Al-Khateeb hunting [[Bashar Al-Assad]] by [[Carlos Latuff]].]]
Hamza's name became a rallying cry for protesters. A [[Facebook]] page honouring him had more than 105,000 followers by May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hamza.alshaheed|script-title=ar:كلنا الشهيد الطفل حمزة علي الخطيب|date=May 2011|work=Facebook|language=Arabic|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pattern of demonstrators calling Fridays a "day of rage", Saturdays in Syria were called the "day of Hamza".&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;

On May 31, 2011, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] marked his death as a turning point in the Syrian uprising, indicating that it "symbolises for many Syrians ... the total collapse of any effort by the Syrian government to work with and listen to their own people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Reuters via Dawn.com |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/06/01/clinton-citing-syrian-boy-sees-total-collapse.html |title=API report, "Clinton says death, alleged tortured of boy shows 'total collapse' of Syria’s reform effort" |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 14, 2012 ''[[The Guardian]]'' released 3,000 [[Syria Files#Bashar and Asma al-Assad|emails leaked]] from [[Asma al-Assad]], Bashar al-Assad's wife, and her father, Fawas Akhras. Akhras had emailed Bashar al-Assad, instructing him to respond to allegations that children are tortured in Syria by dismissing it as "British propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/15/assad-emails-father-in-law-crackdown | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Robert | last=Booth | title=Assad emails: father-in-law gave advice from UK during crackdown | date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6989">'''Douglas Hubbard''' is a management consultant, speaker, and author in [[decision sciences]] and [[actuarial science]]. He is the inventor of the [[Applied information economics|Applied Information Economics]] (AIE) method and founder of Hubbard Decision Research (HDR). He is the author of ''How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, ''The Failure of Risk Management: Why It’s Broken and How to Fix It''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, ''Pulse: The New Science of Harnessing Internet Buzz to Track Threats and Opportunities''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-01-02|editor-last=Hubbard|editor-first=Douglas W.|title=Pulse|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119200956|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119200956}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his latest book, ''How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=Douglas W.|last2=Seiersen|first2=Richard|date=2016-08-01|title=How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119162315|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781119162315}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]], 2016). Since 2017, two of his books have been on the required reading list for the [[Society of Actuaries]] exam prep.  In addition to his books, Mr. Hubbard has been published in several periodicals including ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the ''[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]]'', ''[[OR/MS Today]]'', ''Analytics'', ''CIO'', ''[[InformationWeek|Information Week]]'', and ''[[ArchitectureBoston|Architecture Boston]]''. His books have been selected for required, recommended, and suggested reading by multiple business schools such as the [[College of Charleston School of Business and Economics|School of Business and Economics]] (College of Charleston), [[Jon M. Huntsman School of Business]] (Utah State University), and [[Carl H. Lindner College of Business]] (University of Cincinnati).  

He is known for taking a critical view of several popular methods and standards in risk management and decision making in organizations.  He argues that extensive research in methods such as "risk matrices", the use of weighted scores in decision making, and even expert intuition are inferior to certain quantitative methods.  

Mr. Hubbard began his management consulting career at [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] (subsequently merged with Price Waterhouse to form Price Waterhouse Coopers) in 1988 after finishing his MBA at the University of South Dakota.  He formed [Http://www.hubbardresearch.com Hubbard Decision Research] in 1998 to focus on the practical application of several fields of quantitative analysis.  His methods have been adopted in insurance, financial services, pharmaceutical, healthcare, utilities, energy, federal and state government, entertainment media, military logistics, aerospace R&amp;D, cybersecurity, and manufacturing. His work is frequently cited in both management and academic publications.

'''Edmund Scientific Corporation''' was a company based in [[Barrington, New Jersey]] that specialized in supplying surplus optics and other items via its mail order catalog and Factory Store.

==Early history==
In 1942, amateur photographer Norman W. Edmund (1916 - 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Edmund Optics Mourns the Loss of Founder, Norman W. Edmund |url=http://www.edmundoptics.com/company/press-releases/press-article.cfm?newsid=359 |publisher=Edmund Optics |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found it hard to find lenses he needed for his hobby. This led him to advertise lenses for sale in photography magazines. It was so successful he founded "'Edmund Salvage Corporation'". It soon changed its name to Edmund Scientific and made its name with ads in publications like ''[[Scientific American]]'' as a supplier of chipped lenses, war-surplus optics, and low cost scientific gadgetry. Its advertisements caught the attention of hobbyists, amateur astronomers, high school students, and cash-strapped researchers.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===War surplus===
[[File:Edmund001b.jpg|thumbnail|An Edmund lens envelope.]]
[[File:Edmund002c.jpg|thumbnail|An Edmund chipped lens.]]
Edmund Scientific was part of the post-[[World War II]] "war surplus" phenomenon, when the U.S. government sold off large quantities of materials. "Army and Navy Stores" were a national phenomenon and originally sold military-surplus clothing. Surplus electronics found an outlet in dozens of shops, in [[New York City]]'s "[[Radio Row, Manhattan|Radio Row]]" and elsewhere. A few issued catalogs and developed national mail-order businesses. Edmund was, however, the only widely known supplier of surplus optics.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

The core of Edmund's offerings was surplus lenses. These were single-element lenses, shipped in {{convert|2.5|x|4.25|in|adj=on}} coin envelopes, with the ''approximate'' diameter and focal length stenciled on them. Reflecting their salvage and surplus origins, available diameters and focal lengths did not fall into regular progressions. Edmund published crudely printed, stapled "books" describing experiments that could be performed with their lenses, and plans for building telescopes and other optical equipment. Edmund also sold lens "kits". The 10-lens kit cost less than US$10 and included a booklet of plans for instruments which could supposedly be built with them.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Unlike [[Heathkit]]s, which were absolutely complete kits requiring only soldering and assembly, Edmund's "kits" consisted of only the lenses. A great deal of skill and effort would have been needed to fashion the telescopes, microscopes, or opaque projectors described. With single-element lenses, the quality of the resulting optics was not high. Edmund even sold high-quality, thick, black cardboard tubes needed for many of the projects.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Heyday==
[[File:Edmund Scientific Surplus.jpg|thumbnail|Edmund Scientific's factory store in Barrington, New Jersey in the mid-1970s which carried many items not listed in the catalogs.]]
Following [[Sputnik]], Edmund was able to capitalize on a growing national interest in science and astronomy. They expanded their business into a full line of telescopes and telescope kits as well as equipment, parts, and supplies for other scientific fields such as physics, optics, chemistry, microscopy, electronics, and meteorology. They continued to grow as a supplier to teachers and schools with demonstration devices and kits which covered most fields of science.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Edmund's catalog became a source for optical and mechanical parts essential to [[amateur telescope making]], including hard-to-find items such as optical glass blanks, pitch-lap ingredients, and a series of grit abrasives for grinding and polishing astronomical objective mirrors by hand. A compilation of Edmund's earlier pamphlets published as the book "All About Telescopes" offered many designs for telescopes of all sizes and configurations, which directed the builder to the relative Edmund catalog part numbers needed for each design. The "Factory Store" in Barrington, New Jersey also had a number of bins and shelves full of rare surplus items which never made it into the catalogs.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Edmund's catered to the 1960s generation by expanding and highlighting their line of projectors, color wheels, [[black light]]s, filters and other optical devices which could be used by rock bands and in [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] light shows. Other items catering to the [[Counterculture#1960s Counterculture in the USA|counterculture]] were eventually added to the catalog covering the fields of [[Biofeedback]], [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]], [[Kirlian photography]], [[Pyramid power]], and [[alternative energy]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

In 1971, in the [[Whole Earth Catalog]] of items "relevant to independent education", [[Stewart Brand]] noted: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Edmund is the best source we know of for low-cost scientific gadgetry (including math and optics gear). [In this category,] many of the items we found independently... turned up in the Edmund catalog, so we were obliged to recommend that in this area we've been precluded."{{fact|date=January 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some sources claim that certain of the original polyhedral dice used in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game system were obtained from Edmund Scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Contrarian (2008-03-05). Blog posting in RPGnet Forums: Where'd the first d20's come from?, dated "03-05-2008, 10:21 PM". Retrieved on 2016-03-05 from https://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-382854.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of an era==
In the 1970s, as the viability of Edmund's business model waned, Norman Edmund's son Robert Edmund refashioned the business into two new ones, '''Edmund Scientifics''' and '''Edmund Optics'''. Edmund Scientifics marketed to consumers and specialized in science-themed toys, vaguely high-tech household gadgets, and "science gifts." Edmund Optics did not have a public showroom like Edmund Scientifics, although the two organizations shared the same building. The large back room of Edmund Scientifics still sold military surplus from World War II and other wars well into the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Some of the items in the surplus room were from German and other non-American militaries. None of these items were in the mail-order catalogs. They also sold other surplus wares of interest to hobbyists, including specialized motors and other miscellaneous electronics, parts from toys, and other household items.

In line with their focus on optics, Edmund Scientifics's entrance vestibule housed a pale-blue working World War II Japanese submarine periscope. Children were often drawn to this periscope. Drawing on the periscope's popularity, sometime in the 1970s a [[House of mirrors|hall of mirrors]], complete with [[black light]]s, was installed toward the rear of the building.

The Barrington, New Jersey, store closed in 2001 after Edmund Scientific was acquired by [[Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories]].

Beginning in 2000, Edmund Optics offered a variety of experimental grade and stock clearance items via a print catalog and online under a separate business named Anchor Optics, but this operation ceased in 2016, and the current Anchor Optics website now redirects to a page at Edmund Optics listing clearance items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anchoroptics.com|title=Anchor Optics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504050302/http://www.anchoroptics.com/|archive-date=2016-05-04|access-date=23 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Edmund Optics continues to offer brand-new stock optics, as well as offering custom and specialized optics to corporations and higher education institutions.

==Today==
In 2000 Edmund Scientific was purchased by [[Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories]], a western New York based science supply company. Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories is part of a group of companies that provide science supplies to elementary, middle, and high schools as well as colleges and universities. This group falls under the unofficial umbrella "VWR Education"  and are owned by [[VWR International]], a multi-national conglomerate with offices in India, China, Europe, Canada and the United States. They are no longer affiliated with Edmund Optics Inc.

As of 2009, online sales now make up the bulk of Edmund Scientific's revenues. The company still sells telescopes (including an updated version of their [[Astroscan]] Telescope), microscopes (mostly they carry the Boreal brand which is manufactured for their parent company Science Kit LLC), surplus optics, magnets and [[Fresnel lens]]es. They continue to sell many of their old favorites along with new items such as the Impossiball and [[hand boiler]]s as well as other science-themed toys, novelty items, gifts and gadgets.

== In movies and television ==

Edmund Scientific has provided items used in television shows such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', ''[[MythBusters]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Modern Marvels]]'', and motion pictures such as ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', and the 1975 version of ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]''. [[Wah Chang]], the artist who designed and built several props in the 1960s for the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] television show, used [[moiré pattern]]s found in the Edmund Scientific Educator's and Designer's Moiré Kit for the texture used in the Starfleet communicator props.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herocomm.com/Details/MoireStory.htm herocomm.com - The Details... A Moiré Story]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Simpsons'' episode "[[Two Bad Neighbors]]", Bart Simpson releases locusts from a box labeled ''Edmund Scientific''.&lt;ref name="Simpsons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F09.html |title=[3F09] Two Bad Neighbors |work=[[The Simpsons Archive]] |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970710084237/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F09.html |archivedate=10 July 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited with the 1953 discovery of [[Gee's golden langur]]. He is notable as an early influential [[wildlife conservation]]ist, especially for his 1959 and 1963 surveys and recommendations resulting in the creation of [[Chitwan National Park]], the first of [[Protected areas of Nepal#National parks|nine national parks]] in [[Nepal]].

==Conservationist==
Gee was the fourth son of Rev. C. G. Gee, Vicar of Lowick and  his wife, daughter of a Colonel Briggs of Hylton Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifty years in Ministry | page=4| newspaper=The Berwick Advertiser| date=21 January 1937|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000717/19370121/102/0004| via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a tea planter, Gee was part of a highly influential group of British landowners very close to the highest levels of provincial power.
Soon after [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence]], Gee was one of the first to assess the threats to [[endangered species]] and outline [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] measures to protect them. He believed cattle had no place in a sanctuary and thought they would arouse a sense of surprise, disappointment, and revulsion in tourists who had come looking for wild animals.
[[File:Golden Langur.jpg|thumb|[[Gee's golden langur]] named for E.P. Gee]]
Like his contemporaries, [[Salim Ali]] and [[M. Krishnan]], Gee was a non-official member of the Indian Board for Wildlife, the apex body that advises the Union Government on wildlife matters. Gee argued in favour of separate [[Deputy Conservator of Forests (India)|wildlife wardens]] within the Forest Department, who have specific powers in relation to fauna. He wrote extensively on the role of [[forester]]s as protectors of wildlife, as he thought it important to rely on their goodwill. He believed conservation success depended on cooperation between foresters and the forest ministers of each state and that the role of the central government was only to advise and assist.&lt;ref name="Rangarajan"/&gt;

He is famous for his discovery of the langur species which is named after him, [[Gee's golden langur]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He had heard reports of an unusual coloured primate and he organised an expedition in 1953. He managed to film the langurs near the [[Sankosh River]] on the border between [[Assam]] and [[Bhutan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[File:Rhinos leofleck.jpg|thumb|Elephant safari in Chitwan National Park]]
He recommended that the [[Govindgarh, Madhya Pradesh|Govindgarh Palace]] of the Maharaja of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]], and its [[white tiger]] inhabitants, be made a "National Trust", which didn't happen.
[[File:Kazi rhino edit.jpg|thumb|[[Indian rhinoceros|Great Indian one-horned rhinoceros]] at Kaziranga National Park]]
In 1959, the [[Fauna and Flora International|Fauna Preservation Society]] appointed E.P. Gee to undertake a survey of the [[Chitwan Valley]]. Gee, who had spent most of his life in India and was an authority on its wildlife, recommended creation of a national park north of the [[East Rapti River|Rapti River]].&lt;ref name="Adventures"/&gt; He also proposed creation of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of ten years. In 1963, after he surveyed Chitwan again, this time for both the Fauna Preservation Society and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], Gee recommended extension of the national park to [[Indian rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] areas to the south of the river. In December 1970, His Majesty [[King Mahendra]] approved extension of the national park as recommended, thus creating the first national park in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Adventures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuresnepal.com/nepal/chitwan_national_park/establishment.htm|title=Establishment-Chitwan National Park|year=2009|publisher=Adventures Nepal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retirement from tea planting in Assam, Gee settled in [[Shillong]], where he assembled one of the finest private [[orchid]] collections.&lt;ref name="ali"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Sálim |title=The fall of a Sparrow  |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi |year=1985|pages=189|isbn= 0-19-568747-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After Independence, sensitive to the nationalism of the new Indian leadership, Gee searched for and emphasized indigenous nature conservation practices, ranging from ancient imperial edicts to village traditions of protecting nesting bird colonies. This cooperative and culturally sensitive style won recognition from [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] whom Gee accompanied together with Nehru's daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] and son-in-law [[Feroze Gandhi]] on a tour of [[Kaziranga National Park|Kaziranga Wildlife Sanctuary]] on 20 October 1956.&lt;ref name="AMTRON"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assamforest.in/knp-osc/linkpages.php?u=vww|title=Visitors Who's who, Guest Register 1938 to 1958,  Kaziranga Game Sanctuary| last=Official Support Committee|first=Kaziranga National Park|year=2009|publisher=AMTRON|accessdate=4 January 2010|location=Assam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru's forward to Gee's book in February 1964 was one of the only pieces he ever wrote on wildlife conservation. In it he said,
{{quotation|Life would become very dull and colourless if it did not have these magnificent animals and birds to look at and to play with.}}

Nehru called for more refuges for vanishing wildlife, but he died in May and Gee died four years later. It was the end of an era.&lt;ref name="Rangarajan"/&gt;

*E.P. Gee was an active contributor to the early wildlife protection policy of India. He wrote his own account of his wildlife work in the book ''Wildlife of India'' in 1964. This work makes a good comparison with present-day [[wildlife conservation]] efforts in India.&lt;ref name="gee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Edward Prichard|title=The Wildlife of India|publisher=Fontana |location=London |year=1964 |edition=orig. publ., paperback ed., 1969, (also: Indus, 1992, repr., Harper Collins, New Delhi 2000|pages=224, ills., foreword by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]|isbn=81-7223-406-6|url=http://indianmedicine.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/root/G/30459/?pFullItemRecord=ON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Book review by India Club says,
[[File:E.P.Gee Wildlife cover3.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Wildlife of India, 2000 edition]]
{{quotation|For anyone interested in wildlife or the natural resources of India this is an enthralling and informative book. For the animals themselves it may make all the difference between extermination and survival. Some of the noblest and most beautiful animals in the world are to be found in India. But they are unlikely to survive outside the pages of Kipling and the memoirs of big-game hunters unless something is done quickly to save them. E P Gee has spent half a lifetime studying and photographing animals and birds in India. He has sat in the open within ten feet of a lion, has fallen in front of a charging rhinoceros and he has a strange tale to tell of a bird mystery in Assam; but although it is full of good stories this is not a book of daring deeds. It is a unique panorama of the wildlife resources of India, her sanctuaries, the animals which inhabit them and the men who have done most to preserve them.}}

{{quotation|COMMENTS: Absolutely splendid. The photographs and text are of a very high quality. - [[Peter Scott]] - The author's great experience of Indian wildlife and his superb photography render this one of the most enthralling books on natural history. All interested in nature will find it hard to stop reading. -  [[The American Naturalist|The Naturalist]] - A plea for the preservation of wild animals and birds in India. Mr. Gee a splendid raconteur, takes each of the main species and discusses with a wealth of anecdotes its chances of survival. A dedicated man, he is no fanatic. Of outstanding interest.&lt;ref name="marelibri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marelibri.com/search/current?maximumPrice=0&amp;keywords=&amp;firstResult=0&amp;ISBN=&amp;selectedDatasources=511&amp;quicksearch=&amp;matchTypeList=ALL&amp;author=&amp;title=the+wild+life+of+india&amp;description=&amp;minimumPrice=0&amp;sorting=RELEVANCE&amp;booksellerName=&amp;keycodes=&amp;cid=3353187|title= the wild life of india|work=Search -|publisher=marelibri|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">'''Fred Prehn''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Horse harness|harness]]maker and merchant from [[Marathon City, Wisconsin|Marathon City]], [[Wisconsin]] who served one term in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, A. Peter, ed. ''Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848–1999''. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Prehn was born on May 5, 1860 in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|the city of Manitowoc]], son of Theodore and Fredrika Prehn, of [[German American]] ancestry. He was brought up on a farm in that county; received his education in [[State school|public schools]] in [[Newton, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Newton, Wisconsin]], and attended [[Manitowoc High School]]. He learned the trade of harness making and [[saddle]]ry, working first in [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]], then [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and later in [[Milwaukee]]. In 1881 he moved to Marathon City to work at his trade. He opened a harnessmaker shop, soon afterward adding the sale of implements for farm use to his harness line and still later adding [[hardware store|hardware]],  [[furniture]] and [[Funeral director|undertaking]].

== Public office ==
Prehn, an active member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], was
appointed [[postmaster]] of Marathon City in 1889 under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Benjamin Harrison]], holding that office until 1893. He served as president of his [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Village|village]] for three years, served on the county [[board of supervisors]] for two years and on the village [[school board]] for three.

Prahn was elected to the Assembly in 1904 from the 1st Marathon County district (the [[political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|Towns]] of [[Bergen, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Bergen]], [[Berlin, Wisconsin|Berlin]], [[Brighton, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Brighton]], [[Cassel, Wisconsin|Cassel]], [[Cleveland, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Cleveland]], [[Day, Wisconsin|Day]], [[Eau Pleine, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Eau Pleine]], [[Emmet, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Emmet]], [[Frankfort, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Frankfort]], [[Halsey, Wisconsin|Halsey]], [[Hamburg, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Hamburg]], [[Holton, Wisconsin|Holton]], [[Hull, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Hull]], [[Johnson, Wisconsin|Johnson]], [[Maine, Marathon County, Wisconsin|Maine]], [[McMillan, Wisconsin|McMillan]], [[Marathon, Wisconsin|Marathon]], [[Mosinee (town), Wisconsin|Mosinee]], [[Rib Falls, Wisconsin|Rib Falls]], [[Rietbrock, Wisconsin|Rietbrock]], [[Spencer, Wisconsin|Spencer]], [[Stettin, Wisconsin|Stettin]] and [[Wien, Wisconsin|Wien]]; the Villages of [[Edgar, Wisconsin|Edgar]],  [[Marathon City, Wisconsin|Marathon]], [[McMillan (community), Wisconsin|McMillan]], [[Mosinee, Wisconsin|Mosinee]]; and the east [[wards of the United States|ward]] of [[Colby, Wisconsin|Colby]]), receiving 2,354 votes against 2,145 for the incumbent, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Willis F. La Du]].

He was not a candidate for re-election in 1906, and was succeeded by Democrat [[Nic Schmidt]].

== After the Assembly ==
Prehn's two-story store building caught fire in 1905. The building and contents were under-insured, and he lost more than three-quarters of their value. Prehn went into business with his son Edwin in another store in Marathon City. As of 1913, their firm also owned a farm of 240 acres in [[Jackson County, Wisconsin|Jackson County]].

He was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]&lt;ref name=graveyard&gt;http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/pratte-presba.html#0WA01FJB0&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Modern Woodmen of America]].

Prehn was married first to Bentenia Langenhahn, a native of [[Germany]]; she died in Marathon City at the age of 26. They had four children: Helen, Arthur W., Edwin R., and Ella. Prehn's second marriage was to Emma Erdman, of the town of Stettin. As of 1913, they had six children: Benjamin, Delos, Fred, Douglass, Gerlinda and Aurora. They had an adopted daughter, Levina Clemens, whom they adopted when she was three years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.HistoryMarathon Marchetti, Louis. ''History of Marathon County Wisconsin and Representative Citizens'' Chicago: Richmond-Arnold Publishing Co., 1913; pp. 238-239, 746]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prehn died from [[heart disease]] in [[Wausau, Wisconsin]] in 1932. His son Arthur would become [[district attorney|District Attorney]] of Marathon County and Wisconsin Republican State Central Committeeman.

'''Gabbar Singh''' is a [[fictional character]], the antagonist of the 1975 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Sholay]]''.

Played by [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]], he is depicted in ''Sholay'' as a [[Dacoity|dacoit]] who leads a group in looting and plundering the villages in the region of Ramgarh. He has a sadistic personality and insists on killing whenever required to continue his status and to take revenge on his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahai, Dissanayake|first=Malti, Wimal|title=Sholay, a cultural reading|year=1992|publisher=Wiley Eastern|isbn=81-224-0394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baghel|first=Meenal|title=Once upon a time in Ramgarh|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/135702/|accessdate=5 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=Patrick Colm|title=Understanding Indian movies: culture, cognition, and cinematic imagination|year=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-72167-8|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;The character is considered to be one of the most iconic villains in [[hindi film|Indian Cinema]].&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title='Sholay' completes 35 years|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-16/news-interviews/28312058_1_dacoit-gabbar-singh-film|accessdate=22 Nov 2011|newspaper=The Times of India|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured in the 1991 spoof ''[[Ramgarh Ke Sholay]]'', with Amjad Khan portraying a parody version of the character.

==Development==
The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around [[Gwalior]] in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen.{{sfn|Khan|1981||pp=88–89, 98}} The character was also inspired by ''Gunga Jumna'', where Dilip Kumar's character Gunga is a dacoit speaking with a similar dialect, a mix of [[Khariboli]] and [[Awadhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chopra|first=Anupama|title=Shatrughan Sinha as Jai, Pran as Thakur and Danny as Gabbar?

[[Danny Denzongpa]]  was the first choice of Gabbar but had to miss out because he was shooting for [[Dharmatma]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=toi1&gt;{{cite news|title=Danny Denzongpa’s loss|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-30/did-you-know-/27922509_1_danny-denzongpa-bandit-feroz-khan|work=Article|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=20 Nov 2011|date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] was almost dropped from the project because [[Javed Akhtar]] found his voice too weak for Gabbar Singh's role but was later convinced. For his preparation for the role Amjad read Abhishapth Chambal, a book on Chambal dacoits written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri (actress Jaya Bhaduri's father).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Anupama|authorlink=Anupama Chopra|title=[[Sholay: The Making of a Classic]]|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books, India|isbn=0-14-029970-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanjeev Kumar]] also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed "felt he had the audience’s sympathy through roles he’d done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful."&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Salim|authorlink1=Salim Khan|last2=Sukumaran|first2=Shradha|title=Sholay, the Beginning|journal=[[OPEN (magazine)|OPEN Magazine]]|date=14 August 2010|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/arts-letters/sholay-the-beginning|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130151204/http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/arts-letters/sholay-the-beginning|archivedate=30 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of speech==
Gabbar's language was a mixture of North Indian [[Khariboli]] and Hindi, which was something new for the audiences so the dialogues were an instant hit and are still popular in India. Javed Akhtar says that Gabbar seemed to acquire life and vocabulary of his own as he wrote the film. His sadism lies in his choice of words like "Khurach, khurach (scratch)" when he talks to [[Hema Malini]].&lt;ref name=tag1 &gt;{{cite web|author=Meenal Baghel |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/Storyold/135702/ |title=Once upon a time in Ramgarh |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=5 December 1999 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amjad shot to stardom with the movie. His mannerisms and dialogues have become an integral part of Bollywood lexicon.&lt;ref name=filmfare /&gt; ''Sholay'' went on to become a blockbuster, and is the highest grossing movie in India. Although the movie boasted an ensemble cast of superstars including Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, he stole the thunder with his unorthodox and eerie dialogue delivery that was perfectly opposite to the total lack of empathy his character was supposed to convey. Even after forty seven years people fondly remember his dialogues and mannerisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Ruma|title=Tera kya hoga, Gabbar Singh?|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore-times/Tera-kya-hoga-Gabbar-Singh/articleshow/2161793.cms|accessdate=28 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later appeared in advertisements as Gabbar Singh endorsing [[Britannia Industries#Biscuits|Britannia]] Glucose Biscuits (Popularly knowns as "Gabbar Ki Asli Pasand"), and it was the first incidence of a villain being used to sell a popular product.
The role of Gabbar Singh was so deep-rooted in people's mind those days that Amjad Khan was known for the rest of his life by this role alone and wherever he went he had to speak some dialogues from the film to amuse the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451166/ |title=Amjad Khan&amp;nbsp;— IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Anupama|title=Sholay, The Making of a Classic|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-029970-0|url=http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/category/Cinema/Sholay__The_Making_Of_A_Classic_9780140299700.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;  because the dialogues are very popular among the audiences of [[Indian Cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lines that linger|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050717/spectrum/main6.htm|work=Article|publisher=The Tribune|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] have compared the impact of Gabbar Singh on Bollywood to the impact that [[Darth Vader]] later had on Hollywood. According to [[Anupama Chopra]], "He’s like Darth Vader in ''[[Star Wars]]'', pure evil, utterly terrifying and a cool baddie”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Verma|first1=Rahul|title=Sholay: The Star Wars of Bollywood?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150813-sholay-the-star-wars-of-bollywood|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Amitabh Bachchan told a contestant on his ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'' TV show that when Amjad Khan visited their home, his son [[Abhishek Bachchan]] ran to him and said "Papa, Gabbar Singh aaya hai" (meaning: Father, Gabbar Singh is here!), and Bachchan had to convince his son that Gabbar was just a character played by Khan.&lt;ref name="A lady from my town(pulgaon) wins fifty lakhs in KBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tJ1Ma2xgbo|work=Youtube.com |title=Sujata Wankhade from Maharashtra on Hot Seat-Episode 35 - KBC 2011 - 12th Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabbar Singh has been a subject of parodies and jokes innumerable times in the popular Indian media.&lt;ref name="cineplot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cineplot.com/amjad-khan/ |title=Amjad Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cineplot1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2006/11/01/1769/index.html |title=Kitne aadmi they? for the role of Gabbar Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Filmfare]]'' named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.filmfare.com/features/iconic-villains-of-indian-cinema-3038-2.html|title=Iconic villains of Indian cinema|accessdate=7 July 2013|date=3 May 2013|journal=[[Filmfare]]|author= Hashmi, Parampara Patil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Jai Hind (film)|Jai Hind]]'' (1994) comedian [[Senthil (actor)|Senthil]] says "Arre O Sambha" while appearing as a dacoit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BohprgUAjo|title=Jai Hind Comedy|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2016}} Clip from 9:30 to 11:30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 film ''[[Gabbar Singh (film)|Gabbar Singh]]'', the character has been referenced by protagonist Venkataratnam Naidu (played by [[Telugu language|Telugu]] actor [[Pawan Kalyan]]), nicknaming himself after Gabbar Singh's character. Constable Ram Prasad ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) is nicknamed 'Samba' after Gabbar Singh's sidekick. The sequel ''[[Sardaar Gabbar Singh]]'' (2016 film), Pawan reprises his role, albeit with 'Sardaar' in front of his name, referring to the title given by Gabbar Singh's henchmen. Both Telugu films contain dialogues made famous by Sholay's antagonist, e.g. "''Joh darr gaya... samjho marr gaya''" (Whoever is afraid... they are dead).

In the 2015 film ''[[Gabbar is Back]]'', the protagonist Aditya Singh Rajput (portrayed by [[Akshay Kumar]]) resembles Gabbar Singh and he also nicknamed himself after Gabbar's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-17/news-interviews/38587127_1_gabbar-ram-leela-ramana|title=After rowdy, Bhansali turns Akshay into Gabbar | date= 17 April 2013|accessdate=16 December 2013|work=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hendrik Karel Nicolaas van der Noot''' (7 January 1731 – 12 January 1827), was a jurist, lawyer and politician from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. He was one of the main figures of the [[Brabant Revolution]] (1789–1790) against the [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian rule]] of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. This revolution led to the short-lived existence of the [[United States of Belgium]] with himself as [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rulers.org/indexn2.html#noot|title=Index Ng-Nz|publisher=rulers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (11 January 1790 – 2 December 1790).

== Family ==
{{main|Count van der Noot}}
He was the son of [[Nicolas van der Noot, Lord of Vreschem]], and is distantly related to the current [[Marquess of Assche]].

==Overview==
Two lawyers, [[Jan Frans Vonck]] and Hendrik Van der Noot, were the leaders of the revolt but each represented a different faction. The Vonckists were inspired by the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and sought a link-up with the people and the patriot army. The [[Statists (Belgium)|Statists]] led by Van der Noot strived for the restoration of old privileges of the nobility and the church such as the "[[Joyous Entry of 1356|Joyous Entry]]" and sought cooperation with the [[Dutch Republic]].

In contrast to Vonck, who was of the opinion that the Belgian people themselves had to fight against the Austrian despot, Van der Noot had more confidence in obtaining foreign support.&lt;ref name=blom2006&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Blom|editor1-first=J. C. H.|editor2-last=Lamberts|editor2-first=E.|title=History of the Low Countries|date=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-1845452728|page=293–294|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1788 Van der Noot travelled to [[Kingdom of England|England]], the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Prussia]] to get attention for the cause of Brabant liberty. Only Prussia, which itself had beaten the Dutch patriots in 1787, was inclined to support the Belgian patriots as they were at that time anti-Austrian. Van der Noot had less success seeking support from the last Grand Pensionary of Holland, [[Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel]].

In October 1789 Van der Noot and [[Jean-André van der Mersch|General Vander Meersch]] with a small patriot army from [[Breda]] captured the entire province of Brabant. In his first concurred (or freed) town, [[Hoogstraten]], Van der Noot published his [[Manifesto of the People of Brabant|Manifesto of the Brabant People]] on 24 October 1789. The document explains why the people of Brabant have the right to disobedience against a ruler. The main argument is that the will of a nation is the highest law and if that is violated by a ruler the nation has the right to revolt against the ruler.

Van der Noot captured Turnhout, defeating the Austrians in the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] on 27 October and Ghent was taken on 13 November. On 17 November the imperial regents Albert of Saxony and Archduchess Maria Christina fled Brussels. The remains of the imperial forces withdrew behind the citadel walls of Luxembourg and Antwerp.

Van der Noot declared Brabant independent, and all other provinces of the Austrian Netherlands with the exception of Luxembourg soon followed suit. On 11 January 1790 they signed a pact, establishing a confederation, headed by Van der Noot, under the name ''Verenigde Nederlandse Staten''/''États-Belgiques-Unis'' ([[United States of Belgium]]).&lt;ref name=blom2006/&gt;

When Prussia abandoned the revolt after the signing the [[Treaty of Reichenbach (1790)|Convention of Reichenbach]] (27 July 1790) with Austria the fragile state soon came under attack by the Austrian troops of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], who had succeeded his brother Joseph II after the latter's death on 20 February 1790. In November 1790 Van der Noot had to flee to the Dutch Republic and thereafter to England. In 1792 he made an appeal for cooperation with the French occupiers (1794–1815). He returned to Brabant but was arrested 1796 and imprisoned in 's Hertogenbosch.

He died in 1826 in Strombeek and his tomb is located in the wall of the vicar's compound of the Sint-Amandsparochie in Strombeek-Bever.

Moore was the son of [[Charles Moore, 2nd Viscount Moore of Drogheda]], by his wife Hon. Alice Loftus, the youngest daughter of [[Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus]].&lt;ref&gt;John Debrett, ''Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland'' (1840), p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ardee (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ardee]] between 1639 and 1643, when he succeeded to his father's viscountcy. He became a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] Colonel of Horse and served as Governor of [[County Meath|Meath]] of [[County Louth|Louth]] in 1643. Moore served in the forces of [[Confederate Ireland]] and fought at the [[Battle of Dungan's Hill]] in August 1647. In 1653 he was forced to pay £6,953 to the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] government in order to retain his estates under the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]]. Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] he was made Governor of Drogheda in 1660 and invested as a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].

He developed several streets in [[Dublin]] which still bear his name: [[Henry Street, Dublin|Henry Street]], [[Moore Street]], [[North Earl Street]], Of Lane (now "Off Lane") and Drogheda Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">'''James Simms''' (1828 &amp;ndash; 4 September 1915) was a British instrument maker.

He succeeded his father [[William Simms (instrument maker)|William Simms]] (1793 &amp;ndash; 1860) at the instrument making firm [[Troughton &amp; Simms]].  The firm made instruments of various kinds, including notably astronomical instruments and [[telescope]]s.

For about ten years, until 1871, his partner in the firm was his cousin William Simms (1817 &amp;ndash; 1907), who was the son of his uncle James, the brother of his father William.  After  1871 he was sole proprietor.  After his death, he was succeeded in the firm by his sons, who were named William and James.

Marmaduke''' (born '''John Sappington Marmaduke''', March 14, 1833 – December 28, 1887) served as the [[List of Governors of Missouri|25th governor of Missouri]] from 1885 until his death in 1887. Prior to that, he was a senior [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Confederate States Army]] who commanded [[cavalry]] in the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi Theater]] of the [[American Civil War]]. On September 6, 1863 Marmaduke killed [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lucius M. Walker]] in a duel. [[Major-General]] [[Sterling Price]] ordered Marmaduke's arrest, but suspended the order because of the impending [[United States Army|Union]] advance on [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Marmaduke never faced a [[court martial]] for the duel.&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:John S. Marmaduke]]. --&gt;

== Early life and education==
The second son among ten children, John S. Marmaduke was born on his father's plantation in [[Saline County, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;Shoemaker's pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Meredith Miles Marmaduke|Meredith M. Marmaduke]] (1791&amp;ndash;1864), was the 8th governor of Missouri. His great-grandfather, [[John Breathitt]], had served as the [[governor of Kentucky]] from 1832 to 1834, dying in office.&lt;ref name=C&gt;Parrish's pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Marmaduke attended Chapel Hill Academy in [[Lafayette County, Missouri]] and [[Masonic College]] in [[Lexington, Missouri]], before attending [[Yale University]] for two years and then [[Harvard University]] for another year.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[John S. Phelps]] appointed Marmaduke to the [[United States Military Academy]], from which he graduated in 1857, placing 30th out of 38 students.&lt;ref name=B&gt;Welsh's pp. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 1st United States Mounted Riflemen, before being transferred to the [[2d Armored Cavalry Regiment|2d United States Cavalry]] under [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]. Marmaduke later served in the [[Utah War]] and was posted to [[Camp Floyd]], [[Utah]], in 1858&amp;ndash;1860.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

== American Civil War ==
Marmaduke was on duty in the [[New Mexico Territory]] in the spring of 1861 when he received news that Missouri had [[seceded]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. He hastened home and met with his father, an avid Unionist. Afterwards, Marmaduke decided to resign from the [[United States Army]], effective April 1861. Pro-secession Missouri Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]], Marmaduke's uncle, soon appointed him as the [[colonel]] of the 1st Regiment of Rifles, a unit from Saline County, Missouri, in the [[Missouri State Guard]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt; Governor Jackson departed [[Jefferson City, Missouri]] in June, along with State Guard commander Major-General Sterling Price, to recruit more troops. Marmaduke and his regiment met them at [[Boonville, Missouri]]. Within a short time, Price and Jackson left, leaving Marmaduke in charge of a small force of [[militia]]men. Marmaduke realized his troops were not adequately prepared for combat, but Governor Jackson ordered him to make a stand. [[United States|Federal]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier-General]] [[Nathaniel Lyon]]'s 1,700 well-trained and equipped soldiers easily routed Marmaduke's untrained and poorly armed force at the [[Battle of Boonville]] on June 17, 1861, a skirmish mockingly dubbed "the Boonville Races" by Unionists, since Marmaduke's recruits broke and ran after just 20 minutes of battle.&lt;ref name=C/&gt;

Disgusted by the situation, Marmaduke resigned his commission in the Missouri State Guard and traveled to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he was commissioned a [[first lieutenant]] in the regular Confederate States Army.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; The Confederate War Department ordered him to report for duty in Arkansas, where he soon was elected [[lieutenant-colonel]] of the 1st Arkansas Battalion.&lt;ref name=B/&gt; He served on the staff of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[William J. Hardee]], a former United States Military Academy instructor of infantry tactics. Marmaduke's former Mormon War commander, [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], asked him to join his staff in early 1862.&lt;ref name=D&gt;Johnston's pp. 583–584&lt;/ref&gt; Marmaduke was wounded in action at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] as colonel of the [[18th Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Marmaduke's)|3rd Confederate Regiment]], incapacitating him for several months.&lt;ref name=E&gt;Neal's pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1862, the War Department confirmed Marmaduke's promotion to brigadier-general. His first battle as a [[brigade]] commander was at the [[Battle of Prairie Grove]].&lt;ref name=F&gt;Black's pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1863, Marmaduke departed Arkansas with 5,000 men and ten [[artillery]] pieces and entered Union-held Missouri. However, he was repulsed at the [[Battle of Cape Girardeau]] and forced to return to [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], Arkansas.&lt;ref name=G&gt;Conard's pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy soon followed. In September 1863, he accused his immediate superior officer, Brigadier-General [[Lucius M. Walker]], of cowardice in action for not being present with his men on the battlefield. Walker, slighted by the insult, challenged Marmaduke to a [[duel]], which resulted in Walker's death on September 6, 1863.&lt;ref name=G/&gt;

Marmaduke later commanded a cavalry division in the Trans-Mississippi Department, serving in the [[Red River Campaign]]. During this period, he once again was involved in controversy. Commanding a mixed force of Confederate troops, including Native-American soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Choctaw Regiments, Marmaduke defeated a Union foraging detachment at the [[Battle of Poison Spring]], Arkansas on April 18, 1864. Marmaduke's men were accused of murdering African-American soldiers of the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (Colored)|1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry]] (later designated the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). Marmaduke and other white officers claimed that the accusations of illegal killings were overblown, and blamed any murders that may have happened on the Choctaw troops who, in the words of one Confederate, did "kill and scalp some" of the black troops. He was hailed in the Confederate press for what was publicized as a significant southern victory.

Marmaduke commanded a division in Major-General Sterling [[Price's Raid]] September–October 1864 into Missouri, where Marmaduke was captured at the [[Battle of Mine Creek]] in Kansas (by Private [[James Dunlavy]] of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry).&lt;ref name=G/&gt; While still a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Johnson's Island]] in [[Ohio]], Marmaduke was promoted to major-general in March 1865. He was released after the war ended.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; His younger brother, Henry Hungerford Marmaduke, served in the [[Confederate States Navy]], was captured and was imprisoned on [[Johnson's Island]]. He later served the federal government in negotiations with South American nations. He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Two other Marmaduke brothers died in the American Civil War.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

== Later life and death ==
Marmaduke returned home to Missouri and settled in [[Carondelet, St. Louis]]. He worked briefly for an insurance company, whose ethics he found contrary to his own. He then edited an agricultural journal, and publicly accused the [[Rail transport|railroads]] of [[pricing|discriminatory pricing]] against local farmers. The governor soon appointed Marmaduke to the state's first Rail Commission.&lt;ref name=H&gt;Reavis's pp. 510–511&lt;/ref&gt; Marmaduke decided to enter politics, but lost the 1880 [[Missouri Democratic Party|Democratic]] nomination for governor to former Union general [[Thomas Theodore Crittenden|Thomas T. Crittenden]], who had strong support and financial backing from the railroads. Undeterred, Marmaduke [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1884|ran again for governor four years later]], at a time when public opinion had changed, and railroad reform and regulation became more in vogue. Marmaduke conducted a campaign which apologetically highlighted his Confederate service, emphasized alleged abuses of Missourians by Union troops during the Civil War, celebrated the activities of pro-Confederate "partisan guerrillas" such as [[William Clarke Quantrill]], claimed that the Republican Party in Missouri was a tool of "carpetbaggers" to oppress "native" Missourians, and made overt appeals to white racism. He was elected on a platform officially focused on cooperation between former Unionists and Confederates, promising an agenda which would produce a "New Missouri." He settled potentially crippling railroad [[Strike action|strikes]] in 1885 and 1886. The following year, Marmaduke pushed laws through the state legislature that finally began regulating the state's railway industry. He also dramatically boosted the state's funding of public schools, with nearly a third of the annual budget allocated to education.

Marmaduke never married, and his two nieces served as hostesses at the governor's mansion.&lt;ref name=I&gt;McClure pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Like his great-grandfather, he died while serving as governor. He contracted [[pneumonia]] late in 1887 and died in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he was buried in Woodland Cemetery.&lt;ref name=I/&gt;

'''June Edna Fairchild''' (September 3, 1946 – February 17, 2015) was an [[United States|American]] actress and dancer. Fairchild starred or co-starred in more than a dozen major notable film roles before her addictions to drugs and alcohol effectively ended her professional acting career.

==Life==
Fairchild was born '''June Edna Wilson''' on September 3, 1946,&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;  in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].&lt;ref name=ciobit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lentz III|first1=Harris|title=Obituaries|journal=Classic Images|date=April 2015|issue=478|pages=50–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a musician who specialized in writing gospel songs and music.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Fairchild was raised in Manhattan Beach and graduated from [[Aviation High School (California)|Aviation High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]].&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; She was hired as a member of the [[Gazzarri's|Gazzarri Dancers]] on the 1960s syndicated [[variety show]], ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'', after graduating from high school.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

===Year of success===
During the 1960s, Fairchild lived with her then-boyfriend, [[Danny Hutton]], the lead singer of [[Three Dog Night]] for several years.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Chawkins|title=June Fairchild dies at 68; former actress lived on skid row |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-june-fairchild-20150219-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2015-02-18 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairchild was credited with conceiving the band's name, Three Dog Night.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s Fairchild had a successful acting career. She co-starred in ''[[Head (film)|Head]]'', which was a vehicle for [[The Monkees]], in 1968; ''[[Drive, He Said]]'', which was directed by [[Jack Nicholson]], in 1971; ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', which starred [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jeff Bridges]], in 1974; and the 1978 [[Cheech &amp; Chong]] film, ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', in which she appeared as a drug addict who snorts [[Ajax (cleaning product)|Ajax]] soap powder.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

===Decline===
In her later life Fairchild lived on the streets of [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] due to her addictions.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In 2001, a reporter for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' ran a story about Fairchild's past career in Hollywood and her present life on the streets of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=latimes2&gt;{{cite news|first=Noaki|last=Schwartz|title=A Fallen Star: Addiction: Former actress, now 54 and living on the streets, dreams of a movie comeback.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/21/local/me-28123 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2001-02-21 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairchild was selling newspapers outside a Los Angeles courthouse at the time in an attempt to earn enough money for a [[single-room occupancy]] hotel room.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; On February 21, 2001, the same day that her story was published in the ''Los Angeles Times'', police stopped her in [[Van Nuys]] for carrying an open container. A police officer recognized her picture from the newspaper and arrested her for failure to complete her [[community service]] from a past [[drunk driving]] conviction. Fairchild was sentenced to 90 days in prison.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; In 2002, Fairchild told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that her prison sentence had triggered a pledge of sobriety.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Friends told reporters that Fairchild remained sober until her death in 2015.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

Fairchild spent the later years of her life living in single-room hotels in [[downtown Los Angeles]] using her [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] disability payments.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Death==
Fairchild died from liver cancer at a convalescent home in Los Angeles on February 17, 2015, at the age of 68.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; She was survived by her daughter, Megan Mull; a 2-month-old grandson; and her brother, Jerry Wilson. Fairchild had divorced twice.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

'''Kim Man-il''' ({{korean|hangul=김만일|hanja=金萬一}}; 1944–1947/8) was the second son and child of [[North Korea]]n leader [[Kim Il-sung]] and his first wife, [[Kim Jong-suk]].

==Biography==
Soviet records show that he was born '''Alexander Irsenovich Kim''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Ирсенович Ким}}) in 1944 in the [[Russia]]n village of [[Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai|Vyatskoye]]. Inside his family, he was nicknamed ''Shura''. Official North Korean biographies state that Shura and his older brother [[Kim Jong-il]] got along very well and played together.&lt;ref&gt;Both Jerrold Post in {{Cite journal|author=Post, Jerrold M. |year=2008 |title=Kim Jong-Il of North Korea: In the shadow of his father |journal=International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies |volume=5|issue=3|pages=191–210}} and Robert Davison who publishes ''The Inquisitor'' cite  North Korean defector Yi Ki-bong (이기봉, 李基奉) for statements that shed some doubt on this. Davison quotes from Yi's book, ''What Kind of Man is Kim Jong II [sic: Kim, Chŏng-il]'' (most likely Yi's chapter in ''민족사 입장 에서 본 김 일성 정권''): “Kim was very mischievous when a child. When he saw an insect, he trampled on it. After Korea’s liberation from Japanese occupation, the Kim II-sung family lived in a house in Mansu-tong, Central District, P’yongyang. In the early summer of 1948, his younger brother, Shura (then three years old) drowned. Kim Jong II was there at the time. I learned later how the accident occurred. The two brothers were playing in the pond right by the edge. Kim Jong II raised his face faster than his brother, and pushed his brother’s face back into water. He did that over and over.” {{Cite web|author=Davison, Robert|title=Despot of the Week #5 – Kim Jong II |date=26 August 2009 |url=https://robertod.wordpress.com/2009/08/26/despot-of-the-week-5-kim-jong-ii/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830223323/http://robertod.wordpress.com/2009/08/26/despot-of-the-week-5-kim-jong-ii/ |archivedate=30 August 2009 |deadurl=no}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Man-il's death is shrouded in mystery.

'''Laverna "Verna" Katie Dollimore''' (January 22, 1922 – October 24, 2011) was one of six Canadians awarded the [[Order of Canada]] for her participation in the [[Canadian Caper]], in which the Canadian government and the [[CIA]] orchestrated the cover rescue of six American diplomats in Iran (1979). Her Order of Canada Medal is on display at the [[Maritime Command Museum]].

Laverna Katie Dollimore was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on 22 January 1922. Her parents, William Dollimore and Eva Somner, emigrated to Canada in 1915 on the penultimate voyage of the [[RMS Lusitania]]. Dollimore was the youngest of three children, preceded by brother, Hedley, and sister, Neysa. She attended Oakwood Collegiate High School and then Western Technical Commercial School for business, graduating in 1938.&lt;ref name="ryell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryell|first1=Nora|title=Dollimore got more adventure than she bargained for in Iran|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/dollimore-got-more-adventure-than-she-bargained-for-in-iran/article4180935/|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|date=13 December 2011|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Robert|title=Our woman in Tehran|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55f9740de4b06788affc824b/t/55fffeb0e4b0b10a56e526d3/1442840240198/Dollimore.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=The Ottawa Citizen|date=5 November 2011|ref=2|page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For five years she did secretarial or bookkeeping jobs for companies in Toronto including, Jenny Lind Candy Shops and Dominion Paper Box Co.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Laverna Dollimore - Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ottawacitizen/obituary.aspx?pid=154307356|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=The Ottawa Citizen|date=29 October 2011|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 she joined the [[Women’s Royal Canadian Naval Service]] and was posted to [[HMCS Cornwallis]] in Halifax. Despite taking the Petty Officer exam, the war concluded before Dollimore could follow that path and she returned to Toronto to continue in her previous line of work.&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;

In 1956, she took the public service exam and joined the Department of External Affairs. Dollimore worked in a number of Canadian embassies, such as Cairo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.K. Dollimore Goes to Cairo|work=The Globe and Mail|date=22 April 1957|location=Toronto|page=15}} {{subscription required |via= [[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the Suez Crisis, Poland, Kuala Lumpur, Leopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]], DRC), and many others. During her time she worked for notable members of the diplomatic corps, including: [[Robert Ford (poet)|Robert Ford]], [[G. Hamilton Southam]], [[Charles Ritchie (diplomat)|Charles Ritchie]], [[Paul Martin Sr]].&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt;

She joined the [[International Commission for Supervision and Control]], under [[Percy Stewart Cooper]] in Laos in 1969. For her services there she received the [[Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal]].&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;

Dollimore’s most notable posting came in 1977, when she joined the Canadian embassy in Tehran, just ahead of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. There, she was the personal secretary to [[Kenneth D. Taylor|Kenneth Taylor]] and assisted in the ‘Canadian Caper’. Despite being given the option to leave Tehran in 1979, Dollimore remained until 1980 and, along with Roger Lucy, Ken Taylor, Sgt. Claude Gauthier, was one of the last Canadian’s to leave the embassy in Tehran.(2). For her service, she received the Order of Canada.&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aided"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aided escape, 8 Canadians to be honored|work=The Globe and Mail|date=1 July 1980|ref=5|location=Toronto|page=3}} {{subscription required |via= [[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remainder of her time with Foreign Affairs, Dollimore was posted to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Pauline|title=A surprise birthday party for Maureen Forrester|work=The Globe and Mail|date=31 July 1980|ref=6|location=Toronto|page=T5}} {{subscription required |via= [[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired in 1983 to Brighton Ont. Every five years she attended a ‘Canadian Caper’ reunion, hosting the 2005 party.&lt;ref name="ryell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt; She died of natural causes in 2011.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

'''Lisa Charleyboy''' is a First Nations ([[Tsilhqot’in]]) writer and social entrepreneur. She is the editor-in-chief of ''Urban Native Magazine'', which focuses on pop culture with an Indigenous twist. She writes, and also does appearances on radio shows and T.V. interviews to promote her magazine and give her opinion on current Aboriginal issues in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mediaindigena.com/lisa-charleyboy|title = Lisa Charleyboy|date = December 12, 2014|accessdate = |website = Media Indegina|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charleyboy has said in interviews that she considers herself a [[feminist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.roommagazine.com/blog/exclusive-interview-preview-lisa-charleyboy|title = Exclusive Interview Preview with Lisa Charleyboy|date = |accessdate = December 15, 2014|website = Room|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrays a positive representation of Aboriginal people in her magazine.

Charleyboy has written about [[cultural appropriation]], pop culture, and politics, and has been named one of Toronto’s Top Bloggers and one of Canada’s Top Ten Fashion Bloggers. In 2013, she was named by ''[[Huffington Post]]'' as one of three Aboriginal millennials to watch,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/05/10/millenials-first-nations-generation-y_n_3231763.html|title=Millennial First Nations: 3 Young Aboriginal Canadians To Watch|date=2013-05-10|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended for a Toronto DiverseCity Fellowship for 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.annickpress.com/author/Lisa-Charleyboy|title = Lisa Charleyboy|date = n.d.|accessdate = December 15, 2014|website = Annick Press|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Charleyboy moved from [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]] to Toronto to attend [[Ryerson University]] for Fashion Communication. Her love of magazines, united with her desire to become a fashion editor, led her to transfer to [[York University]] for Professional Writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lisacharleyboy.com/|title = Lisa Charleyboy|date = December 14, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2007 Charleyboy created a blog, [http://urbannativegirl.tv/ Urban Native Girl], (UNG) which is all about pop-culture with an Indigenous twist.&lt;ref name="SheDoes"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.shedoesthecity.com/lisa-charleyboy-founder-of-urban-native-magazine|title = Lisa Charleyboy, Founder of Urban Native Magazine|date = November 6, 2013|accessdate = December 15, 2014|website = She Does the City|publisher = |last = Cullingham|first = Haley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Urban Native Magazine was created as a spin-off of Charleyboy's blog, which is a Native lifestyle magazine geared toward inspiring Indigenous youth with positive success stories.&lt;ref name="SheDoes" /&gt; Urban Native Magazine is aimed towards Aboriginal Canadians aged from 15-35.  Many different types of social media are used to create positive change about  Aboriginals and breaking the stereotypes and generalizations down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://business.financialpost.com/2013/11/03/an-aboriginal-storyteller-for-the-digital-generation-entrepreneur-aims-to-get-native-culture-in-front-of-todays-youth/|title = An Aboriginal Storyteller for the digital generation:Entrepreneur aims to get native culture in front of today's youth|date = November 3, 2013|accessdate = December 15, 2014|website = Financial Post|publisher = |last = Bitti|first = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Charleyboy released a book with author Mary Beth Leatherdadale called "Dreaming in Indian: Contemporary Native American Voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.annickpress.com/Dreaming-in-Indian|title = Dreaming in Indian Contemporary Native American Voices|date = 2014|accessdate = December 2014|website = Dreaming in Indian|publisher = Annick Press|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charleyboy has also served as a board member for Association for the Native Development of Visual and Performing Arts (ANDVPA), the Young Indigenous Professionals, and is now the Director of Communications for the Aboriginal Professionals of Canada (APAC). She has also been invited to give talks at Harvard University and to Aboriginal Women Entrepreneurs, and has become a regular writer/contributor and guest in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/shannon-skinner/urban-native-girl-blogger_b_4013135.html|title = Lisa Charleyboy's Mission to Empower Aboriginal Canadians|date = September 29, 2014|accessdate = December 13, 2014|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Skinner|first = Shannon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lennox arms.svg|thumb|250px|right|Coat of arms of Earl of Lennox]]
Mormaer '''Maol Choluim II of Lennox''' (anglicised '''Malcolm II of Lennox''') (died 19 July 1333) was [[mormaer]] (the Celtic equivalent of an [[earl]]) of [[Lennox (district)|Lennox]] from 1303 to his death.

Maol Cholium's father, [[Maol Choluim I, Earl of Lennox|Maol Choluim I]] embraced the cause of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] as early as 1292. As a result the English king bestowed the Lennox earldom on Sir John Menteith, who was holding it in 1307 while the real earl was with King Robert in his wanderings in the Lennox country.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Earl of Lennox|volume=16|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to succeed to the Mormaerdom only on giving homage to King [[Edward I of England]] and attending Edward's court. It was perhaps to ease this process, that his mother Marjorie became an informant of the English crown. Maol Choluim assisted Edward initially by raising men from his Mormaerdom. Nevertheless, Maol Choluim's [[House of Bruce|Bruce]] loyalties were the same as his father [[Maol Choluim I, Earl of Lennox|Maol Choluim I]]'s, and this was keenly displayed when he attended Robert's coronation.

He was one of the signatories of the [[List of signatories of the Declaration of Arbroath|Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320.

Maol Choluim was in fact one of the most loyal followers of Bruce, and was rewarded by both Bruce and by later pro-Bruce writers such as [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]] and [[John of Fordun]], who wrote much praise of him.  Robert even retired in Lennox country, at the settlement of [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]].
Maol Choluim died in 1333 fighting for the Bruce cause against the Anglo-Balliol alliance at [[Battle of Halidon Hill]].

He had two known sons by an unknown wife, his successor [[Domhnall, Earl of Lennox|Domhnall]] and [[Muireadhach of Lennox|Muireadhach]].

'''Marina Barampama''' (born 1969) is a [[Burundi]]an politician. She was elected Second [[Vice President of Burundi|Vice President]] on 8 September 2006, replacing [[Alice Nzomukunda]]. She remained in post for six months, until she was sacked for her support of [[Hussein Radjabu]]. Formerly a member of the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD–FDD), she is now General Secretary of the [[Union for Peace and Development]].

==Political career==
After the resignation of Vice President [[Alice Nzomukunda]] over corruption and human rights abuses, Barampama was nominated for the role by [[President of Burundi|President]] [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] on 8 September 2006. She was almost unknown, and the members of the opposition party, [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA), walked out of the vote in protest over the lack of information provided about her. They subsequently argued that Barampama's election was invalid, since without their members, there were not enough members voting to form a [[quorum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Unknown' elected as Burundi VP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5326846.stm|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was sacked by Nkurunziza on 8 February 2007; he attributed this to insubordination and irresponsibility. Barampama had been a supporter of [[Hussein Radjabu]], the former chairman of the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD–FDD), who was ousted as chairman by the President shortly before Barampama's sacking.&lt;ref name="bbcsacked"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burundi's president sacks deputy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6345751.stm|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|date=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radjabu was subsequently arrested and imprisoned for 13 years for subversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burundi jail term for 'plotter'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7330298.stm|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=BBC News|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She subsequently switched allegiance to the [[Union for Peace and Development]] (UPD), and by 2015 had become General Secretary of the party. Following the increase in violence seen in the [[Burundian unrest (2015–present)|Burundian unrest]], and the murder of party spokesperson [[Patrice Gahungu]], Barampama feared for her life as she said that the UPN was seen as a threat to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burundi: le porte-parole d’un parti d’opposition tué à Bujumbura|newspaper=RFI Afrique|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20150908-burundi-porte-parole-parti-opposition-tue-bujumbura-upd-patrice-gahungu-zedi-feruzi|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=8 September 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mo-nah-se-tah''' or '''Mo-nah-see-tah'''&lt;ref&gt;Recorded to mean "Spring Grass".  The name may possibly be '''''Monâhtseta'e''''', which might mean "Shoot Woman"—"shoot" as in "the young grass that shoots in the spring."

Her father was killed on November 28, 1868, in the [[Battle of Washita River]] when the camp of Chief [[Black Kettle]], of which Little Rock was a member, was attacked by the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th U.S. Cavalry]] under the command of Lt. Colonel (brevet Major General) [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref name="greene-120"&gt;Greene 2004, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Mo-nah-se-tah was among the 53 Cheyenne women and children taken captive by the 7th Cavalry after the battle.&lt;ref name="greene-169"&gt;Greene 2004, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly, according to Captain [[Frederick Benteen]], chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral history, Custer had a sexual relationship with the 18-year-old Mo-nah-se-tah during the winter and early spring of 1868-1869.&lt;ref name="greene-169"/&gt;&lt;ref name="utley-107"&gt;Utley 2001, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Washita battle; Cheyenne oral history alleges that she later bore a second child, fathered by Custer, in late 1869. Custer, however, had apparently become sterile after contracting venereal disease at West Point, leading some historians to believe that the father was really his brother [[Thomas Custer|Thomas]].&lt;ref name="utley-107"/&gt;

==Battle of the Washita==
{{main|Battle of Washita River}}

At daybreak on November 27, 1868, the 7th U.S. Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel George Custer attacked a Cheyenne camp of 51 lodges on the Washita River in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Custer's troops were able to take control of the village quickly, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Greene 2004, pp 116-138.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some women and children were killed, as Custer acknowledged in his report of the battle,&lt;ref name="casualtyestimates"&gt;"In the excitement of the fight, as well as in self-defense, some of the squaws and a few of the children were killed."

One of the scouts, Raphael Romero, was sent to assure those women and children who had remained in their lodges during the attack that they would not be harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Green 2004, pp. 120, 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of fifty-three women and children were taken captive.

==Account by White Cow Bull (Lakota)==
In 1938, Joseph White Cow Bull, an [[Oglala Sioux|Oglala]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] veteran of the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], went with [[David Humphreys Miller]] to the Little Bighorn battlefield and recounted to him his recollections of the battle. Among his recollections:&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Miller, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While we were together in this village [on the [[Little Bighorn River]]], I spent most of my time with the ''Shahiyela'' [Cheyenne] since I knew their tongue and their ways almost as well as my own. In all those years I had never taken a wife, although I had had many women. One woman I wanted was a pretty young ''Shahiyela'' named Monahseetah, or Meotxi as I called her. She was in her middle twenties but had never married any man of her tribe. Some of my ''Shahiyela'' friends said she was from the southern branch of their tribe, just visiting up north, and they said no ''Shahiyela'' could marry her because she had a seven-year-old son born out of wedlock and that tribal law forbade her getting married. They said the boy’s father had been a white soldier chief named Long Hair; he had killed her father, Chief Black Kettle {{sic}}, in a battle in the south [Battle of the Washita] eight winters before, they said, and captured her. He had told her he wanted to make her his second wife, and so he had her. But after a while his first wife, a white woman, found her out and made him let her go.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Miller asked White Cow Bull, "Was this boy still with her here?" and White Cow Bull answered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I saw him often around the ''Shahiyela'' camp. He was named Yellow Bird and he had light streaks in his hair. He was always with his mother in the daytime, so I would have to wait until night to try to talk to her alone. She knew I wanted to walk with her under a courting blanket and make her my wife. But she would only talk with me through the tepee cover and never came outside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nancy Dell'Olio''' (born 23 August 1961) is an Italian-British lawyer who first came to public notice as the girlfriend of [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]].

==Early life==
Dell'Olio was born in New York in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2029983/Nancy-Dell-Olio-showcases-jaw-droppingly-youthful-body-celebrates-50th-birthday.html|title=Nancy Delio ... celebrates 50th birthday|publisher= Daily Mail|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011|location=London|first=Marcus|last=Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; where her mother Antonia was born and her immigrant father ran a series of delicatessens. She is the eldest of four children; when she was five her family moved back to Italy, to the town of [[Bisceglie]] in the [[Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani]] and region of [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jun/08/sport.comment1|title=The Observer Profile: Nancy Dell'Olio – Sven's star striker|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 June 2003|accessdate=14 October 2011|location=London|first=Harriet|last=Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1393777/Nancy-DellOlio-comes-clean-age-takes-Sir-Trevor-Nunn-romantic-break-Italy.html|title='I'm almost 50!'

==Projects==
In 2005, Dell'Olio hosted the show ''Footballers' Cribs'' on MTV. She gave viewers tours of the luxury homes of English football players. "Nancy is a dream signing for us," said series executive producer Sean Murphy. "She's the first lady of football, so is in the perfect position to give us a real insider's view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2005/06/10/nancydellolio |title=Nancy Dell'Olio to peek into footballers' homes |work=Hello! |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Dell'Olio had an autobiography published titled ''My Beautiful Game,'' better known in publishing circles as ''My Life On The Game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/24/biography.features1|title=Nancy scores again – Book review (My beautiful game by Nancy Dell'Olio)|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2007|accessdate=14 October 2011|location=London|first=Lisa|last=O'Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Dell'Olio was interviewed on the BBC news analysis programme ''[[Newsnight]]'' to talk about a new range of lingerie she was launching but, according to interviewer [[Jeremy Paxman]], "I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_vqdRkv7LI |title=Newsnight |date=21 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The programme swiftly moved on to the next item.

In 2011, Dell'Olio took part in the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 9)|ninth series]] of BBC1 show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14809342 | title=Strictly Come Dancing signs up Lulu and Edwina Currie | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | work=BBC News | date=6 September 2011 | accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October, she and partner [[Anton du Beke]] were eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/strictly-come-dancing/8858765/Nancy-DellOlio-knocked-out-of-Strictly-Come-Dancing.html |title=Nancy Dell'Olio knocked out of Strictly Come Dancing |work=The Telegraph |first=Michael |last=Hogan |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Daily Telegraph]] reported that Dell'Olio clod-hopped around the show.  Dell'Olio reported it as "The best season Strictly ever had; everyone say so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/edinburgh-festival/11031284/Nancy-DellOlio-Its-the-job-of-a-woman-to-look-impeccable.html |title=Nancy Dell'Olio: 'It's the job of a woman to look impeccable' |work=The Telegraph |date=14 August 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2012, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' announced that Dell'Olio would begin contributing to its Sunday editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4147345/Your-Sunday-service.html |title=Your Sunday service.

Dell'Olio presented her own one-woman show, co-scripted by comedian Diane Spencer, called Rainbows from Diamonds at Edinburgh Fringe in 2014.

On 5 January 2016, it was revealed that Dell'Olio would be one of the sixteen housemates competing in the [[Celebrity Big Brother 17|seventeenth series]] of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. She entered on Day 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3385311/PICTURED-Strictly-siren-Kristina-Rihanoff-Kim-Kardashian-s-BFF-Jonathan-Cheban-troubled-Danniella-Westbrook-confirmed-Celebrity-Big-Brother.html|title=Strictly siren Kristina Rihanoff, Kim Kardashian's BFF Jonathan Cheban and troubled Danniella Westbrook among 16 stars confirmed for Celebrity Big Brother|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=5 January 2016|first=Lucy|last=Mapstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the second housemate to be evicted on Day 11.

In late January 2016, Dell'Olio was interviewed by the [[Daily Telegraph]], in which she mentioned she was starting her own brand of [[limoncello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/12120751/From-Svens-squeeze-to-start-up-boss-Nancy-DellOlio-on-her-new-limoncello-business.html |title=From Sven's squeeze to start-up boss: Nancy Dell'Olio on her new limoncello business |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=25 January 2016 | location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dell'Olio aimed to start her new company through crowd funding investment, though only €1,865 of the required €70,000 was raised.  The project went ahead.  Dell'Olio's aim was not to be involved in the day-to-day running of the company, but only to act as ambassador for it.

==Charity works==
Dell'Olio has visited [[British Red Cross]] projects in the UK and in Kenya. She stated, "I have always been a great admirer of the principles and values behind the work of the Red Cross. The thing that really impressed me is that the Red Cross seems to go everywhere, more than any other charity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=80098 |title=Nancy Dell'Olio |work=BritishRedCross |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell'Olio is the chairwoman of Truce International, the British-based charity she founded with Eriksson, which aims to use football as a means of uniting people in areas affected by war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truce.net/ Truce – Peace Through The Passion For Football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell'Olio is a member of the [[Accademia Apulia|Accademia Apulia UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accademiapulia.org/en/members/ |title=Members |work=accademiapulia.org |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In May 1998, Dell'Olio  was introduced to [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], the manager of the [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio football team]], and they began a relationship six months later. In 2001, Eriksson became [[England national football team manager|manager of the England team]], and he and Dell'Olio relocated to [[London]]. In early 2002, Eriksson had a short-lived affair with television presenter [[Ulrika Jonsson]], but he returned to  Dell'Olio.

In August 2004, Eriksson had an affair with [[The Football Association]] secretary [[Faria Alam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040809/asp/atleisure/story_3601808.asp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | first=Amit | last=Roy | title=Faria drags Salman into Sven sleaze fest | date=9 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Alam had also had an affair with FA CEO, [[Mark Palios]], when the media got hold of the story, it became high-profile and made leading headlines in newspapers and on television. Dell'Olio was upset but chose to stay with Eriksson. The couple eventually split up in August 2007.

{{As of|2011|May}} Dell'Olio was in a relationship with [[Trevor Nunn|Sir Trevor Nunn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8485598/Sven-Goran-Erikssons-former-lover-Nancy-DellOlio-insists-Im-drawn-to-men-of-passion.html |title=Sven-Goran Eriksson's former lover Nancy Dell'Olio insists: 'I'm drawn to men of passion' |newspaper=The Telegraph |first1=Tim |last1=Walker |first2=Richard |last2=Eden |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the year it was reported the relationship had ended.&lt;ref name=Tlgrph/&gt; In December 2011 she lost a High Court libel action against [[Associated Newspapers]], publishers of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, over an article that referred to her as a "man eater".&lt;ref name=Tlgrph&gt;{{cite news|title=Nancy Dell'Olio loses court action over "man eater" newspaper comments|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8969499/Nancy-DellOlio-loses-court-action-over-man-eater-newspaper-comments..html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Dell'Olio was photographed at a fashion show in [[Hyde Park, London]] with taut new features and not looking like her former self,  five months after she had appeared on Celebrity Big Brother.  In the words of the [[Daily Mirror]], "she looks unrecognisable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/nancy-dellolio-looks-unrecognisable-shows-8092415 | location=Hyde Park, London | work=The Daily Mirror | title=Nancy Dell'Olio looks unrecognisable as she shows off taut features during fashion show | date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Gray Smith Hart''' (c. 1784 – January 23, 1813), often '''Nathaniel G. S. Hart,''' {{efn-ua|Although some sources list Hart's name as "Nathaniel G. T. Hart," this is incorrect according to historian John E. Kleber writing in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia''{{sfn|Kleber|1992||pages=[http://www.kyenc.org/entry/h/HARTN01.html 415–416]}} and to historians David and Jeanne Heidler's ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812''.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2004| |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232–233]}}  Also, Hart is referred to in a court document dating from shortly before his death as "Nathaniel G. S. Hart."{{sfn|Cook|Cummings|1985|page=[http://simpsonhistory.com/notes/thomashart3.html 185]}}  The misnomer apparently dates to a mistake in ''Historical Sketches of Kentucky'', either the Richard Collins edition (published in 1874) or the original edition (published in 1848 by Lewis Collins).{{sfn|Collins|1848|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XFlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 345]}}}} was a [[Lexington, Kentucky]] lawyer and businessman, who served with the state's volunteer militia during the War of 1812. As [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] of the Lexington Light Infantry from Kentucky, Hart and many of his men were killed in the [[River Raisin Massacre#River Raisin Massacre|River Raisin Massacre]] of January 23, 1813, after being taken prisoner the day before following the [[Battle of Frenchtown]] in [[Michigan Territory]].

Hart was especially well-connected politically and socially.  In addition to reading law with [[Henry Clay]], Hart's wife Anna and Clay's wife Lucretia were sisters.  Hart's wife Anna Edward Gist was the stepdaughter of Charles Scott, Governor of Kentucky and through her Hart was also a brother-in-law to James Brown, a future Ambassador to France and to James Pindell - a member of the Society of Cincinnati.  Many other members of Hart's Kentucky militia unit and its associated troops also came from the elite of Lexington and of the state.  The men's deaths in the two Battles of Frenchtown, but especially in the subsequent Massacre captured state and national attention.  The phrase "Remember the Raisin!" became an American call to arms for the duration of the War.

==Personal life==
[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Clay's Law Office|Henry Clay's law office]] in Lexington]]
Nathaniel Hart was one of seven children,{{sfn|Remini|1992|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=f9Hb6i90_mAC&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 29]}} the second son of Colonel Thomas Hart, a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and his wife Susanna (Gray) Hart.{{sfn|Smith|Clay|Clay|1899|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=72gUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232]}}

Originally from [[North Carolina]], the family had moved to [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], where Nathaniel was born. In 1794 they settled in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] as part of the postwar migration west. His father was a highly successful businessman, achieving wealth.  Hart's four sisters married men who achieved some renown: Ann married the future US Senator [[James Brown (Louisiana)|James Brown]] (who subsequently served as [[United States Ambassador to France#United States Ministers Plenipotentiary to France|Minister to France]]); Eliza married the surgeon Dr. Richard Pindell (a member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Militant Surgeon of the Revolution:Some Letters of Richard Pindell, M.D.|journal=Maryland Historical Magazine |publisher=[[Maryland Historical Society]]|date=1922|volume=17-18|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5woSAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA309#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|1992|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3AV5AAAAMAAJ 427]}} Susanna married the lawyer Samuel Price, and Lucretia married [[Henry Clay]], future US Senator and Secretary of State.{{sfn|Clift|2009|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1A3k7Wqaq0wC&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 149–150]}}{{sfn|Connelley|Coulter|1922||page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7DMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 5]}}

Hart attended [[Princeton University|Princeton College]], where his classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario. Elliott's father was a Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War.{{sfn|Berton|2011|page=406}} The two young men were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2004| |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232–233]}}

After Hart's return to Lexington, he [[read law]] under Henry Clay, passed the bar, and set up a law practice in the city.{{sfn|Clift|2009|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1A3k7Wqaq0wC&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 149]}}  Like his father, he became a successful businessman,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2004| |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232–233]}} a ropewalk (hemp rope factory) in the city being among his ventures.

[[File:First Battle of the River Raisin.jpg|thumb|Lewis' River Raisin crossing – First Battle]]
During the [[Battle of Frenchtown#First Battle of the River Raisin|First Battle of Frenchtown]] on January 18, 1813, the American forces under Lt. Colonel William Lewis were successful in forcing the retreat of the small British force stationed there. The British commander of the [[Fort Malden]] garrison in Amherstburg, [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Colonel Henry Procter]],{{sfn|Ramage|Watkins|2011|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4qKA2xglF8C&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 105]}} made plans to take back Frenchtown and he ordered troops to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ridler|first=Jason|title=Henry Procter (Proctor)|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/henry-procter-proctor/|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada|Historica Foundation]]|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of January 22, 1813, Procter's forces, including hundreds of Indian warriors, attacked the American troops and overwhelmed the right flank of regulars under Winchester, forcing him and much of the general staff to surrender. The Kentucky militia under the command of [[George Madison|Major George Madison]] on the left flank fought on and thought the flag of truce presented by the enemy was a British flag of surrender.{{sfn|Coles|1966|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d8ZOFNbhIU0C&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 116]}}  During this second [[Battle of Frenchtown]], 397 Americans were killed.&lt;ref name = "Upton"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Upton|first1=Emory|title=Military Policy of the United States (Military History of the United States)|date=1904|publisher=United State Government|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJYsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gardner|1860|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2flAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA566#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 566]}}  Hart was wounded and was among the 547 survivors&lt;ref name = "Upton"/&gt;{{sfn|Gardner|1860|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2flAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA566#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 566]}} who surrendered to Procter upon orders of Winchester.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2004| |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c09EJgek50C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232–233]}}{{sfn|Ranck|1872|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qidAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 256]}}  Not many more than 30 Kentucky troops escaped death or capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=River Raisin National Battlefield Park - Monroe, Michigan|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/cultural_diversity/River_Raisin_National_Battlefield_Park.html|website=nps.gov|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The dead of our army are still denied the rites of sepulture. ... I was told the hogs were eating them. A gentleman told me he had seen them running about with skulls, arms, legs and other parts of the human system in their mouths. The French people on the Raisin buried Captains Hart, Woolfolk, and some others, but it was more than their lives were worth to have been caught paying this last customed tribute to mortality."&lt;ref&gt;American State Papers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iJUbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 370 (Isaac Baker)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Harris Jouett]], a man who painted noted portraits of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[George Rogers Clark]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], was one of the Kentucky volunteers and among the survivors of the River Raisin Massacre.  The company payroll of $6000 disappeared during the slaughter. Jouett restored the missing funds to the militia, based on his earnings as a painter. He also painted portraits of his fellow soldiers from memory, including Hart and Colonel Allen.{{sfn|Pennington|Miles|2010|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sV12204GZC8C&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 172]}}

==Legacy and honors==
*In 1819, the state of [[Kentucky]] named its 61st county as [[Hart County, Kentucky|Hart County]] in Nathaniel Hart's honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hart County Chamber of Commerce|url=http://hartcountychamber.com/visithart/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=44|accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kentucky Counties Named in Honor of Military Personnel|url=http://kynghistory.ky.gov/people/ky+counties+named+after+military+persons.htm|work=Kentucky: National Guard History eMuseum|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Kentucky]]|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hart was listed among officers on the Kentucky War Memorial in Frankfort Cemetery in the capital of Frankfort.

*In 2009, the [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]] was established, the only such park to commemorate the War of 1812, and one of four battlefield parks in the nation. It had earlier been recognized as a state historic site and was previously listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

A '''''picador''''' ({{IPA-es|pikaˈðoɾ}}; pl. ''picadores'') is one of the pair of [[horse]]men in a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[bullfight]] that jab the bull with a [[lance]]. They perform in the '''''tercio de varas''''' which is the first of the three stages in a Spanish bullfight.

== Function ==

The picador has three main functions:
* To pierce the muscle on the back of the bull’s neck in order to straighten the bull's charge.
* To fatigue the bull’s neck muscles and general stamina as it tries to lift the horse with its head.
* To lower the bull’s head in preparation for the next stage. 

If the public feels that a picador is  better than the bull the public will whistle, boo or jeer as they see fit. This is because they do not want the bull to lose all its strength and energy as this can lead to a dull bullfight.

The picador is obliged to give the bull two lances in a first category bullring ([[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[Sevilla]], [[Zaragoza]] etc.), but the [[matador]] may request that the second be waived in second and third category rings. The bull may receive three lances if it is particularly ferocious.

The aim of the bull to charge the picador is often cited as the biggest test of its courage. A bull that does not charge may be punished with a black ''[[Torero#Banderillero|banderilla]]'', which although somewhat longer than a normal ''banderilla'' is largely symbolic and a mark of shame for the breeder. This is very rare.

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Picador.JPG|thumb|Picador in action]]
Prior to 1928, horses did not wear protection and the bull would on occasion disembowel the horse during this stage. In Seville they retain two teams of ''muleteros'', one to drag out the dead bull and the other to drag out any dead horses (this is now just for tradition). These days the horse is surrounded by a ''peto'', a mattress-like protection that greatly minimizes damage taken.  However, injuries to the horses often include broken ribs and damage to internal organs.

In the original days before bullfighting became recognizable in today's form, the picador was the central attraction and his name would be billed on the promotional flyers. In these bullfights the bull would charge the horse and the spectacle was watching the rider's skill in protecting his horse whilst lancing the bull. The picador would lance the bull as many times as necessary. The matador and other bullfighters were on hand to help the picador, to direct the bull to the picador, and finally to finish off the injured bull. It was not until certain foot bullfighters started to bring some flair to their minor roles, to the pleasure of the crowd, that matadors started to become the main attraction, ultimately relegating the picador to a relatively unpopular and minor function.

'''Robert Ryman''' (born May 30, 1930) is an [[United States|American]] painter identified with the movements of [[monochrome painting]], [[minimalism]], and [[conceptual art]]. He is best known for abstract, white-on-white paintings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phillipscollection.org/exhibitions/2010-06-05-exhibition-robert-ryman.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; He lives and works in New York.

==Early life and career==
Ryman was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. After studying at the [[Tennessee Technological University|Tennessee Polytechnic Institute]], Cookeville, between 1948 and 1949, and at the [[George Peabody College for Teachers]] between 1949 and 1950, Ryman enlisted in the United States army reserve corps and was assigned to an army reserve band during the Korean War.&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"&gt;[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_140.html Guggenheim Museum Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026084819/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_140.html |date=2008-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryman moved to [[New York City]] in 1953, intending to become a professional jazz [[saxophonist]]. He had lessons with pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], which later informed his painting.&lt;ref&gt;Colaizzi, Vittorio (Spring 2007) "'How It Works': Stroke, Music, and Minimalism in Robert Ryman's Early Paintings".  (Spring 2007) ''American Art''. Vol. 21, No. 1. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryman soon took a day job at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] as a security guard to make ends meet, and met the artists [[Sol LeWitt]] and [[Dan Flavin]], who were co-workers with him at MoMA. Immediately after quitting his job at MoMA, Ryman spent the next year working in the art division of the [[New York Public Library]]. He also met artist [[Roy Lichtenstein]] during this period of the 1950s.

Captivated by the newly acquired [[abstract expressionist]] works of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Barnett Newman]], Ryman became curious about the act of painting. From 1953 to 1960, he worked at the MoMA as a guard in order to be close to painting.&lt;ref&gt;Phong Bui, "In Conversation: Robert Ryman with Phong Bui" the Brooklyn Rail, June 2007.http://brooklynrail.org/2007/06/art/ryman&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased some art supplies at local store and began experimenting in his apartment in 1955. That year, Ryman finished what he considers his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled ''Untitled (Orange Painting)'' (1955–59).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diabeacon.org/exhibitions/introduction/94&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryman had a close relationship with the late conservator [[Orrin Riley]], who would frequently give him advice on archival materials, many times testing the acidity of media the artist was interested in using. He has been interviewed by the television writer and producer [[Barbaralee Diamonstein]] twice, once for the book and video production ''[[Inside New York's Art World]]'' in 1979 and again for ''Inside the Art World'' in 1993.

In 1961 the artist married art historian [[Lucy Lippard]]. They had a son together, Ethan Ryman, in 1964, who was a sound engineer and recently began making art. This marriage ended in divorce. He later married artist [[Merrill Wagner]].&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt; Robert Ryman's sons, [[Cordy Ryman]] and [[Will Ryman]] are also artists and currently work in [[New York City]].

==Work==
Ryman is often classified as a [[minimalist]], but he prefers to be known as a "realist" because he is not interested in creating illusions, but only in presenting the materials he has used in compositions at their face value. As he wrote in a statement for a 2010 exhibition at [[Pace Wildenstein]], "I am not a picture painter. I work with real light and space, and since real light is an important aspect of the paintings, it always presents some problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yau|first=John|title=Robert Ryman: Large-small, thick-thin, light reflecting, light absorbing|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=March 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/03/artseen/robert-ryman-large-small-thick-thin-light-reflecting-light-absorbing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of his works feature [[abstract expressionist]]-influenced brushwork in white or off-white paint on square canvas or metal surfaces.  A lifelong experimenter with media, Ryman has painted and/or drawn on canvas, [[linen]], steel, aluminum, [[plexiglas]], lumasite, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], fiberglass, corrugated paper, [[burlap]], newsprint, wallpaper, [[jute]] sacking, fiberplate, a composite material called [[gator board]], feather board, handmade paper, and [[acrilivin]]. He has used painted and/or drawn with oil, acrylic, encaustic, Lascaux acrylic, [[casein]], enamel, pastel, oil pastel, [[graphite]], [[guache]], and enamelac. Ryman has also experimented with printmaking, creating etchings, [[aquatint]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and silkscreens. His most famous quote is "There is never any question of ''what'' to paint only ''how'' to paint."

By the time Ryman began working, older artists like [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Philip Guston]] had already reduced painting to its essences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (1993), [] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Ryman began what he considers his earliest professional work, a largely monochrome painting titled ''Orange Painting'' (1955–59).&lt;ref name="Robert Ryman"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Robert%20Ryman Robert Ryman] Guggenheim Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s he created his ''Classico'' series of compositions consisting of multi-panel paintings on a specific type of paper called Classico. For each work in the series, Ryman attached a configuration of heavy, creamy white sheets of the paper to a wall with masking tape, painted the sheets with a shiny white acrylic paint, removed the tape when the sheets were dry, mounted them on foamcore, and reattached them to the wall. The built-up paint edge tracing the outline of masking tape and the ripped paper left behind give witness to the process of creation. The various works in the Classico series differ in the organization of paper sheets, the configuration of tape traces, and the painted shape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3745 Robert Ryman, ''Classico IV'' (1968)] Guggenheim Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the ''Classico'' works were titled after the type of paper used as a medium, the so-called ''Surface Veil'' works from 1970 were named for the brand of fiberglass upon which the smaller pieces in this group were painted. Some of the 12-foot square paintings from the series were executed not on fiber-glass but on cotton or linen. In each of these works the pigment appears to form a membrane over the support due to the differing degrees of opacity and translucence in the white paint juxtaposed with areas where less of it has been applied, leaving the fabric exposed. These disruptions in the painting’s skin often mark the literal pauses between the artist’s working sessions.

From 1975 until the late 1990s, Ryman affixed his paintings to the wall with metal brackets.  He would design each set of brackets specifically for each piece and have them constructed by a local metals fabricator.

In 2009 he participated in the art project ''Find Me'', by [[Gema Alava]], in company of artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], Merrill Wagner and Paul Kos.&lt;ref name= "findme"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= http://gemaalava.com/work/findme2.htm |title=FIND ME 2.0 |work=[[Gema Alava]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has stated that his paintings' titles are meaningless, and that they only exist as a form of identification.  Ryman actually prefers the term of "name" for a painting instead of a title because he is not creating a picture or making reference to anything except the paint and the materials.  The "names" of paintings often come from the names of art supplies, companies, or are just general words that do not carry much connotation.

==Exhibitions==
Ryman had his first one-man show at [[Paul Bianchini]]'s gallery, New York, in 1967 at the age of 36; his first show in Europe came the following year at the Galerie [[Heiner Friedrich]], Munich. One year later, Ryman was included in ''When Attitudes Become Form'', a seminal exhibition of works by Minimalist and Conceptual artists organized by the [[Kunsthalle Bern]].&lt;ref name="guggenheimcollection.org"/&gt; His first one-man show at a museum was in 1972 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, displaying thirty-eight of Ryman’s works from 1965 to 1972.&lt;ref name="Robert Ryman"/&gt; Ryman's works were represented in [[documenta]]s 5 (1972), 6 (1977), and 7 (1982), in Kassel, in the [[Venice Biennale]] (1976, 1978, 1980), and in the [[Whitney Biennial]] (1977, 1987, 1995). His first retrospective was organized by the [[Stedelijk Museum]], Amsterdam, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diabeacon.org/exhibitions/artistbio/94 Robert Ryman] Dia Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a major touring retrospective of Ryman's paintings was mounted by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Tate Gallery]], including venues such as the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia]] in Madrid, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis.

Robert Ryman is represented by [[Pace Gallery]] in New York, and [[Xavier Hufkens]] in Brussels.

==Collections==
The [[Hallen für Neue Kunst]], a former [[contemporary art]] museum in [[Schaffhausen]], [[Switzerland]] (closed in 2014) had the largest public collection of Ryman's work, permanently exhibiting 29 pieces created from 1959 to 2007. In 2010 Ryman undertook a major reinstallation of his galleries at Hallen für Neue Kunst. Returning to the museum in 2008 — for the first time in 12 years — to revisit the permanent exhibition of his work that was first installed in 1983, he decided to transform the galleries into a “gesamtkunstwerk” — a synthesis, or total experience, composed of 30 paintings from 50 years of work. 

In 2017, Ryman donated 21 painting to the [[Dia Art Foundation]]’s permanent collection, making it the only site with an extensive permanent grouping, featuring works made as early as the late 1950s and continuing up to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (April 12, 2017), [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/arts/design/robert-ryman-minimalist-master-donates-trove-to-dia-art-foundation.htmlRobert Ryman, Minimalist Master, Donates Trove to Dia Art Foundation] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major museums collecting his works include the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; the [[Tate]], London; the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (April 12, 2017), [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/arts/design/robert-ryman-minimalist-master-donates-trove-to-dia-art-foundation.htmlRobert Ryman, Minimalist Master, Donates Trove to Dia Art Foundation] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and reception==
A recipient of numerous honors, Ryman has been awarded a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1973|John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Scholarship]] (1973), the Skowhegan Medal from the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmgallery.com/artists/robert-ryman/ Robert Ryman] L&amp;M Arts, New York/Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] since 1994, and assumed the role of the organization’s Vice President in 2003.&lt;ref name="Robert Ryman"/&gt;

In 2005, Ryman was awarded the [[Praemium Imperiale]].

2009 saw the publication of ''Robert Ryman: Critical Texts Since 1967'', edited by Vittorio Colaizzi and [[Karsten Schubert]] and published by [[Ridinghouse]]. The book charts the gradual evolution of the reception of and reaction to Ryman’s art. A comprehensive selection of over 60 essays and exhibition reviews has been collated into one volume, including texts by some of the most influential art historians and critics: [[Yve-Alain Bois]], [[Donald Kuspit|Donald B. Kuspit]], [[Lucy R. Lippard]] and others.

Ryman's painting ''Bridge'' (1980) sold for $20.6 million at a [[Christie's]] auction in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (April 12, 2017), [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/arts/design/robert-ryman-minimalist-master-donates-trove-to-dia-art-foundation.htmlRobert Ryman, Minimalist Master, Donates Trove to Dia Art Foundation] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robin Berry Janvrin, Baron Janvrin''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|GCVO|QSO|PC}} (born 20 September 1946 in [[Cheltenham]]) was the [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Private Secretary]] to [[Elizabeth II]] from February 1999 to September 2007. 

==Early life==
A native of [[Gloucestershire]], Robin Berry Janvrin is the son of [[Vice-Admiral]] Sir [[Richard Janvrin|Hugh Richard Benest Janvrin]] and Nancy Edyth Fielding. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]], [[Britannia Royal Naval College]], [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] from which he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class]] [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's]] degree in 1969, and of which he was made an Honorary Fellow in 1999. In 1962, he was selected to attend [[Camp Rising Sun (New York)|Camp Rising Sun]] in upstate New York.

==Career==
Janvrin entered the [[Royal Navy]] in 1964, was commissioned as an acting sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44661|pages=9347–9348|date=27 August 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted [[lieutenant]] on 4 March 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=45454|page=9185|date=24 August 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served until 2 July 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=46638|page=9320|date=21 July 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a member of the [[Castaways' Club]]. On leaving the Navy, Janvrin joined the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. He was a [[Second Secretary]] in 1975 and was appointed [[Diplomatic rank|First Secretary]] at the mission to [[NATO]] in 1976. He was officially appointed an Officer of the Diplomatic Service on 7 February 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=47811|page=4500|date=5 April 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janvrin was First Secretary in [[New Delhi]] from 1981 to 1984, during which time he was made a Member of the 4th Class of the [[Royal Victorian Order]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=49569|page=16478|date=13 December 1983}}  Membership of the 4th Class was subsequently renamed so members of this grade became Lieutenants of the order, and were entitled to the [[postnominals]] LVO.&lt;/ref&gt; for services during the [[state visit]] by The Queen to [[India]].

Janvrin was then [[Consul (representative)|Counsellor]] and Deputy Head of Department for the Personnel Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 1985 to 1987.

On 1 June 1987 he was recruited as [[Press Secretary]] to The Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=50942|page=7387|date=9 June 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was initially thought that he would be appointed Assistant Press Secretary.  On 19 October 1990 he became Assistant [[Private Secretary]] to The Queen,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=52306|page=16315|date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996 the Deputy Private Secretary.

'''The Dubliners''' were an [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] band founded in Dublin in 1962 as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group after its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves The Dubliners. The line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career, but the group's success was centred on lead singers [[Luke Kelly]] and [[Ronnie Drew]]. The band garnered international success with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Smiling Seoige sisters |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/dubliners-50year-musical-odyssey-2985040.html |title=Dubliners' 50-year musical odyssey – Music, Entertainment |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 1 December 2012|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band were regulars on the folk scenes in both Dublin and London in the early 1960s, and were signed to the [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] label in 1965 after backing from [[Dominic Behan]]. They went on to receive extensive airplay on [[Radio Caroline]], and eventually appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1967 with hits "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]" (which sold over 250,000 copies in the UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Guida |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_02.htm |title=The Dubliners 1967–1969: It's the Dubliners |publisher=Itsthedubliners.com |date=1 May 1969 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]". Often performing political songs considered controversial at the time, they drew criticism from some folk purists and Ireland’s national broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] had placed an unofficial ban on their music from 1967 to 1971. During this time the band's popularity began to spread across mainland Europe and they appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the United States. The group's success remained steady right through the 1970s and a number of collaborations with [[The Pogues]] in 1987 saw them enter the [[UK Singles Chart]] on another two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/arts/music/barney-mckenna-banjo-player-in-the-dubliners-dies-at-72.html | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi | title=Barney McKenna, Banjo Player in the Dubliners, Dies at 72 | date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dubliners were instrumental in popularising Irish folk music in Europe, though they did not quite attain the popularity of [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] in the United States. They influenced many generations of Irish bands, and their legacy can to this day be heard in the music of artists such as The Pogues, [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Flogging Molly]]. Much adored in their native country, covers of Irish ballads by Ronnie Drew and Luke Kelly tend to be regarded as definitive versions. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland's longest surviving musical act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slacker.com/station/St-Patricks-Day |title=St. Patricks Day Station on Slacker Personal Radio |publisher=Slacker.com |date=28 January 1928 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/--Dubliners-Banjo-Barney-McKenna-dies-over-his-morning-cuppa---VIDEOS-146360025.html |title=Dubliners "Banjo" Barney McKenna dies over his morning cuppa – VIDEOS &amp;#124; Irish News |publisher=IrishCentral |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bljzz |title=BBC Radio 2 – BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, Radio 2 Folk Awards 2012 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubliners announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012, after 50 years of playing, following the death of the last of the founding members, [[Barney McKenna]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/retirement.html |title= The Dubliners: Retirement |publisher=Thedubliners.org |date= |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the surviving members of the group, with the exception of [[John Sheahan]], continued touring under the name of "The Dublin Legends". As of 2018, Seán Cannon is the only former member still in this group, following Eamonn Campbell's death in October 2017.

==Formation and history==
[[File:ODonoghue pub Dublin Ireland.jpg|thumb|O'Donoghue's Pub on Merrion Row, Dublin, where the group played regularly in the early 1960s.]]

===Origins===
The Dubliners, initially known as "The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group", formed in 1962 and made a name for themselves playing regularly in [[O'Donoghue's Pub]] in Dublin. The change of name came about because of [[Ronnie Drew]]'s unhappiness with it, together with the fact that [[Luke Kelly]] was reading ''[[Dubliners]]'' by [[James Joyce]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Its"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Guida |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_01.htm |title=The Dubliners 1962–1966: It's the Dubliners |publisher=Itsthedubliners.com |date= |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members were Drew, Kelly, [[Ciarán Bourke]] and [[Barney McKenna]].&lt;ref name="Thedubliners.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/history.html |title=The Story so far... The Dubliners' History |publisher=TheDubliners.org |date= |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drew, McKenna and Thomas Whelan had originally teamed up for a fundraising concert&lt;ref&gt;''The Dubliners Songbook'', Heathside Music/Wise Publications 1974, Introduction by Eric Winter p.4&lt;/ref&gt; and then went on to work in a revue with the Irish comedian John Molloy at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in Dublin. They used to sing songs between acts.

Before joining the Dubliners full-time, Kelly had spent some time playing at English folk clubs such as the Jug o'Punch in Birmingham, run by the folk singer [[Ian Campbell (folk musician)|Ian Campbell]].

The group played at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1963 and that led to them being featured on a [[BBC]] programme called Hootenanny. The extra exposure helped them to win a contract with Transatlantic Records, with whom they recorded their first album, called simply ''The Dubliners''. They also recorded their first single featuring ''[[Rocky Road to Dublin]]'' and ''[[The Wild Rover]]''.

===Members of the group===
Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play [[Flamenco guitar]], and he accompanied his songs on a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]].&lt;ref name="Its"/&gt; Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995.&lt;ref name="Its"/&gt; Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/08/16/drew-dubliners.html ''Dubliners singer Ronnie Drew dies''], 16 August 2008. Retrieved on 13 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]", his rendition of "[[Finnegan's Wake]]", and "[[McAlpine's Fusiliers]]".

Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string [[banjo]]. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like "[[The Black Velvet Band]]", "[[Whiskey in the Jar]]", "Home Boys Home"; but also [[Phil Coulter]]'s "[[The Town I Loved So Well]]", [[Ewan MacColl]]'s "[[Dirty Old Town]]", "[[The Wild Rover]]", and "[[On Raglan Road|Raglan Road]]", written by the famous Irish poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]]. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ronnie-drew-lead-singer-of-the-dubliners-900669.html |title=Ronnie Drew: Lead singer of the Dubliners – Obituaries – News |publisher=The Independent |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by [[Seán Cannon]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Luke Kelly Dies at Age of 44 | quote = Luke Kelly of the Dubliners died last night in the Richmond Hospital in Dublin.

In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/1102/kellyl.html |title=Council votes to erect Luke Kelly statue – RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date= 2 November 2004|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.

Ciarán Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish ("[[Peigín Leitir Móir|Peggy Lettermore]]", "Preab san Ól"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Mary Hardy | title = The Dubliners Scrapbook | quote = The night of 5 April 1974 was little short of catastrophic.

[[John Sheahan]] and [[Bob Lynch (musician)|Bobby Lynch]] joined the band in 1964.&lt;ref name="Thedubliners.org"/&gt; They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-dubliners-bobby-lynch-dubliner-forever-3730354.html?cat=33 |title=The Dubliners' Bobby Lynch: A Dubliner Forever – Yahoo!

When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Guida |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/bl_01.htm |title=The Dubliners: Bob Lynch – From the Land of Carolan |publisher=Itsthedubliners.com |accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later changes and tours===
[[File:TheDubliners2005.jpg|thumb|The Dubliners in 2005: (l-r) [[Eamonn Campbell]], [[John Sheahan]], [[Barney McKenna]], [[Seán Cannon]], [[Patsy Watchorn]].]]
In 1996 Ronnie Drew quit the band, and [[Paddy Reilly]] came on to replace him. Reilly, a long-time friend of the group, toured with them before on several occasions; he was already a successful solo artist in Ireland, scoring hits with "[[The Fields of Athenry]]" and "[[The Town I Loved So Well]]".

In 2005, Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and [[Patsy Watchorn]] joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with [[The Dublin City Ramblers]]; like Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the five-string banjo.

The band toured Europe every year. A planned tour of Denmark two weeks after the death of McKenna on 5 April 2012 went ahead as planned. From the first show in Copenhagen on 18 April onwards he was replaced by the Irish banjo player [[Gerry O'Connor (banjo player)|Gerry O'Connor]].
In the fall of 2012 the band announced their retirement, effective after their 50th anniversary shows at the end of the year. The Dubliners played their final shows at [[Vicar Street]] in Dublin on 28/29/30 December 2012, and made their final TV appearance in the UK on a pre-recorded New Year's Eve edition of [[Hootenanny (UK TV series)|Jools Holland Annual Hootenanny']] on 31 December. Their last public appearance as the Dubliners was on 27 January 2013 in memory of Barney McKenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/tourdates/tour2013.html |title=Concerts 2013 |publisher=Thedubliners.org |date=30 January 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reunions==
[[File:O'Donoghue's Pubs vægudsmykning.JPG|left|thumb|A wall in O'Donoghue's dedicated to The Dubliners.]]
===25th anniversary===
In 1987, The Dubliners celebrated their 25th anniversary. They recorded a double CD, produced by [[Eamonn Campbell]], long-time friend and guest musician. He introduced them to [[The Pogues]], and their collaboration resulted in a hit with "[[The Irish Rover]]". It reached number 8 in the UK singles charts and number 1 in Ireland. In 1990 their final hit single was "Jack's Heroes/Whiskey in the Jar", again with The Pogues, which reached number 63 in the UK and number 4 in Ireland. Campbell, who plays the guitar on stage, has been touring with the band ever since. [[Christy Moore]], [[Paddy Reilly]] and [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]] also featured on the CD; Moore sings a tribute to Luke Kelly, and McCann sings the song "I Loved the Ground She Walked Upon", written by [[Phil Coulter]] and [[Ralph McTell]]. The following year, to coincide with Dublin's millennial celebrations, [[Radio Telefís Éireann]] produced an hour-long special on the band and the city's influence on their music, titled ''[[The Dubliner's Dublin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkingelephant.co.uk/artists/artist.php?Artist_Ref=22738&amp;Genre_id=all |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421093916/http://www.talkingelephant.co.uk/artists/artist.php?Artist_Ref=22738&amp;Genre_id=all |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 April 2013 |title=The Dubliners |publisher=Talking Elephant |date= |accessdate=4 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===40th anniversary===
In 2002, they temporarily reunited with Ronnie Drew and Jim McCann, for their [[The Dubliners 40 Years Anniversary Tour|40th anniversary tour]]. They made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÉ 1.

After the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and, though he fully recovered, his voice was severely damaged, and he was unable to sing since his illness. Despite this, he regularly acted as [[MC]] at folk gigs, notably at The Dubliners reunion shows, and at the 2006 'Legends of Irish Folk' shows (where he also played guitar in the finale).

[[File:Dubliners Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|350px|The Dubliners performing in Luxembourg, 11 October 2008.]]

===50th anniversary===
The band celebrated their 50th anniversary with an extensive year-long European tour and the release of a live DVD recorded live at [[Dublin]]'s [[Vicar Street]] featuring Chris Kavanagh from the Band "The Legend of [[Luke Kelly]]" as a special guest. The tour continued in the wake of the death of the final founding member [[Barney McKenna]], although the band announced that the final shows of the tour, to be held 28–30 December also at [[Vicar Street]] would be the band's final shows in which the band were joined by former band member [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]].

==Success==

The Dubliners became well known, not just in Ireland but also as pioneers for Irish folk in Europe and also (though less successful) in the United States. Their 1967 recordings of "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]" and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]" were released on the fledgling [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] label, and were heavily promoted on [[pirate radio]] station [[Radio Caroline]]. The result was that both records reached the top 20 in the UK pop charts. A third single, "Maids, When You're Young Never Wed an Old Man" reached number 43 in December 1967. It was their last UK hit single till they recorded with [[The Pogues]] in 1987.

In 1974, Ronnie Drew decided to quit the band, to spend more time with his family. He was replaced with [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]]. Before joining the band McCann had a TV show in the early seventies called ''The McCann man''. He is best known for his incarnations of "[[Carrickfergus (song)|Carrickfergus]]", [[Tommy Makem|Makem's]] "[[Four Green Fields]]", and "[[Lord of the Dance (hymn)|Lord of the Dance]]". He stayed with the band until 1979 when he left to start a solo career; then Ronnie Drew rejoined the band. First Ronnie went to Norway to record two songs in the Norwegian language with the Norwegian band Bergeners.

The Dubliners also gained popularity amongst famous musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and Pink Floyd's drummer [[Nick Mason]], who were all self-proclaimed Dubliners fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/the-dubliners-legends-in-their-own-happy-hour-500749.html |title=The Dubliners: Legends in their own happy hour |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 24 November 2012|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as "The Old Alarm Clock", "[[Foggy Dew (Irish ballad)|The Foggy Dew]]" and "Off to Dublin in the Green". However, the [[The Troubles|conflict]] in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards led them to drop most of these from their repertoire. They resumed performing such songs occasionally towards the end of their career.  They have also recorded satirical protest songs against nuclear weapons such as ''The Button Pusher'' and ''Protect and Survive'', feminist songs such as ''[[Don't Get Married]]'', and socialist songs such as ''[[I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night|Joe Hill]]''.

On 8 February 2012, The Dubliners received a "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the 2012 [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]].

'''Wilhelmina Cole Holladay''' (born October 10, 1922 in Elmira, NY) is an [[United States|American]] art collector and patron, and co-founder of the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Museum of Women in the Arts |url=http://www.nmwa.org/about/history.asp |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Holladay, known as "Billie", graduated with a degree in art history from [[Elmira College]] in 1944 and also studied art at the [[University of Paris]].  After working for the [[United States Air Force]] and the Embassy of [[China]], she married Wallace Holladay. According to a profile in the Washington Post, in the 1940s she was employed as Madame Chiang Kai-shek's social secretary.

==Collection==
The Holladays began collecting art in the 1950s.  On a trip to Europe, they saw and admired paintings by [[Clara Peeters]], and were dismayed to discover that neither Peeters nor any other female artist was mentioned in the leading art texts of the time.  From that point, they began specializing in acquiring significant works by female artists such as [[Élisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], and [[Angelica Kauffman]].

==The National Museum of Women in the Arts==
In 1981, Wilhelmina and Wallace Holladay founded the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], donating their collection of works by female artists.  For the first few years, the collection was housed in the Holladays' home. She had consulted with the art historian [[Ann Sutherland Harris]] regarding long-term placement of her private collection, and Harris suggested she found a museum dedicated to women's art.&lt;ref name="art table"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ann Sutherland Harris|url=http://www.arttable.org/sutherlandharris|website=Art Table: The Leadership Organization for Professional Women in the Visual Arts|publisher=ARTTABLE|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the museum acquired a former [[Masonic]] temple in Washington, D.C. as its permanent facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Neal Parker|first1=Lonnae|title=Holladay founded National Museum of Women in the Arts, now she’s working on its legacy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/holladay-founded-national-museum-of-women-in-the-arts-now-shes-working-on-its-legacy/2014/04/17/0b98f322-c4b5-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_story.html|accessdate=17 January 2017|publisher=The Washington Post|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The museum houses a permanent collection of art, presents changing special exhibitions and performances, maintains a library and research center, publishes exhibition catalogues, and offers educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wilhelmina Cole Holladay|url=https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/wilhelmina-cole-holladay/|publisher=National Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Wilhelmina Holladay was inducted into to the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and was awarded a 2006 [[National Medal of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2006 National Medal of Arts Recipient |url=http://arts.gov/honors/medals/wilhelmina-holladay |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Foremother Award from the National Research Center for Women &amp; Families.  Also in 2006, Wilhelmina Holladay was awarded the [[Légion d’honneur]] by the French Government. In 2005, Holladay received a [http://www.moore.edu/support_moore/visionary_woman_awards Visionary Woman Award] from [[Moore College of Art &amp; Design]]. In 2001 Holladay received a [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award]].

Holladay has authored the book ''A Museum of Their Own: National Museum of Women in the Arts'', published by Abbeville Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holladay|first1=Wilhelmina Cole|title=A Museum of Their Own: National Museum of Women in the Arts|date=2008|publisher=Abbeville Press|isbn=978-0789210036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willi Heinrich''' (August 9, 1920 – July 12, 2005) was a German author.

==Biography==

Willi Heinrich was born in [[Heidelberg]], [[Baden-Württemberg]]. During the Second World War he fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] with the 1st [[Battalion]] 228th [[Jäger (military)|Jäger]] [[Regiment]] of the [[101st Jäger Division]]. Over the course of the war, the 101st Jäger Division suffered seven hundred percent casualties - Heinrich himself was wounded five times.

After the war, Heinrich became a writer; his first novel ''In einem Schloss zu wohnen'', written 1950–1952, went unpublished until 1976, when he was an established novelist. His first commercial novel, ''[[The Willing Flesh|Das Geduldige Fleisch]]'' was published in 1955. The novel is set on the Eastern Front and centres around the conflicts within Heinrich's former unit. An immediate success, the novel was translated to English and published as ''The Willing Flesh'' (1956) by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in the U.K., and as ''Cross of Iron'' (1957) by Bobbs-Merrill in the U.S.  In 1977, [[Sam Peckinpah]] adapted it as the film ''[[Cross of Iron]]'', featuring [[James Coburn]] as the protagonist anti-hero Rolf Steiner.

Though he began as a war [[genre novelist]], Heinrich concentrated in the [[potboiler]] genre of soapy, sexy stories that were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of his books are [[novels]], but ''Erzählungen'' (1985) is an anthology comprising three [[novellas]]: ''Die Freundinnen'', ''Fata Morgana'', and ''Harte Bandagen''. His last book, ''Der Gesang Der Sirenen'' (''The Singing of the Sirens''), was published in 1994.

Willi Heinrich died in Dobel, near [[Karlsruhe]], in 2005.

'''Zofia Potocka''' née ''Clavone'' ({{lang-uk|Софія Костянтинівна Потоцька}}; 11 January 1760 – 24 November 1822) was a Greek slave courtesan and a Russian agent, later a Polish noble. She was famous in contemporary Europe for her beauty and adventurous life. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she was the lover of the Russian commander prince [[Grigory Potemkin]] and acted as an agent in Russian service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore (2006). Potemkin och Katarina den stora – en kejserliga förbindelse (Potemkin: Catherine the Great's Imperial Partner) (in Swedish). prisma. {{ISBN|9789151844978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Compatriots of her time wrote: "She was beautiful as a dream, a child of southern countries. All those who have seen her admire her beauty, igniting a fire in the hearts of men and envy in the eyes of women."

==Life==
===Early life===
Potocka was born in 1760 January 1 (January 11, New Style) in the Turkish city of [[Bursa]] to Constantine Clavone, a poor Greek cattle merchant, and Maria Clavone. In 1772, when Zofia was 12 years old, she moved to the Greek district of [[Phanar]] in [[Constantinople]] with her parents and sisters. 

Around 1775, when Zofia was 15 years old, her father Constantine died under mysterious circumstances. Her mother married an Armenian, who also died. During the great fire in Constantinople, their house burned down. In this difficult time for them, her mother Maria sought support from foreign embassies. 

In May 1777, when Zofia was not yet 17 years old, Maria sold her two daughters to the Polish Ambassador, [[Boskamp Lyasopolskomu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The ambassador was known to procure girls for the Polish king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Learning about their supposed noble origin and seeing the beauty of the girls, the Ambassador agreed to help. The sister were claimed to descent from the noble aristocratic family Pantalisa Mavrokordato, who stemmed from the royal family of Greece and was related by blood to the rulers of Byzantium. 

Zofia and her sister settled in his palace and was given lessons in French. Reportedly, the ambassador kept her as his mistress for a time, and then prostituted her.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Boskamp-Lyasopolsky arranged for her sister to be sold as a wife to a Turkish Pasha,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; but he promised her mother to arrange marriage for Zofia in Europe. 

The Polish Count Major [[Józef Witt]] learned the purpose of the trip and her ancient lineage. He made an offer, bought her from Boskamp-Lyasopolsky and married her in 1779.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 
Józef Witt was the son of the commandant of the fortress Kamianetska, and the couple lived a year in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], before departing for Europe in 1781.

===Europe===
Zofia reportedly made a sensational success when being introduced to the aristocracy by her spouse in the drawing room receptions of Europe in the palaces of Berlin and Hamburg, Vienna, Rome, Venice and, most famously, in Paris. She was celebrated as "The most beautiful woman in Europe" and known for her expression: "My eyes aches".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
Her beauty and admired ability to improvise herself out of difficult situations resulted in an admiration and love affairs with several of the most powerful personalities of Europe at the time, which attracted a lot of attention. She was regarded as fashionable decoration at every party in high society in the cities they visited and was courted by monarchs and ministers. 
  
At the beginning of their European tour, the couple visited Warsaw. In early March 1781, she was called to court to be introduced to King Stanislas Augustus. After Warsaw, they visited Berlin, where Zofia was introduced to the King of Prussia Frederick II. In the resort town of Spa, Zofia was introduced to the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was reportedly so fascinated and impressed by her that he ordered [[Mozart]] to compose music on the Turkish harem theme. 
In one of his letters to his sister, the French queen Marie Antoinette, Joseph II recommended the Witte couple to her. 

Zofia saw [[Marie Antoinette]] at [[Petit Trianon]], which at that time was being rebuilt in a landscaped park. This was possibly what Zofia was inspired to create a similar park. Reportedly, Marie Antoinette was charmed by her and spoke of her as her adopted daughter. During her stay in Paris, Zofia became the lover of both of the French king's brothers; the Count of Provence, later King Louis XVIII, and the Comte d'Artois, the future French king Charles X respectively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  

On November 17, 1781 Zofia gave birth in Paris to a son. When this news reached the Polish king, she personally visited Kamianets and congratulated her father-in-law Josef Witt with the birth of a grandson, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant General and volunteered to be the godfather of the newborn. 

===Russia===
In 1782, the couple returned to Kamianets visiting Vienna, Moravia, Slovakia and Galicia on the way. In 1785, her spouse Joseph Witte succeeded his father as commandant of Kamianets-Podilskyi, making Zofia first lady of Podolia. 

During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]], she entered a relationship with the Russian Prince Potemkin, the commander of Catherine the Great, which lasted until his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; At least during the [[Battle of Khotyn (1788)|Siege of Khotyn]], her spouse managed Potemkin's net of agents in Southern Poland and his spy contacts within Chotin: in practice, however, these contacts were likely managed by, or at least with the assistance of Zofia, whose elder sister was married to the Turkish pasha of Chotin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Potemkin appointed her spouse governor of [[Kherson|Cherson]], and gave Zofia the informal task of managing the Turkish-Polish relations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1791, she accompanied Potemkin to Saint Petersburg, where she was introduced to the nobility as his official mistress.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Later life===
In February 1796, Zofia arrived in Uman and announced her divorce from Jozef De Witte. In April 17, 1798, in Tulchin, she remarried [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]], who had divorced his wife in order to marry her. The wedding ceremony was conducted with the participation of the Orthodox priest and Catholic priest in an Orthodox Church. 

During her second marriage, Zofia had three sons; Alexander (born in 1798), Mieczyslaw (born in 1800) and Boleslaw (born in 1805), and two daughters; Sophia, and [[Olga Potocka|Olga]] (1802-1861). During the marriage, she also had an affair with her stepson, [[Szczęsny Jerzy Potocki]], who may have been the biological father of her son Boleslaw.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She also had an affair with the Russian governor, [[Nikolai Novosiltsov]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki indulged in mysticism and came under the influence of Polish "Illuminati" and died in March 15, 1805, without having time to say goodbye to her. 
As a widow, she was by law only entitled to her [[dowry]] and a small portion of the fortune of her late spouse, which would have had a bad effect on her economy as she had brought no dowry to the marriage; however, she managed to inherit almost all of the fortune of her late spouse with the assistance of her stepson and the Russian governor, both of whom were her lovers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

As a widow, Zofia reportedly occupied herself with the upbringing of her children and charitable activities. Looking back on her time in Russia, she described Potemkin as a brother.

===Death===
In the early 1820s, she experienced a deteriorated health. Reportedly, the mysticism of the Polish Illuminati was suspected to have affected her health. She left for [[Berlin]] to consult German doctors, where she died. 

She left instructions to be buried Uman. Zofia's embalmed body was clothed in a beautiful dress and placed in a carriage, in one hand a bouquet and in the other a fan. Her body was transported in such a way across the border. In Uman, an elaborate funeral ceremony was conducted out of respect pfor the charity of her last years. When the Zofia's coffin was carried 10 miles along the road, barrels of resin were placed for lighting torches, lighting the way as the procession passed the night before a huge crowd. 

Zofia was buried in the crypt under the Basilian church. In 1877, the body was disturbed as the church was badly damaged by an earthquake. Zofia's remains were reburied in [[Talne]] with those of her youngest daughter Olga, where they still rest in the crypt of the church.

Zofia Potocka died in on 24 November 1822, aged 62.
