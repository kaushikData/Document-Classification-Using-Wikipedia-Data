'''Allegations of a support system in Pakistan for Osama bin Laden''' have been made both before and after [[Osama bin Laden]] was found living in a [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Abbottabad]], [[Pakistan]] and was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|killed]] by a team of United States Navy SEALs on 2 May 2011. The compound itself was located just half a mile from Pakistan's premier military training academy [[Pakistan Military Academy|Kakul Military Academy]] (PMA) in Abbottabad.&lt;ref name="What Pakistan Knew"&gt;{{cite news |author =Carlotta Gall |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/what-pakistan-knew-about-bin-laden.html?_r=1 |title=What Pakistan Knew About Bin Laden |date= March 19, 2014 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1384861/Osama-Bin-Laden-dead-Obama-says-compound-raid-longest-40-minutes-life.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Osama Bin Laden dead: Obama says compound raid was 'longest 40 minutes of my life' &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=May 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |location=London |first1=Neil |last1=Sears |first2=Tim |last2=Shipman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of bin Laden's death, US-President [[Barack Obama]] asked Pakistan to investigate the network that sustained bin Laden.&lt;ref name="bbc20110508"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13328083|title=US presses Pakistan on Bin Laden|date=May 8, 2011|work=BBC|accessdate=May 8, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110509033038/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13328083| archivedate= 9 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan," Obama said in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview with [[CBS News]]. He also added that the United States was not sure "who or what that support network was."&lt;ref name="bbc20110508"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; In addition to this, in an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]] stated that US-officials did not alert Pakistani counterparts to the raid because they feared the terrorist leader would be warned.

According to [[Fred Burton (security expert)|Fred Burton]], vice-president of the global intelligence firm [[Stratfor]], officials of ISI, Pakistani military, along with one retired Pakistani military general, had knowledge of the arrangements made for bin Laden and the safe house. Bin Laden's compound was razed that day at his Abbottabad safe house.&lt;ref name=Rnews /&gt;

[[David Ignatius]] in ''[[Washington Post]]'' referred to the claim of the former ISI chief General [[Ziauddin Butt]] that the [[Abbottabad]] compound was used by the Intelligence Bureau and noted that a report in the Pakistani press in December had quoted him as saying that Osama's stay at Abbottabad was arranged by Brigadier (retired) [[Ijaz Shah]], senior ISI officer and the head of the [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)|Intelligence Bureau]] during 2004–2008, on [[Pervez Musharraf]]'s orders.&lt;ref name="Wpost2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan and Osama bin Laden|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-did-pakistan-know-about-bin-laden/2012/02/16/gIQAccLhKR_story.html|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|first=David|last=Ignatius|date=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Butt denied making any such statement.&lt;ref name="Ashraf Javed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ijaz Shah to sue Ziauddin Butt|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/16-Feb-2012/ijaz-shah-to-sue-ziauddin-butt|accessdate=14 November 2012|newspaper=The Nation|date=16 February 2012|author=Ashraf Javed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402072120/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/16-Feb-2012/ijaz-shah-to-sue-ziauddin-butt|archive-date=2012-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics cited the very close proximity (800 yards) of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound (a custom-built luxury complex) to the Pakistan's National [[Pakistan Military Academy|Military Academy]] (PMA), Pakistan's "[[West Point]]",&lt;ref name=Rnews&gt;{{cite news|title=REVEALED!

US-government files leaked by [[WikiLeaks]] disclosed that American diplomats were told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time US-forces approached. Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) also helped smuggle al Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight [[NATO]] troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the [[government of Tajikistan]] had told US-officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.

The CIA Director and the [[US Secretary of Defense|US defense secretary]] [[Leon Panetta]] stated that Pakistan was "either involved or incompetent."&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/08/pakistan.us.relations|title=Pakistan questions need answers, top Obama aide says|publisher=CNN |date=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview to CBC television, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously the concern has always been how could a compound like this, how could bin Laden be in an area where there were military establishments, where we could see the military operating and not have them know.&lt;ref name=Defense /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Regarding the US decision to withhold intelligence about the raid from Pakistan, he said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The concern we had is that...we had provided intelligence to them with regards to other areas and unfortunately, for one way or another, it got leaked to the individuals we were trying to go after, so as a result of that we were concerned that if we were going to perform a sensitive mission like this, we had to do it on our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-04-02/news/31275256_1_abbottabad-bin-laden-leon-panetta |title=Pakistan considers India as 'threat' but US differs: Leon Panetta |work=Economic Times |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Talking about the support network Panetta stated that some "lower rank" officers in the military knew where Bin Laden was hiding. The defense secretary said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, you know, these situations sometimes, the leadership within Pakistan {{sic}} is obviously not aware of certain things and yet people lower down in the military establishment find it very well, they've been aware of it, ...But bottom line is that we have not had evidence that provides that direct link.&lt;ref name=Defense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5006 |title=News Transcript: CBC Television Interview with Secretary Panetta |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Husain Haqqani]] the former-[[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States]], who earlier said both countries "cooperated in making sure" that the operation leading to bin Laden's death was "successful",&lt;ref name=BLOG/&gt; has admitted that Osama bin laden indeed had a support system in Pakistan, albeit without the Pakistani government being privy to this fact.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, bin Laden did have a support system (in Pakistan). The issue was that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan or within the society of Pakistan, ...We all know that there are people in Pakistan who share the same belief system as bin Laden and other extremists... So that is a fact, that there are people who probably protected him... We did not know. We had no knowledge [about Bin Laden]. And if we had knowledge, we would have acted upon it long ago" —Mr. Haqqani said in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/osama-bin-laden-had-support-system-in-pakistan-envoy/784968 |title=Osama Bin Laden had support system in Pakistan: envoy |publisher=Indian Express |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Pakistani official, speaking anonymously, said "We assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace" and that "we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong."&lt;ref name=BLOG&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/obama-to-make-statment-tonight-subject-unknown/|title=U.S. troops kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan|publisher=CNN|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505205323/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/02/obama-to-make-statment-tonight-subject-unknown/ |archivedate=5 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Nick Paton|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-02/world/bin.laden.pakistan.role_1_intelligence-official-bin-tribal-region/2?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Official: Pakistan had but didn't probe data that helped make raid|publisher=CNN|date= May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|Senate Homeland Security Committee]], said "This is going to be a time of real pressure on Pakistan to basically prove to us that they didn't know that bin Laden was there". [[John O. Brennan]], Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan. He further stated: "People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight. We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long." Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] said that "it's hard for me to understand how the Pakistanis ... would not know what was going on inside the compound", and that top Pakistan officials may be "walking both sides of the street." Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] questioned, "How could [bin Laden] be in such a compound without being noticed?", raising suspicions that Pakistan was either uncommitted in the fight against Islamist militants or was actively sheltering them while pledging to fight them. A Pakistani intelligence official said that they had passed on raw phone tap data to the United States that led to the operation, but had failed to analyze this data themselves.  [[Carl Levin]] who is chairman [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] stated that he believes Pakistani officials knew the location of bin Laden and had "no doubt" they also know the location of other senior al-Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref name="ET20110506"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/163192/pakistan-government-knew-where-osama-was-carl-levin/|title=Pakistan government knew where Osama was: Carl Levin|date=May 6, 2011|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Pakistan's intelligence and army have "got a lot of explaining to do," given that bin Laden was holed up in such a large house with surrounding buildings, the fact that its residents took the unusual step of burning their garbage and avoiding any trash collection.&lt;ref name="recordnet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110503/A_NEWS/110509976 |title=Pakistan's president denies harboring bin Laden |publisher=Recordnet.com |date= |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated, "It's hard to imagine that the military or police did not have any ideas what was going on inside of that."&lt;ref name="recordnet1"/&gt; After the raid, the US asked that Pakistan identify its top intelligence operatives as it tried to establish if any of them had contact with bin Laden in the last few years.&lt;ref name="NYT20110606"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/asia/07policy.html|title=Probing Link to Bin Laden, U.S. Tells Pakistan to Name Agents|last=Cooper|first=Helene|date=May 6, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507033121/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/07/world/asia/07policy.html |archivedate=7 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mosharraf Zaidi]], a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, "It seems deeply improbable that bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2011/0502/Osama-bin-Laden-killed-near-Pakistan-s-West-Point.-Was-he-really-hidden|title=Osama bin Laden killed near Pakistan's West Point. Was he really hidden?|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WikiLeaks]] had revealed that a US diplomatic dispatch told the Americans that "many" inside Pakistan knew where bin Laden was. The document stated that "In Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden wasn't an invisible man, and many knew his whereabouts in North Waziristan, but whenever security forces attempted a raid on his hideouts, the enemy received warning of their approach from sources in the security forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=184186|title=Pak security always tipped off Osama|work=Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Indian Minister for Home Affairs]] [[P.

In October 2011, former Pakistani Army Chief, General [[Ziauddin Butt]] has asserted that Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the [[Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan]] (2004–2008), Brigadier [[Ijaz Shah]]. According to him, this had occurred with the "full knowledge" of former army chief General [[Pervez Musharraf]] and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General [[Ashfaq Pervez Kayani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McDermott |first=Roger |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?cHash=b3da5dd4a1af2664ec4821b405dae77b&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38819 |title=The Jamestown Foundation: Former Pakistan Army Chief Reveals Intelligence Bureau Harbored Bin Laden in Abbottabad |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a police report dated Jan. 17, 2012 Osama Bin Laden's youngest wife Amal Ahmad Abdul Fatah claims that except for the eight or nine months just after 9/11, Laden skipped from home to home in Peshawar, [[Swat District|Swat]] and Haripur, Pakistan before settling in Abbottabad for about the last six years of his life.&lt;ref name=TDive&gt;{{cite news|title=Osama Bin Laden hid in Pakistan, not caves, for decade says wife|url=http://truthdive.com/2012/04/01/osama-bin-laden-hid-in-pakistan-not-caves-for-decade-says-wife.html|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=Truth Dive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, the then-president Musharraf emphatically denied bin Laden was in Pakistan, stating "One thing is very sure, let me assure you, that we are not going to hide him for a rainy day and then release him to take advantage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title=The Search For Bin Laden| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/23/60minutes/main881268.shtml| series=[[60 Minutes]]|

The Pakistani foreign office issued a statement that "categorically denies" media reports that Pakistan's leadership, "civil as well as military, had any prior knowledge of the US operation against Osama bin Laden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-laden-killed-us-probes-pakistan-support/story?id=13516775|title=Osama Bin Laden Killed: U.S. Intelligence Probes Possible Pakistani Support System|author =Brian Ross|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's former president [[Pervez Musharraf]] denied that officials in his country were responsible, calling bin Laden's presence in Pakistan a "blunder". Musharraf said instead that there was a possibility that rogue lower-level members of Pakistan's intelligence and military may have had knowledge of bin Laden's location. He conceded they might have known during the last year of his presidency six years ago, and said there ought to be an investigation.

{{quote|"It's really appalling that he was there and nobody knew. I'm certainly appalled that I didn't know and that intelligence people from that time onward didn't know for 6 years that he was inside. And there is no excuse for this great, massive slip-up. And an investigation is in order and people must be punished for this big lapse."

"As a policy, the army and the ISI fighting terrorism and extremism, al Qaeda, Taliban. But rogue element within is a possibility," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title=Musharraf: If U.S. Alienates Pakistan, They Will "Lose"| url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-president-pervez-musharraf-concedes/story?id=13572519| series=[[ABC World News]]| credits= Correspondent: [[Christopher Cuomo]], Producer: Eamon McNiff| network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]| airdate=May 11, 2011| accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of Pakistan's powerful Directorate of [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), conceded that Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan had been an "intelligence failure" but denied his ISI could have had any role in hiding Bin Laden. "If we had shielded Osama bin Laden, why would we have killed and arrested so many al-Qaeda leaders?" he stated "Would we have hidden such a large target in such an exposed area? Without any guards or escape route?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20110514/wl_time/08599207141200|title=Berating General Pasha: Pakistan's Spy Chief Gets a Tongue-Lashing|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up by Pakistani authorities ==
Regardless of Pakistan's claims about their previous conduct, many outside observers have raised ongoing concerns that most of the people jailed by them since Bin Laden's killing have been those who were trying to help capture him, rather than those who helped shield him.&lt;ref name=Wpost&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani doctor who helped CIA hunt for bin Laden sentenced to prison for treason|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistani-doctor-who-helped-capture-bin-laden-sentenced-to-prison-for-treason/2012/05/23/gJQApFVGkU_story.html|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|first1=Richard|last1=Leiby|first2=Peter|last2=Finn|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18175964|title=Pakistan jails doctor who helped CIA find Bin Laden|publisher=BBC | date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such incident would be when doctor [[Shakil Afridi]] who assisted the CIA in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was arrested several weeks after the killing of bin Laden. A Pakistani court imposed a 33-year sentence on the doctor. The doctor was eventually tried under a tribal judicial system that denies the accused the right to have an attorney or to present evidence. According to ''Washington post'', the Doctor could have received the death penalty if he had been tried under normal Pakistani law.&lt;ref name=Wpost/&gt;

″It is now indisputable that militancy in Pakistan is supported by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence). Pakistan's fight against militancy is bogus. It's just to extract money from America,″ Dr Shakil Afridi stated in an interview with [[Fox News]]. He was interviewed from inside [[Peshawar]] Central Jail, where he is being held by Pakistani authorities. According to his statements, the Pakistani authorities said, 'The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians,' and he suffered ′crippling torture′ and ′psychological abuse′ during the 12 months he was held by Pakistani spy agency for helping the US. He further revealed the fact that the ISI is in collusion with terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/09/10/exclusive-jailed-doc-who-helped-nail-bin-laden-warns-us-seen-as-pakistan-worst/ |title=Jailed doc who helped nail Bin Laden warns Pakistan sees US as 'worst enemy' |publisher=Fox News |date= September 10, 2012|accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbottabad Commission report==
{{Main|Abbottabad Commission Report}}

A judge-led inquiry set up by Pakistani government in 2011, based on interviews with 201 sources found there was evidence of incompetence at every level in the Pakistan's intelligence and security services and it did not rule out the involvement of rogue elements within the Pakistani intelligence service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-pakistan-binladen-idUSBRE96714L20130709 | work=Reuters | title=Bin Laden's life on the run revealed by Pakistani inquiry | date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 336-page [[Abbottabad Commission Report]], obtained in July 2013 by [[Al Jazeera]], blasted Pakistan's civilian and military leadership for "gross incompetence" over the bin Laden affair.  It found that by 2005, Pakistani intelligence was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture.  The report called the handling of the bin Laden situation a "natural disaster" and even called on the leadership to apologize to the people of Pakistan for their "dereliction of duty."  Al Jazeera reported that the government's intention in conducting the inquiry was likely aimed at "regime continuance, when the regime is desperate to distance itself from any responsibility for the national disaster that occurred on its watch" and was likely "a reluctant response to an overwhelming public and parliamentary demand."  Lack of intelligence on bid Laden's nine-year residence in the country was blamed on "Government Implosion Syndrome."  Lack of knowledge of a CIA support network without Pakistan being aware was "a case of collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military, and intelligence leadership."  Although the report focused on the night of the raid, it had other findings.  One was that bin Laden had been living in Pakistan since 2002, after surviving the [[Battle of Tora Bora]].  Another was that he and some family members moved into the compound in Abbottabad in 2005, the same year Pakistani intelligence stopped independently looking for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20130708/NEWS08/307080036/Leaked-Pakistan-report-details-bin-Laden-s-secret-life Leaked Pakistan report details bin Laden's secret life] – Militarytimes.com, 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anal expulsiveness''' is the state of a person who exhibits cruelty, emotional outbursts, disorganization, self-confidence, artistic ability, generosity, rebelliousness and general carelessness.&lt;ref name="Sharan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kosslyn|first=S.|authorlink=Stephen Kosslyn|others=Rosenberg, R.|year=2004|title='Psychology: The brain, the person, the world|edition=2nd|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Pearson Education|ISBN=978-0-205-37609-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] theory claims the [[anal stage]] follows the [[oral stage]] of infant/early-childhood development. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions, a time of [[toilet training]].  For a child in this stage of development, control of [[bowel movements]] is the stage at which the child can express autonomy by withholding, refusing to comply, or soiling himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magnavita|first=Jeffrey J.|title=Theories of Personality: Contemporary Approaches to the Science of Personality|page=90|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2002|ISBN=0-471-37890-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2E3aXMMHoFQC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Anal+expulsive&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Q1XMTOfjDY3rOabm9bAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Anal%20expulsive&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with [[bullying]] parents regarding [[toilet training]] can produce a [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] in this stage, which can manifest itself in adulthood by a continuation of erotic pleasure in defecation.&lt;ref name="Sharan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharan|first=A.K.|title=

A barcarolle is characterized by a rhythm reminiscent of the gondolier's stroke, almost invariably in 6/8 meter at a moderate tempo.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Harvard Dictionary of Music |editor-first=Don |editor-last=Randel |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1986 |isbn=0-674-61525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the most-famous barcarolles are from the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period, the genre was known well enough in the 18th century for [[Charles Burney|Burney]] to mention, in ''The Present State of Music in France and Italy'' (1771), that it was a celebrated form cherished by "collectors of good taste".&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{cite book |article=Barcarolle |first=Maurice |last=Brown |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |editor-first=Stanley |editor-last=Sadie |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |date=1980 |isbn=1-56159-174-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==

The barcarolle was a popular form in opera, where the apparently artless sentimental style of the folklike song could be put to good use. In addition to the Offenbach example: [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] wrote [[aria]]s that were barcarolles; [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] set the Venetian scene at the opening of ''[[Marino Faliero (opera)|Marino Faliero]]'' (1835) with a barcarolle for a gondolier and chorus; and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] included a barcarolle in ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' (i.e., Richard's atmospheric "Di’ tu se fidele il flutto m’aspetta" in Act I).&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; The [[Canzone Napoletana|traditional Neapolitan]] barcarolle "[[Santa Lucia]]" was published in 1849.

[[Arthur Sullivan]] set the entry of Sir Joseph Porter's barge (also bearing his sisters, cousins and aunts) in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' to a barcarolle, as well as the Trio "My well-loved lord and guardian dear" among Phyllis, Earl Tolloller and the Earl of Mountararat in Act I of ''[[Iolanthe]]''.   [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], while not using the name specifically, used a style reminiscent of the barcarolle in some of his most-famous songs, including especially his haunting "[[Auf dem Wasser zu singen]]" ("To be sung on the water"), D.774.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Other notable barcarolles include: the three "Venetian Gondola Songs" from [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Songs Without Words]]'', Opp. 19, 30 and 62; the "June" barcarolle from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Seasons (Tchaikovsky)|The Seasons]]''; [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]]'s "Barcarolle" from the Op. 65 ''Troisième recueil de chants''; [[Béla Bartók]]'s "Barcarolla" from [[Out of Doors (Bartók)|''Out of Doors'']]; Barcarolle, Op. 27, no. 1, by [[Moritz Moszkowski]], and several examples by [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Mily Balakirev]], [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Edward MacDowell]], [[Mel Bonis]], [[Ethelbert Nevin]]; and a series of thirteen for solo piano by [[Gabriel Fauré]].&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

In the 20th century, further examples include: [[Agustín Barrios]]'s ''Julia Florida''; the second movement of [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]]'s Trio No. 2 (1915) (which contains a Berceuse-Barcarolla); the first movement of [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''Napoli'' suite for solo piano (1925); [[George Gershwin]]'s ''Dance of the Waves'' (1937, unpublished); [[Ned Rorem]]'s three Barcarolles for piano, composed in Morocco (1949); the first movement of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]]'s Piano Sonata no. 8, op. 83 (1949); "The Kings' Barcarolle" from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' (1956); and "Agony" from [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Into the Woods]]''.

A '''boomkin''' is a short [[spar (sailing)|spar]] that may project either fore or aft on a sailing vessel, depending on its function.  Traditionally, it was a strong, usually wooden spar extending forward over the bow of a Western [[sailing ship]] holding a [[Block (sailing)|block]] through which the tack of the foresail was passed; on some modern sailing yachts with long main booms it is a short spar extending aft from the stern anchoring a central [[backstay]].&lt;ref name=Goodwin&gt;{{Cite book

Historically, boomkins were employed in pairs, one on either side of the vessel, often canted downwards over the main head-rail.  Originally butted at their inboard ends against a [[Glossary of nautical terms#K|knighthead]], bolting prevailed since the end of the 18th century.

They are not to be confused with [[cathead]]s, heavy wooden beams on either side of a traditional vessel's bow angled forward at roughly 45 degrees which support the ship's anchors when being raised or lowered.

==History==
Traditional boomkins found on English sailing vessels gradually evolved from 1710 until around 1850.&lt;ref name=Goodwin/&gt;

*1710-1730 CE: The first boomkins were generally {{convert|6|ft}} to {{convert|8|ft}} long, usually square in cross section, untapered, at one inch in width per foot of length.
*1730-1780 CE: The boomkin grew longer, with an octagonal inboard end and a circular outboard end tapering to 3/4ths its initial diameter by its tip.
*1780-1805 CE: The boomkin often became circular in cross section from base to tip.
*1805 CE: The boomkin's inboard end was made half-round and generally bolted to rather than butted against the knighthead.  An iron band with eyelets for (typically three) boomkin [[shrouds]] was also introduced.
*1825 CE: The boomkin reverted to being square-edged, usually one inch wider than it was high. It also gained an additional eyelet for securing a slip.
*1850 CE and beyond: The boomkin began to appear at a vessel's [[stern]] to provide either an attachment point for a [[backstay]] or the [[Sheet (sailing)|sheet]] of sail flown from a [[Mast (sailing)|mizzen]] mast.
*1967: Drascombe Lugger yawls designed with boomkins as an attachment point for sail flown from the mizzen.

'''Brainwashing''' (also known as '''mind control''', '''menticide''', '''coercive persuasion''',  '''thought control''', '''thought reform''', and '''re-education''') is the concept that the [[human mind]] can be altered or controlled by certain [[psychological]] techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject’s ability to [[think]] critically or independently,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Religion, Volume 2, Gyan Publishing House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into the subject’s mind,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary, Robert Jean Campbell, Oxford University Press, USA, 2004, page 403&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to change his or her attitudes, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Psychology, Raymond J. Corsini, Psychology Press, 2002, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kowal, D. M. (2000). Brainwashing. In A. E. LOVE (Ed.), Encyclopedia of psychology, vol. 1 (pp. 463-464). American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10516-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The concept of brainwashing was originally developed in the 1950s to explain how the [[Chinese government]] appeared to make people cooperate with them. Advocates of the concept also looked at [[Nazi Germany]], at some criminal cases in the United States, and at the actions of [[Human trafficking|human traffickers]]. It was later applied by [[Margaret Singer]], [[Philip Zimbardo]] and some others in the [[anti-cult movement]] to explain conversions to some [[new religious movement]]s and other groups. This resulted in [[scientific]] and [[legal]] debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Stuart|title=Media Coverage of Unconventional Religion: Any "Good News" for Minority Faiths?|journal=Review of Religious Research|date=December 1997|volume=39|issue=2|pages=101–115|doi=10.2307/3512176|jstor=3512176}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Eileen Barker]], [[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]], and other scholars, as well as legal experts, rejecting at least the popular understanding of brainwashing.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

Gordon Melton |title=Brainwashing and the Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton.htm |publisher=CESNUR: Center for Studies on New Religions |date=10 December 1999 |accessdate=5 September 2009 |quote=Since the late 1980s, though a significant public belief in cult-brainwashing remains, the academic community-including scholars from psychology, sociology, and religious studies-have shared an almost unanimous consensus that the coercive persuasion/brainwashing thesis proposed by Margaret Singer and her colleagues in the 1980s is without scientific merit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other views have been expressed by scholars including: [[Dick Anthony]], [[Robert Cialdini]], [[Stanley A. Deetz]], [[Michael J. Freeman]], [[Robert Jay Lifton]],  [[Joost Meerloo]], [[Daniel Romanovsky]], [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]], [[Louis Jolyon West]], and [[Benjamin Zablocki]]. The concept of brainwashing is sometimes involved in legal cases, especially regarding [[child custody]]; and is also a major theme in [[science fiction]] and in criticism of modern [[political]] and  [[corporate culture]].  Although the term appears in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) of the American Psychiatric Association&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/DSM-5|title=DSM-5|last=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not accepted as [[scientific fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bvem38QO9y0C|publisher = Routledge|date = 2012-12-06|isbn = 9781134636969|language = en|first = Frank|last = Usarski|page = 238|quote = ...there has been until now a lack of any convincing scientific evidence which can be applied in a generalised form to show that involvement in a New Religious Movement has any destructive consequences for the psyche of the individual concerned. ...

Thus, up to the time of writing, there has not been one single successful, legal conviction of the Scientology Church, even though this group has come to be regarded as the most dangerous of the new religious organisations. ...

For example, {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心脏病|xīn zàng bìng]]}} means [[Cardiovascular disease]], but {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:心理医生|xīn lǐ yī shēng]]}} means [[psychologist]], and {{lang|zh-Latn|[[:zh:市中心|shì zhōng xīn]]}} means [[Central business district]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the earliest known English-language usage of the word "brainwashing" in an article by newspaperman [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]], in ''Miami News'', published on 24 September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken [[Anti-communism|anticommunist]] and was said to be a [[CIA]] agent working undercover as a journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |authorlink=John D.

The U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine  confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including [[Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War|biological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. [[Mark W. Clark]] asserted:&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/02/24/93602632.pdf "Clark Denounces Germ War Charges", 24 February 1953], accessed 16 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want .... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.''

Beginning in 1953, [[Robert Jay Lifton]] interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the [[Korean War]] as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton's 1961 book ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China]]'', was based on this research.)&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Wilkes ''Knowledge in Minds'', p. 323, Psychology Press, 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-86377-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lifton found that when the  POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of "brainwashing."&lt;ref name="Home_by_Ship"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Home by Ship: Reaction Patterns of American Prisoners of War Repatriated from North Korea |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=April 1954 |first=Robert J. |last=Lifton |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=732–739 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/110/10/732 |accessdate=2008-03-30 |pmid=13138750 |doi=10.1176/ajp.110.10.732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled ''Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War'', which called brainwashing a "popular misconception".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = U.S Department of the Army | authorlink = | title = Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War. |publisher =U.S Gov't Printing Office | series = | volume = | edition =Pamphlet number 30-101 | date =15 May 1956 | location = | pages = 17 &amp; 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states "exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea."&lt;ref name="CommunistInterogation51"&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 [[dystopian]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' the main character is subjected to imprisonment, isolation, and torture in order to conform his thoughts and emotions to the wishes of the rulers of Orwell's fictional future [[totalitarian]] society. Orwell's vision influenced Hunter and is still reflected in the popular understanding of the concept of brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;Psychiatry and Public Affairs, Leo H. Bartemeier, Aldine Transaction, Aug 1, 2011, page 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements'', Peter Clarke, Reader in Modern History and Fellow Peter Clarke, Routledge, Mar 1, 2004, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;  Written about the same time, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' also addressed brainwashing, although in a [[fantasy]] setting.&lt;ref&gt;The Return of Christian Humanism: Chesterton, Eliot, Tolkien, and the Romance of History, Lee Oser, University of Missouri Press, 2007, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R.

Drout editor, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007, page 251&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[science fiction]] stories of [[Cordwainer Smith]] (written from the 1940s until his death in 1966) depict brainwashing to remove memories of traumatic events as a normal and benign part of future medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gary K. Wolfe and Carol T. Williams, “The Majesty of Kindness: The Dialectic of Cordwainer Smith”, Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Volume 3, Thomas D. Clareson editor, Popular Press, 1983, pages 53-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s many American films were filmed that featured brainwashing of POWs, including ''[[The Rack (film)|The Rack]]'', ''[[The Bamboo Prison]]'', ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'', and ''[[The Fearmakers]]''. ''[[Forbidden Area]]'' told the story of Soviet secret agents who had been brainwashed through [[classical conditioning]] by their own government so they wouldn't reveal their identities. In 1962 ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (based on the 1959 novel by [[Richard Condon]]) "put brainwashing front and center" by featuring a plot by the Soviet government to take over the United States by use of a brainwashed presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Enemies of the American Way: Political Paranoia About Nazis, Communists, Saboteurs, Terrorists and Body Snatching Aliens in Film and Television'', Fraser A.

Mind control remains an important theme in [[science fiction]]. Terry O'Brien comments: "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brien in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; A subgenre is ''corporate mind control'', in which a future society is run by one or more business [[corporations]] that dominate society using [[advertising]] and [[mass media]] to control the population's thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Per Schelde, ''Androids, Humanoids, and Other Science Fiction Monsters: Science and Soul in Science Fiction Films'', NYU Press, 1 July 1994, pages 169-175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal and civil cases==
In 1974, [[Patty Hearst]], a member of the wealthy [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst family]], was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a left-wing group calling itself the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. After several weeks of captivity she agreed to join the group and took part in their activities.  In 1975, she was arrested and charged with bank robbery and use of a gun in committing a felony.  Her attorney, [[F. Lee Bailey]] argued in her trial  that she should not be held responsible for her actions since her treatment by her captors was the equivalent of the brainwashing of Korean War POWs. (See: [[diminished responsibility]].)  Hearst was found guilty, but her “brainwashing defense” brought the topic to renewed public attention in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe, James T. Richardson, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Dec 6, 2012, page 518&lt;/ref&gt; as did the 1969 to 1971 case of [[Charles Manson]], who was said to have brainwashed his followers to commit murder and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology'', by Charles Patrick Ewing, Joseph T.

Bailey developed his case in conjunction with psychiatrist [[Louis Jolyon West]] and psychologist [[Margaret Singer]].  They had both studied the experiences of  Korean War POWs.

[[Italy]] has had controversy over the concept of ''[[plagio]]'', a crime consisting in an absolute psychological—and eventually physical—domination of a person. The effect is said to be the annihilation of the subject's [[freedom]] and [[self-determination]] and the consequent negation of his or her [[personality]]. The crime of plagio has rarely been prosecuted in Italy, and only one person was ever convicted. In 1981, an Italian court found that the concept is imprecise, lacks coherence, and is liable to arbitrary application.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Usai “Profili penali dei condizionamenti mentali, Milano, 1996 {{ISBN|88-14-06071-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the twenty-first century, the concept of brainwashing was being applied "with some success" in  [[child custody]] and [[child sexual abuse]] cases.

In 2003, forensic psychologist [[Dick Anthony]] said that "no reasonable person would question that there are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony."&lt;ref name="Oldenburg"/&gt;  In 2016, Israeli anthropologist of religion and fellow at the [[Van Leer Jerusalem Institute]] Adam Klin-Oron said about then-proposed "anti-cult" legislation: 
:''In the 1980s there was a wave of ‘brainwashing’ claims, and then parliaments around the world examined the issue, courts around the world examined the issue, and reached a clear ruling: That there is no such thing as cults…that the people making these claims are often not experts on the issue. And in the end courts, including in Israel, rejected expert witnesses who claimed there is "brainwashing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/will-israels-first-anti-cult-legislation-harm-religious-freedom], ''[[Times of Israel]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;''

It is neither magical nor mystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggested that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref name="Zimbardo 1997 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another adherent to this view, Jean-Marie Abgrall was heavily criticized by forensic psychologist Dick Anthony for employing a [[pseudo-scientific]] approach and lacking any evidence that anyone's [[worldview]] was substantially changed by these coercive methods.

Barker’s extensive enumerations showed that among the recruits who went so far as to attend two-day retreats (claimed to beMoonie’s most effective means of "brainwashing"), fewer than 25% joined the group for more than a week and only 5% remained full-time members one year later. And, of course, most contacts dropped out before attending a retreat. Of all those who visited a Moonie centre at least once, not one in two-hundred remained in the movement two years later.

In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or coercive persuasion did indeed play a role in recruitment by NRMs.
&lt;ref&gt;

''Cults and [[large group awareness training]]s have generated considerable controversy because of their widespread use of deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control. These techniques can compromise individual freedom, and their use has resulted in serious harm to thousands of individuals and families.

On 11 May 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report "lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur", and concluded that "after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force.

Russian historian [[Daniel Romanovsky]], who interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses in the 1970s, reported on what he called "[[Nazi]] brainwashing" of the people of [[Belarus]] by the occupying Germans during the [[Second World War]], which took place through both mass [[propaganda]] and intense re-education, especially in schools. Romanovsky noted that very soon most people had adopted the Nazi view that the Jews were an inferior race and were closely tied to the [[Soviet]] government, views that had not been at all common before the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Europe and the Final Solution'', David Bankier, Israel Gutman, Berghahn Books, 2009, page 282-285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and its Aftermath, Jonathan Petropoulos, John Roth, Berghahn Books, Jul 15, 2005, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Minsk Ghetto 1941-1943: Jewish Resistance and Soviet Internationalism, Barbara Epstein, University of California Press, 2008, page 295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bringing the Dark Past to Light: The Reception of the Holocaust in Postcommunist Europe, John-Paul Himka, Joanna Beata Michlic, University of Nebraska Press, Jul 1, 2013, pages 74, 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/sc3/soviet_jews_exodus/English/Interview_s/InterviewRomanovsky.shtml Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU6WielZ_VoC&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Soviet Person as a Bystander of the Holocaust: The case of eastern Belorussia|first=Daniel|last=Romanovsky|page=276|title=Nazi Europe and the Final Solution|editor-first=David|editor-last=Bankier|editor2-first=Israel|editor2-last=Gutman|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn Books}}

[[Joost Meerloo]], a Dutch psychiatrist, was an early proponent of the concept of brainwashing. ("Menticide" is a [[neologism]] coined by him meaning: "killing of the mind.") Meerloo's view was influenced by his experiences during the German occupation of his country and his work with the Dutch government and the American military in the [[interrogation]] of accused [[Nazi war criminals]]. He later emigrated to the United States and taught at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Propaganda Studies, Jonathan Auerbach, Russ Castronovo, Oxford University Press, 2014, page 114&lt;/ref&gt; His best-selling 1956 book, ''The Rape of the Mind'', concludes by saying: 
:''The modern techniques of brainwashing and menticide—those perversions of psychology—can bring almost any man into submission and surrender. Many of the victims of thought control, brainwashing, and menticide that we have talked about were strong men whose minds and wills were broken and degraded. But although the totalitarians use their knowledge of the mind for vicious and unscrupulous purposes, our democratic society can and must use its knowledge to help man to grow, to guard his freedom, and to understand himself.'' &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite web |author= [[Joost Meerloo|Meerloo, Joost]] |url=http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/mc-ch1.html |title=''The Rape of the Mind: The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing'' |year=1956 |publisher=World Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have said that modern [[business corporation]]s practice mind control to create a work force that shares common values and culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Exploring Leadership: Individual, Organizational, and Societal Perspectives'', Richard Bolden, Beverley Hawkins, Jonathan Gosling, Scott Taylor, Oxford University Press, 30 June 2011, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have linked "corporate brainwashing" with [[globalization]], saying that corporations are attempting to create a worldwide [[Cultural homogenization|monocultural]] network of producers, consumers, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Anti-corporate Movement: Corporations and the People who Hate Them'', Evan Osborne, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Modern educational systems have also been criticized, by both the left and the right, for contributing to corporate brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''More Money Than Brains: Why School Sucks, College is Crap, &amp; Idiots Think They're Right'', [[Laura Penny]], McClelland &amp; Stewart, 20 April 2010, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1992 book, ''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization'', [[Stanley A. Deetz]] says that modern "[[self awareness]]" and "[[self improvement]]" programs provide corporations with even more effective tools to control the minds of employees than traditional brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''Democracy in an Age of Corporate Colonization: Developments in Communication and the Politics of Everyday Life'', Stanley Deetz, SUNY Press, 1 January 1992, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2000 book, ''Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Robert Lifton applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]] and the [[War on Terrorism]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. He also pointed out that in their efforts against terrorism Western governments were also using some mind control techniques, including [[thought-terminating cliché]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Destroying the ''World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism'', Owl Books, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2004 [[popular science]] book, ''[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]'', [[neuroscientist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] reviewed the history of mind control theories, as well as notable incidents. She suggests that persons under its influence have more rigid [[neurological]] pathways, and that can make it more difficult to rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways.&lt;ref name="szimhart"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Szimhart | first =Joseph | title =Thoughts on thought control | journal =[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | volume =29 | issue =4 | pages =56–57 | date =July–August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers  praised her book for its clear presentation, while some criticized it for oversimplification.&lt;ref name="lefanu"&gt;{{cite news | last =Le Fanu | first =James | title =Make up your mind | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] | publisher =Telegraph Media Group Limited | date =20 December 2004 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/12/19/botay19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2004/12/19/bomain.html | accessdate = 2008-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{cite news | last =Hawkes | first =Nigel | title =Brainwashing by Kathleen Taylor | work =[[The Times]] | publisher =Times Newspapers Ltd | date =27 November 2004 | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article395436.ece | accessdate = 2008-11-02 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Caterson | first =Simon | title =Hell to pay when man bites God | work =[[The Australian]] | page =4 | date =2 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Kathleen Eleanor |authorlink=Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title=Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BIuju20yhDkC&amp;dq |accessdate=2009-07-30 |date=December 2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280496-9 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10399">'''Calculator spelling''' is an [[Unintended consequences|unintended characteristic]] of the [[seven-segment display]] traditionally used by [[calculator]]s, in which, when read upside-down, the digits resemble letters of the [[Latin alphabet]]. Each digit can be mapped to one or more letters, creating a limited but functional [[subset]] of the alphabet, sometimes referred to as ''beghilos'' (or ''beghilosz'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-beg1.htm |title=World Wide Words: Beghilos |last=Quinion |first=Michael |date=2009-08-08 |access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/rec.games.mecha/mZLlCJchP-s/xgsOa21jJTkJ |title=Was Re: Mech postings..

The graphic below is  illustrates the term "BEghILOSZ" constructed from the inverted sequence "250714638":

BEghlLOSZ =[[File:Beghilos.svg|200px]]

Certain calculators omit the topmost stem on the digit "6" and the bottom-most stem on the "9". In such cases, "6" renders a [[lowercase]] "q" when turned upside-down, and "9" appears as a lowercase "b".

Other variants of calculator spelling alphabets consider "0" to be a capital "D" instead of "O", "6" (not used in the standard beghilos) as a lowercase "g" (as opposed to uppercase represented by 9) and "9" as either a reversed lowercase "a" or an [[at sign]] (@), both of which represent the letter A.

Extending the available alphabet to [[hexadecimal]] notation (generally available on lower-end [[scientific calculator]]s, though not on basic models), "b" and "d" correspond to "q" and "p" respectively. "F" transforms to a mixture between a "J" and a "t". A and C do not transform readily to recognizable letters. E transforms to 3. C transforms to an open O or [[right parenthesis]]. [[Turned a|Upside-down A]] is the # sign.

Using [[leet]], additional letters can be represented by combinations of letters (11/II or 2 ["Z" being very rare in English] representing "two" or "to", 111/III representing "three", 15/SI, 935/SEa or 335/SEE for "C", etc.). This is generally rare and, especially in the last case (using a spelling-out of a letter) severely limits readability.

Only certain calculators are capable of being used for beghilos calculator spelling. [[LCD]], [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]], [[LED]], and [[Panaplex]] displays are best for spelling words. The ability of [[dot-matrix]] [[display device|display]]s, [[fourteen-segment display|fourteen-segment]] and [[sixteen-segment display]]s to render most characters defeats the purpose of spelling with a limited alphabet.

If the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from upright to create a vertical display, a different, but less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:

If the calculator is instead rotated 90 degrees clockwise from upright to create a vertical display, ''still'' a different, but similarly less useful, set of letters can be reproduced, including:

==Applications==

Aside from novelty and amusement, calculator spelling has limited utility. The popularity of [[pager]]s in the 1990s gave rise to a form of [[leetspeak]] called [[pagerspeak]].&lt;ref name="pagerspeak"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/news/mn-57816 Pager Language | Teens Create Language of Pager-Speak - Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Student]]s, in particular, experimented with calculators to discover new words.

===English===
{{example farm|date=April 2018}}
The 'original' attributed example of calculator spelling, which dates from the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (2006), Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, Terry Victor, pp. 2160&lt;/ref&gt; is 5318008, which when turned over spells "[[Breasts|BOOBIES]]". Another early example of calculator spelling offered the sequence 0.7734, which becomes "hELLO".&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Words that can be written on a calculator |url=http://everything2.com/title/Words+that+can+be+written+on+a+calculator |work=Everything2 |publisher=Everything Development Co. | date=2000-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other words possible with the traditional "BEghILOSZ" set include "LOOSE", "ShELL", "BEIgE", "gOBBLE", "gOOgLE", and very many others. Among the longest are "gLOSSOLOgIES" and "BIBLIOLOgIES" at 12 letters, and "hILLBILLIES" and "SLEIghBELLS" at 11 (these require 12-digit displays, such as those used in [[adding machine]]s). [[Hip hop]] [[slang]] applications include the sequence 3722145 which spells "[[wikt:-izzle|ShIZZLE]]". On certain 10 digit calculators the number 5304577351 spells "I SELL ShOES", the number 77151345 spells "ShE IS ILL", or the number 7715134 spells "hE IS ILL". Another common number, 7734206, spells "gO 2 hELL". 8008 is special in that it can spell "BOOB" upside-down or right-side up. 71077345 spells "SHELLOIL", which can be separated into two individual words ("shell" and "oil").

===Scientific and programmer calculators===

[[Scientific calculator]]s that feature [[hexadecimal]] readout using the letters ''A'' through ''F'' offer more flexibility.  Using a scientific calculator with hex capability, the earlier "5318008" example can be improved with the A–F keys to spell "B00B1E5", without needing to rotate the display (a practice known as [[hexspeak]]).

Students often use this capability and the improved "alpha" feature that use the letters "A" through "Z" to write messages, separating words by using the minus sign ("-") or other punctuation. In the "B00B1E5" example above, for instance, a [[factorial]] product sign ("!") can be added to create "B00B1E5!" Most of these calculators do not use seven-segment displays, instead using dot matrix displays for greater versatility.

===Programmable devices===

When accessed through [[calculator programming|programming]], calculator spelling can provide a form of textual feedback in [[embedded system|devices]] with limited output ability. A programmer creates a wider set of letters, which does not require a reader to turn the device upside-down.&lt;ref name="E2" /&gt; Many consumer devices including digital cameras resort to variants of calculator spelling in order to display diagnostic or status information in non-alphanumeric displays. For example, many [[Minolta]] cameras display "Err" or "HELP" to indicate various problems.

'''Carpathian Romani''', also known as '''Central Romani''' or '''Romungro Romani''', is a group of dialects of the [[Romani language]] spoken from southern [[Poland]] to [[Hungary]], and from eastern [[Austria]] to [[Ukraine]].

'''North Central Romani''' is one of a dozen of major [[dialect]] groups within [[Romani language|Romani]], an [[Indo-Aryan language]] of Europe. The North Central dialects of Romani are traditionally spoken by some subethnic groups of the [[Romani people]] (Gypsies) in Hungary, the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] (with the exception of its southwestern and south-central regions), southeastern Poland, the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathia]] province of Ukraine, and parts of [[Romania]]n [[Transylvania]]. There are also established outmigrant communities of North Central Romani speakers in the [[United States]], and recent outmigrant communities in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Belgium]], and some other Western European countries.

'''Christina Charlotta Cederström''' ([[née]] ''Mörner af Morlanda'') (2 March 1760 –
22 February 1832) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Amateur|dilettante]] artist, [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess, and baroness. She was an honorary member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]], as well as an honorary member of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;Svenskt konstnärslexikon (Swedish Art Dictionary) Allhems Förlag, Malmö (1952) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life==
Her father was [[Count]] Gustaf Mörner af Morlanda. She was married in 1780 to Baron Axel Ture Gyllenkrok, whom she [[divorce]]d in 1799. During her first marriage, she spent her days on her husband's estate in the countryside. Bored, she developed her artistic talents in various genres. She wrote poems and a novel in the style of [[Rousseau]]. She drew in ink and [[Indian ink]] and [[Oil painting|painted in oil]]. She wrote songs and composed music to them, the best known being "Välkommen, o måne, min åldrige vän" (Welcome, oh Moon, my old friend).

After her second marriage, to Baron [[Bror Cederström]] (1780–1877) in 1800, she moved to Stockholm, where she established a salon and became a central figure in the city's cultural life. She participated in the exhibitions of the academy with oil paintings. In 1803, she was elected an honorary member of both the Swedish and French Academies of Art.

'''Chumburung''' (Kyongborong, Nchimburu, Nchummuru) is a [[Guang language]] spoken by 69,000 persons, mostly Chumburu by tribe and living in the Kingdom of [[Chumburung]] at both sides of the southwestern leg of [[Lake Volta]] in [[Ghana]].

3,000 of these speak the Yeji (Yedji) dialect, which is quite divergent: no closer to Chumburung proper than [[Kplang language|Kplang]] or [[Krache language|Krache]] are.

A large number of publications describing the language can be found at: http://www.language-archives.org/language/ncu . References to the tribe and the traditional area are rare, but here is one: http://www.northernghanapeoples.co.uk/ ; click down left on CHUMBURUNG.

'''Controlling law''' is a [[legal term]] used in  [[contracts]], [[trusts]], or other legal documents. It refers to the laws of the state which will be relied upon in settling disputes, and is often stated as one of the provisions in an official agreement between two parties. The term is used most frequently in contracts formed between two parties that do not reside in the same state. In such an instance, the authoring party usually includes a clause asserting that any [[litigation]] that arises involving the contract must do so under the laws of the author's home state.

Establishing which state will be the venue for litigation is an important part of any contract, and affects nearly every form of industry or commerce that transcends borders. For example, in the [[United States]], many insurance companies choose to locate their headquarters in [[Iowa]] or [[Connecticut]] where state law is seen as favorable to their interests. This ensures that any legal action taken against the corporation will occur under friendly laws. The same phenomenon occurs in the software industry as well, with the majority of [[End User License Agreement]]s including an item that establishes the laws of their home state as controlling law.

Controlling law can also have an effect on whether or not a lawsuit begins in the first place. When the plaintiff resides in a different state than the defendant, taking action can be extremely expensive. The costs of hiring an attorney in the area, along with the costs of travel and wages lost from appearing in court, can often discourage them from filing the lawsuit. This effectively limits the number of minor claims brought against the author of the contract, although more serious claims are often brought without regard to the expense.

[[Machine translation]] can use a method based on [[dictionary]] entries, which means that the words will be translated as a dictionary does – word by word, usually without much correlation of meaning between them. Dictionary lookups may be done with or without [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological analysis]] or [[lemmatisation]]. While this approach to machine translation is probably the least sophisticated, '''dictionary-based machine translation''' is ideally suitable for the translation of long lists of phrases on the subsentential (i.e., not a full sentence) level, e.g. [[inventory|inventories]] or simple catalogs of products and services.&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Muegge (2006), "An Excellent Application for Crummy Machine Translation: Automatic Translation of a Large Database", in Elisabeth Gräfe (2006; ed.), ''Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the German Society of Technical Communicators'', Stuttgart: tekom, 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be used to expedite manual translation, if the person carrying it out is fluent in both languages and therefore capable of correcting syntax and grammar.

== LMT ==
LMT&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ACQUIRING LEXICAL DATA FROM MACHINE-READABLE DICTIONARY RESOURCES FOR MACHINE TRANSLATION|pages = 85–90|publisher = IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, P. O. Box 704, Yorktown Heights, New York 10598|last = Mary S. Neff Michael C. McCord|citeseerx = 10.1.1.132.8355|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Prolog-based machine-translation system that works
on specially made bilingual dictionaries, such as the Collins English-German
(CEG), which have been rewritten in an indexed form which is easily readable by
computers. This method uses a structured lexical data base (LDB) in order to
correctly identify word categories from the source language, thus constructing
a coherent sentence in the target language, based on rudimentary morphological
analysis. This system uses "frames"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to identify the position a certain word
should have, from a syntactical point of view, in a sentence. This "frames"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are
mapped via language conventions, such as UDICT in the case of English.

In its early (prototype) form LMT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; uses three lexicons,
accessed simultaneously: source, transfer and target, although it is possible
to encapsulate this whole information in a single lexicon. The program uses a
lexical configuration consisting of two main elements. The first element is a
hand-coded lexicon addendum which contains possible incorrect translations. The
second element consist of various bilingual and monolingual dictionaries
regarding the two languages which are the source and target languages.

== Example-Based &amp; Dictionary-Based Machine Translation ==
This method of Dictionary-Based Machine translation explores
a different paradigm from systems such as LMT. An [[example-based machine translation]] system is supplied with only a "sentence-aligned bilingual corpus".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mt-archive.info/TMI-1997-Brown.pdf|title = Automated Dictionary Extraction for "Knowledge-Free" Example-Based Translation|date = |accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = Language Technologies Institute (Center for Machine Translation) Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890 USA|last = Ralf D. Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using this data the translating program generates a "word-for-word bilingual
dictionary"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is used for further translation.

Whilst this system would generally be regarded as a whole
different way of machine translation than Dictionary-Based Machine Translation,
it is important to understand the complementing nature of this paradigms. With
the combined power inherent in both systems, coupled with the fact that a
Dictionary-Based Machine Translation works best with a "word-for-word bilingual
dictionary"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; lists of words it demonstrates the fact that a coupling of this two
translation engines would generate a very powerful translation tool that is,
besides being semantically accurate, capable of enhancing its own
functionalities via perpetual feedback loops.

A system which combines both paradigms in a way similar to
what was described in the previous paragraph is the Pangloss Example-Based
Machine Translation engine (PanEBMT)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; machine translation engine. PanEBMT uses a
correspondence table between languages to create its corpus. Furthermore,
PanEBMT supports multiple incremental operations on its corpus, which facilitates
a biased translation used for filtering purposes.

== Parallel Text Processing ==
Douglas Hofstadter through his "Le Ton beau de Marot: In
Praise of the Music of Language" proves what a complex task translation is. The
author produced and analysed dozens upon dozens of possible translations for an
eighteen line French poem, thus revealing complex inner workings of syntax,
morphology and meaning.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Parallel Text Processing: Alignment and Use of Translation Corpora|journal = Computational Linguistics|volume = 27|issue = 4|pages = 592–595|publisher = Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers (Text, speech and language technology series, edited by Nancy Ide and Jean V´eronis, volume 13), 2000, xxiii+402 pp; hardbound |isbn=978-0-7923-6546-4|last = Jean V´eronis|doi = 10.1162/coli.2000.27.4.592|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most translation engines who choose a single
translation based on back to back comparison of the texts in both the source
and target languages, Douglas Hofstadter’s work prove the inherent level of
error which is present in any form of translation, when the meaning of the
source text is too detailed or complex. Thus the problem of text alignment and
"statistics of language"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is brought to attention.

This discrepancies led to Martin Kay’s views on translation
and translation engines as a whole. As Kay puts it "More substantial successes
in these enterprises will require a sharper image of the world than any that
can be made out simply from the statistics of language use" [(page xvii)
Parallel Text Processing: Alignment and Use of Translation Corpora].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus Kay
has brought back to light the question of meaning inside language and the
distortion of meaning through processes of translation.

== Lexical Conceptual Structure ==
One of the possible uses of Dictionary-Based Machine Translation is facilitating "Foreign Language Tutoring" (FLT). This can be achieved by using Machine-Translation technology as well as linguistics, semantics and morphology to produce "Large-Scale Dictionaries"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in virtually any given language. Development in lexical semantics and computational linguistics during the time period between 1990 and 1996 made it possible for "natural language processing" (NLP) to flourish, gaining new capabilities, nevertheless benefiting machine translation in general.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/716/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1007965530302.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1007965530302&amp;token2=exp=1446652127~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F716%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1007965530302.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1007965530302*~hmac=5697c0e4de24aef3be9dcddb7f87900ebac27599d7e34f5d297ed9e55da00dee|title = Large-Scale Dictionary Construction for Foreign Language Tutoring and Interlingual Machine Translation|journal = Machine Translation|volume = 12|issue = 4|pages = 271–322|accessdate = 2 November 2015|last = BONNIE J. DORR|doi = 10.1023/A:1007965530302|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Lexical Conceptual Structure" (LCS) is a representation
that is language independent. It is mostly used in foreign language tutoring,
especially in the natural language processing element of FLT. LCS has also
proved to be an indispensable tool for machine translation of any kind, such as
Dictionary-Based Machine Translation. Overall one of the primary goals of LCS
is "to demonstrate that synonymous verb senses share distributional patterns".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== "DKvec" ==
"DKvec is a method for extracting bilingual lexicons, from
noisy parallel corpora based on arrival distances of words in noisy parallel
corpora". This method has emerged in response to two problems plaguing the
statistical extraction of bilingual lexicons: "(1) How can noisy parallel
corpora be used? (2) How can non-parallel yet comparable corpora be used?"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/42/bok%253A978-3-540-49478-2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fbook%2F10.1007%2F3-540-49478-2&amp;token2=exp=1446652324~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F42%2Fbok%25253A978-3-540-49478-2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Fbook%252F10.1007%252F3-540-49478-2*~hmac=4f84c22e743cb0db2f7e3e3bd46d5136fc975e1a6d780d0cce451a512c1e93d2|title = Machine Translation and the Information Soup|volume = 1529|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = CR Subject Classification (1998): I.2.7, H.3, F.4.3, H.5, J.5 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York|isbn=978-3-540-65259-5|last = David Farwell Laurie Gerber Eduard Hovy|doi = 10.1007/3-540-49478-2|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "DKvec" method has proven invaluable for machine
translation in general, due to the amazing success it has had in trials
conducted on both English – Japanese and English – Chinese noisy parallel
corpora. The figures for accuracy "show a 55.35% precision from a small corpus
and 89.93% precision from a larger corpus".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With such impressive numbers it is
safe to assume the immense impact that methods such as "DKvec" has had in the
evolution of machine translation in general, especially Dictionary-Based
Machine Translation.

Algorithms used for extracting parallel corpora in a
bilingual format exploit the following rules in order to achieve a satisfactory
accuracy and overall quality:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# Words have one sense per corpus
# Words have single translation per corpus
# No missing translations in the target document
# Frequencies of bilingual word occurrences are comparable
# Positions of bilingual word occurrences are comparable

This methods can be used to generate, or to look for, occurrence patterns which in turn are used to produce binary occurrence vectors which are used by the "DKvec" method.

== History of Machine Translation ==
The history of machine translation (MT) starts around the
mid 1940s. Machine translations was probably the first time computers were
used for non-numerical purposes. Machine translation enjoyed a fierce research interest
during the 1950s and 1960s, which was followed by a stagnation until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080448542009378|title = Machine Translation: History|date = January 2006|accessdate = 2 November 2015|last = J. Hutchins|doi=10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/00937-8|journal=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|pages=375–383|isbn = 9780080448541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the 1980s, machine translation became mainstream again, enjoying an even
bigger popularity than in the 1950s and 1960s as well as rapid expansion,
largely based on the text corpora approach.

The basic concept of machine translation can be traced back
to the 17th century in the speculations surrounding "universal
languages and mechanical dictionaries".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The first true practical machine
translation suggestions were made in 1933 by Georges Artsrouni in France and Petr
Trojanskij in Russia. Both had patented machines that they believed could be
used for translating meaning from a language to another. "In June 1952, the
first MT conference was convened at MIT by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On 7 January 1954 a Machine Translation convention in New York, sponsored by IBM,
served at popularizing the field. The conventions popularity came from the
translation of short English sentences into Russian. This engineering feat
mesmerised the public and the governments of both the USA and USSR who
therefore stimulated large-scale funding in machine translation research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
Although the enthusiasm for machine translation was extremely high, technical
and knowledge limitations led to disillusions regarding what machine
translation was actually capable of doing, at least at that time. Thus machine
translation lost in popularity until the 1980s, when advances in linguistics
and technology helped revitalise the interest in this field.

== Translingual information retrieval ==
"Translingual information retrieval (TLIR) consists of
providing a query in one language and searching document collections in one or
more different languages". Most methods of TLIR can be quantified into two
categories, namely statistical-IR approaches and query translation. Machine
translation based TLIR works in one of two ways. Either the query is translated
in the target language, or the original query is used to search while the
collection of possible results is translated in the query language and used for
cross-reference. Both methods have pros and cons, namely:&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370298000630|title = Translingual information retrieval: learning from bilingual corpora|date = August 1998|accessdate = 2 November 2015|publisher = Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA||author1=Yiming Yang |author2=Jaime G. Carbonell |author3=Ralf D. Brown |author4=Robert E. Frederking |doi=10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00063-0 |volume=103 |issue = 1–2|journal=Artificial Intelligence |pages=323–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Translation Accuracy – the correctness of any machine translation, is dependent on the size of the translated text, thus short texts or words may suffer from a bigger degree of semantic errors, as well as lexical ambiguities, whereas a larger text may provide context, which helps at disambiguation.
* Retrieval Accuracy – based on the same logic invoked at the previous point, it is preferably to have whole documents translated, rather than queries, because large texts are likely to suffer from less loss of meaning in translation then short queries.
* Practicality – unlike the previous points, translating short queries is the best way to go. This is because it is easy to translate short texts, whilst translating whole libraries is highly resource intensive, plus the volume of such a translating task implies the indexing of the new translated documents

All this points prove the fact that Dictionary-Based machine translation is the most efficient and reliable form of translation when working with TLIR. This is because the process "looks up each query term in a general-purpose bilingual dictionary, and uses all its possible translations."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Machine Translation of Very Close Languages ==
The examples of RUSLAN, a dictionary-based machine
translation system between Czech and Russian and CESILKO, a Czech – Slovak
dictionary-based machine translation system, shows that in the case of very
close languages simpler translation methods are more efficient, fast and
reliable.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=974149|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = |author1=Jan HAJIC |title = Proceedings of the sixth conference on Applied natural language processing -|pages = 7–12|author2=Jan HRIC |author3=Vladislav KUBON |doi = 10.3115/974147.974149|year = 2000|chapter = Machine translation of very close languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RUSLAN system was made in order to prove the hypotheses
that related languages are easier to translate. The system development started
in 1985 and was terminated five years later due to lack of further funding. The
lessons taught by the RUSLAN experiment are that a transfer-based approach of
translation retains its quality regardless of how close the languages are. The
main two bottlenecks of "full-fledged transfer-based systems"&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; are complexity
and unreliability of syntactic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=290957|title = The Effects of Query Structure and Dictionary Setups in DictionaryBased Cross-language Information Retrieval|pages = 55–63|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = Department of Information studies University of Tampere|last = Ari Pirkola|doi = 10.1145/290941.290957|chapter = The effects of query structure and dictionary setups in dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval|year = 1998|isbn = 978-1581130157|citeseerx = 10.1.1.20.3202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multilingual Information Retrieval MLIR ==
"Information Retrieval systems rank documents according to
statistical similarity measures based on the co-occurrence of terms in queries
and documents". The MLIR system was created and optimised in such a way that
facilitates dictionary based translation of queries. This is because of the
fact that queries tend to be short, a couple of words, which, despite not
providing a lot of context it is a more feasible than translating whole
documents, due to practical reasons. Despite all this, the MLIR system is
highly dependent on a lot of resources such as automated language detection
software.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=243212|title = Querying Across Languages: A Dictionary-Based Approach to Multilingual Information Retrieval|pages = 49–57|accessdate = 2 November 2015|website = |publisher = Rank Xerox Research Centre 6 chemin de Maupertuis, 38240 Meylan France|author1=David A.

The prestige form and most-cited representative form is the [[Fuzhou dialect]], the speech of the capital and largest city of [[Fujian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=李如龙 Li Rulong|title=福州方言词典 Fuzhou Fangyan Cidian|date=1994|publisher=福建人民出版社 Fujian Renmin Chubanshe|location=Fuzhou|isbn=7211023546|page=1|edition=Rev. 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===China and Taiwan===

Eastern Min varieties are mainly spoken in the eastern part of [[Fujian]] Province in [[People's Republic of China]], in and near the cities of [[Fuzhou]] and [[Ningde]]. They are also widely encountered as the [[First language|mother tongue]] on the [[Matsu Islands]], [[Republic of China]]. Additionally, the inhabitants of [[Taishun County|Taishun]] and [[Cangnan County|Cangnan]] to the north of Fujian in [[Zhejiang]] also speak Eastern Min varieties. Eastern Min generally coexists with the official [[standard Chinese]] in all these areas.

===America===

As the coastal area of [[Fujian]] has been the historical homeland of a large worldwide [[diaspora]] of [[overseas Chinese]], varieties of Eastern Min can also be found across the world, especially in their respective [[Chinatown]]s. Cities with high concentrations of such immigrants include [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guest|first1=Kenneth J.|title=God in Chinatown: Religion and Survival in New York's Evolving Immigrant Community|date=2003|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0814731546|page=48|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Little Fuzhou]], Manhattan; [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]]; and [[Flushing, Queens]].

===Europe===

They are also found in various Chinatown communities in Europe, including [[London]], [[Paris]], and [[Prato]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pieke|first1=Frank|title=Research Briefing 4: Transnational Communities|url=http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/briefings/brief4.pdf|publisher=Transnational Communities Programme, Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, Oxford|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan and Malaysia===

Fuzhou communities can also be found in [[Sitiawan]], [[Perak]] and [[Yong Peng]], [[Johor]] in [[West Malaysia]].

==Classification==

===Branches and influences===

The Eastern Min group is conventionally divided into three branches:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kurpaska|first1=Maria|title=Chinese language(s) : a look through the prism of the great dictionary of modern Chinese dialects|date=2010|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110219142|page=71|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8808">The '''English Language Unity Act''' was first introduced in 2005. It hoped to establish [[English language|English]] as the [[official language]] of the [[federal government of the United States]]. If passed it would require that all official functions and proceedings of federal and state government be conducted in English. It would also require that applicants for [[naturalization]] be tested on their ability to read and generally understand the English language. They would be tested on the laws of the United States as well as other important documents that relate to the law, including the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. It would also require that all naturalization ceremonies be conducted in English. If a person became injured because of violations of this Act, they would be able to file suit in court. Before this act could be considered by the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House of Representatives]] it had to be approved by the House Judiciary, and Education and the Workforce Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-997|title=Text of H.R. 997 (112th): English Language Unity Act of 2011 (Introduced version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The English Language Unity Act is based on a similar bill, "The [[Bill Emerson]] English Language Empowerment Act", which passed in the House of Representatives in 1999. However, it never became law. It tried to amend Federal law to declare English to be the official language of the U.S. Government. If it became a law, it would have required state representatives to conduct official business in English. It would have required that all officials conduct naturalization ceremonies entirely in English as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-123|title=Bill Emerson English Language Empowerment Act of 1999 (1999 - H.R. 123)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conservative Republican lawmaker Representative [[Steve King]] introduced this act to the House of Representatives on March 1, 2005 it was known as the English Language Unity Act of 2005. Before the 109th session ended of congress, the bill accumulated 164 sponsors. The last action on this bill was the introductory remarks on the proposed bill on May 19, 2006. The bill did not come up for debate during this session of [[United States Congress|Congress]], so it is said to have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-997|title=English Language Unity Act of 2005 (2005 - H.R. 997)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative King reintroduced the bill as the English Unity Act of 2007 on February 12, 2007. This time it gained the support of 153 cosponsors. The last action on this proposed bill was on June 5, 2007 when the [[House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Committee on Education and Labor]] referred the bill to the subcommittee on Early Childhood Education, Elementary and Secondary Education. Congress adjourned before further action could be taken, so the bill died again in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-997|title=English Language Unity Act of 2007 (2007 - H.R. 997)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative King alongside Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] introduced the English Language Unity Act of 2011 on Friday, March 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-997|title=English Language Unity Act of 2011 (2011 - H.R. 997)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a release King defended his proposition by saying "A common language is the most powerful unifying force known throughout history. We need to encourage assimilation of all legal immigrants in each generation. A nation divided by language cannot pull together as effectively as a people." Inhofe added: "This [[legislation]] will provide much-needed commonality among [[United States]] citizens, regardless of heritage. As a nation built by immigrants, it is important that we share one vision and one official language." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20042244-503544.html|title=Bill would make English official language of U.S. government|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Repeated attempts to make English the official language of the United States have failed time and time again, though the issue never fails to spark heated debate. While appearing to focus solely on language, these attempt trigger issues related to financial burden, [[discrimination]], [[patriotism]], and [[wikt:unity|unity]].

Those against the legislation argue the bill deals with a non-issue. They claim Congress does not need to establish legislation in order to teach others the importance of knowing English since the language is already spoken by a majority of Americans. Opponents of the legislation question why there is a sudden need for an official language, given that the [[United States government]] has flourished without one for the past two hundred years. They argue that it is not an official language that binds Americans together as a country, but rather the freedoms and ideals that are enjoyed by its citizens. 

Some opponents of the bill also argue that the legislation is unconstitutional. They assert it would limit the government's ability to correspond with all its citizens, and that by restricting federal and state employees from communicating with citizens in a language other than English, the bill violates [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] rights of [[free speech]]. Some further contend that the bill would call for changes to the [[Voting Rights Act]] by eliminating all non- English ballots, despite the fact that nothing in the bill's language modifies the Voting Rights Act.

Supporters of the legislation take the position that accommodation of non-English speakers discourages [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. They acknowledge that the ability to speak a language other than English is valuable, and that its use in the home, church or private place of business should in no way be discouraged. At the same time, they argue that the government should not bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that non-English-speaking individuals can participate in government solely using their [[Mother tongue|mother language]]. They contend that as more immigrants learn English, the [[language barrier]]s that divide the country into separate groups will disintegrate and lead to a decrease in racial and ethnic problems. They also believe that by learning English, individuals can become more productive citizens and members of American society. They argue that [[immigrant]]s who are fluent in English have better economic opportunities, and assert that non-English speakers tend to find themselves restricted to low-skilled, low-paying jobs. Supporters of the bill also posit that the ability of immigrant groups to speak English will give them an increased political voice and allow them to participate more fully and effectively in the democratic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/GSR716A_KUECHLER/monique.htm|title=Does the United States Need an Official Language?|website=maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Thirty - one states currently have adopted legislation similar to the English Language Unity Act. Alabama (1990) Alaska (1998) Arizona (2006) Arkansas (1987) California (1986)  Colorado (1988) Florida (1988) Georgia (1986 &amp; 1996)  Hawaii (1978)  Idaho (2007)  Illinois (1969)  Indiana (1984)  Iowa (2002)  Kansas (2007) Kentucky (1984) Louisiana (1812)  Massachusetts (1975) Mississippi (1987)  Missouri (1998 &amp; 2008) Montana (1995)  Nebraska (1920) New Hampshire (1995)  North Carolina (1987) North Dakota (1987) Oklahoma (2010) South Carolina (1987)  South Dakota (1995)  Tennessee (1984) Utah (2000) Virginia (1981 &amp; 1996) Wyoming (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/inc/official/states.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106211903/http://www.us-english.org/inc/official/states.asp |archivedate=2010-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kokuritsu gekijo - hanamichi - june 16 2017.jpg|thumb|The ''hanamichi'' at [[National Theatre of Japan]]]]

The {{nihongo|'''''hanamichi'''''|花道||}} is an extra [[Stage (theater)|stage]] section used in [[Japan]]ese [[kabuki]] [[theater]]. It is a long, raised platform that runs, left of center, from the back of the theater, through the audience, to connect with the main stage. Generally it is used for characters' entrances and exits, though it can also be used for [[aside]]s or scenes taking place apart from the main action. In this use, it can be seen as an [[alley theater]] connecting to a larger stage.

==History==

The ''hanamichi'' was first used in 1668 in the [[Kawarazaki-za]], in the form of a simple wooden plank that reached from the center of the stage to the middle of the theater. It was not used in performances, but  allowed actors to step into the audience after a performance to receive flowers. The word ''hanamichi'' literally means "flower path."

The modern style of ''hanamichi'', sometimes called ''honhanamichi'' ({{lang|ja|本花道}}, "main flower path"), was first conceived and standardized in 1740. The standard size ranges from 16.38&amp;nbsp;m – 18.20&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft, 9&amp;nbsp;in – 59&amp;nbsp;ft, 8&amp;nbsp;in) long and 150–180&amp;nbsp;cm (4&amp;nbsp;ft, 11&amp;nbsp;in – 5&amp;nbsp;ft, 11&amp;nbsp;in) wide. Some theaters have since begun to make use of a secondary ''hanamichi'' on the right side of the audience, known as ''karihanamichi'' ({{lang|ja|仮花道}}, "copied flower path") which is one-third to half the width of the ''honhanamichi'' on the left.

==Usages==
[[Image:Odori Keiyō Edo-e no sakae by Toyokuni III.jpg|thumb|350px|left|The July 1858 production of [[Shibaraku]] at Edo Ichimura-za theater, with ''hanamichi'' shown on the left]]
Though it is rarely used for the main action of a play, much of the more dramatic or famous character moments occur during entrances or exits along the ''hanamichi''. Many particularly dramatic actions take place seven-tenths of the way down the ''hanamichi'' (three-tenths away from the stage), at a spot known in Japanese as ''shichisan'' ({{lang|ja|七三}}, seven-three). It is here that exiting characters may say their final words, and entering characters may address the audience or the characters on stage. Since the ''hanamichi'' runs through the audience, it allows for a closer experience for the spectator than might normally be allowed by other forms of traditional theater.{{clear}}

==Sumo==
In [[sumo]], the path to the ''dohyō'' is also called ''hanamichi''.

==Eid stamp==&lt;!-- target of links from other articles, changes will break links --&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Mohammed Zakariya postage stamp.jpg|upright|right|thumb|US Eid Stamp 2001]]
The [[United States Postal Service]] issued a 34 [[Cent (currency)|cent]] stamp on the 1 September 2001 at the annual [[Islamic Society of North America]]'s convention in [[Des Plaines]], [[Illinois]]. It features [[gold]] [[Arab language|Arabic]] [[calligraphy]] on a [[lapis]] background that commemorates two of the most important Muslim festivals: [[Eid ul-Fitr]], marking the end of the month-long fast of [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], at the end of the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. During the festival, Muslims wish each other "Eid mubarak," the phrase featured on the stamp. "[[Eid Mubarak]]" translates  into English as "blessed festival," and can be paraphrased as "May your religious holiday be blessed." This phrase can be applied to both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. This stamp was designed by the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher]] [[Mohammed Zakariya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=USPS|date=1 August 2001|url=http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_054.htm|title=USPS: Eid Stamp Part of Holiday Celebrations Series|accessdate=15 June 2007|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070911225313/http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_054.htm|archivedate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2011, a new version of the Eid stamp, a Forever stamp for first class mail, was issued. With a red background, its calligraphy (i.e., text) is distinctly different from the 2001 stamp with blue background. On the Forever stamp, the text in the upper left corner is "2011 USA", and text in upper right, running vertically, reads "FOREVER." Text running across bottom reads "EID GREETINGS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2011/pb22315/html/info_008.htm|title=Stamp Announcement 11-36: Eid|publisher=USPS|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States &amp; Israel===
[[Image:Stamp 1996US hanukkah.png|thumb|right|US Hanukkah stamp]]
The U.S. Postal Service issued a 32 cent stamp on October 22, 1996 as a [[joint issue]] with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1996/10/Israeli-American%20Hanukkah%20Stamp|title=Israeli-American Hanukkah Stamp|work=Israel Postal Authority|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=22 October 1996|accessdate=15 June 2007|archivedate=19 October 2007|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071019035622/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1996/10/Israeli-American%20Hanukkah%20Stamp}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanukkah]] commemorates the revolt led by [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]] against the government of [[Antiochus IV]] in 165 BC. This initial printing produced 103.5 million stamps and in it was re-issued in 1999 in a 33 cent value.

The Israeli stamp employs the same multi-colored [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] design, by American Hannah Smotrich, a graduate of the [[Yale School of Art]]. Israel also issued a [[first day cover]] as well as a [[souvenir sheet]], which shows both stamps (pictured on left). As a unique feature, this was this first [[self-adhesive stamp]] in Israel.

In 2004, the U.S. issued another hanukkah stamp depicting a photograph of a [[dreidel]] (a spinning toy with four sides), with the word 'Hanukkah' in the background. The [[dreidel]] shown was purchased in [[Jerusalem]] by an American couple. The stamp was first issued on October 15 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2004/sr04_069.htm|title=Hanukkah Postage Stamp Issued Today by U.S. Postal Service.|accessdate=18 February 2008|archivedate=18 February 2007|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070218011832/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2004/sr04_069.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial version of the stamp has been reissued; in 2006 it was 39 cents, in 2007, it was 41 cents stamp, and in 2008 it was a 42 cent stamp.

In 2013 United States Postal Service issued a new version of Hanukkah stamp which depicted menorah again. The stamp was issued on November 19 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishpost.com/news/US-Postal-Service-Unveils-New-Hanukkah-Forever-Stamp.html|title=US Postal Service Unveils New Hanukkah Forever Stamp|work=Jewish Post|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwanzaa is a non-religious [[African-American]] festival which synthesizes and reinvents traditional [[African culture|African]] "first fruits" celebrations. The U.S. Postal Service issued the first 32 cent stamp designed by self-taught artist [[Synthia Saint James]] for [[Kwanzaa]] on October 22, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.synthiasaintjames.com/bio.html|title=Synthia Saint James Biography|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was revalued three times to 33-cent, 34-cent and 37-cent in 1999, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

==Rosh Hashanah==
Israel has issued its "festival" series of stamps every year to commemorate the Jewish New Year, [[Rosh Hashanah]]. In 1948, Israel's first festival stamps were designed by [[Otte Wallish]] and depicted [[LMLK seal#Israeli postage|LMLK seals]] stamped onto jars from the time of King [[Hezekiah]] (circa 700 BCE). The Rosh Hashanah stamps often display [[secular]] and [[patriotic]] motifs, such as bread, wine, olives, soldiers, [[kibbutzniks]], [[Israeli dancing]] and the national library (1992). Fittingly, many series feature religious motifs, such as curtains for [[Ark (synagogue)|synagogue arks]] (1999), [[Hebrew Bible]] stories (1994), [[ushpizin]] of [[Sukkot]] (1997), Jewish lifecycle events (1995), and the orders the [[Mishnah]] 92006), with [[Nezikin]] pictured here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Philatelic Federation]] [http://www.israelphilately.org.il/catalog/ catalog]. English version is available, may be browser dependent.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint Valentine's Day stamps==
Several countries have issued [[love]] stamps for Saint Valentine's Day, such as; Belgium, France, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heindorffhus.motivsamler.dk/shoebox/frame-StValentine.htm|title=St. Valentine: The Patron Saint of Love|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectors will often try to collect [[Cover (philately)|covers]] from romantically named towns. Perhaps the most well known, servicing more than 200,000 each year around Valentine's Day, is [[Loveland, Colorado#The Valentine Re-Mailing Program|Loveland]], USA.

===Ireland===
In 1985 [[An Post]], the Irish Post Office, started issuing Love stamps for use on Saint Valentine's Day cards. The first pair of stamps issued depicted [[cloud]]s and [[balloon]] (22p value) and [[heart]]s and [[flower]]s (26p value). An Post continues to issue new designs each year.

==Chinese New Year==
Several nations issue [[postage stamp]]s to mark the [[Chinese New Year]] (or Lunar New Year). Typically appearing in January and February, issuing countries have included China, [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], United States, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and France.

The stamps usually depict the [[Chinese astrology|animal sign]] of that year, consisting of the sequence: [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], [[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]], [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]], [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]] and [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]. The designs may be part of a set, or individually designed; for instance, since 1992 the US has been issuing Chinese New Year stamps using a common design type based on colored paper cutouts of the animals. In succeeding years, the U.S. Postal Service issued additional stamps until all twelve animals associated with the [[Chinese lunar calendar]] were represented. The calligraphic characters on these stamps may be translated into English as "Happy New Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujTfCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|author=William D. Crump|title=Encyclopedia of New Year’s Holidays Worldwide|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2008|page=60|isbn=978-0-7864-3393-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hong Kong]] was one of the first countries to issue a [[commemorative stamp]] for the lunar new year since the 1960s (1967), but other countries have followed:

*[[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) - since 1965
*[[People's Republic of China]] - since 1980
*[[Malaysia]] - Firstly started since 2000, Started again since 2010 until now
*[[Singapore]] - Zodiac series since 1996, Festival series on-off since 1971, biannually since 2000
*United States - since 1992
*Australia - since 1994
*Canada - since 1997
*[[Macau]] - since 1984
*France - since 2005
*[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] - since 1994

Most of these stamps consist of [[first day cover]]s, commemorative sheets and multiple country brochures.

'''''Internationalism or Russification?''''' ({{lang-uk|Інтернаціоналізм чи русифікація?}}) is a book by [[ukrainians|Ukrainian]] writer and [[social activist]] [[Ivan Dziuba]], written in September-December 1965.

==History of writing==

The immediate impetus for writing this work were political repressions that took place in [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] in 1965 against the Ukrainian [[intellectuals]]. In August and September 1965 in [[Kiev]], [[Lviv]], [[Lutsk]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] and [[Ternopil]] about three dozen of young Ukrainian intellectuals  were arrested. On September 4 in Kiev during the premiere of the [[Sergei Parajanov]]'s movie ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' poets Vasyl Stus and Ivan Dziuba called for protesting against political repression.

==Content==

In the work ''Internationalism or Russification?'', written under the influence of those events, Dziuba analyzed from a Marxist position the national and cultural policy of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Ukraine]]. The author sent his work to the first Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Petro Shelest]], and to the Head of the Ukrainian SSR government, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], and its Russian translation - to the leadership of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU).

In ''Internationalism or Russification?'' Dziuba argued that during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule the CPSU had moved to the positions of [[Russian nationalism|Russian chauvinism]]. His argumentation the author built largely on quotations from the works of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and party documents of the 1920s. He believed that the policy of the CPSU, particularly in Ukraine, contradicts with the fundamental interests of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] people and contended that the solution is in returning  to [[Lenin's national policy|Lenin's principles of national policy]].

==Spread of the book==

The work ''Internationalism or Russification?'' spread in the ''[[samizdat]]'', and in February, 1968 it was published in the magazine ''The Contemporary'' (Сучасність).
Without permission and knowledge of the author the book was repeatedly issued outside of the Soviet Union in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] languages. In Ukraine, this work was legally published only in 1990 in the magazine ''Motherland'' (Вітчизна), and as a book it was first published in 1998.

==The reaction of the Soviet government==

The Soviet government announced ''Internationalism or Russification?'' as an Anti-Soviet work, and its distribution, storage or even just reading - as a crime. Dziuba lost his job, he was expelled from the [[Writer's Union of Ukraine|Writers' Union of Ukraine]] and faced harassment from the [[KGB]], and in 1972 was jailed for 18 months.

The '''Kalam languages''' are a small [[language family|family]] of languages in the [[Madang languages|Madang]] stock of New Guinea.

The languages are:
:[[Kalam language|Kalam]]–[[Tai Papuan language|Tai]], [[Kobon language|Kobon]].

They are famous for having perhaps the smallest numbers of [[lexical verb]]s of any languages in the world, with somewhere in the range of 100 to 120 verbs in the case of Kobon.

It is as yet unclear whether the [[Gants language]] is most closely related to the Kalam languages or is one of the [[Sogeram languages]].

[[File:Handwriting of Poet Kalapi.jpg|thumb|Handwriting of Kalapi (A letter, written to Monghi a.k.a. Shobhana]]
'''Sursinhji Takhtasinhji Gohil''' (1874–1900), popularly known by his pen name, '''Kalapi''' was a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] poet and the Thakor (prince) of [[Lathi, Gujarat|Lathi]] state in [[Gujarat]]. He is mostly known for his poems depicting his own [[pathos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Joseph T.

He lived in [[Lathi, Gujarat|Lathi]]-Gohilwad, which is located in the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[Gujarat]].

Sursinhji was born to the [[royal family]] of Lathi in 1874. His mother's name was Ramba. He had a very short life of 26 years, and died in 1900. He was educated at [[Rajkumar College, Rajkot|Rajkumar College]], [[Rajkot]]. He was married to two [[princess]]es. Rajba-Ramaba, the princess of [[Kutch]] - [[Roha Fort|Roha]], and Kesharba-Anandiba, the Princess of Saurashtra-Kotada at the age of 15. Ramaba was elder to Sursinhji by eight years, while Anandiba was elder to him by two years. When he was 20 years old, he fell in love with Shobhana, who was serving as a maid to his royal family.

It is believed that Kalapi's love for Shobhana became the reason of conflicts with Ramaba, and then the reason for his accidental death due to [[poison]]ing by his own wife.&lt;ref name="Datta1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1436|volume=2|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/rajkot/Kavi-Kalapis-birth-anniversary-celebrated/articleshow/7374519.cms|work=The Times of India|date=Jan 27, 2011|title=Kavi Kalapi's birth anniversary celebrated|accessdate =July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In spite of his short life, poet Kalapi's creation was immense and enormous. His creation includes about 250 [[poem]]s (including 15,000 verses). He has also given a number of [[prose]] writings. His 900 letters to his friends and wives brought the facts and truth. He not only used [[Gujarati language]] as his [[Media (communication)|medium]] to elaborate his own creation, but also translated four [[English novel]]s in Gujarati.

In his relatively short life, he still managed to mentor a minor number of budding poets, who carried on his style of writing, becoming very famous in their own right. The most prominent among these was [[Kavi Lalitji]], who was about the same age as Kalapi, and already an established poet, when he was invited to the Lathi Darbar as a tutor for the Royal children. He came under Kalapi's influence, the two became great friends, and [[Kavi Lalitji]] went on to become the Rajya Kavi (Royal Bard) of [[Lathi, Gujarat|Lathi]].

All of Kalapi's creations, reading, study and achievements were packed by Kavi Lalitji during the period of his age from 16 years to 26 years.

Kavi Kalapi had written poems in various Chhand of Gujarati language. Like Mandakranta, Shardulvikridit, Shikharini etc. To write poem in particular Chhand, one has to follow the structure of that chhand and the rules of chhandas poem. Kavi kalapi is the only poet who has written maximum number of poems in these chhands.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} ''Aapni Yadi'' is one of his best known ghazal in Gujarati literature.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

Today, a [[Kalapi Museum|museum]] has been set up in the present Lathi town, where visitors can gather more information about Kavi Kalapi's life and the history of Gohilwad Kingdom.

'''Kapingamarangi''' is a [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian language]] spoken in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. It had 3,000 native speakers in 1995.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; The language is closely related to the [[Nukuoro language]].

==Introduction==

===History===
The [[Kapingamarangi]] language is a language spoken in the Pacific by people from Kapingamarangi, the Pohnpei Island, and in the Pohnrakied village in Pohnpei. Kapingamarangi was first recorded on an expedition in 1557 by Spanish navigator Hernando de Grigalvan (Elbert, 1946). Kapingamarangi, also known as Kirinit, is categorized in the Austronesian language family, along with many other Pacific languages. Kapingamarangi is an atoll, which is located in the state of Pohnpei of the Federated States of Micronesia. In the country of Pohnpei,{{clarify|reason=Pohnpei is not a country|date=February 2015}} Kapingamarangi is the southernmost atoll of the country and of the Caroline Islands. The total area of the Kapingamarangi Island is {{convert|72|km2}}.{{citation needed|reason=There are several islands in Kapingamarangi atoll and the claim of 72 km^2 is much too large for the land area.|date=February 2015}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} The western reef rim of the islands gets almost submerged in water when the tides are high. The Kapingamarangi language is spoken not only on the atoll of Kapingamarangi, but also in the village of Pohnrakied, located on the island of Pohnpei. Pohnpei is the largest, highest, most populated, and the most developed island{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is also part of the Caroline Islands group. The island of Pohnpei is administered under the Federated States of Micronesia government.

===Population===
Kapingamarangi is viewed as another world, even to other cultures located inside of [[Micronesia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The people of Kapingamarangi live in towns, rather than being scattered out in little hamlets like other additional places located in Micronesia (Elbert, 1946).{{citation needed|reason=This citation is quite old and better information is available like FSM census data|date=February 2015}}  Kapingamarangi currently{{When|date=July 2016}} has three thousand total speakers: one thousand speakers on the atoll of Kapingamarangi and two thousand speakers in Pohnrakied village on Pohnpei. The people of Kapingamarangi are considered{{By whom|date=July 2016}} to be of Polynesian ethnicity; the other seven states of the Federated States of Micronesia are categorized as being Micronesian.{{clarify|reason=The FSM only has four states and Nukuoro is also a Polynesian outlier|date=February 2015}} The only language that is recognized as an official language in Micronesia is English.{{citation needed|reason=Is this a claim about the FSM national government or state governments? Pohnpei recognizes English and Pohnpeian as official languages in its constitution.|date=February 2015}} The language status of Kapingamarangi is "educational", which means that the language is in vigorous use, maintaining standardization and literature throughout a widespread system in institutions of education.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The language has been developed to a point that it is used and sustained in people's homes and around the community.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsmgov.org/info/culture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113142756/http://www.fsmgov.org/info/culture.html |archivedate=2013-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
'''A''', '''B''', '''D''', '''E''', '''G''', '''H''', '''I''', '''K''', '''L''', '''M''', '''N''', '''Ng''', '''O''', '''P''', '''T,''' '''U''', '''W'''

Long vowels are written with double vowels (Leiber &amp; Dikepa, 1974).

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Kapingamarangi has 18 [[consonants]] /p, pʰ, t, tʰ, k, kʰ, w, wʰ, h, hː, m, mʰ, n, nʰ, ŋ, ŋʰ, ɺ, ɺʰ/ (Leiber &amp; Dikepa, 1974).

===Vowels===
The main [[vowels]] in Kapingamarangi are /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ (Leiber &amp; Dikepa, 1974). In the Kapingamarangi language, the vowels can be described as long or short vowels. A long vowel means that the vowel sound is stressed more in a word when spoken. The long vowels are written by writing two of the same letters next to each other. Therefore, the Kapingamarangi language is composed of ten vowels (Lieber &amp; Dikepa, 1974).

ex. ʻʻduliʻʻ bird
ʻʻduliiʻʻ small, little

Kapingamarangi vowel phonemes have diphthongs because in Kapingamarangi language, it is possible to have any two vowels next to each other.{{citation needed|reason=A bold claim about the language that needs cited evidence|date=February 2015}} For example, the word ''eidu'' which means "spirit" has a diphthong with the letters /e/ and /i/ (Lieber &amp; Dikepa, 1974).

===Syllable structure===
The [[syllable structure]] of the Kapingamarangi language is VV, VVV, VCV, CVV, CCVV, CVCV, and CCVCV (Lieber &amp; Dikepa, 1974). In Kapingamarangi, like most Polynesian languages, it is impossible for a word to end in a consonant, but it is possible for there to be two consonants together, as long as it is the same letter.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Example: The term for un-groomed hair is ''libgo wwana''. In this term, the two (W’s) stand together in the word ''wwana''.

==Grammar==

===Basic word order===
There are three possible [[word order]]s in the Kapingamarangi language. The word order of Kapingamarangi is SVO (subject–verb–object), VSO (Verb Subject Object), or OSV (Object Verb Subject), (Elberts, 1948). SVO is the commonly used word order, followed by VSO, and finally OSV is the least used and is a very case in the language. The word order for questions is the same as they are for statements. In research for the grammar of Kapingamarangi, deciphering reasoning or specific uses for the alternative word orders are unsure.

ex.  Mee gu noho  I dono hale.
 He is staying at the house.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is another pivotal element to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi.{{According to whom|date=July 2016}} Morphology is the descriptive analysis of words (Elbert, 1948). The morphology of Kapingamarangi is extremely extensive.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=July 2016}} The word classes in Kapingamarangi are pronouns, possessives, demonstratives, verbs, nouns, adverbs, adjectives, negatives, particles, conjunctions, and interjections (Elbert, 1948).

Many verbs can take a [[prefix]], but even more verbs take a suffix. For example, a verb may have a prefix like ''haka-'' before a word, and a suffix like ''–ina'' after a word. Like the English language, adjectives follow nouns, and adverbs follow verbs, adjectives, and/or demonstratives. Negatives in Kapingamarangi immediately precede verbs or verb particles (Elbert, 1948). Conjunctions mark serial relationships, and interjections denote emotion (Elbert, 1948).

The [[pronouns]] in Kapingamarangi can be dual (two people), plural (more than two people), inclusive (including the addressee), or exclusive (excluding the addressee). Serial relationships are expressed by the pronoun ''mo'', which means "and" (Elbert, 1948). For example, "David and I" would be, "Kimaua mo David". The pronouns in the Kapingamarangi language are very different from the pronouns in the English language. The pronouns in Kapingamarangi are not gender specific. For example, ''Kinae'' means "him or her"; therefore the gender must be translated through the context of a sentence or conversation.

===Reduplication===
[[Reduplication]] is a common concept that appears in the Kapingamarangi language, and is relevant to understanding the grammar of Kapingamarangi. Reduplication is the repetition of a root word (Elbert, 1948).  The reduplication of Kapingamarangi can be achieved in two different fashions: partial and full reduplication. The fully reduplicated form is generated by the full repetition of the base form, while partial reduplication is generated by partial repetition of the base form (Lieber &amp; Dikepa, 1974). Reduplication usually depicts continued or repeated action (Elbert, 1948).  For example, ''tapa'' is a single flash of lightning, while ''tapatapa'' is repeated flashing. In Kapingamarangi, reduplication can be done with the first two syllables, or it can be done with the final two syllables. There is only one word in the lexicon of Kapingamarangi that displays a partially reduplicated form; the word ''baba'' is the only word that is partially reduplicated, and it reduplicates to the word ''babaa'' (Lieber &amp; Dikepa, 1974).

Examples:
* ''Tapa'' – single flash of lightning
** ''Tapatapa'' – repeated flashing
* ''Uii'' – pick fruit  
** ''Uuii'' – pick a bunch of fruits
* ''Waa'' – roar   
** ''Waawaa'' – repeated roaring
* ''Mahi'' – strength, power, energy 
** ''Mahimahi'' – hard to pull out

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous vocabulary===
{{clarify|reason=Unusual heading and word choice|date=February 2015}}
* gabadaa - "twitch or jerk"
* gaba - "hip"
* gabugabua - "bad weather"
* dule - "erection"
* dulii loo - "tiny"
* duuaganga - "coconut husk"
* gaalege - "dance
* doudou ="having sex"

===Loanwords===
The Kapingamarangi language has an influence of English in their community, because English is the official language of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Words from the English vocabulary were borrowed and transfigured into the Kapingamarangi lexicon.

Words derived from English:
* Madangaholu malama - "October"
* Hulu dau gee - "odd number"
* Daahi - "adopt"
* kaaman - "government"
* sii - "semen"
* lohongo - "office"
* Madangaholu mahiwa - "nineteen"

===Materials===
Kapingamarangi has access to many different materials. One of the materials that the Kapingamarangi language has access to is an online talking dictionary. It is a dictionary where one can enter a word in English and it will automatically translate it to Kapingamarangi.{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} Many words in this dictionary also have a vocal response on how to pronounce the word, which is why it is called a talking dictionary. This is a resource{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} because it not only provides visual correlations between the English and Kapinga translation for a word, but it also has vocal responses so that scholars of Kapingamarangi can hear a word and how to correctly pronounce it.

Kapingamarangi also has access to a variety of books, including dictionaries, books that contain linguistic information, and even books about the atoll of Kapingamarangi. Many native speakers were involved in the translation project that resulted in the Kapingamarangi Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Its Our Bible|url = https://vimeo.com/73345277|website = Vimeo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are resources because they are full of information and are highly reliable.{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} Websites like Facebook and [[YouTube]] also contain information on Kapingamarangi. The Facebook page is a Micronesia Language Revitalization Workshop page and it contains information about a workshop that was held all throughout Micronesia, including Kapingamarangi.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} There is a YouTube video of an interview with a speaker who is bilingual in both English and Kapinga and he explains the importance of speaking Kapingamarangi and language revitalization (Heinrich, 2013).

{{clarify|text=In accordance to [[intergenerational transmission]]|reason=What does "in accordance" mean here?|date=April 2018}}, it is likely that Kapingamarangi is being transmitted to children, because Kapingamarangi is in {{clarify|text=revitalization mode|reason=What is "revitalization mode"?|date=February 2015}}, and the number of speakers keeps increasing.

'''[[Ivory Coast]]''' ({{lang-fr|Côte d'Ivoire}}) is a [[multilingual]] country with an estimated 78 languages currently spoken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CI Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International.] (Page on "Languages of Côte d’Ivoire." This page indicates that one of the 79 no longer has any speakers.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[official language]], [[French language|French]], was introduced during the [[History of Ivory Coast#French colonial era|colonial period]]. This language is taught in schools and serves as a [[lingua franca]] in the country.

The seventy or so indigenous languages fall into five main branches of the [[Niger–Congo]] family. In the southeastern quadrant are [[Kwa languages]], some such as [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]] and [[Anyin language|Anyin]] (2–3 million and 1 million speakers) part of a [[dialect continuum]] with [[Akan language|Ashante]] in Ghana, others such as [[Attié language|Attié]] (half a million) more divergent. Baoulé is spoken east of [[Lake Kossou]] and at the capital [[Yamoussoukro]], and Anyi along the Ghanaian border. In the southwestern quadrant are [[Kru languages]], such as [[Bété language|Bete]] and We ([[Guere language|Gure]]/[[Wobe language|Wobe]]), half a million apiece, and [[Dida language|Dida]] (a quarter million), related to the languages of Liberia. In the northwest, along the Guinean border and across to Lake Kossou in the center of the country, are [[Mande languages]], such as [[Dan language|Dan]] (1 million speakers) and [[Guro language|Guro]] (half a million, on the lake). The lake and the ear ASnna divide the Kwa east of the country from the Kru and Mande west. Across the center north are various [[Senufo languages]], such as [[Cebaara language|Senari]] (1 million speakers). In the northeast corner, surrounding [[Comoé National Park]], are a quarter million speakers each of [[Kulango language|Kulango]], the [[Gur language]] [[Lobi language|Lobi]], and the Mande language [[Jula language|Jula]] ({{lang-fr|Dioula}}), which is a ''[[lingua franca]]'' of neighboring [[Burkina Faso]].

There are also three million or so speakers of immigrant languages, mostly from neighboring countries and above all from Burkina Faso. Ethnic tensions in the north between immigrant and native Ivoirians, as well as between the Mande/Senoufo north and the Kru/Kwa south, were a large factor in the [[Ivorian Civil War (disambiguation)|Ivorian civil war]]s.

Education for the deaf in Ivory Coast uses [[American Sign Language]], introduced by the deaf American missionary [[Andrew Foster (educator)|Andrew Foster]].

'''Lawu''' (autonym: ''la21 wu21''&lt;ref name="Yang2011"/&gt;) is a highly endangered unclassified [[Loloish language]] of [[Yunnan]], China. It has about 50 elderly speakers in Jiuha village 旧哈村,&lt;ref name="ynszxc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=250326|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=新平县水塘镇旧哈村民委员会|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shuitang district 水塘镇, [[Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County|Xinping County]], Yuxi Prefecture, [[Yunnan]] Province. There are possibly also some speakers in Jiujia District 九甲乡, [[Zhenyuan Yi, Hani and Lahu Autonomous County|Zhenyuan County]], [[Pu'er City|Pu'er Prefecture]], Yunnan Province.&lt;ref name="Yang2011"&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2012-067_lwu.pdf Yang (2011)] (ISO 639-3 documentation)&lt;/ref&gt; Lawu speakers are currently classified by the Chinese government as [[Lahu people|Lahu]], but were formerly classified as [[Yi people|Yi]].

==Classification==
Cathryn Yang (2012)&lt;ref name="Yang2012"&gt;Yang, Cathryn. 2012.

In ''Linguistic Discovery'', Volume 10, Issue 2, Year 2012. Hanover, NH: Dartmouth College. {{doi|10.1349/PS1.1537-0852.A.410}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Lawu is most likely a [[Central Loloish languages|Central Ngwi]] language, but notes that it does not classify with Lalo, Lahu, or the Lisoid (Lisu, Lipo, Lolopo) languages.

Andrew Hsiu (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2017. ''[https://zenodo.org/record/1249178/files/Lawu_languages.pdf The Lawu languages: footprints along the Red River valley corridor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Lawu is related to [[Awu language|Awu]] of Xiaopingzi 小坪子, Daping Township 大坪乡, [[Yuanyang County, Yunnan]], China&lt;ref name="ynszxc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=197147|website=ynszxc.gov.cn|title=元阳县大坪乡大坪村委会小坪子村|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is documented in Lu &amp; Lu (2011).&lt;ref name="Lu2011"&gt;Lu Peng 卢鹏; Lu Wei 路伟. 2011. 国际哈尼/阿卡区域文化调查: 中国元阳县大坪哈尼族阿邬人文化实录. Kunming: Yunnan People's Press 云南人民出版社. {{ISBN|978-7-222-07999-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Lawu and Awu form a ''Lawu'' or ''[[Lawoish languages|Lawoish]]'' language branch. The linguistic evidence suggests that the ancestors of the Awu had migrated down the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] valley from further up northwest, and arrived at their present location after migrating downstream.

[[Lewu language|Lewu]], which is currently extinct, may have been related to Lawu, but classification is uncertain due to the paucity of data.

A '''lifestyle center''' is a [[shopping center]] or mixed-used commercial development that combines the traditional retail functions of a [[shopping mall]] with [[leisure]] amenities oriented towards upscale consumers. Lifestyle centers, which were first labeled as such by [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] developers [[Poag and McEwen]] in the late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2116246|title="The Mall Goes Undercover", Slate.com|accessdate=2006-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged as a retailing trend in the late 1990s, are sometimes labeled "boutique malls". They are often located in affluent [[suburbia|suburban]] areas.

The proliferation of lifestyle centers in the United States accelerated in the 2000s, with number going from 30 in 2002 to 120 at the end of 2004.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/11/news/fortune500/retail_lifestylecenter/|title=CNN article: "Not a mall, it's a lifestyle center"|accessdate=2006-05-26 | date=2005-01-11 | first=Parija | last=Bhatnagar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifestyle centers are sometimes depicted as occupying the upscale end of the spectrum of commercial development, opposite to the [[outlet mall]] which typically caters with marked down prices.

Lifestyle centers typically require less land and may generate higher revenue margins, generating close to 500 dollars per square foot, compared to an average of 330 dollars per square foot for a traditional mall, according to the president of Poag and McEwen.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; Other advantages lifestyle centers have over traditional enclosed malls are savings on heating and cooling and quicker access for customers. Lifestyle centers typically look like strip shopping centers turned outside in, and the formal storefronts don't face parking areas like in strip centers, but landscaped park-like pedestrian areas, with storefronts facing each other across the pedestrian walkway or a low volume parkingless two-lane road. A two-lane road might go through the inside of the center.&lt;ref name=FtWayne&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lipp |first1=Linda |title=Fort Wayne, Ind., Pioneered 'Lifestyle' Shopping Center Trend in U.S. |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=36903ded-972f-40c5-af5a-d30156ba748d%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#AN=2W61796551351&amp;db=plh |accessdate=12 November 2018 |publisher=Ft.

{{Property law}}

A '''listing contract''' (or '''listing agreement''') is a [[contract]] between a [[real estate broker]] and an owner of [[real property]] granting the broker the authority to act as the owner's agent in the sale of the property.&lt;ref name="investopedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/listing-agreement.asp | title=Listing Agreement | publisher=Investopedia, LLC | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the broker is a member of the [[National Association of Realtors]], the agreement must include all of the following terms:

#A beginning date and a termination date.
#The ''list price'' at which the property will be offered for sale.
#The amount of compensation offered to the broker, whether it is in the form of a flat fee or percentage of the sales price.
#The terms and conditions under which the brokerage fee shall be paid by the seller.
#Authorizes the broker to co-operate with other brokers as sub-agents or buyer's agents and details the compensation to be offered to those brokers in the event they procure a buyer.
#Authorizes the broker to reveal or not to reveal the existence of offers previously received.

In addition, other terms which may appear in the agreement can include:

*Authorization to the broker to post a sign, to advertise the property, and to put a lockbox on the door, as well seller's obligations to advise the broker on the condition of the property, and broker's obligations to advise the seller about regulations and laws which may affect the sale.

Typically, separate listing agreements exist for the sale of residential property, for land, and for commercial or business property.
&lt;ref name="Emeraldbb"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://emeraldbb.ca/small-business-for-sale-a-brief-primer/ | title=Things to know before posting business for sale | publisher=Emerald Business Board | accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2016}}

Upon listing the property, the real estate agency tries to obtain a buyer for the property and, in consideration of successfully finding a satisfactory buyer, the broker anticipates receiving a commission (fee) for the services the brokerage provided.

==Payment of a commission or fee==
Although the terms of the contract could vary, usually the payment of a commission (or fee) to the brokerage is contingent upon:
*the successful negotiation of a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] between a satisfactory buyer and seller and the subsequent ability and willingness of the buyer to close the deal, or
*finding a satisfactory buyer who is ready, willing, and able to pay the full listing price (or more) for the real estate for sale without any contingencies.

If the seller refuses to sell the real estate when one of the above two conditions applies, it is typically considered that the real estate agent has done their job of finding a satisfactory buyer and the seller must still pay the commission, although the details are determined by the listing contract.  Unless [[closing (real estate)|closing]] (or "settlement" or "close of escrow", as it is known in some parts of the country) is a condition of the listing agreement, the buyer's failure to complete the transaction may not require the seller to pay a commission to the broker.

The commission is usually a percentage of the sales price of the property ranging from  2 or 3% up to about 10%, but usually in the range of about 3 - 7% for houses.  The commission could also be a flat fee or some combination of flat fee and percentage, based on the rate you negotiate.  Commission rates and fees are negotiable and not regulated. The average days to sale in your market, advertising, labor costs, length of term, and competition may influence the rate acceptable by the listing real estate broker before entering a listing agreement.

The commission is paid by the seller to the listing real estate broker, who will then compensate their listing agent and any co-operating brokers/agents from this commission by separate agreements with them.

==Listing price and final contract price==
The listing contract typically also includes a '''listing price''' for the property and a date of [[wikt:expiration|expiration]] by which the contract expires.  However, if the property is sold at a lower or higher price, the seller pays a commission at a proportionally lower or higher amount.  If the seller does not accept a price lower than the listing price, then the broker will have to wait until a satisfactory sale to earn the commission.

In the event of multiple offers being presented, the seller may accept whichever offer is most suitable to him/her, even if the price is not the highest.  The percentage commission will be paid according to the accepted price.  The seller, often in concurrence with the real estate agent, may choose to accept an offer that is lower than the highest offer for various reasons, such as terms or contingencies in the purchase contract offered or perceived differences in financial qualification of the competing buyers.

Typically, the real estate agent has the experience and data to determine a suitable listing price for the seller's property and will recommend a listing price to the seller.  The seller can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract.  If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.

==Expiration date==
Listing a property commonly incurs certain expenses for the listing broker and takes some time and effort for the listing salesperson. To make it worthwhile, they want a certain minimum listing time period to have a good chance of selling the property.  However, the listing contract must have an expiration date.  A typical listing period is often three to six months. If the property is not sold or under a [[real estate contract|purchase contract]] by then, the seller may decide to re-list the property, perhaps with a different listing price, with the same or a different broker or agent, or not list it at all.  The listing of the property can start at a date later than the date the listing contract is signed to allow the seller time to prepare the property for showing or sale.

==Types of listing contracts==
There can be several types of listing contracts:

*'''Exclusive right to sell''': The seller must pay the brokerage a commission if, by the expiration date in the listing contract, the real estate is sold, regardless of whether the buyer is obtained through the agency or not.  Even if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, a commission is still owed to the brokerage.  Furthermore, the seller cannot list the property with any other broker until the listing expires with the property unsold.

:Brokers who are REALTORS and, thus, are members of [[National Association of Realtors|NAR]] are obliged to enter the property into the local [[Multiple Listing Service|MLS]] system and offer compensation to co-operating brokers.

*'''Exclusive Agency''': The seller can only list the property with one brokerage until the listing contract expires with the property unsold.  The seller must pay the broker a commission if the real estate is sold to a buyer obtained through that brokerage.  By agreement, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.  Since there will be no co-operating broker involved, the property will not be listed in the MLS.
*'''Open Agency''': A seller can enter into an agreement to sell their property with more than one brokerage in open agency listings.  The seller must pay a commission only to the brokerage which brings the buyer for the real estate.  Typically, if the seller finds the buyer him/herself, the seller does not have to pay a commission.&lt;ref name = "investopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nar3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realtor.org/handbook-on-multiple-listing-policy/key-definitions/section-3-definitions-of-various-types-of-listing-agreements | title=Section 3: Definitions of Various Types of Listing Agreements | publisher=National Association of Realtors | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">'''Louis de Paor''' (born 1961) is a well-known poet in the Irish language. Born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in 1961 and educated at [[Coláiste an Spioraid Naoimh]], de Paor edited the Irish language journal [[Innti]], founded in 1970 by [[Michael Davitt]], [[Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill]], [[Liam Ó Muirthile]] and [[Gabriel Rosenstock]]. He was awarded a PhD in [[Modern Irish]] from the [[National University of Ireland]] in 1986 for his thesis on [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]].

He and his family emigrated to [[Australia]] in 1987 and lived in [[Melbourne]], where he wrote, gave poetry readings and broadcast in Irish on the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (a network set up for speakers of ethnic languages). He was given scholarships by the [[Australia Council]] in 1990, 1991 and 1995.

He returned to [[Ireland]] in 1996, and is now the Director of the Centre for Irish Studies at [[NUI Galway]].

De Paor has worked alongside several other Irish language writers, such as [[Seán Ó Tuama]], with whom he edited a twentieth century anthology of poetry in Irish. He has also published academic works.

==Poetry==
De Paor has had considerable success in the [[Oireachtas]] literary competitions: his first collection, ''Próca solais is luatha'' (BÁC: Coiscéim, 1988), won ''Duais an Ríordánaigh'', a prize which he has won several times since. Among his other collections are ''30 dán'' (BÁC: [[Coiscéim]], 1992), ''Corcach agus dánta eile'' (BÁC: Coiscéim, 1999) and ''Agus rud eile de'' (BÁC: Coiscéim, 2002).

Two collections emerged from his Australian sojourn: ''Aimsir bhreicneach / Freckled weather'' (Canberra: Leros Press, 1993) and ''Ríleanna báistí'' (Indreabhán: [[Cló Iar-Chonnachta]], 1992). His most recent collection is ''Agus Rud Eile De/ And Another Thing'', published by Cló Iar-Chonnachta (2010).

His style, characterised originally by lightness, clarity and directness, has become darker and more complex, though he remains to some extent a "public" poet. Much of his work has been published bilingually.

==Artistic collaborations==
De Paor has collaborated with such  traditional musicians as the piper [[Ronan Browne]] and the Irish-Egyptian [[Sean-nós song|sean-nós]] singer [[Naisrín Elsafty]].&lt;ref&gt;Another Thing... {{cite web |url=http://mayomo.com/83963-tedxgalway-louis-de-paor-ronan-browne-naisrin-elsafty-and-another-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507154424/http://www.mayomo.com/83963-tedxgalway-louis-de-paor-ronan-browne-naisrin-elsafty-and-another-thing/ |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }} Accessed 7 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maonan language''' is a [[Kam–Sui language]] spoken mainly in [[Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County]], [[Hechi]], northern [[Guangxi]] by the [[Maonan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Grammar of Maonan|last=Lu|first=Tian Qiao|publisher=[[Universal Publishers (USA)|Universal Publishers]]|location=Boca Raton, Florida|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59942-971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Approximately half of all Maonan people are capable of speaking Maonan. In addition to this, many Maonan also speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or a [[Zhuang language]]. About 1/3 of all people who self-identify as Maonan are concentrated in the southern [[Guizhou]] province. They speak a mutually unintelligible dialect commonly called ''Yanghuang'', which is more common known as the [[Then language]] in Western literature. The Maonan do not have a writing system.

Other than [[Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County]] in [[Guangxi]], Maonan is also spoken in the following locations.&lt;ref name="gx"&gt;Guangxi Minority Languages Orthography Committee. 2008. ''Vocabularies of Guangxi ethnic languages [广西民族语言方音词汇]''. Beijing: Nationalities Publishing House [民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Du'an Yao Autonomous County]], [[Guangxi]]
*[[Yizhou District, Hechi|Yizhou]], [[Guangxi]]
*[[Libo County]], [[Guizhou]]
*[[Pingtang County]], [[Guizhou]]

==Phonology==
Maonan is a tonal language with 8 tones (Lu 2008:90–91), featuring an SVO clause construction (Lu 2008:169). For example, ''man'' (he/she) ''shoot'' (drink) ''ka:u'' (wine) "He/She drinks wine", ''man'' (he/she) ''ba:i'' (go) ''hə'' (market) "He/She goes to the market", etc.

==Syntax==
Maonan displays a head-first modification structure, i.e. the modifier occurring after the modifier (Lu 2008:170). For example, ''ka:u'' (wine) ''hulia:ng'' (broomcorn) "broomcorn wine", ''mu'' (pig) ''la:u'' (big) "big pig", ''nok'' (bird) ''vin'' (fly) "flying bird", among others. Occasionally, a head-final modification structure is also possible with the involvement of a possessive particle (P.P.) ''di'', e.g. ''ya:n'' (house/family) ''nda:u'' (we/our) ''di'' (P.P.) ''bo'' (buffalo) "Our family's buffalo" (cf. the more common ''bo ya:n nda:u'')  (''ibid''. pp173–174).

'''Mirjaqip Dulatuli''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]: Міржақып Дулатұлы, [[Russia]]n: Миржакып Дулатов (1885–1935), also known as '''Mir Yakub Dulatov''', was a [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] [[poet]], [[writer]] and one of [[leader]]s of [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[nationalist]] [[Alash Orda]] [[government]]. He also is known to have used the pen names ''Madiyar'' and ''Arghyn''.&lt;ref name="Uyama"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tomohiko |last=Uyama |title=The Geography of Civilizations: Chapter 3-A Spatial Analysis of the Kazakh Intelligentsia's Activities, From the Mid-Nineteenth to the Early Twentieth Century |url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/98summer/pdf/uyama.pdf |date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dulatuli was born on November 25, 1885 in the [[village]] of [[Sarikopa]], [[Kostanay Province]]. He was from [[Middle jüz]], Argin [[tribe]]. He lost his mother, Demesh, at the age of two and his father, Dulat, at the age of 12. He received early education in the traditional village school. In 1897, Dulatuli enrolled in a Kazakh-[[Russia]]n high school and graduated in 1902 as a village [[teacher]]. In 1904, he joined Akhmet Baytursinuli and Alikhan Bokeikhanov in Karkaraly. Under the influence of these two leaders of emerging Kazakh reformist nationalist movement, he developed an anti-colonial, anti-Russian worldview.

He moved to St. Petersburg in 1907 as a delegate of Kazakh Constitutional Democratic Party. In St. Petersburg, he published his first poem in the Kazakh journal "Serke", which ran only one issue. The poem was entitled ''Jastarga'' ("to the Youth").&lt;br /&gt; He contributed another article, ''Bizdin Maksatimiz'' ("Our Objective"), to the second issue of the journal, which was never published.

==Political activities==
Mirjaqip's political formation was greatly maturated when he published his first poetry book, ''Oyan! Qazaq,'' "Wake up! Kazakh" in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/state/teacher/dulatov/ Мир-Якуб Дулатов]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was immediately confiscated. He republished ''Oyan! Qazaq'' in 1911 and returned to the Turgay oblast after the publication of the book.

Meanwhile, Dulatuli published his first novel ''Baqitsiz Jamal,'' "Jamal the Unfortunate" in 1910. Baqitsiz Jamal has been the first novel in the contemporary Kazakh literature. The book narrates the story of oppressed Kazakh women.

Thus, in early 1910s, Dulatuli emerges as a leader of emerging Kazakh reformism and nationalist movement. His publications puts him under Russian surveillance, investigations and intimidations. Under Tsarist Russian surveillance, Dulatuli could not have a steady job or settle down in a town for a long time. He was arrested in Semey in 1911 and served one and half years prison term.

After his release, Dulatuli regularly contributed to Kazakh language journals [[Ay Qap|Ayqap]] and [[Qazaq (journal)|Qazaq]] until 1918 when ''Qazaq'' was closed by the Kerensky government. In his essays and poems Dulatuli criticized socio-economic, political conditions of Kazakhs under imperial administration. He also published another poetry, ''Azamat,'' "Citizen" in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Asur Ozdemir, Kazak Turklerinin Buyuk Edibi, Mirjakip Dulatuli, Bilim ve Kültür Dergisi (bilig-3/Fall, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dulatuli was one of the leaders of [[Alash Orda|Alash Orda Government]] which was formed to promote [[Alash Autonomy|Kazakh autonomy]] under the [[Menshevik]] government. Alash leaders, including Baytursunov and Dulatuli, aligned with the Whites, declared independence of Kazakhstan and fought against [[Bolsheviks]] between December 1917-May 1919. When the leader of the Whites, Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, turned down requests of Alash leaders for help, the Kazakh nationalists realigned with the Bolsheviks expecting autonomy under Bolshevik government. In 1920, autonomous socialist republic was established and Alash leaders participated in local government.

Dulatuli worked as an editor and teacher under Bolshevik government. In 1928, he was arrested on nationalism charges and died in [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]] labour camp in 1935.

==Legacy==
Dulatuli was rehabilitated post-humously in 1988. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of modern Kazakh [[literature]], and a leader of Kazakh nationalism.

The first novel in Kazakh literature is "Miserable Jamal" ("Бақытсыз Жамал"). The author describes Jamal, a Kazakh girl, who becomes a victim of patriarchal- feudal traditions and customs, and exposing the fight between old traditions and new generation on this basis. The novel is celebrated for clear depiction of a feeling of equality, among rising young people of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Қирабаев Серік Тәуелсіздік Рухымен Астана: "Фолиант", 2002, 35 page&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nganasan language''' (formerly called {{lang|ru|тавгийский}}, ''tavgiysky'', or {{lang|ru|тавгийско-самоедский}}, ''tavgiysko-samoyedsky'' in Russian; from the [[ethnonym]] {{lang|ru|тавги}}, ''tavgi'') is a moribund [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic language]] spoken by the [[Nganasan people]]. In 2010 it was spoken by only 120 out of 860 Nganasan people in the southwestern and central parts of the [[Taymyr Peninsula]].

==Classification==
Nganasan is the most divergent language of the [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic branch]] of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]] (Janhunen 1998). There are two main [[dialect]]s, Avam ({{lang|ru|авамский говор}}, ''avamsky govor'') and Vadeyev ({{Lang-ru|вадеевский говор|translit=vadeyevsky govor}}). Vocabulary can be traced to elements of the unknown substrate origin.

==Phonology==
The language has 10 vowels and about 20 consonant phonemes.

== Grammar ==
=== Morphology ===
==== Nouns ====
Nouns in Nganasan have the grammatical categories of [[grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual, plural), [[grammatical case|case]] (nominative, genitive, accusative, lative, locative, elative, prolative, comitative) and [[Possession (linguistics)|possessivity]] (non-possessive versus possessive forms). Nganasan lacks determiners; however, the possessive forms of second person singular and third person singular can be used to express definiteness (Katzschmann, 2008).

==== Pronouns ====
Nganasan has personal, demonstrative, interrogative, negative and determinative pronouns. Personal pronouns are not inflected: their grammatical case forms coincide and their local case forms are expressed by the corresponding possessed forms of the postposition '''''na-'''''. Other pronouns are inflected like nouns (Helimski, 1998).

==== Verbs ====
Verbs agree with their subjects in person and number, and have three conjugation types. Like other Samoyedic languages, Nganasan has the opposition of perfective and imperfective verbs.

''''' Conjugation '''''

The subjective conjugation is used when there is no object or the object is focused. The objective conjugation is used with transitive words. The reflexive conjugation is used for some intransitive verbs. Each conjugation type has its own personal endings. There are three subtypes of objective conjugation endings that correspond to object number.

''''' Mood '''''

Nganasan has a broad mood paradigm with nine forms: indicative, imperative, interrogative, inferential, renarratve, irrealis, optative, admissive-cohortive, debitive, abessive and prohibitive. Mood forms are mostly built with the help of affixation but special particles are also sometimes used. All mood forms, except the imperative, have the same personal suffixes. Tenses are distinguished in the indicative, imperative and interrogative moods (Tereščenko, 1979).

''''' Aspect and tense '''''

Most corresponding imperfective and perfective stems have the same root, but in rare cases the roots can be different. The aspectual opposition between imperfective and perfective verbs remains semantic in most verbal forms. However, in the indicative mood it is used to express present continuous and present perfect meanings, respectively. In this case, the opposition is present formally: imperfective verbs take imperfective suffixes and the perfective ones have the perfective suffixes (Helimski, 1998). Imperfective verbs can also express future meanings. These forms are not considered tense in the strict tense. The proper tense forms of past and future include past, past perfect, future, future-in-the past (Katzschmann, 2008).

=== Syntax ===
==== Word order ====
The dominating word order in Nganasan is SOV, similar to other Samoyedic languages. However, Nganasan is considered to exhibit more freedom in word order than other languages of its group. According to Tereščenko (1979), other types of word orders are used for shifting the sentence focus, especially in emphatic speech. The focused constituent usually immediately precedes the verb. Wagner-Nagy (2010) suggests that Nganasan is similar to Hungarian in its behavior, in that its word order is determined by pragmatic factors rather than being fixed.

On the phrase level, the attributes within the noun phrase usually precede the noun and become focused when placed after it. Numerals and adjectives agree with the heads in case, and adjectives also agree with the head in number. The case agreement is only complete in grammatical cases; in locative cases the attribute gets genitive form. There are no prepositions in Nganasan, postpositions are composite parts of words and also require the attributes in genitive cases. Possession is expressed with genitive construction or by a possessive suffix attached to the possessed (Helimski, 1998; Katzschmann, 2008).

Nganasan is a pro-drop language: pronominal subjects are often omitted when the verb conjugation type is subjective (Tereščenko, 1979).

==== Negation ====
Standard negation is expressed by negative auxiliary ('''''ńi-''''') followed by the main verb in connegative form marked with ʔ, e.g. '''''ńi-ndɨ-m konɨʔ''''' "I do not go". All inflectional markers are taken by the negation auxiliary (Gusev, 2015). Objects in the form of personal, negative or demonastrative pronouns can be inserted between the negative auxiliary and the main verb (Wagner-Nagy, 2011). There are a few negative verbs other than '''''ni-''''', such as '''''kasa''''' — "nearly", '''''ləði''''' — "vainly", '''''əku''''' — "maybe", and '''''ŋuəli''''' — "of course", but their functionality is restricted, with only '''''ni-''''' having a full paradigm.

Existential sentences are negated with the negative existential predicate '''''d'aŋku''''' or its derivative stem '''''d'anguj-'''''. '''''D'aŋku''''' can only be used in present indicative as it behaves like a noun: it takes nominal predicative endings. D'anguj- (a composite of d'aŋku and ij- "be") is used for all other tense/mood combinations.

==== Subordination ====
Subordination is typically formed by constructions with non-finite verbal forms. Such constructions are usually placed before the constituents they modify. The relative construction is always placed immediately before the modified constituent, whereas other types of constructions allow other constituents to interfere. The word order in such construction is the same as in simple sentences (Tereščenko, 1973).

==== Coordination ====
Coordination is most often achieved by means of intonation. Sometimes pronominal and adverbial derivatives can be used as conjunctions. For example, adverb ŋonə 'also' can be used as conjunction. The category of conjunctions may be undergoing formation under the influence of Russian (Tereščenko, 1973).

==History==
The ''American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style'' cites usage of "people of colour" as far back as 1796. It was initially used to refer to light-skinned people of mixed African and European heritage.&lt;ref name=houghton356/&gt; French [[Colonialism|colonists]] used the term ''[[gens de couleur]]'' ("people of color") to refer to people of mixed African and European descent who were freed from [[slavery]] in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brickhouse|first=Anna|page=91|year=2009|title=Transamerican Literary Relations and the Nineteenth-Century Public Sphere|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521101011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Carolina and other parts of the [[Deep South]], this term was used to distinguish between slaves who were mostly "[[Black people|black]]" or "[[negro]]" and free people who were primarily "[[mulatto]]" or "[[mixed race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Powers, Bernard. ''Black Charlestonians: a Social History 1822-1885.'' University of Arkansas Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War]], "colored" was used as a label exclusively for black Americans, but the term eventually fell out of favor by the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=houghton356/&gt; 

Although American activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] used the term "citizens of color" in 1963, the phrase in its current meaning did not catch on until the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=safire&gt;{{cite web|author=[[William Safire]]|title=On language: People of color|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=November 20, 1988|accessdate=2008-03-21|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DD153CF933A15752C1A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Black Press at 150", editorial, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 18, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the term "person of color" was introduced in the United States in order to counter the condescension implied by the terms "non-white" and "[[minority group|minority]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher's Guide for in the Shadow of Race: Growing Up As a Multiethnic, Multicultural, and "Multiracial" American|publisher=Routledge|author=Christine Clark, Teja Arboleda|page=17|date=1999|quote=The term People of Color emerged in reaction to the terms "non-white" and "minority." … The term people of color attempts to counter the condescension implied in the other two." }}&lt;/ref&gt; and racial justice activists in the U.S., influenced by radical theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]], popularized it at this time.&lt;ref name=immigrants/&gt; By the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was in wide circulation.&lt;ref name=immigrants&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=227| author= [[Rinku Sen]] |title= Are Immigrants and Refugees People of Color? |publisher= [[ColorLines Magazine|ColorLines]] |date= |accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both anti-racist activists and academics sought to move the understanding of race beyond the black-white dichotomy then prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.indigenouspeople.net/blackwht.htm|title=Seeing More Than Black &amp; White|publisher=Z Magazine|date=May 1994|author=[[Elizabeth Martínez|Elizabeth Martinez]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "women of color" was developed and introduced for wide use by a group of black women activists at the National Women's Conference in 1977.&lt;ref name="socimages-woc"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=Lisa |title=Loretta Ross on the Phrase "Women of Color" |url=https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2011/03/26/loreta-ross-on-the-phrase-women-of-color/ |website=Sociological Images |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used as a method of communicating solidarity between non-white women that was, according to [[Loretta Ross]], not based on "biological destiny" but instead a political act of naming themselves.&lt;ref name="socimages-woc" /&gt;

==Political significance==
According to Stephen Saris, in the United States there are two main [[racial segregation in the United States|racial divides]]. The first is the "black–white" divide, which he describes as "basically anti-black". The second racial divide is the one "between whites and everyone else" with whites being "narrowly construed" and everyone else being called "people of color".&lt;ref name=Zack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zack|first1=Naomi|title=American Mixed Race: The Culture of Microdiversity|date=1995|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0847680134|pages=55-56|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=G9vLpONQLXMC|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term "people of color" includes vastly different people with only the common distinction of not being white, it draws attention to the fundamental role of [[racialization]] in the United States. Joseph Tuman argues that the term "people of color" is attractive because it unites disparate racial and ethnic groups into a larger collective in [[solidarity]] with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tuman|first=Joseph S.|title=Communicating terror|publisher=SAGE, |date=2003|isbn=978-0-7619-2765-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Rt_DOyCumAC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=definition+%22person+of+color%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=2000&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=HNgLSp7zCpvuzQSwkdS6DA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the term "person of color", especially in the United States, is often associated with the [[social justice]] movement.&lt;ref name="AdamsBell1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurianne Adams|author2=Lee Anne Bell|author3=Pat Griffin|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-BEnvaodCoC&amp;pg=PA98|year=1997|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-91057-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Style guide]]s from the American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style,&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford Graduate School of Business Writing and Editing Style Guide|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/styleguide/pdf/print_styleguide.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915153112/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/styleguide/pdf/print_styleguide.pdf|archivedate=6 September 2016|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mount Holyoke College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Style Guide|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/communications/editorial.html#P|accessdate=18 September 2010|author=Mount Holyoke College}}&lt;/ref&gt; all recommend the term "person of color" over other alternatives. Unlike "colored", which refers only to blacks and is often considered [[wikt:offensive#English|offensive]], "person of color" and its variants refer inclusively to all non-European peoples—often with the notion that there is political solidarity among them—and "are virtually always considered terms of pride and respect"; others find the phrase offensive because it implies that neither whites nor Caucasians have any color.&lt;ref name=houghton356/&gt;

==Criticism==
Some critics, both whites and non-whites, of the term object to its lack of specificity and find the phrase racially offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/phrase-people-person-of-colour-bme-black-woman-women-different-experiences-race-racism-a7868586.html|title=I am no ‘person of colour’, I am a black African woman|author= Adebola Lamuye|date=31 July 2017|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that term lessens the focus on individual issues facing different racial groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/black-women-people-of-colour-racism-beyonce-coachella-black-lives-matter-a8316561.html|title=As a black woman, I hate the term 'people of colour'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, as the only group excluded, is it inherently discriminatory towards white people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spps.org/cms/lib010/MN01910242/Centricity/Domain/125/white_is_a_color.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Ronan Point - Daily Telegraph.jpg|thumb|The partially-collapsed Ronan point, an example of a Plattenbau]] --&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0128-310, Berlin, Marzahn, Neubaugebiet, Wohnblocks.jpg|thumb|{{lang|de|Berlin-[[Marzahn]]|italic=no}}, the largest East German {{lang|de|Neubaugebiet}} (1987)]]
'''{{lang|de|Plattenbau}}''' (plural: {{lang|de|Plattenbauten}}, {{lang-de|Platte + Bau|lit=panel/slab' + 'building/ construction}}) is a building constructed of large, [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] [[concrete slab]]s. The word is a compound of {{lang|de|Platte}} (in this context: panel) and {{lang|de|Bau}} (building).

Although {{lang|de|Plattenbauten}} are often considered to be typical of [[East Germany]], the prefabricated construction method was used extensively in [[West Germany]] and elsewhere, particularly in [[public housing]] (see [[tower block]]). In English the building method is also called '''large panel system-building''' or LPS.

==History==
Prefabrication was pioneered in the [[Netherlands]] following [[World War I]], based on construction methods developed in the [[United States]]. The first German use of plattenbau construction is what is now known as the ''Splanemann-Siedlung'' in Berlin's [[Lichtenberg]] district, constructed in 1926–1930.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luise-berlin.de/bms/bmstxt97/9704detb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These two- and three-storey apartment houses were assembled of locally cast slabs, inspired by the Dutch ''Betondorp'' in [[Watergraafsmeer]], a suburb of [[Amsterdam]].

In [[East Germany]], Plattenbau areas have been designated as ''Neubaugebiet'' (''"New development area"''). Virtually all new residential buildings since the 1960s were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively inexpensive way to curb the country's severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east. At the same time, many buildings from earlier eras had substantial drawbacks, such as coal heat, no [[water heating|hot running water]], or bathrooms shared by multiple units. As these buildings fell into disrepair, many of their inhabitants moved into newer ''Plattenbau'' housing. Today, 'Plattenbau' are often no longer desirable, due in part to their rapid deterioration as a direct result of their cheap and quick construction methods, while older housing stock has undergone extensive renovation or been replaced with more modern dwelling units.

There were several common plattenbau designs. The most common series was the [[P2 (panel building)|P2]], followed by the [[WBS 70]], the [[WHH GT 18]], and [[Q3A Panel house|Q3A]]. The designs were flexible and could be built as towers or rows of apartments of various heights.

[[Image:Neuperlach 0629.jpg|thumb|250px|West German Plattenbau in [[Munich]]-Neuperlach]]

There have been projects with low rise "plattenbauten" such as the town of [[Bernau bei Berlin|Bernau]] just north of Berlin. This town had an almost complete historic center of mainly wooden framed buildings within its preserved city walls. Most of these were torn down after 1975 and during the eighties to be replaced by 2–4 storey buildings constructed of prefabricated concrete slabs. However, it is to be noted that this 'development' and 'modernization' is today regarded as disastrous, and an enormous cultural loss, with the town largely replaced by drab concrete buildings of exceeding mediocrity.

To fit in with the medieval church and the almost complete city wall, the houses used rather small design units and decreased in height the farther away they were from the Church and the nearer they came to the city wall. A similar project was the [[Nikolaiviertel]] around the historic Nikolai church in [[Berlin]]'s old centre. In the case of the Nikolaiviertel the buildings were made to look more historic.

Plattenbau apartments were once considered highly desirable in East Germany, largely due to the lack of any other viable alternative. The main alternatives of the time were overcrowded, deteriorating prewar housing, often with wartime damage still visible, due to policies that chose not to repair the damaged housing stock. Since [[German reunification|reunification]] a combination of decreasing population, renovation of older buildings, and construction of modern alternative housing has led to high vacancy rates, with some estimates placing the number of unoccupied units at around a million. Many plattenbau apartments were built in giant settlements, often on the edge of cities (such as [[Marzahn]] and [[Hellersdorf]] in [[Berlin]] and [[Halle-Neustadt]]), making them inconveniently located. Their inconvenient locations were likely also a factor in their rapid deterioration. However, despite the centrally located buildings of the International Building Exposition in Berlin, the neighbourhood today is not considered particularly desirable, and is characterised by deserted streets and apartment buildings isolated from one another in a lifeless garden.

While some plattenbau apartments have been renovated to a high standard, some are being torn down, although a lack of funds means many have been left to become derelict, as without extensive renovation, the cheap and low-quality construction of the original buildings meant that after only a few years, they had become severely deteriorated. Because of the modular construction some are dismantled and moved to a new location, which only proves that they were cheap and temporary constructions, which were not built to last, evident even at the time when they were new.

Eastern Berlin has many ''Plattenbauten'': reminders of [[Eastern Bloc]] planned residential areas, with shops and schools in a ratio fixed to the number of residents. Berlin-based architect [[David Chipperfield]] has suggested that the plain appearance of Plattenbau housing does not promote [[gentrification]], and may be a factor that helps preserve social continuity for local residents and neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urban experiment Berlin|url = http://www.dw.com/en/urban-experiment-berlin/av-18759802|website = [[Deutsche Welle]] - Arts 21|accessdate = 2015-10-08|date = 2015-10-03 |format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">A '''predictive dialer''' dials a list of [[telephone number]]s and connects answered dials to people making calls, often referred to as agents. Predictive dialers use statistical [[algorithm]]s to minimize the time that agents spend waiting between conversations, while minimizing the occurrence of someone answering when no agent is available.&lt;ref name="Interfaces"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/25062520 Predictive Dialing for Outbound Telephone Call Centers], Douglas A. Samuelson, Interfaces, 29:5 September–October, 1999 (pp. 66-81).&lt;/ref&gt;

When dialing numbers one at a time, there are two sources of delay. First, only some fraction of dials are answered; for example, if 1 out of 3 dials are answered, a predictive dialer might dial 3 lines every time an agent becomes available. Second, even dials that are answered take some time before being picked up. If it typically takes 10 seconds for someone to pick up, and conversations typically last 90 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 80 seconds.&lt;ref name="Interfaces" /&gt;  A predictive dialer does so by discarding all tones and only passing "Hellos" from the lead to the agent, the total time can be as short as 3 seconds between calls, as opposed to nearly a minute if the agent dialed by hand.   The 57 second difference is an extraordinary amount of time for a call center to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deskforce.com/10-second-car/|title=10 second car - DeskForce|date=2015-04-16|work=DeskForce|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dialing one number at a time, only when an agent is available, typically keeps agents utilized for 40 minutes per hour (33% idle time). Predictive dialing can increase utilization to 57 minutes per hour (5% idle time).&lt;ref name="Interfaces" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EVS7"&gt;https://www.evs7.com/predictive-dialer-software To increase business sales predictive dialer can help speeding dial process by enabling 5 calls simultaneously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictive dialers may be standalone hardware devices, cloud-based, or they may be integrated in software with call center or contact center platforms. A cloud-based predictive dialer provides the functionalities of a traditional predictive dialer without requiring installation on the local device and reduces the dependency on the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= https://www.callcenterhosting.in/blog/what-is-a-predictive-dialer/ |
title= What is Predictive Dialer? - Definition, Dialing Algorithm &amp; Benefits | 
publisher= CallCenterHosting}} &lt;/ref&gt; The dialer can often also perform less aggressive dialing modes such as, power, progressive, or preview dialing.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

== Regulations ==
In the UK, [[Ofcom]] requires that predictive dialers abandon fewer than 3% of answered calls on a daily basis.  Ofcom also requires that if an agent is not available within 2 seconds the call is considered "abandoned" and an automated message is played.  The automated message must identify the company making the call, the purpose of the call, a free phone or basic rate phone number to call back on and must not contain any form of marketing. A phone call to the return number must not be treated by the company as an opportunity to market, but to be removed from the calling list. In the UK "abandoned" calls must not be called back within 72 hours unless there is a dedicated agent available.

In the United States, if someone answers but no agent is available within 2 seconds of the person's greeting, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations consider the call "abandoned" and require the dialer to play a recorded message. The FCC requires that predictive dialers abandon less than 3% of answered calls.&lt;ref name="FCC"&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/Telemarketing-Rules.pdf PART 64 – MISCELLANEOUS RULES RELATING TO COMMON CARRIERS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 the Telephone Consumer Protection Act prohibited the use of an “automatic telephone dialing system” to contact “any telephone number assigned to a mobile telephone service” without “express prior consent” from the party being called. Dialing “accidents” are not an effective legal defense and penalties run from $500 to $1,500 per violating call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deskforce.com/predictive-dialer/|title=Predictive Dialer - Engage and convert your leads and contacts|work=DeskForce|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the maximum abandon rate is 5%, and calls cannot be made to numbers registered with the National Do Not Call Registry, emergency or health care providers.&lt;ref name="CRTC"&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/trules-reglest.htm Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules - Part III&lt;/ref&gt; However, not-for-profit organizations such as survey companies are exempt from the National Do Not Call Registry.

The '''privileged transit traffic''' or '''corridor traffic''' is traffic of one country across the territory of another country without usual customs and passport checks. The corresponding line of communication (usually a railway) is called the '''(privileged) traffic corridor''' and a train used in this kind of transit is called a '''corridor train''' ({{lang-de|Korridorzug}}, {{lang-it|Treno-corridoio}}). The reason for such arrangements is usually border changes or border creation which cut through an existing transport corridor.

==Examples==

===Estonia===
*The road from [[Värska Parish|Värska]] to [[Ulitina]] in [[Estonia]], traditionally the only road to the Ulitina area, goes through Russian territory for one kilometre (0.6&amp;nbsp;mi) of its length, an area called [[Saatse Boot]]. This road has no border control, but there is no connection to any other road in Russia. It is not permitted to stop or walk along the road. This area is a part of [[Russia]] but is also a de facto part of the [[Schengen area]]. This arrangement started in 1991 and remains as of 2016.

===Finland===
* Finland [[concession (territory)|leases]] the 19.6&amp;nbsp;km-long Russian part of the [[Saimaa Canal]] from [[Russia]] and is granted [[extraterritoriality]] rights. [[Visa policy of Russia|Russian visas]] are not required for just passing through the canal, but a passport is needed and it is checked at the border.

===Poland===
*A 1931 agreement between [[Poland]] and [[Romania]] for railway traffic between parts of Poland across Romania, between [[Zaleszczyki]] and [[Jasienów Polny]]  (now [[Yaseniv-Pil'nyi]]).  Since 1945, both places have been in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/LNTSer/1931/236.pdf Poland and Romania: Convention of the Freedom of Transit by Rail from One Part of Polish Territory to Another] (retrieved July 4, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
*During the years between the world wars German trains could travel to and from [[East Prussia]] across the [[Polish Corridor]] with legally sealed doors, thereby relieving the passengers of obtaining Polish visas.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Russia===
*Railway connection between mainland [[Russia]] and its [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] exclave across [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]]. This is not privileged since normal passport and visa rules apply.

===Germany===
*A historical case of privileged transit was the arrival of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in a "sealed train car" through [[Germany]] from Switzerland to [[Russia]] (through Sweden as a normal passenger) in April 1917, amid [[World War I]] and [[Russian Revolution|Russian revolutionary activity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lenin-returns-to-russia-from-exile "Lenin returns to Russia from exile"], ''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Communication between [[East Prussia]] and mainland [[Germany]] across the [[Polish Corridor]] during the [[interwar period]].
*[[Zittau]]–[[Görlitz]] (by train) from 1948, through Poland.  This is still in operation as of 2014, but since 2007 the Schengen area removed all passport checks at the German–Polish border.
*In the cold war era, 1961-1990, [[Berlin U-Bahn]] and [[Berlin S-Bahn]] trains passed along sealed tunnels through [[East Berlin]], without any check or any stop. The sealed stations were called [[ghost station]]s.
*[[Büsingen am Hochrhein]] is politically part of Germany but is surrounded by [[Switzerland]] and as such economically it forms part of the Swiss customs area, as do the independent principality of [[Liechtenstein]] and though unofficially, the Italian village of [[Campione d'Italia]]. As such there have been no border controls between Switzerland and Büsingen am Hochrhein since 4 October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buesingen.de/de/Unser-B%C3%BCsingen/Deutsche-Insel-in-der-Schweiz/Staatsvertrag|title=Staatsvertrag - Gemeinde Büsingen |website=www.buesingen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
*Trains between [[Salzburg]] and [[Kufstein]] operated (via Germany) as privileged transit until 1997 when the Schengen area removed passport checks at this border. Border checks were reintroduced for them in 2015-2016 because of the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20150914_OTS0019/oebb-fernverkehrszuege-koennen-wieder-ueber-salzburg-nach-muenchen-und-innsbruck-fahren ÖBB Fernverkehrszüge können wieder über Salzburg nach München und Innsbruck fahren]&lt;/ref&gt;
* After [[World War II]] a 'corridor-train' service was established between [[Lienz]] and [[Innsbruck]] using the [[Puster Valley]] railway (via Italy); this services lost importance after the [[Schengen Agreement]], and was discontinued after 2013.
*During the [[Cold War]] trains with locked doors were allowed to go from northern to southern [[Burgenland]] by traversing a small part of western [[Hungary]].

=== Czech Republic ===
* After World War II, in 1945, a 2.7&amp;nbsp;km part of the railway line [[Varnsdorf]] (CS) – [[Zittau]] (DE) – [[Liberec]] (CS) through [[Porajów]] became part of [[Poland]] and international traffic was stopped. In 1951, the Czechoslovak Railways restored Varnsdorf – Liberec connection based on an agreement with GDR and Poland; ČSD trains had no stop at Polish and German area. In 1964, a new treatment was signed. Since 1972, GDR and Czechoslovakia restored also standard international transport at this line. After broadening of the Schengen area, Varnsdorf – Liberec trains stop also at German area, but traffic through the Polish section is still based on the transit agreement. The Polish side gets a charge from the Czech side but neglects the Polish section and refuses proposals of Czech or German participation on the maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liberec.idnes.cz/trat-do-nemecke-zitavy-je-v-ohrozeni-d7n-/liberec-zpravy.aspx?c=A150515_153801_liberec-zpravy_tm Hrozí zastavení vlaků do Německa. Poláci se nemají k opravě trati], iDnes.cz, 15. 5. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air traffic==
Air traffic has in general a number of privileged transit traffic rights, making it suitable to reach enclaves or isolated countries.
*[[Freedoms of the air|First freedom of the air]]: The right to fly over another country.
*[[Freedoms of the air|Second freedom of the air]]: The right to make technical stops (such as refuelling) in another country without customs and passport check.
*Airside transit: The right for passengers to change aircraft at airports, without going through passport control.

===Consonants===
The following table shows the consonants of Proto-Tai according to [[Li Fang-Kuei]]'s ''A Handbook of Comparative Tai'' (1977), considered the standard reference in the field.  Li does not indicate the exact quality of the consonants denoted here as {{IPA|tɕ}}, {{IPA|tɕʰ}} and {{IPA|dʑ}}, which are indicated in his work as ''č čh ž'' and described merely as [[palatal consonant|palatal]] [[affricate consonant]]s.

The table below lists the consonantal phonemes of Pittayawat Pittayaporn's 2009 reconstruction of Proto-Tai (Pittayaporn 2009:70). Some of the differences are simply different interpretations of Li's consonants: the palatal consonants are interpreted as stops, rather than affricates, and the glottalized consonants are described using symbols for [[implosive consonant]]s.  However, Pittayaporn's Proto-Tai reconstruction has a number of real differences from Li:
#Pittayaporn does not allow for [[aspirated consonant]]s, which he reconstructs as secondary developments in [[Southwestern Tai languages]] (after Proto-Tai split up into different languages).
#He also reconstructs a contrastive series of [[uvular consonant]]s, namely */q/, */ɢ/, and */χ/. No modern dialect preserves a distinct series of uvular consonants. Pittayaporn's reconstruction of the sounds is based on irregular correspondences in differing modern Tai dialects among the sounds /kʰ/, /x/ and /h/, in particular in the [[Phuan language]] and the [[Kapong District|Kapong]] dialect of the [[Phu Thai language]]. The distinction between /kʰ/ and /x/ can be reconstructed from the [[Tai Dón language]]. However, words with /x/ in Tai Dón show three different types of correspondences in Phuan and Kapong Phu Thai: some have /kʰ/ in both languages, some have /h/ in both, and some have /kʰ/ in Phuan but /h/ in Kapong Phu Thai. Pittayaporn reconstructs the correspondence classes as reflecting Proto-Tai /x/, {{IPA|/χ/}} and /q/, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Pittayaporn, Pittayawat (2009). "Proto-Southwestern-Tai Revised: A New Reconstruction". Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, Volume 2. Page 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a total of 33-36 consonants, 10-11 consonantal [[Syllable#Coda|syllable coda]]s and 25-26 tautosyllabic consonant clusters.

Tai languages have many fewer possible consonants in coda position than in initial position. Li (and most other researchers) construct a Proto-Tai coda inventory that is identical with the system in modern Thai.

Pittayaporn (2009) reconstructs two types of complex [[syllable#Onset|onsets]] for Proto-Tai:

#'''Tautosyllabic clusters''' – considered one syllable.
#'''[[Sesquisyllabic]] clusters''' – "one-and-a-half" syllables. ("Sesquisyllabic" is a term coined by [[James Matisoff]].) However, sesquisyllabic clusters are not attested in any modern Tai language.
{{clear}}
'''Tautosyllabic consonant clusters''' from Pittayaporn (2009:139) are given below, some of which have the medials *-r-, *-l-, and *-w-.

Pittayaporn's Proto-Tai reconstruction also has '''sesquisyllabic consonant clusters'''.  [[Michel Ferlus]] (1990) had also previously proposed sesquisyllables for ''Proto-Thai-Yay''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferlus, Michel (1990). ''Remarques sur le Consonnantisme du Proto-Thai-yay.'' Paper presented at the 23rd International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Languages and Linguistics. University of Texas at Arlington, Oct. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The larger [[Tai-Kadai]] family is reconstructed with disyllabic words that ultimately collapsed to monosyllabic words in the modern Tai languages.  However, irregular correspondences among certain words (especially in the minority non-Southwestern-Tai languages) suggest to Pittayaporn that Proto-Tai had only reached the sesquisyllabic stage (with a main monosyllable and optional preceding [[minor syllable]]). The subsequent reduction to monosyllables occurred independently in different branches, with the resulting apparent irregularities in synchronic languages reflecting Proto-Tai sesquisyllables.

Examples of sesquisyllables include:

{{refbegin|2}}
;Voiceless stop + voiceless stop (*C̥.C̥-)
* *p.t-
* *k.t-
* *p.q-
* *q.p-

'''Other clusters''' include *r.t-, *t.h-, *q.s-, *m.p-, *s.c-, *z.ɟ-, *g.r-, *m.n-; *gm̩.r-, *ɟm̩ .r-, *c.pl-, *g.lw-; etc.

===Vowels===
Below are Proto-Tai vowels from Pittayaporn (2009:192). Unlike Li's system, Pittayaporn's system has vowel length contrast. There is a total of 7 vowels with length contrast and 5 [[diphthong]]s.

The '''diphthongs''' from Pittayaporn (2009) are:
*Rising: */iə/, */ɯə/, */uə/
*Falling: */ɤɰ/, */aɰ/

===Tones===
{{further|Four tones (Middle Chinese)}}
Proto-Tai had three contrasting tones on syllables ending with [[sonorant]] finals ("live syllables"), and no tone contrast on syllables with [[obstruent]] finals ("dead syllables").  This is very similar to the situation in [[Middle Chinese]].  For convenience in tracking historical outcomes, Proto-Tai is usually described as having four tones, namely *A, *B, *C, and *D (Pittayaporn 2009), where *D is a non-phonemic tone automatically assumed by all dead syllables.  These tones can be further split into a voiceless (*A1 [1], *B1 [3], *C1 [5], *D1 [7]) and voiced (*A2 [2], *B2 [4], *C2 [6], *D2 [8]) series. The *D tone can also be split into the *DS (short vowel) and *DL (long vowel) tones. With voicing contrast, these would be *DS1 [7], *DS2 [8], *DL1 [9], and *DL2 [10].

Proto-Tai tones take on various tone values and contours in modern [[Tai languages]]. These tonal splits are determined by the following conditions:
#"Friction sounds": Aspirated onset, voiceless fricative, voiceless sonorant
#Unaspirated onset (voiceless)
#Glottalized/implosive onset (voiceless)
#Voiced onset (voiceless)

In addition, William J. Gedney developed a "tone-box" method to help determine historical tonal splits and mergers in modern Tai languages. There is a total of 20 possible slots in what is known as a "Gedney Box." (For a tutorial on Gedney boxes, see "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/gedney1989checklist.pdf A checklist for determining tones in Tai dialects]" (1989) by William Gedney).

Gedney (1972) also included a list of diagnostic words to determine tonal values, splits, and mergers for particular Tai languages. At least three diagnostic words are needed for each cell of the Gedney Box. The diagnostic words preceding the semicolons are from Gedney (1972), and the ones following the semicolons are from Somsonge (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacling.anu.edu.au/series/SEALS-PDFs/Somsonge2012tones.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tones of Thai Song Varieties |website=Pacling.anu.edu.au |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jackson, ''et al.''

===Proto-Southern Kra-Dai===
In 2007, Peter K. Norquest undertook a preliminary reconstruction of Proto-Southern Kra-Dai, which is ancestral to the [[Hlai languages]], [[Ong Be language]], and [[Tai languages]].&lt;ref name="Norquest"&gt;Norquest, Peter K. 2007. [http://gradworks.umi.com/32/84/3284367.html ''A Phonological Reconstruction of Proto-Hlai'']. Ph.D. dissertation. Tucson: Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 28 consonants, 5-7 vowels, 9 closed rimes (not including vowel length), and at least 1 [[diphthong]], *ɯa(C).

Proto-Southern Kra-Dai also includes the [[diphthong]] *ɯa(C).

===Syllable structure===
Unlike its modern-day monosyllabic descendants, Proto-Tai was a [[sesquisyllabic]] language (Pittayaporn 2009). Below are some possible Proto-Tai syllable shapes from Pittayaporn (2009:64).

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Proto-Tai syllable structure &lt;br&gt;(Pittayaporn 2009)
|-
!
! Open syllable
! Closed syllable
|-
! Monosyllable
| *C(C)(C)V(:)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;
| *C(C)(C)V(:)C&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
! Sesquisyllable
| *C(C).C(C)(C)V(:)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;
| *C(C).C(C)(C)V(:)C&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

''Legend'':
*C = consonant
*V = vowel
*(:) = optional vowel length
*&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = tone

During the evolution from Proto-Tai to modern Tai languages, monosyllabification involved a series of 5 steps (Pittayaporn 2009:181).
#Weakening (segment becomes less "consonant-like")
#Implosivization
#Metathesis
#Assimilation
#Simplification (syllable drops at least one constituent)

==Morphology==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
[[Robert M. W. Dixon ]] (1998) suggests that the Proto-Tai language was [[fusional language|fusional]] in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] because of related sets of words among the language's descendants that appear to be related through [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]].&lt;ref name="dixon"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of Languages|last=Dixon|first=R. M. W.|authorlink=Robert M. W. Dixon|date=1998|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pp=42–43|isbn=978-0-521-62654-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntax===
Proto-Tai had a SVO ([[subject–verb–object]]) word order like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and all modern [[Tai languages]]. Its syntax was heavily influenced by Chinese.

''Revealer of Secrets'', first published in 1819, is an [[epistolary novel]] by [[Joseph Perl]], a proponent of Jewish emancipation and [[Haskalah]]. It is often considered the first modern novel in [[Hebrew]]. The book purports to be a collection of letters between various [[hasidic]] rabbis, but is actually a satire of their teachings. 

It is an unusual book in that it satirizes the language and style of early hasidic rabbis writing in Hebrew, which was not the vernacular of the Jews of its time. To make his work available and accessible to his contemporaries, Perl translated his own work into [[Yiddish]]. It is currently in print only in an English translation, by Dov Taylor, published by Westview Press.

'''Thomas Obicini of Novara''' ({{lang-it|Tomasso Obicini da Novara}}; 1585{{nbsp}}– 7 November 1632) was a [[Franciscan]] friar, originally from [[Novara]], [[Italy]].  As an early [[orientalists|orientalist]], [[Arabist]] and [[linguist]], he translated Arabic texts into [[Latin]] and took possession of the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Grotto of Nazareth]] for the [[Franciscan order]] in 1620.

==Journey to Nazareth==
In 1620 Fra Obicini's travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to the [[Emir]] of [[Beirut]], [[Fakhr ad-Din II]].

The background to this mission began seven years earlier, in 1613, when Fakhr ad-Din II had taken refuge in  [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. The emir formed an alliance with  the [[Medici]] ruler, [[Cosimo II]], and spent two years under his protection. He spent three more in [[Sicily]] and [[Naples]] seeking, and failing, to rally a [[Crusade]] against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.  By 1618 the changed political situation permitted his return to [[Lebanon]].

Two years later Friar Obicini journeyed to [[Jerusalem]] in an embassy with Lord Battista Tarquet, the Consul of all [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], sent by the consul of Sidon, the Christian King, Lord Albert Gardana and the Prosecutor of [[the Holy Land]], Lord Francis Lebar.

In Beirut, Obicini was, according to his account, warmly and lavishly received by the emir ad-Din, who had readily granted the two Christian holy sites, the Grotto of the Annunciation, i.e. the Grotto of Nazareth, and [[Mount Tabor]] to his Franciscan order.

In his description of the acquisition of the holy sites he recounts how he travelling to Nazareth, as a small group of a priest, friar John of Vendôme, and a Sicilian friar, Francesco Salice, had brought letters from the Princes, various testimonials, and a decree from the [[Qadi]] of Safed.  On Saturday 29 November 1620, the group took possession of the sanctuary built on the foundations of the House of Loreto and known as the ''Holy Grotto'' - the site venerated by Christians as the place where the [[Angel Gabriel]] announced the birth of [[Christ]] to the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/abs/10.1484/J.SOCC.3.171 Riedizione e traduzione degli opuscoli di Tommaso Obicini da Novara sulle processioni nei Luoghi Santi e sull’acquisto dei santuari di Nazaret e Ain Karem (1623)]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Obicini was [[abbot]] in the convent of [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] he had mastered [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic]],  [[Hebrew]], [[Chaldee]], and [[Coptic language]]s. In 1621, he  was the first lector in [[Arabic]] in the [[San Pietro in Montorio]] convent and was a precursor of [[Athanasius Kircher]].

In 1631 Obicini published ''Grammatica Arabica''; a Latin translation of the 13th-14th century Arabic grammar {{lang|ar|[[Al-Ājurrūmīyya|Matn Al Ajrumiyyah]]}}, ({{lang|ar|إلاجرُومِية}}),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/waqmamme Matn Al Ajrumiyyah]&lt;/ref&gt; by Abū Abdullaahi Muhammad bin Muhammad bin Dāwūd aṣ-Ṣanhaajī, known as [[Ibn Adjurrum]].

In 1636 Obicini published ''Thesaurus Arabico-Syro-Latinus'', his opus magnum; a Latin expanded translation of [[Elijah of Nisibis]]'s 11th-century glossary intended to assist Latin-speaking prelates in converting Syrians and other Arabic speakers.

'''Ume Sami''' is a [[Sami languages|Sami language]] spoken in [[Sweden]] and (formerly) in [[Norway]]. It is a [[Endangered language|moribund language]] with only about 10 native speakers left which used to be spoken mainly along the [[Ume River]] in the south of present-day [[Arjeplog Municipality|Arjeplog]], in [[Sorsele Municipality|Sorsele]] and [[Arvidsjaur Municipality|Arvidsjaur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Olavi |last=Korhonen |work=The Saami: a cultural encyclopaedia |title=Ume Saami language |location=Helsinki |year=2005 |pages=421–422 |url=http://www-db.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/thw/?${APPL}=saamien&amp;${BASE}=saamien&amp;${THWIDS}=22.0/1341400440_5538&amp;${MAXHITS}=5000&amp;${HTML}=docu2&amp;${THWURLSAVE}=0/1341400440_5538&amp;${TRIPSHOW}=form=biblen |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Sammallahti, ''The Saami languages: an introduction'', Kárášjohka, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==

Until 2010, Ume Sami did not have an official written standard, although it was the first Sami language to be written extensively (because [[Sámi school (Sweden)#History|a private christian school]] for Sami children started in [[Lycksele]] 1632, where Ume Sami was spoken).  The [[New Testament]] was published in Ume Sami in 1755 and the first Bible in Sami was also published in Ume Sami, in 1811.

The current official orthography is maintained by the ''Working group for Ume Sami'', whose most recent recommendation was published in 2016.

Shortcomings:
* Vowel length is ambiguous for the letters {{angbr|u}}, {{angbr|ü}} and {{angbr|å}}. In reference works, the length is indicated by a macron ({{angbr|ū}}, {{angbr|ǖ}}, {{angbr|å̄}}). In older orthographies, length could be indicated by writing a double vowel.
* No distinction is made between long and overlong consonants, both are written with a double consonant letter. In reference works, the overlong stops are indicated with a vertical line ({{angbr|bˈb}}, {{angbr|dˈd}} etc.).

==Grammar==

=== Consonant gradation ===

Unlike its southern neighbor [[Southern Sami]], Ume Sami has [[consonant gradation]]. However, gradation is more limited than it is in the more northern Sami languages, because it does not occur in the case of short vowels followed by a consonant that can gradate to quantity 1 (that is, Proto-Samic single consonants or geminates). In these cases, only quantity 3 appears. Consonant clusters can gradate regardless of the preceding vowel.

=== Cases ===

===Pronouns===

===Verbs===

====Person and grammatical number====

The verbs in Ume Sami have three persons:

* first person
* second person
* third person
There are three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural.

====Mood ====

Ume Sami has two [[grammatical mood]]s:

*[[Grammatical mood#Indicative|indicative]]
*[[Imperative mood|imperative]]

====Tense====

====Negative verb====

Ume Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a [[negative verb]]. In Ume Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative and imperative), [[Grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual and plural).

Renhunden ska man börja lära i koppel. Då måste man själv springa från den ena kanten till den andra (av renhjorden) och så också på (renarnas) viloplats, medan de andra äter. Då ska man med den där bandhunden springa runt hjorden, så att hunden ser, hur folket gör. Lärohunden springer en sådan gång runt hjorden och låter ingen undslippa. Så finns det ofta sådana hundar, som inte har lärt sig helt, som tar någon ren och jagar iväg den. Då måste man en sådan gång sätta band på den och slå den.

A reindeer [[herding dog]] must begin its training with a leash. Then one has to run from one side [of the herd] to the other and also on the area where they [the reindeer] rest, while others are eating. One must run around the herd with the dog [to be trained] on a leash, so that the dog sees how people do it.  The trained dog then runs around the herd and does not allow any to slip away.  Then there are often dogs that are not fully trained [and] who single out a reindeer and drive it away [i.e. to kill it].  Then one must put a leash on that [dog] and strike it.

The three [[deaf-community sign language]]s indigenous to [[Vietnam]] are found in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Hanoi]], and [[Haiphong]]. The HCMC and Hanoi languages especially have been influenced by the [[French Sign Language]] once taught in schools, and have absorbed a large amount of FSL vocabulary. 

The Vietnamese languages are part of a sign language area that includes indigenous sign languages of [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], though it is not known if they are genealogically related to each other. The influence of FSL may have obscured the links: the highest cognacy is with Haiphong Sign, which has been the least influenced by FSL. 

There are attempts to develop a national [[standard language]], '''Vietnamese Sign Language'''.

'''ǂAakhoe''' (ǂĀkhoe) and '''Haiǁom''' are part of the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] dialect continuum and are spoken mainly in [[Namibia]].&lt;ref name=DOBES&gt;[http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/projects/akhoe DOBES documentation project on Haiǁom]&lt;/ref&gt; In the sparsely available material on the subject, ǂAkhoe and Haiǁom have been considered a variant of the Khoekhoe language, as separate dialects (Haacke et al. 1997), as virtual synonyms of a single variant (Heikinnen, n.d.), or as "a way in which some Haiǁom speak their language in the northern part of Namibia" (Widlock, n.d.). ǂAkhoe especially is intermediate between the Khoekhoe and Kalahari branches of the [[Khoe languages|Khoe language family]].

==The people==
The Haiǁom are traditionally [[hunter-gatherers]], and many aspects of this traditional culture have been preserved in spite of the political, economic, and linguistic marginalisation of the group. Characteristical features of their culture include healing trance dances, hunting magic, intensive usage of wild plant and insect food, a unique kinship and naming system, frequent storytelling, and the use of a landscape-term system for spatial orientation.&lt;ref name=DOBES/&gt;

The Haiǁom live in the savannah of northern Namibia, in an area stretching from the edges of Etosha salt pan and the northern white farming areas as far as the Angola border – and perhaps beyond – in the north and Kavango in the east. 
According to ''Ethnologue'' there were 48,400 Haiǁom speakers in 2006, but as with all figures on people and languages of low reputation this count might not be very reliable.

==Grammar==
In theory ǂAkhoe possesses free word order, with the [[subject–object–verb]] order (SOV) being the dominant preference. In keeping with the typological profile of SOV languages, adjectives, demonstratives and numerals generally precede nouns. Nouns are marked by person–gender–number (PGN) markers.  Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals all agree with their head noun.

For example,
:{|
|-
|Mãa	|| &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;ũ-ba	||nde-ba?
|-
|what	||colour-3SGM	||this-3SGM
|}
:"What colour is this?"

Mãa is an interrogative used freely in Haiǁom, the subject ''|ũ'' takes the suffix ''-ba'', which is a PGN marker denoting the 3rd person masculine singular. The indirect object ''nde'', a demonstrative, follows the noun, and is inflected in concord with the head noun.

Compound structures are highly productive in ǂAkhoe and vary widely in the combination of word categories. The possibilities include: noun+noun, noun+adverb or vice versa, noun+adjective or vice versa, adjective+adjective, adjective+adverb or vice versa, adjective+suffix, or multiple combinations of the above.

==Phonology==
Comparing Heikinnen’s&lt;ref&gt;Heikinnen, T. (n.d.), pp 15–30.&lt;/ref&gt; and Widlock’s&lt;ref&gt;Widlock, T. (n.d.), pp. 12–17&lt;/ref&gt; contribution to ǂAkhoe phonology with the more general and theoretical phonological work of Peter Ladefoged (1996),&lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter &amp; Maddieson, Ian (1996), pp. 246–260.&lt;/ref&gt; ǂAkhoe can be said to have 47 phonemes. However, an in-depth phonological sketch of the language might show other results where the vowels are concerned.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Consonants===
There are 34 consonants in ǂAkhoe, 20 of which are [[Click consonant|clicks]] produced with an ingressive airstream, and 14 of which are [[pulmonic consonant]]s produced with an egressive airstream.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Vowels===
ǂAkhoe Haiǁom has a total of 12 vowel phonemes. These can be divided into monophthongs and diphthongs, with a further subdivision into oral and nasal pronunciation.

;Monophtongs: {{IPA|/i e a o u/}} and {{IPA|/ĩ ã ũ/}}.

;Diphthongs: {{IPA|/ai au/}} and {{IPA|/ãi ãu/}}.
