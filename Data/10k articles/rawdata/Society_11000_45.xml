==Background==
Before the formation of a coalition government in March 2018, immigration policy had become an issue that prevented Angela Merkel obtaining a workable majority, with the Free Democratic Party declining to join a coalition and all potential coalition partners calling for stricter migration controls.&lt;ref name = Guardian-Olterman-2017-11-19"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Oltermann |first1=Philip |title=German coalition talks collapse after deadlock on migration and energy: Chancellor Angela Merkel left facing prospect of forming minority government – or fresh elections – after FDP quits negotiations | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/19/german-coalition-talks-close-to-collapse-angela-merkel | accessdate=July 1, 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=November 11, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The coalition government agreement, made between [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), was not ratified by SPD members until 3 March 2018, more than five months after the September 2017 German Federal elections.&lt;ref name="Reuters-Coalition Agreement-2018-03-04"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Reuters staff |title=Factbox: Main points of German coalition agreement |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-pact/factbox-main-points-of-german-coalition-agreement-idUSKBN1GG0GY |accessdate= July 1, 2018 |publisher=Reuters |date=March 4, 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition agreement indicates that the parties intended to modify policies in relation to refugees and family reunification. "The previous government (also a CDU/CSU/SPD grand coalition) had suspended the right of refugees with a 'limited protection status' to bring their families over. The new coalition deal says this will be limited to 1,000 people per month. On top of that, the number of asylum-seekers taken in altogether is to be capped at between 180,000 and 220,000 per year."&lt;ref name="DW-Knight-Jones-2018-03-12"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Ben Knight |author2=Timothy Jones |title=Germany's coalition agreement: What's in it? |url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-coalition-agreement-whats-in-it/a-42242741 |accessdate= July 1, 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=December 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
===June 2018===
In June 2018, the coalition government, especially the [[CDU/CSU]] sister parties, quarreled over the specifics of asylum policies. After the interior minister [[Horst Seehofer]] (CSU) had announced a "master plan" on asylum policies containing 63 points&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/asylstreit-punkte-die-die-koalition-spalten-1.4020943 63 Punkte, die die Koalition spalten], Süddeutsche Zeitung, 18 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; - of which 62 were reportedly agreed between Seehofer and chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] (CDU)&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; - differences arose on the question of the rejection of asylum seekers already registered in other EU countries. After Seehofer threatened "national measures", meaning the closure of the borders for such asylum seekers, Merkel requested two weeks for talks on a "European solution" and convened an [[EU asylum policy summit]] on migration policies in the night of 28/29 June.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/regierungskrise-um-fluechtlingspolitik-zerreisst-es-die-union-im-asylstreit/22716002.html Zerreißt es die Union im Asylstreit?], Der Tagesspiegel, 21 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/kaffeeklatsch/2018/06/19/angela-merkel-has-two-weeks-to-keep-germanys-centre-right-together Angela Merkel has two weeks to keep Germany’s centre-right together], The Economist, 19 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the summit was seen as a "vague" success for Merkel. The [[Visegrád Group]], represented by the Hungarian prime minister, claimed that the EU was beginning to accept its proposals for dealing with asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eu-gipfel-asylpolitik-einigung-fluechtlinge-1.4034565 Die EU zieht die Tür weiter zu], Süddeutsche, 29 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://visegradpost.com/en/2018/06/30/european-summit-small-victory-for-the-v4/|title=European Summit: small victory for the V4|website=V Post|date=30 June 2018|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other things, it was agreed that European governments are allowed to "take all necessary internal legislative and administrative measures" to prevent refugees and migrants from crossing Europe's internal borders. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called this "an apparent lifeline for Merkel".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/29/eu-summit-migration-deal-key-points EU migration deal: what was agreed and will it work?], The Guardian, 29 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; While Merkel claimed that she had reached agreements with [[Greece]] and [[Spain]] as well as commitments of 14 states on deportations of registered migrants, the Visegrád Group among them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/brief-an-koalitionspartner-laender-sichern-merkel-rasche-fluechtlingsrueckfuehrung-zu-1.4035396 14 weitere Länder sichern Merkel rasche Flüchtlingsrückführung zu], Süddeutsche Zeitung, 30 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; the governments of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]] subsequently denied that there were new agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article178556504/Polen-widerspricht-Angela-Merkel-Keine-neue-Vereinbarung-ueber-Rueckfuehrungen.html „Keine neue Vereinbarung“ – Auch Polen widerspricht Merkel], Die Welt, 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also reported that there were personal differences between Merkel and Seehofer, the latter reportedly saying: "I can’t work with this woman any more!"&lt;ref name="econ"/&gt;

===July 2018===
After the EU summit, German chancellor Angela Merkel faced resistance by the [[Bavaria]]n CSU party over the result of the summit, and interior minister HorstSeehofer announced a "declaration"Sunday 1 July. Seehofer threatened to order "national measures" and reject migrants who are registered in other EU countries. It was reported that he considered talks with Merkel in [[Berlin]] on 30 June 2018 on the summit results as "ineffective" and "useless", stating that Merkel's plan would create new "pull factors" for asylum seekers to come to Europe.&lt;ref name="faz"&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/regierungskrise-merkel-laesst-loesung-des-asyl-streits-mit-csu-offen-15668865.html "Seehofer nimmt Merkels Asyl-Paket auseinander"], ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected a proposal by Merkel to accommodate asylum seekers who are already registered in EU countries in so-called "anchor centers" (''Ankerzentren''), which would allow quicker deportations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Seehofer-Gipfel-Ergebnisse-nicht-wirkungsgleich-article20507361.html "Seehofer: Gipfel-Ergebnisse nicht wirkungsgleich"], n-tv.de, 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst Bavarian minister president [[Markus Söder]] stated that the summit result would point "in the right direction", the party leaders held a meeting in the CSU party headquarters in [[Munich]] on Sunday and voiced criticism of Merkel's plan.&lt;ref name="spieg"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/regierungskrise-so-reagiert-die-csu-auf-merkels-eu-gipfel-ergebnisse-a-1215950.html "Es geht in die richtige Richtung"], Der Spiegel, 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel stated that she wants to avoid a breakup of the government and the historical [[CDU/CSU|parliamentary group]] with the Bavarian sister party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-01/merkel-faces-crunch-time-in-coalition-showdown-on-migrant-policy Merkel Faces Crunch Time in Showdown on Migrant Policy], Bloomberg.com, 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 1 July, interior minister Horst Seehofer reportedly offered the CSU party leadership his resignation over the conflict with Angela Merkel,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.sky.com/story/german-interior-minister-quits-over-migration-conflict-11423348 German interior minister offers to resign over migration conflict], Sky News, 1 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;, but chose to stay in office for the time being, after party board members as [[Alexander Dobrindt]] convinced him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merkur.de/politik/seehofer-ruecktritt-als-er-bombe-platzen-liess-reagierte-dobrindt-am-schnellsten-9998712.html Protokoll des Nervenkriegs: Als Seehofer die Bombe platzen ließ, reagierte Dobrindt am schnellsten], Merkur.de, 1 July 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; New talks were agreed between CDU and CSU delegations for 1700 CET on 2 July in Berlin. Seehofer stated ahead of the talks: "I'm not going to get dismissed by a chancellor who's only chancellor because of me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/seehofer-merkel-krisengipfel-1.4037923 Seehofer: "Ich lasse mich nicht von einer Kanzlerin entlassen, die nur wegen mir Kanzlerin ist"], Süddeutsche Zeitung, 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/live178588484/Einigung-moeglich-Transitzentren-nahe-der-Grenze-im-Gespraech-Liveticker-zum-Unionsstreit.html Einigung möglich? Offenbar Transitzentren nahe der Grenze im Gespräch], Die Welt, 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the evening of 2 July, an agreement was made between the CDU/CSU sister parties. It contains the introduction of ''Transitzentren'' (''transit centres'') which allow quick deportations of asylum seekers already registered abroad without entering the country, and in specific cases the rejection of such people directly at the German border. To avoid that there is only a national approach, agreements with the European neighbours are also included. Seehofer announced that the agreement allows him to stay in office as Minister of the Interior. After the agreement between the sister parties, talks with the coalition partner of the SPD party followed. Leading SPD politicians said that they had "many questions" about the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dw.com/en/chancellor-angela-merkel-and-horst-seehofer-agree-on-a-migration-compromise/a-44485481 Chancellor Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer agree on a migration compromise], Deutsche Welle, 2 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

By 9 July, it was being reported that the ruling coalition had achieved a level of stability, leaving the government able to negotiate bilateral deals with other European countries. Meanwhile, talks commenced with Austria and Italy in an effort to close the Mediterranean migration routes from Africa to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2018/0709/Immigration-deal-saves-German-government-points-to-European-future|title=Immigration deal saves German government, points to European future|website=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
* [[European Union]]: The [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] stated, the compromise was probably conform to European right, but will be examined by the Juristic Service of the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/juncker-kompromiss-von-cdu-und-csu-wohl-eu-rechtskonform-15672443.html Juncker: Asyl-Kompromiss wohl mit EU-Recht vereinbar], Frankfurter Allgemeine, 3 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Austria]]: Austrian Chancellor [[Sebastian Kurz]] stated: "it hasn't become clear what Germany intends to do here." He wanted to wait and see if the compromise would become government policy. "Should this agreement thus become the German government position, we see ourselves forced to take action to avert disadvantages for Austria and its population."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article178647566/Kurz-zum-Unions-Kompromiss-Es-ist-nicht-klar-geworden-was-Deutschland-hier-vorhat.html „Es ist nicht klar geworden, was Deutschland hier vorhat“], Die Welt, 3 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Hadi Dawi''' ({{lang-ps|عبدالهادي داوي}} 1894 - 1982) was an [[Afghan]] poet, diplomat and government official. His works were published under his pen name, '''Pareshan''' (worried).

==Biography==
Abdul Hadi Dawi was born to a [[Daavi]] Afghan family in 1894 in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. 
He graduated from Habibia High School in 1912. 
In 1919, [[Mahmud Tarzi]] turned over the editorship of ''Siraj al-Akhbar'' to him. 
Under Dawi's editorship, the name of the paper was changed to ''Aman-i Afghan'' (Afghan Peace).&lt;ref&gt;Ideology and power in the Middle East studies in honor of George Lenczowski. Durham: Duke UP, 1988. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, he was appointed as first ever Afghan Ambassador to [[London]]. From 1925 until his resignation in 1928, he served as a [[Minister of Commerce &amp; Industries (Afghanistan)|Minister of Commerce]]. After his resignation, he was appointed as an Afghan Ambassaord to [[London]] where he served from 1929 until 1931. He was imprisoned from 1933 until 1946 as a supporter of [[Amanullah Khan]].

In 1950, Dawi was elected to the [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|Afghan parliament]] and became speaker of the House. During this time, he also served as secretary of King [[Mohammad Zahir Shah]] and tutor of the crown prince. He was appointed as ambassador to [[Cairo]] from 1952 to 1954, and to [[Jakarta]] from 1954 until 1958. On 12 October 1965, Zahir Shah appointed Abdul Hadi dawi president of the [[House of Elders|Mesherano Jirga]] (House of Elders).&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Clements,.

The '''Algerians of the Pacific''' were a group of men and women native of Algeria  [[Deportation|deported]] by [[France|French]] authorities to [[labor camp]]s on the island of [[New Caledonia]], after taking part in the 1870–1871 uprising against [[French rule in Algeria|colonial rule in Algeria]].

Their arrest took place in 1871, and 212 persons were tried together in 1873, in the city of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. Most were sent over to prisons in metropolitan France - [[Oléron]] and [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] (on [[Île de Ré]]) - then, as these were due to be closed, to [[Quélern]] (near [[Brest, France|Brest]]). At the same time, 29 of them were kept in [[Oran]]; [[Antoine Chanzy]], the [[Colonial heads of Algeria|Governor-General]], attempted to have them removed from the public's eye by proposing they should be sent to the [[Marquesas Islands]]. They too were ultimately transported to Quélern, through [[Marseille]]. A third group was imprisoned together with former [[Paris Commune|Communards]] in [[Thouars]].

Due to malfunctions in the communication between ministries, the distinction made between sentences to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] (traditionally, to [[French Guiana]]) and deportation (to New Caledonia) was no longer made - all were sent to New Caledonia in the end.

Their arrival on the island coincided with transports of Communards, who were to leave precious testimonies of the [[Kabyle people|Kabyles']] presence. However, the Kabyles were left behind when the Communards were granted an [[amnesty]] in 1879, and remained in exile despite campaigns to raise sympathy among the French public. An amnesty was awarded only in 1895, and they were not able to return to Algeria until after 1904.

Some descendants of the deported still live in New Caledonia. One of them, Taïeb Aïfa, served as the mayor of [[Bourail]] from 1977 to 2001. In [[Nessadiou]] ([[:fr:Nessadiou|FR]]), south of Bourail, there is a ''[[:fr:Cimetière des Arabes|Cimetière des Arabes]]'', or "Cemetery of the Arabs"; over time, the community began to identify as "Arabs" rather than with a Kabyle or local designation. One elderly Algerian-Caledonian traces this to an occasion when the Algerians arrived to perform labour during [[Ramadan]] dressed in white robes, whereupon the native Caledonians decided that they must be "Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qsr-FjZhEM|title=Al Jazeera World - Exile In New Caledonia|last=Mame|first=Abdelkader|author2=Abdelaziz Abid|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 September 2015}} Time: 11:50-12:05&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amazônia Legal''' ({{IPA-pt|amaˈzonjɐ leˈɡaw}}, ''Legal Amazon'') is the largest [[Brazil socio-geographic division|socio-geographic division]] in [[Brazil]], containing all nine states in the [[Amazon basin]]. The region was created in 1948 based on studies of the Brazilian government on how to plan the economic and social development of the Amazon region.

== Area ==
It is an official designation that encompasses all seven states of the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region]] ([[Acre (state)|Acre]], [[Amapá]], [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], [[Pará]], [[Rondônia]], [[Roraima]] and [[Tocantins]]), as well as part of [[Mato Grosso]] in the [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West Region]] and most of [[Maranhão]] in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]]. Amazônia Legal is a 5,016,136.3 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region with around 24 million inhabitants, in other words 59% of Brazil is part of Amazônia Legal but only 12.34% of the Brazilian population lives there. The administrative unit was initially established by Federal Law No. 5.173 (Art. 2).&lt;ref&gt;Lei Federal Nº 5.173, de 27 de outubro de 1966. Dispõe sobre o Plano de Valorização Econômica da Amazônia; extingue a Superintendência do Plano de Valorização Econômica da Amazônia (SPVEA), cria a Superintendência do Desenvolvimento da Amazônia (SUDAM), e dá outras providências. Senado Federal, Subsecretaria de Informações. Acesso em 28/08/2012.

Although called Amazônia Legal the region overlaps three different [[biome]]s: all of Brazil's [[Amazon biome]], 37% of the [[Cerrado]] biome and 40% of the [[Pantanal]] biome.&lt;ref&gt;INSTITUTO SOCIOAMBIENTAL - ISA (Socio Environment Institute).

[http://www.socioambiental.org/banco_imagens/pdfs/Amazonia2009_ISA_portuguesBaixa.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The main characteristic of the region is the abundant and [[tropical]] [[vegetation]], including large sections of [[rainforest]].

== Demographics ==
A total population of 24.7 million inhabitants lives in the area,&lt;ref&gt;INSTITUTO BRASILEIRO DE GEOGRAFIA E ESTATÍSTICA (IBGE). 2000. Estimativas populacionais dos municípios em 2009.

including more than 300,000 [[Indigenous peoples in South America|Indians]] belonging to more than 170 ethnicities and many traditional [[Extractive reserve (Brazil)|extractive communities]].

Because of its remoteness, this region was the last to be colonized by Brazilians of [[Europe]]an descent and it still has a very low [[population density]].

'''Anna Byford Leonard''' (July 31, 1843 – ) was an American reformer, who was the first woman who was appointed sanitary inspector. She also served as president of the Woman's Canning and Preserving Company.

==Early years==
Anna Byford was born in [[Mount Vernon, Indiana]], July 31, 1843. She was a daughter of the physician and surgeon, [[William Heath Byford]], of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He was the founder and president of the Woman's Medical College of Chicago. 

==Career==
In 1889, Leonard was appointed sanitary inspector, being the first woman who ever held that position, and was enabled to carry out many of the needed reforms It was through her instrumentality, aided by the other five women on the force, that the eight-hour law was enforced, providing that children under fourteen years of age should not work more than eight hours a day. That was enforced in all dry-goods stores. Through her endeavors seats were placed in the stores and factories, and the employers were instructed that the girls were to be allowed to sit when not occupied with their duties. She was enabled to accomplish this through the fact that the physicians and women of Chicago were ready to sustain her, and the other fact that her position as a sanitary inspector of the health department made her an officer of the police force, thus giving her authority for any work she found necessary to do. As a result of this eight-hour law, schools were established in some of the stores from eight to ten a. m.. giving the younger children, who would spend that time on the street, two hours of solid schooling. In 1891, Leonard was made president of the Woman's Canning and Preserving Company, which, after one short year from its organization, she left with a factory, four stories and basement, with a working capital of {{USD|40000}}. Leonard was an artist of ability, having studied abroad and traveled extensively.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=457}}

[[Image:Alexis I's bride-show by G.Sedov (1882, GTG).jpg|thumb|250px|1882 painting of Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]] choosing his bride in 1648. Painting by [[Grigory Sedov]].]]

The '''bride-show''' was a custom of [[Byzantine emperor]]s and [[Russian tsar]]s to choose a wife from among the most beautiful maidens of the country. A similar practice was also existent in Imperial China. 

==Byzantium==
The method to select a bride for the emperor through the method of Bride-show is known to have been used at least from the 8th century onward. [[Irene of Athens]] was likely chosen for [[Leo IV the Khazar]] by this method, though it has not been confirmed. 

The first recorded bridal show in Byzantine was however the one in 788, in which [[Maria of Amnia]] was selected for emperor Constantine. The method was regularly used in the 8th and 9th centuries. 
Among notable bride-shows was the one in which [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]] was selected by [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] and [[Kassia]] rejected. 

None of the empresses of the 10th century onward, however, are confirmed to have been selected this way, and the custom was surely dead by the 13th century.  

==Imperial China==
Imperial China practiced a similar method in which to choose wives for the emperor at least from the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279) onward; in this case not just one empress, but also the various consorts and concubines of lower ranks for the emperor.  During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912), daughters of the elite families where summoned to the imperial palace prior to marriage for inspection, and selected by the emperor to become his empress, secondary imperial consorts or concubines before the rest of them were released and allowed to marry.&lt;ref name="Walthall date?, page?"&gt;{{harvnb|Walthall|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moscovite Russia==
The Byzantine method was transferred to [[Moscovite]] Russia, where it became the traditional method to select a bride from the boyar nobility for the Tsar in the contemporary Russian culture, where the ''[[Terem (Russia)|Terem]]'' otherwise secluded women of the aristocracy from men. 

The method was regularly used in the 16th- and 17th-century. This was the case with the three wives of [[Ivan IV of Russia]]. The first time this method was securely recorded was in 1505, when [[Solomoniya Saburova]] was selected for [[Vasily III of Moscow]] this way. 

The last time a bride-show was held to arranged a marriage to a Russian Tsar was that of [[Ivan V of Russia]] to [[Praskovia Saltykova]] in 1684. After this, Russia was Westernized in accordance with the reforms of Peter the Great and this method was abandoned.

The '''Bwe''' or Kayaw is an ethnic group present in [[Kayah State]] in [[Myanmar]].  [[Bwe]] are mostly populated at [[Kyebogyi|Kyèbogyi]] area of [[Kayah State|Kayah state]] and [[Thandaunggyi Township|Thandaunggyi]] Township of [[Karen state|Kayin (Karen) state.]] 

Population 15,700 (1983).  

Language development Literacy rate in L1: Below 1%. 

Bible portions: 1857–1862. 

They speak several languages, which included [[Karen language|Karen]], [[Karenni language|Karenni]], and [[Burmese language|Burmese]]. They deported to [[Thailand]] because of civil war in [[Myanmar]]. They were separating from one another due to the dictatorship in Myanmar. They have a very strong connection and commitment to their country, language, culture and people. Bwe people are now locating in the Karenni Refugee camp at section 1. They are religious and mostly [[Baptists]]. They have been moving to the [[United States]], [[Finland]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]] since 2006. They came overseas for a better life and education.

As of 2005, nearly all of the 150 largest companies in the world had a sustainability officer with the rank of [[vice president]] or higher, and numerous [[Green MBA|MBA programs]] had incorporated sustainability training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14261">The '''Declaration of Sentiments''', also known as the '''Declaration of Rights and Sentiments''',&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. The Learning Page. [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/99/suffrage/seneca.html ''Lesson Two: Changing Methods and Reforms of the Woman's Suffrage Movement, 1840-1920.''] "The first convention ever called to discuss the civil and political rights of women...(excerpt)". Retrieved on April 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a document signed in 1848 by 68 women and 32 men—100 out of some 300 attendees at the first [[women's rights]] convention to be organized by women. Held in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]], the convention is now known as the [[Seneca Falls Convention]]. The principal author of the Declaration was [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who modeled it upon the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. She was a key organizer of the convention along with [[Lucretia Coffin Mott]], and [[Martha Coffin Wright]].

According to the ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]],'' published by [[Frederick Douglass]], whose attendance at the convention and support of the Declaration helped pass the resolutions put forward, the document was the "grand movement for attaining the civil, social, political, and religious rights of women."&lt;ref&gt;''North Star'', July 28, 1848, as quoted in ''Frederick Douglass on Women's Rights'', Philip S. Foner, ed. New York: Da Capo Press, 1992, pp. 49-51; originally published in 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Woman Suffrage: 1848-1861|page=74|year=1881|editor1=Elizabeth Cady Stanton|editor2=Susan B. Anthony |editor3=Matilda Joslyn Gage |editor4=Ida Husted Harper|volume=1|publisher=Fowler &amp; Wells|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when traditional roles were still very much in place, the Declaration caused much controversy. Many people respected the courage and abilities behind the drafting of the document, but were unwilling to abandon their morals. An article in the ''Oneida Whig'' published soon after the convention described the document as "the most shocking and unnatural event ever recorded in the history of womanity." Many newspapers insisted that the Declaration was drafted at the expense of women's more appropriate duties. At a time when temperance and [[Married Women's Property Acts in the United States|female property rights]] were major issues, even many supporters of women's rights believed the Declaration's endorsement of women's suffrage would hinder the nascent women's rights movement, causing it to lose much needed public support.

==Opening paragraphs==
{{quote|text=When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the earth a position different from that which they have hitherto occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to such a course.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted, deriving their powers from the [[consent of the governed]]. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these rights, it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

[[Prudence]], indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed, but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.

The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpation on the part of man toward woman, having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/senecafalls.html Modern History Source book: Seneca Falls: The Declaration of Sentiments, 1848]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sentiments==
*He has not ever permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise.
*He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she had no voice.
*He has withheld her from rights which are given to the most ignorant and degraded men—both natives and foreigners.
*Having deprived her of this first right as a citizen, the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.
*He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.
*He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.
*He has made her morally, an irresponsible being, as she can commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be done in the presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to all intents and purposes, her master—the law giving him power to deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.
*He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes of divorce, in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given; as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of the women—the law, in all cases, going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of a man, and giving all power into his hands.
*After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a government which recognizes her only when her property can be made profitable to it.
*He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty remuneration.
*He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and distinction, which he considers most honorable to himself. As a teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.
*He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education—all colleges being closed against her.
*He allows her in church, as well as State, but a subordinate position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public participation in the affairs of the Church.
*He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a different code of morals for men and women, by which moral delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only tolerated but deemed of little account in man.
*He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and her God.
*He has endeavored, in every way that he could to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.

==Closing remarks==
{{quote|text=Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation—in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of these United States.

In entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the State and national Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and the press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will be followed by a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country.}}

After achieving independence, East Timor has a high illiteracy rate, with 55% of women and 46% of men illiterate. Only 18% of the adult population has secondary education and only 1.4% of them have higher education.  Attempts to improve education services face challenges in the form of a lack of educated and experienced  teachers. Continuing high fertility rates also translates to greater strains on the government to increase education budgets. The United Nations (UN) has assisted in rebuilding the education system increasing the number of teachers and rehabilitating many schools, leading to a rapid increase in school enrollment.  However, problems remain as the quality of education was deemed secondary to the need to increase enrollment in East Timor.

Another problem faced in increasing the education levels includes the economic conditions of the population. With high proportions of the population living below the poverty line and large households with many children, the direct costs of schooling is significant for families. Lack of monetary resources to send children to school imposes greater difficulty in increasing enrollment rates in schools. In addition, parents may be disillusioned with the poor quality of education and thus may not even be interested to send their children to schools. Much remains to be done to establish a new curriculum and support it with texts and learning materials to improve the quality of education. The variety of language spoken also means a large number of children do not speak the language of instruction – Portuguese – and this causes them to be marginalised. Many teachers do not speak Portuguese. 

The inaccessibility of schools with proper facilities adds to the problem of providing adequate education to the population. Schools are located far away from homes and, coupled with the poor conditions of schools, may inhibit the early enrollment of children or lead to early drop-outs. Schools in rural areas face substantial lack of facilities to render them safe. As for the schools in urban areas, significant urban migration has meant that the supply of schools in urban areas have not managed to keep up with the increasing demand; leading to overcrowding in urban schools.

Besides the problems faced at the level of the individual households and the schools, problems in the governance and management of education are also significant impediments to raising education levels in East Timor. The lack of qualified personnel in critical positions within the education ministry has meant that overall policy making, planning and management functions are restricted. Management of schools at the district level is often under-qualified due to the lack of formal training. Today therefore, East Timor faces many challenges in increasing the literacy rates of their people.

'''Discrimination against the homeless''' is the act of treating the [[homeless]], or those perceived to be homeless, unfavorably. As with most types of [[discrimination]] it can manifest in numerous forms.

==Discriminatory legislation regarding homelessness==
{{Main|Criminalization of homelessness}}
Use of the law to discriminate against the homeless takes on disparate forms: restricting the [[General public|public]] areas in which sitting or sleeping are allowed, ordinances restricting [[aggressive panhandling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Criminalizing Crisis: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities |publisher=National Law Center on Homelessness &amp; Poverty |date=November 2011 |url=http://www.nlchp.org/documents/Criminalizing_Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; actions intended to divert the homeless from particular areas, penalizing loitering or anti-social behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Britain: Where have all the homeless gone? |journal=[[The Economist]] |volume=372 |issue=8388 |pages=21–49 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/3084301}}&lt;/ref&gt; or enforcing laws on the homeless and not on those who are not homeless.&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;{{cite book |title=Out of Sight - Out of Mind? |publisher=National Law Center on Homelessness &amp; Poverty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ESQoVYYWN4C&amp;pg=PA90 |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7881-8276-1 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French literature|French]] [[novelist]] [[Anatole France]] noted this phenomenon as long ago as 1894, famously observing that "the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges".&lt;ref name="Anatole France"&gt;{{cite book |title=Le lys rouge |last=France |first=Anatole |authorlink=Anatole France |year=1894 |publisher= |location= |language=French |isbn= |pages= |chapter=VII |chapterurl=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Lys_rouge_-_VII |quote=Ils y doivent travailler devant la majestueuse égalité des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization of homelessness in the United States===
There is a growing trend in the United States towards [[Criminalization of homelessness in the United States|criminalizing the state of being homeless]].&lt;ref name="dream"&gt;{{cite report |title=A Dream Denied: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities |publisher=National Coalition for the Homeless |date=January 2006 |url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach believe that punitive measures will deter people from a homeless lifestyle.

To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw life-sustaining activities—such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging—in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral laws—such as those prohibiting open containers or [[loitering]]—against homeless populations.&lt;ref name="dream"/&gt;

Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines or incarceration or both.
Homeless people with new "criminal charges" have very restrictive housing and employment options, if either, for years.

In April 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that "making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|8th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] Amendments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/8138B5E4723C6FE988257150005B327E/$file/0455324.pdf?openelement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091904/http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/8138B5E4723C6FE988257150005B327E/$file/0455324.pdf?openelement |archivedate=2007-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal victimization==
{{see also|Homelessness in the United States#Crimes against homeless people}}
Precise factors associated with victimization and injury to the homeless are not clearly understood. Nearly one-half of homeless people are victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meinbresse |first1=M |last2=Brinkley-Rubinstein |first2=L |last3=Grassette |first3=A |last4=Benson |first4=J |last5=Hamilton |first5=R |last6=Malott |first6=M |last7=Jenkins |first7=D |title=Exploring the Experiences of Violence Among Individuals Who Are Homeless Using a Consumer-Led Approach |journal=Violence &amp; Victims |date=2014 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=122–136 |pmid=24672998 |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.vv-d-12-00069}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many violent crimes committed against the homeless due to their being homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fantz |first=Ashley |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/19/homeless.attacks/index.html |title=Teen 'sport killings' of homeless on the rise |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2007 found that this number is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewan |first=Todd |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-08-homelessattacks_N.htm |title=Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Coalition for the Homeless]], [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html Hate, "Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness, 2006"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403051522/http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html |date=April 3, 2007 }}, February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of access to public restrooms ==
Per the National Alliance to End Homelessness&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance to End Homelessness. (2018). State of homelessness. National Alliance to End Homelessness, retrieved from https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-report/&lt;/ref&gt;, in January 2017, there were a total of 553,742 homeless people accounted for across the United States, including territories. Of those accounted for, 192,875 of them were unsheltered and “lived in a place not meant for human habitation, such as the street or an abandoned building”. Many unsheltered homeless camps are located in industrial districts and along highways, far away from public parks facilities where traditional public bathrooms are located. If local municipalities do not provide bathroom access, the homeless are left to defecate in the streets and waterways near their camps. Robinson and Sickels with the University of Colorado Denver &lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Sickels (2015). No right to rest criminalizing homelessness in Colorado. University of Colorado Denver and Denver Homeless Outloud, retrieved from http://www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/homelessness-study.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; released a report highlighting the criminalization of homelessness across the State of Colorado. During their research, they found that 83% of the people they interviewed were denied bathroom access because they were homeless. Without access to public bathrooms, unsheltered homeless populations across the country are living in third world conditions. This, in turn, leads to public health concerns such as the hepatitis A outbreak seen in California. As reported by Dr. Kushel with The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kushel, M. (2018). Hepatitis A outbreak in California – addressing the root cause. The New England Journal of Medicine, retrieved from https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1714134&lt;/ref&gt;, in 2017 alone 649 people in California were infected with hepatitis A, this outbreak began in the homeless population. If we fail to consider the true cost of denying the homeless bathroom access, we put our communities at risk and leave an entire group of people to live as second-class citizens without basic first world amenities.

== Advocacy and awareness ==

=== National Alliance to End Homelessness ===
[http://www.endhomelessness.org/ The National Alliance to End Homelessness] offers an organized spread of homeless issues and solutions while providing means of donation and support. President Nan Roman expresses that in her opinion, "People will always have problems and crises. But in a nation as wealthy as ours, where human life is valued, widespread homelessness need not—and SHOULD not—exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Message from the President |url=http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/message_from_the_president |website=National Alliance to End Homelessness |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week ===
The National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week is held every year the week before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] to raise awareness of issues relating to hunger and homelessness in communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title=National Hunger &amp; Homelessness Awareness Week |url=http://nationalhomeless.org/about-us/projects/awareness-week/ |website=National Coalition for the Homeless |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity offers guidelines and educational tools that encourage the public to get involved. Participants are encouraged to share thanks and help fellow community members in times of need.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sex differences in religion can be classified as either "internal" or "external". Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the sex or gender of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity;&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, Darlene. "Gender." In ed. J. Hinnels. The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion. 2nd ed.  New York: Routledge, 2010:245-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. For example, various religious perspectives have either endorsed or condemned alternative family structures, homosexual relationships, and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/NSWBills.nsf/1d4800a7a88cc2abca256e9800121f01/d598da2bcf9adfd0ca257186007f644c!OpenDocument 'Unborn Child Protection Bill'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303211432/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/NSWBills.nsf/1d4800a7a88cc2abca256e9800121f01/d598da2bcf9adfd0ca257186007f644c!OpenDocument |date=March 3, 2016 }}, State Parliament of [[New South Wales]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; External religious issues can also be examined from the "lens of gender" perspective embraced by some in [[feminism]] and/or [[critical theory]] and its offshoots.

In studies pertaining to gender patterns in religions, it has been widely accepted that females are more likely to be religious than males.
In 1997, statistics gathered by Beit-Hallahmi and Argyle theorized this phenomenon into three primary causes. The first explanation is that women feel emotions at greater heights than men do, thus women tend to turn to religion more in times of high emotions such as gratitude or guilt. The second explanation is that female socialization is more likely to align with values that are commonly found in religion such as conflict mediation, tenderness, and humility. In contrast, male socialization is more likely to emphasize rebellion, thus making the guideline aspects of religion less appealing. The third explanation, which is also the most recent theory, is that females are more likely to be able to identify with religion as a natural consequence of societal structures. For example, since a majority of religions emphasize women as caretakers of the home, the societal expectation of women to take greater responsibility than men for the upbringing of a child makes religion an appealing commitment. Another example is that traditionally, men tend to work outside the home whereas women tend to work inside the home, which corresponds to studies that have shown that people are more likely to be religious when working inside of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2095292|title=Gender Differences in Religion: A Test of the Structural Location Theory|first1=David|last1=de Vaus|first2=Ian|last2=McAllister|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=52|issue=4|pages=472–481|doi=10.2307/2095292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender of deities ==
{{Main|Gender of God}}

The earliest documented religions, and some contemporary [[Animism|animist religions]], involve deification of characteristics of the natural world. These spirits are typically, but not always, gendered. It has been proposed, since the 19th century, that [[polytheism]] arose out of animism, as [[religious epic]] provided personalities to [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] animist spirits in various parts of the world, notably in the development of [[Ancient Near East|ancient near eastern]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] literature. Polytheistic gods are also typically gendered. The earliest evidence of [[monotheism]] is the worship of the goddess [[Eurynome]], [[Aten]] in Egypt, the teaching of [[Moses]] in the [[Torah]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Persia]]. [[Aten]], [[Yahweh]] and [[Ahura Mazda]] are all masculine deities, embodied only in metaphor, so masculine rather than reproductively male.

Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Deborah. Class Lecture. Introduction to Women's Studies. Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo. 21 Jan  2009.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that ancient religious Goddesses have been reinterpreted to follow specific gender roles. For example, the Nordic goddess [[Freya]] first represented war and love, but after centuries, she was transformed into only representing love and a sexual behaviour. 

The Hindu goddess, Kali, breaks the gender role of women representing love, sex, fertility, and beauty because she is the goddess of both the life cycle and destructive war. An example of the typical female goddess is Aphrodite, who is shown as vain, simple, and beautiful.

In [[Christianity]], one entity of the Trinity, the Son, is believed to have become incarnate as a human male. Christians have traditionally believed that God the Father has masculine gender rather than male sex because the Father has never been incarnated. By contrast, there is less historical consensus on the [[gender of the Holy Spirit]]. Islam, on the other hand, has a tradition that the name Allah, like its referent, can be allocated neither grammatical nor natural gender. Masculine pronouns for Allah in the [[Qur'an]] are interpreted as generic.

== Creation myths about human gender ==
The [[creation myth]]s of many religions contain stories about how humans came to have gender.

In many stories, man and woman are created at the same time, with equal standing. One example is the creation story in [[Genesis creation myth|Genesis 1]]: "And God created the man in his image. In the image of God he created him.  Male and female he created them."&lt;ref name="Genesis 1"&gt;{{bibleref|Genesis|1:27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators interpret the parallelism to be deliberately stressing that mankind is, in some sense, a "unity in diversity" from a divine perspective (compare ''[[e pluribus unum]]''),&lt;ref&gt;See Geneva College discussion of a biblical foundation for a broader concept of multiculturalism based on this verse"

"Rather, human diversification receives its first mention in Genesis 1:27, where the text announces the creation of the one human race:  'So God created the human race in his own image ... male and female he made them.'  The text's singular term, 'human race' (`Adam in Hebrew), is specified as diverse in gender, male and female.  Diversification immediately receives further stimulus in the Cultural Mandate of Genesis 1:28:  "Be fruitful, increase in number, fill the earth and subdue it."  This divine command calls explicitly for the scattering of the race—a theme that shall recur in the Genesis narratives—and thus calls implicitly for cultural diversification."
Byron Curtis, "[http://www.geneva.edu/page/diversity A Blueprint for Excellence Through Diversity at Geneva College]", ([[Geneva College]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
and that [[woman|women]] as well as [[man|men]] are included in [[Image of God|God's image]]. The first man, Adam, has been viewed as a spiritual being or an ideal who can be distinguished as both male and female; an androgynous being with no sex.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, Daniel. "Gender." In ed. M.C. Taylor. Critical Terms for Religious Studies. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998: 120.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Chaunu]] argues that [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]' gender-inclusive conception of humanity contrasts sharply with the views of gender found in older [[literature]] from surrounding [[culture]]s, and suggests a higher [[Social status|status]] of women in [[western society]] due to Judæo-Christian influence, and based on this [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse]].&lt;ref name="Chaunu" /&gt; Some scholars, such as Philo, argue that the "sexes" were developed through an accidental division of the "true self" which existed prior to being assigned with gender.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other accounts, man is created first, followed by woman. This is the case in the creation account of Genesis 2, where the first woman (Eve) is created from the [[rib]] of the first man (Adam), as a companion and helper.&lt;ref name="Genesis 2"&gt;{{bibleref|Genesis|2:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This version is normally cited by Jewish authorities in support of [[patriarchy]], and likewise by Christian interpreters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  A similar story appears in the [[Qur'an]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} There is an interesting correlation between the two gender creation stories, both stories imagine the ideal of the unitary self. However, the unitary self is either androgynous or physically male; both of which are masculine in configuration. Thus male and female are to become one; meaning that she is to become male.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second creation story of Adam and Eve became influential in regards to how women were viewed in Victorian society by means of the "Eva/Ave Palindrome" where Eva was woman in her weak and evil state, based on Eve in the Garden of Eden and Ave was Mary (as in Ave Maria), the new holy and pure ideal that was impossible for women to mimic.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Davidson. Class Lecture. Introduction to Women's Studies. Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo. 21 Jan  2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, women have been placed into two categories; women and virgins. Women who become intimate with men are marked women, whereas those who do not participate in such acts and who are divinely inspired are considered virgins. Thus women can escape from being gendered as women if they participate in celibacy.&lt;ref&gt;Boyarin, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']], [[Aristophanes]] provides an account to explain gender and romantic attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hunter, ''Plato's Symposium'', ([[Oxford University Press]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0AnvceBAq4C&amp;pg=PA60 p. 60].&lt;/ref&gt;
There were originally three sexes: the all-male, the all-female, and the "androgynous", who was half man, half woman.  As punishment for attacking the gods, each was split in half.  The halves of the androgynous being became [[heterosexual]] men and women, while the halves of the all-male and all-female became [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s, respectively.&lt;ref name="Symposium"&gt;The ''Symposium'' of Plato, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DSym.%3Asection%3D189c 189c2-193d5]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership roles ==
{{Main|Ordination of women}}

Some religions restrict leadership to males.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} In a small minority of religious some select roles are restricted to women only.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The [[ordination of women]] has been a controversial issue in some religions where either the rite of [[ordination]], or the role that an ordained person fulfills, has traditionally been restricted to men because of cultural or theological prohibitions.

Beginning in the 19th century, some [[Christian denominations]] have ordained women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/femclrg13.htm|title=Religious sexism: when faith groups started and stopped ordaining women}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those who do not, many believe it is forbidden by {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|2}}.  Some of those denominations ordain women to the [[diaconate]], believing this is encouraged by {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|3-4}}.
Some [[Islam]]ic communities (mainly outside the Middle East) have recently appointed [[women as imams]], normally with ministries restricted to leading women in prayer and other charitable ministries.

=== Dharmic religions ===
Both masculine and feminine deities feature prominently in [[Hinduism]]. The identity of the [[Vedic]] writers is not known, but the first hymn of the [[Rigveda]] is addressed to the masculine deity [[Agni]], and the pantheon of the Vedas is dominated by masculine gods. The most prominent [[Avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] are men.

Mostly, the traditional religious leaders of [[Jainism]] are all men. The 19th [[tirthankara]] (traditional leader) [[Māllīnātha]] in this half cycle was  female. 

[[Siddhartha Gautama]] (the [[Buddhism|Buddha]]) was a man, but the female Buddha [[Vajrayogini]] is very important in [[Buddhism]].

=== Abrahamic religions ===
In Abrahamic religions, [[Abraham]] himself, [[Moses]], [[David]] and [[Elijah]] are among the most significant leaders documented according to the traditions of the Hebrew Bible. [[John the Baptist]], [[Jesus]] and his apostles, and [[Saul of Tarsus]] again give the [[New Testament]] an impression of the founders and key figures of Christianity being male dominated. They were followed by a millennium of theologians known as the [[Church Fathers]]. [[Islam]] was founded by [[Muhammad]], and his successor [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and [[Ali]], for Sunnis and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[The Twelve Imams]] for those of Shia faith, were also men. On the other hand, [[The Virgin Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, is not associated with leadership or teaching, but is nonetheless a key figure in Catholicism. [[Fatimah]], daughter of Muhammad is regarded by Muslims as an exemplar for men and women.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]], a [[Growth of religion#Bahá'í Faith|fast growing religion]], teaches that men and women are equal, and there have been many and prominent women celebrated in Bahá'í history such as [[Bahiyyih Khánum]], who acted head of the faith for several periods during the ministries of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and [[Shoghi Effendi]], and [[Táhirih]], who is also held by Bahá'ís as a penultimate leader. Women serve in higher percentages of leadership in appointed and elected national and international institutions of the religion than in the general population. However, only men are allowed to be members of the religion's highest governing body, the [[Universal House of Justice]]. See [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality]].

[[Nakayama Miki]] was the founder of [[Tenrikyo]], which may be the largest religion to have a woman founder.
[[Ellen G. White]] was instrumental to the founding of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and is officially considered a prophet by Seventh-day Adventists.&lt;ref name="Fundamentals"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2006-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, White's biblical commentaries and other writings are often considered [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] or even infallible.

[[Mary Baker Eddy]] was the founder of the [[Christian Science]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianscience.com/about-mary-baker-eddy.html|title=Who is Mary Baker Eddy?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Segregation ==
[[File:Mejitza.jpg|right|thumb|A mechitza in [[Livingston, New Jersey]].]]
Many religions have traditionally practiced [[sex segregation]].

In traditional [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, the women's section is separated from the men's section by a wall or curtain called a [[mechitza]].&lt;ref name="separation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm|title=Synagogues, Shuls and Temples|work=jewfaq.org|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are not permitted to pray in the presence of women, to prevent distraction.&lt;ref name="separation" /&gt; The ''mechitza'' shown in the picture on the right is one in a synagogue affiliated with the 'left wing' (more modern side) of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], which requires the ''mechitza'' to be of the height shown in the picture. More traditional or 'right wing' Modern Orthodox Judaism, and all forms of [[Haredi Judaism]], requires the ''mechitza'' to be of a type which absolutely prevents the men from seeing the women.

[[Enclosed religious orders]] are usually segregated by gender.

[[Sex segregation and Islam|Sex segregation in Islam]] includes restrictions on interaction between men and women.  Men and women also worship separately in most [[mosque]]s. According to the Quran, women are not permitted to enter the mosque unless they cover their hair with hijabs and their bodies with modest clothing. Additionally, they are not to wear perfume, nail polish, or any other things that can cause sexual distress to men. For this reason, women pray behind men or in separate rooms from men in order to avoid causing sexual distress to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/49898|title=Conditions of women going out to the mosque - islamqa.info|publisher=islamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles in marriage ==
Nearly all religions recognize [[marriage]], and many religions also promote views on appropriate [[gender role]]s within marriage.

Two notable views are [[Complementarianism]] and [[Egalitarianism#Religious and spiritual egalitarianism|Egalitarianism]].

In Genesis 3, Adam names his wife Eve ("life") because she "was the mother of all living" ({{bibleref|Genesis|3:20|9}}).

=== Christianity ===

The complementarian view of marriage is widely accepted in Christianity, the husband viewed as the leader and wife viewed as the follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/church-history/article/what-would-jesus-do-sexuality-and-salvation-in-protestant-evangelical-sex-manuals-1950s-to-the-present/A0D3B75DDB5D49ADB5E65D2725F72C20|title=What Would Jesus Do? Sexuality and Salvation in Protestant Evangelical Sex Manuals, 1950s to the Present|first=Amy|last=DeRogatis|publisher=|journal=Church History|volume=74|issue=1|pages=97–137|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S0009640700109679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the man is given more of a headship role and the woman is viewed as a supporting component. In mainstream Christian tradition, the relationship between a husband and wife is believed to mirror the relationship between Christ and the Church. This can be seen in Ephesians 5:25:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm|title=Ephesians 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her|website=biblehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.}}
The man, Christian traditionalists assert, is meant to be a living martyr for his wife, "giving himself up for her" daily and through acts of unselfish love.&lt;ref name="waynegrudem.com"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.waynegrudem.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Biblical-Foundations-for-Manhood-and-Womanhood.pdf | title=Biblical Foundations for Manhood and Womanhood | publisher=Crossway Books | editor=Grudem, Wayne | year=2002 | location=US | isbn=1-58134-409-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman, on the other hand, is meant to be a helper.&lt;ref name="waynegrudem.com"/&gt;

While this has been the norm for years, some Christians are moving towards more Egalitarian views.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thomas, G. (2013). The sacred search: what if its not about who you marry, but why? Colorado Springs, CO: David C Cook.&lt;/ref&gt; As the nature of gender roles within the societies churches operate within changes, views on what "natural" roles look like have been shifting as well. What once would've been rejected, gender equality within heterosexual marriage, is now being brought in as a viable option within the faith.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Homosexual gender roles within marriage have not been widely expounded upon by Christian churches due to the inconsistency in doctrine regarding the issue across the faith as a whole.&lt;ref name="waynegrudem.com"/&gt;

=== Islam ===
{{Further|Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam}}
In [[Gender roles in Islam|Islam]], a woman's primary responsibility is usually interpreted as fulfilling her role as a wife and mother, whereas women still have the right and are free to work.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, L., 1992, ''Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate'', New Haven, Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A man's role is to work and be able to protect and financially support his wife and family.&lt;ref&gt;Hessini, L., 1994, Wearing the Hijab in Contemporary Morocco: Choice and Identity, in Göçek, F. M. &amp; Balaghi, S., ''Reconstructing Gender in the Middle East: Tradition, Identity &amp; Power'', New York, Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to guidelines in marriage, a man is allowed to marry a Muslim, Jewish, Sabaean, or Christian woman whereas a woman is only allowed to marry a Muslim man. Both genders cannot marry nonbelievers or polytheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.221|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202024354/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/002-qmt.php#002.221|archivedate=2015-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter of divorce is discussed in verse 2:228 of the Qu'ran. The Qu'ran instructs women to wait at least three menstrual periods, called Iddah, before committing to a second marriage. The purpose of the Iddah is to ensure that a woman's pregnancy will be linked to the correct biological father. In the case of a Talāq, which is a divorce initiated by the man, the man is supposed to announce the words "I divorce you" aloud three times, each separated by a three-month waiting period. Certain practices of the Talāq divorce allows the "I divorce you" utterance to be completed in one sitting; however, the concept of "Triple Divorce" in one sitting is considered wrong in some branches of Islam such as with the Shia Muslims. During the three-month waiting period, only the man has the right to initiate a marital reunion if both sides desire to reconcile. This yields a gender equality perspective in the sense that women have power over men in regards to finance parallel to how men have power over women in regards to obedience, both of which are only valid to a reasonable extent. While a Ṭalāq can be completely easily, a divorce that is initiated by the woman, called a Khula, is harder to obtain due to a woman's requirement to repay her dowry and give up child custody. More specifically, a woman is to give up custody of her child if the child is over the age of seven. If a woman gains custody of her child who is under the age of seven, she must still forfeit custody upon the child's seventh birthday. Although the Islamic religion requires the woman to repay her dowry, she is also entitled to receive financial support from her former husband if needed. This cycle of financial matters protects the woman's property from being taken advantage of during or after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wmlawandpractice.com/2011/04/11/women%e2%80%99s-rights-in-islam-regarding-marriage-and-divorce/ | title=Women's Rights In Islam Regarding Marriage And Divorce | date=April 11, 2011 | accessdate=August 23, 2016 | author=Imani Jaafar-Mohammad, Esq.|author2=Charlie Lehmann|work=William Mitchell Journal of Law and Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural effects on religious practice ==
Religious worship may vary by individual due to differing cultural experiences of gender.

=== Greco-Roman Paganism ===
Both men and women who practiced paganism in ancient civilizations such as Rome and Greece worshiped male and female deities, but goddesses played a much larger role in women's lives. Roman and Greek goddesses' domains often aligned with culturally specific gender expectations at the time which served to perpetrate them in many cases. One such expectation of women was to marry at a relatively young age. The quadrennial Bear Festival, known as Arkteia, was held on the outskirts of Athens in honor of Artemis and involved girls ages seven to fourteen. The girls would compete in public athletic events as Greek men sat as onlookers, observing potential wives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kraemer, Ross Shepard. ''Her Share of the Blessings : Women's Religions among Pagans, Jews, and Christians in the Greco-Roman World''. Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demeter, the goddess of fertility, was a prominent deity due to women's ability to relate to her. The myth surrounding Demeter involves her losing her daughter, Persephone, against her will to Hades and the grief she experiences after the event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mother-daughter relationships were very important to ancient Greeks and the severance of that relationship by fathers and husbands created much strain in young women who were forced to leave their mothers and submit to their husbands and the patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Marilyn B. "Politics and Pomegranates: An Interpretation of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter." ''Arethusa'' 10 (1977):7-47&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter was honored through female-exclusive ceremonies in various rituals due to her general disdain for the behaviors of men. Aphrodite, too, was honored by similar means.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To women during this time period, the thought of Aphrodite's attitude toward males was comforting as she refused to answer to any mortal man, exhibiting the control that mortal women desired to have in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Frederick. "Home Before Lunch: The Emancipated Woman in Theocritus," in Foley, ''Reflections of Women in Antiquity.'' 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==
In many religions, [[abortion]] is considered immoral.

The Catholic Church recognizes conception as the beginning of a human life, thus abortion is prohibited under all circumstances. However, according to the Second Vatican Council, women who have had an abortion but are willing to commit to the right of life are ensured forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html |title=Evangelium Vitae (25 March 1995) – John Paul II |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212211142/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html |archivedate=2015-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hinduism, it is a woman's human duty to produce offspring, thus having an abortion is a violation of that duty. The Vedas, which are age-old sacred Sanskrit texts, suggests that abortion is more sinful than killing a priest or one's own parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml|title=BBC – Religions – Hinduism: Abortion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of a woman having an abortion is deemed as unacceptable in the Hindu community, both socially and morally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VssJ5c7KsNwC|title=Hindu Ethics: Purity, Abortion, and Euthanasia|first1=Harold G.|last1=Coward|first2=Julius|last2=Lipner|authorlink2=Julius J.

== Homosexuality ==
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

Homosexuality is expressly forbidden in many religions, but typically in [[Casuistry|casuistic]] rather than [[Apodicticity|apodictic]] laws. As such, the rationale for such proscriptions is not clearly evident, though avoidance of procreation and contribution to society via establishing families are sometimes offered as pragmatic considerations.

In general, homosexuality is perceived as sinful in conservative movements and fully accepted in liberal movements. For example, the Southern Baptist Christian denomination considers homosexuality a sin whereas the American Baptist denomination perceives homosexuality on an inclusive scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/homosexuality/christianity.htm|title=Christian views of homosexuality – ReligionFacts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and religion ==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
{{Section OR|date=April 2011}}}}

=== Christianity ===
The feminist study of gender and religion began in the 1960s and '70s, when some scholars and women (e.g., [[Mary Daly]]) began to feel increasingly dissatisfied with the position of women in religion. Feminism has engaged with Christians in three main ways:
* from ''outside'' religions as, often critically or as "Rejectionists", feminist scholars have cited religious texts and practice as evidence of patriarchal institutions within humans societies, antithetical to feminist aims;
* from ''within'' religions as "Traditionalists", some members, scholars and leaders sympathetic to feminism have attempted reforms to harmonize contemporary religious thought and practice to be more in line with feminism; and,
* independently of established religion, also as Rejectionists, some feminist thinkers have attempted to construct a theology or range of religious practices based on feminist principles, notably but not restricted to [[Wicca]], [[neopaganism]] and various [[New Age]] religions.

In contrast, Christian writer and speaker Paul Coughlin&lt;ref&gt;Coughlin, Paul. "[http://cms.mgtow.net/?q=node/37 Pain and Prejudice]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723205756/http://cms.mgtow.net/?q=node%2F37 |date=July 23, 2011 }}", 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that male influence in Christianity is overstated, and moreover that a substantial [[misandry|misandric]] undercurrent has existed in American Protestantism for many decades:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here are some of the messages Christian men have been told [by religious leaders], some for decades:
*If there is a major problem in a couple's marriage, whether or not it leads to divorce, it is ultimately the husband's fault.
*Women are more moral and spiritual than men.
*Women are more sensitive to the Holy Spirit than men. ...

...beating up on Christian men in church is good business in Christian media [and husbands] have been told that a "good Christian man" does not confront his wife about her [abusive, self-absorbed or unreasonable] behavior. His spiritual training has told him that accepting abuse is synonymous with sacrifice, so he sits there and takes it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Feminist theology ===
{{Main|Feminist theology}}
Feminist theology is a movement,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} generally in [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of their religion from a feminist perspective.

Likewise, those who practice feminist spirituality may adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In these cases, the notion of [[God]] as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns.

== Views on transgender identities ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''see also:'' [[Transgender people and religion]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Paganism and Neo-paganism ===
Many Pagan religions place an emphasis on female divine energy which is manifested as The Goddess. The consensus is unclear on what is considered female and male. During PantheaCon in 2011, a group of [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic Wiccans]] performing an all-female ritual turned away trans-women from joining due to their concept of women as capable of experiencing menstruation and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, Christine Hoff. “Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary Paganism.” ''Religion Compass'', vol. 6, no. 8, Aug. 2012, pp. 390–401. ''EBSCOhost'', doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2012.00367.x.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other pagans, however, have embraced a multitude of gender identities by worshiping transgender, intersex, and queer gods from antiquity, such as Greek god, Hermaphroditus. &lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda. “‘Listening With’ Ovid.” ''Helios'', vol. 36, no. 2, Fall 2009, pp. 175–202. ''EBSCOhost'', echo.louisville.edu/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=48444068&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious support for gender equality ==
Some religions, religious scholars and religious have argued that "gender inequality" exists either generally or in certain instances, and have supported a variety of remedies.

Sikhs believe in equality of men and women [[Pierre Chaunu]] has argued that the influence of Christianity is the main factor leading to equality for women.&lt;ref name="Chaunu"&gt;"Pierre Chaunu also contends that the very recognition of women as full-fledged human beings depends on moral and ethical categories that derive ultimately from the Bible. He points out, for example, in his book ''Foi et histoire'' (Faith and History, 1980), that it is only in those cultures where the biblical text and Christianity have had some long term influence, that the status of women has gradually improved from that of property and progenitor to that of a full human being, equal to man. In cultures where the biblical text has not had any significant impact, women are regarded as property whose main purpose is to produce children. In such cultures, women are married as soon as they are able to procreate, they have little or no access to formal education, and they are allowed little self-determination. The main reason behind this social transformation is fundamentally linked to a statement found in Genesis 1:27: 'God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.' This text affirms the intrinsic dignity of both men and women regardless of their gender or social status. This is in stark contrast to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia where the value of human beings was primarily determined on the basis of their social standing." Pierre Gilbert, ''How the Bible Shapes Our World''&lt;/ref&gt;

Priyamvada Gopal, of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], argues that increased gender equality is indeed a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but not ''exclusive'' to it. She expresses concern that gender equality is used by western countries as a rationale for "[[neocolonialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"The insistence that equality is a western concept to be defended against the incursions of others relies on a continued deafness to resistant voices from outside Judaeo-Christian contexts. This, ironically, makes the self-proclaimed liberals who insist on this useful collaborators for authoritarian chauvinists from outside the west. For they are all in curious agreement that women's equality is a western concept and call for it, accordingly, to be either enforced (that's why we sent in the troops) or rejected (by keeping women secluded)." Priyamvada Gopal, "[http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= West has no monopoly on battle for gender equality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612155056/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=ODYyODgyODA= |date=June 12, 2010 }}", ''[[Kuwait Times]]'' September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jamaine Abidogun argues another interesting perspective: that Judeo-Christian influence has indeed shaped gender roles in Nigeria (a strongly Christianised country); however, she doesn't consider feminism to be a product of Judeo-Christian doctrine, but rather a preferable form of "neocolonialism".&lt;ref&gt;"These perceptions demonstrate a pattern of gender roles shaped by Western Judeo-Christian doctrine within the formal education curriculum, minimal inclusion of local history or cultural content, and loss of indigenous knowledge and practices. Gender-role change is one aspect of a general Westernizing effect of formal models of Western education on indigenous cultures." Jamaine Abidogun, "Western education's impact on Northern Igbo gender roles in Nsukka, Nigeria", ''[[Africa Today]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guahibo''', the native language of the [[Guahibo people]], is a [[Guahiban languages|Guahiban]] language that is spoken by about 23,006 people in [[Colombia]] and additional 8,428 in [[Venezuela]].  There is a 40% rate of monolingualism, and a 45% literacy rate.

==Sounds==
===Stress===

Guahibo has a unique and complex stress system with both primary and secondary stress. The stress system shows a sensitivity to syllable weight so that heavy syllables are always stressed. Both contrasting trochaic and iambic patterns are found on morphemes in nonfinal morphemes with more than two syllables:

:{|
! Trochaic !! Iambic
|-
| (''''L'''L)(''''L'''L)&lt;br /&gt;''mátacàbi'' "day" || (L''''L''')(L''''L''')&lt;br /&gt;''tulíquisì'' "bead necklace"
|}

The binary feet are parsed from left to right within each morpheme. Morphemes with an odd number of syllables leave the final syllable unstressed (and unparsed into feet):

:{|
! Trochaic !! Iambic
|-
| (''''L'''L)L&lt;br /&gt;''wánali'' "crystal" || (L''''L''')L&lt;br /&gt;''wayáfo'' "savannah"
|-
| (''''L'''L)(''''L'''L)L&lt;br /&gt;''pàlupáluma'' "rabbit" || (L''''L''')(L''''L''')L&lt;br /&gt;''culèmayúwa'' "species of turtle"
|}

Morphemes that consist of two syllables and are also word-final are an exception to the above and only have the trochaic pattern:

:{|
! Trochaic !! Iambic (with reversal)
|-
| (''''L'''L)&lt;br /&gt;''náwa'' "grass fire" || (''''L'''L)&lt;br /&gt;''púca'' "lake"
|}

These morphemes alternate with an iambic pattern when placed in a nonfinal context. Thus ''náwa'' keeps its trochaic pattern with the addition of a single light syllable morpheme like ''-ta'' "in":

: ''náwa'' + ''-ta'' → ''náwata'' (''''L'''L)L

However, an iambic word show its underlying iamb when it is followed by ''-ta'':

: ''púca'' + ''-ta'' → ''pucáta'' (L''''L''')L

Affixation generally does not affect the stress pattern of each morpheme.

Heavy syllables since they are required to be stressed disrupt perfect trochaic and iambic rhythms. However, morphemes with a sequence of at least two light syllables show contrasting stress patterns:

:{|
! Trochaic !! Iambic
|-
| (''''L'''L)(''''H''')&lt;br /&gt;''nónoj&lt;u&gt;ì&lt;/u&gt;'' "hot peppers" || (L''''L''')(''''H''')&lt;br /&gt;''jútabài'' "motmot"
|}

'''Primary Stress.''' Primary stress generally falls on the rightmost nonfinal foot. For example, the following word 

: ('''ˌL'''L)('''ˈL'''L)L (''pà.lu'').(''pá.lu'').ma'' "rabbit"

has primary stress on the rightmost foot (''pa.lu'') which is not word-final. However, the rightmost foot (''qui.si'') in

: (L'''ˈL''')(L'''ˌL''') (''tu.lí'').(''qui.sì'') "bead necklace"

is word-final and cannot receive primary stress; the primary stress then falls on the next rightmost foot (''tu.li''). Placing a light syllable suffix ''-ta'' "with" after a four syllable root shows shifting of primary stress:

: (L'''ˈL''')(L'''ˌL''') ''tsapánilù'' "species of turtle"
: (L'''ˌL''')(L'''ˈL''')L ''tsapànilúta'' "with the turtle"

With the addition of the suffix, the root-final foot (''ni.lu'') is no longer word-final and is subsequently permitted to accept primary stress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14443">The '''Guðmundur and Geirfinnur case''' (Icelandic: '''Guðmundar- og Geirfinnsmálið''') is a case concerning the disappearances of Guðmundur Einarsson and Geirfinnur Einarsson in 1974 in [[Iceland]]. Six people were convicted of their alleged murders on the basis of confessions extracted by the police after intense and lengthy interrogations despite the lack of bodies of the murder victims, witnesses or any forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="visir-2018-09-27"/&gt; In later years, most Icelanders believe the six were wrongfully convicted.

On 27 September 2018, 44 years after the disappearances of Guðmundur and Geirfinnur, the [[Supreme Court of Iceland]] acquitted five of the six original suspects.&lt;ref name="visir-2018-09-27"/&gt;

==Disappearances==
On the night of 26 January 1974, Guðmundur Einarsson, an 18-year-old casual labourer, was walking back from the community hall (''Alþýðuhúsið'') in [[Hafnarfjörður]] to his home, {{convert|10|km}} away.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2014/newsspec_7617/index.html|title=The Reykjavik Confessions|last=Cox|first=Simon|orig-year=2014-05-15|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|format=interactive feature|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|date=September 2018 |accessdate=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was last seen by a motorist after he nearly fell in front of a vehicle and has not been seen since.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Ten months later, on 19 November 1974, Geirfinnur Einarsson, a 32-year-old construction worker unrelated to Guðmundur, received a phone call whilst at home and drove a short distance to the harbour cafe in [[Keflavik]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He left the keys in the ignition, but failed to return to the car.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Extensive searches around the harbour and coast did not find a body, and, although the police in Iceland regularly are informed about people who disappear in snowstorms without motive, witnesses, forensic evidence or bodies,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/out-of-thin-air-a-true-story-of-impossible-murder-in-iceland-anthony-adeane-the-reykjavik-confessions-the-incredible-true-story-of-iceland-s-most-notorious-murder-case-by-simon-cox-review-nd98p6f7c|title=Book review: Out of Thin Air by Anthony Adeane; The Reykjavik Confessions by Simon Cox|last=McConnachie|first=James|date=2018-03-11|work=The Times|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; a murder enquiry was opened.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Six suspects, Sævar Ciesielski, Kristjan Vídar Vídarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason, Guðjón Skarphéðinsson and Erla Bolladóttir, eventually signed confessions to murder, even though they had no clear memory of committing the crimes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4f60adae-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c|title=Shades of grey: those who confessed to a crime they don’t remember|last=Milne|first=Richard|date=2016-08-26|work=The Financial Times|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been kept in isolation, interviewed at length under pressure with little contact allowed with their lawyers.

In 1976, [[Einar Bollason]], the chairman of the [[Icelandic Basketball Federation]], sat innocent for 105 days in solitary confinement, along with Magnús Leópoldsson, Valdimar Olsen and Sigurbjörn Eiríksson, after Einar's half-sister, Erla Bolladóttir, and other suspects had implicated them in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ólafur Ragnarsson|title=Sífellt klifað á því, að ég byggi yfir ákveðinni vitneskju|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3352044|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Vísir|date=12 May 1976|pages=8-9|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visir"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hef meiri tíma með hestunum|url=http://www.visir.is/g/2012703319859|accessdate=24 August 2017|work=[[Vísir.is]]|date=April 1, 2012|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ferðin sem aldrei var farin|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3061362|accessdate=1 February 2018|work=Dagblaðið|date=11 May 1976|page=8|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tryggvi Rúnar died in 2009, after battling cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson: Taldi skynsamlegt að játa rangar sakargiftir |url=https://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2017/02/25/taldi_skynsamlegt_ad_jata_rangar_sakargiftir/ |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=[[Morgunblaðið]] |date=25 February 2017 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sævar Ciesielski died after an accident in Denmark in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sævar Ciesielski er látinn |url=http://www.visir.is/g/2011707149899 |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=[[Vísir.is]] |date=14 July 2011 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was made public in a [[BBC]] radio programme in May 2014, which discussed the apparent [[memory implantation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Williams, [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/may/16/reykjavik-confessions-abba-radio-review The Reykjavik Confessions], ''The Guardian'', UK, 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Gísli Guðjónsson]], a former Icelandic detective and internationally renowned expert on suggestibility and false confessions, investigated this case and concluded: "I've worked on miscarriages of justice in many different countries. I've testified in several countries - hundreds of cases I’ve done, big cases. I'd never come across any case where there had been such intense interrogation, so many interrogations and such lengthy solitary confinement. I mean I was absolutely shocked when I saw that."&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Most Icelanders came to believe the case had been a bad miscarriage of justice,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the BBC described it as "one of the most shocking miscarriages of justice Europe has ever witnessed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05d6zb4|title=Storyville Trailer, Out of Thin Air: Murder in Iceland|last=|first=|date=2017|website=BBC Four|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrial==
In 2013, an official police investigation report was handed to the office of the State Prosecutor. On February 24, 2017, the Interior Ministry's Rehearing Committee concluded that the cases of Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason and Guðjón Skarphéðinsson should be reheard by the [[Supreme Court of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2017/08/10/iceland_s_most_famous_disappearance_case_back_to_co/|title=Iceland's most famous disappearance case back to court next week|last=|first=|date=2017-08-10|work=Iceland Monitor|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the committee did not recommend a retrial for Erla Bolladóttir's [[perjury]] case.

In February 2018, the State Prosecutor requested that the [[Supreme Court of Iceland|Icelandic Supreme Court]] acquit Sævar Ciesielski, Kristján Viðar Viðarsson, Tryggvi Rúnar Leifsson, Albert Klahn Skaftason, Guðjón Skarphéðinsson, and Erla Bolladóttir.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On 27 September 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted all five men, but did not reverse Erla Bolladóttir's conviction.&lt;ref name="visir-2018-09-27"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sunna Kristín Hilmarsdóttir |title=Allir sýknaðir í Guðmundar- og Geirfinnsmálunum |url=http://www.visir.is/g/2018180929054/allir-syknadir-i-gudmundar-og-geirfinnsmalunum |accessdate=27 September 2018 |work=[[Vísir.is]] |date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/news/2018/09/27/all_found_innocent_in_gudmundur_and_geirfinns_case_/ |title=All found innocent in Guðmundur and Geirfinns case, 44 years after the supposed crimes were committed |date=27 September 2018 |work=Iceland Monitor |publisher=''Morgunblaðið'' |accessdate=7 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==
A documentary directed by [[Dylan Howitt]] called ''Out of Thin Air'' came out in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/politics_and_society/2017/08/10/iceland_s_most_famous_disappearance_case_back_to_co/|title=Iceland's most famous disappearance case back to court next week|date=10 August 2016|work=[[Morgunblaðið]]|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was inspired by the BBC programme.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; An Icelandic film called ''Imagine Murder'' ({{Lang-is|Lifun}}) was being made about the case in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28431">An '''isotopic signature''' (also '''isotopic fingerprint''') is a ratio of non-radiogenic '[[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotopes]]', stable [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic isotopes]], or unstable [[radioactive]] isotopes of particular elements in an investigated material. The ratios of isotopes in a sample material are measured by [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]] against an [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|isotopic reference material]]. This process is called [[isotope analysis]].

==Stable isotopes==
The [[atomic mass]] of different isotopes affect their [[chemical kinetics|chemical kinetic]] behavior, leading to natural [[isotope separation]] processes.

===Carbon isotopes===
{{Hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]}} &lt;!--Can't get superscript to work otherwise with template: {{Main article|δ13C}} --&gt;

{{Algal carbon isotopes}}
For example, different sources and sinks of [[methane]] have different affinity for the [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] isotopes, which allows distinguishing between different sources by the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio in methane in the air. In [[geochemistry]], [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleoceanography]] this ratio is called [[Δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]. The ratio is calculated with respect to [[Δ13C#Reference standard|Pee Dee Belemnite]] (PDB) [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|standard]]:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\delta \ce{^{13}C}_\mathrm{sample} = \left(\frac{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\ce{sample}}{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\mathrm{standard}} - 1\right) \cdot 1000&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil;

Similarly, carbon in inorganic [[carbonate]]s shows little isotopic fractionation, while carbon in materials originated by [[photosynthesis]] is depleted of the heavier isotopes. In addition, there are two types of plants with different biochemical pathways; the [[C3 carbon fixation]], where the isotope separation effect is more pronounced, [[C4 carbon fixation]], where the heavier &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is less depleted, and [[Crassulacean Acid Metabolism]] (CAM) plants, where the effect is similar but less pronounced than with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants. Isotopic fractionation in plants is caused by physical (slower diffusion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in plant tissues due to increased atomic weight) and biochemical (preference of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C by two enzymes: [[RuBisCO]] and [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]]) factors.&lt;ref&gt;Park S. Nobel (2009) Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. P.410.&lt;/ref&gt; The different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the [[food chain]], thus it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or an animal consists primarily of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[rice]], [[wheat]], [[soybeans]], [[potato]]es) or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[maize|corn]], or [[corn-fed beef|corn-fed]] [[beef]]) by [[isotope analysis]] of their flesh and bone collagen (however, to obtain more accurate determinations, carbon isotopic fractionation must be also taken into account, since several studies have reported significant &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C discrimination during biodegradation of simple and complex substrates).&lt;ref name="FernandezCadisch2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=Irene|last2=Cadisch|first2=Georg|title=Discrimination against13C during degradation of simple and complex substrates by two white rot fungi|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|volume=17|issue=23|year=2003|pages=2614–2620|issn=0951-4198|doi=10.1002/rcm.1234|pmid=14648898|bibcode=2003RCMS...17.2614F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FernandezMahieu2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=I.|last2=Mahieu|first2=N.|last3=Cadisch|first3=G.|title=Carbon isotopic fractionation during decomposition of plant materials of different quality|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=17|issue=3|year=2003|pages=n/a|issn=0886-6236|doi=10.1029/2001GB001834|bibcode = 2003GBioC..17.1075F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within C3 plants processes regulating changes in δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C are well understood, particularly at the leaf level,&lt;ref name="FarquharEhleringer1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farquhar|first1=G D|last2=Ehleringer|first2=J R|last3=Hubick|first3=K T|title=Carbon Isotope Discrimination and Photosynthesis|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|volume=40|issue=1|year=1989|pages=503–537|issn=1040-2519|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.40.060189.002443}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also during wood formation.&lt;ref name="McCarrollLoader2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarroll|first1=Danny|last2=Loader|first2=Neil J.|title=Stable isotopes in tree rings|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=23|issue=7–8|year=2004|pages=771–801|issn=0277-3791|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2003.06.017|bibcode = 2004QSRv...23..771M |citeseerx=10.1.1.336.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eweda Silveira Lobo Sternberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ewe|first1=Sharon M.L|last2=da Silveira Lobo Sternberg|first2=Leonel|last3=Busch|first3=David E|title=Water-use patterns of woody species in pineland and hammock communities of South Florida|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=118|issue=1–3|year=1999|pages=139–148|issn=0378-1127|doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(98)00493-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent studies combine leaf level isotopic fractionation with annual patterns of wood formation (i.e. tree ring δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) to quantify the impacts of climatic variations and atmospheric composition&lt;ref name="CabaneiroFernandez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabaneiro|first1=Ana|last2=Fernandez|first2=Irene|title=Disclosing biome sensitivity to atmospheric changes: Stable C isotope ecophysiological dependences during photosynthetic  uptake in Maritime pine and Scots pine ecosystems from southwestern Europe|journal=Environmental Technology &amp; Innovation|volume=4|year=2015|pages=52–61|issn=2352-1864|doi=10.1016/j.eti.2015.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; on physiological processes of individual trees and forest stands.&lt;ref name="SilvaAnand2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=Lucas C.

Similarly, marine fish contain more &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C than freshwater fish, with values approximating the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants respectively.&lt;!--bones are composed of an inorganic matrix and organic collagen --&gt;

The ratio of carbon-13 and carbon-12 isotopes in these types of plants is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = O'Leary | first1 = M. H.| title = Carbon Isotopes in Photosynthesis| jstor = 1310735| journal = BioScience| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 328–336| year = 1988| doi = 10.2307/1310735}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -16 to -10 ‰
* CAM plants: -20 to -10 ‰
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -33 to -24 ‰

[[Limestone]]s formed by precipitation in [[sea]]s from the atmospheric carbon dioxide contain normal proportion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. Conversely, [[calcite]] found in [[salt dome]]s originates from carbon dioxide formed by [[oxidation]] of [[petroleum]], which due to its plant origin is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted. The layer of limestone deposited at the Permian extinction 252 Mya can be identified by the 1% drop in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope]] is important in distinguishing [[biosynthetized]] materials from man-made ones. [[Biogenic]] chemicals are derived from biospheric carbon, which contains &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Carbon in artificially made chemicals is usually derived from [[fossil fuel]]s like [[coal]] or [[petroleum]], where the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C originally present has decayed below detectable limits. The amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C currently present in a sample therefore indicates the proportion of carbon of biogenic origin.

===Nitrogen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ15N|δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]}}
[[Isotopes of nitrogen#Nitrogen-15|Nitrogen-15]], or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, is often used in [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[medicine|medical]] research, for example in the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]] to establish the nature of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meselson |first=M. |last2=Stahl |first2=F.

Nitrogen-15 is extensively used to trace [[Ammoniacal nitrogen#Mineral nitrogen|mineral nitrogen]] compounds (particularly [[fertilizers]]) in the environment. When combined with the use of other isotopic labels, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is also a very important [[Isotopic tracer|tracer]] for describing the fate of nitrogenous [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tissues and [[hair]] of [[vegan]]s therefore contain significantly lower δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N than the bodies of people who eat mostly meat. Similarly, a terrestrial diet produces a different signature than a marine-based diet. Isotopic [[hair analysis|analysis of hair]] is an important source of information for [[archaeology|archaeologists]], providing clues about the ancient diets and differing cultural attitudes to food sources.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Richardsa,b,1 and Erik Trinkausc [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16034.full Isotopic evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans] ''PNAS September 22, 2009vol. 106 no. 38 16034-16039''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other environmental and physiological factors can influence the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the [[food web]] (i.e. in plants) or at the level of individual animals. For example, in arid regions, the [[nitrogen cycle]] tends to be more 'open' and prone to the loss of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, increasing δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in soils and plants.&lt;ref name="Handley"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Handley |first=L.L |last2=Austin |first2=A.

===Oxygen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]}}
Oxygen comes in three variants, but the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]] is so rare that it is very difficult to detect (~0.04% abundant).&lt;ref name="iupac_abundance"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Pure Appl.

Taylor | title = Atomic weights of the elements. Review 2000 (IUPAC Technical Report) | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | year = 2003 | pages = 683–799 | doi = 10.1351/pac200375060683}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O in water depends on the amount of evaporation the water experienced (as &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is heavier and therefore less likely to vaporize). As the vapor tension depends on the concentration of dissolved salts, the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratio shows correlation on the [[salinity]] and temperature of water. As oxygen gets built into the shells of [[calcium carbonate]] secreting organisms, such sediments prove a chronological record of temperature and salinity of the water in the area.

Oxygen isotope ratio in atmosphere varies predictably with time of year and geographic location; e.g. there is a 2% difference between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-rich precipitation in Montana and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-depleted precipitation in Florida Keys. This variability can be used for approximate determination of geographic location of origin of a material; e.g. it is possible to determine where a shipment of [[uranium oxide]] was produced. The rate of exchange of surface isotopes with the environment has to be taken in account.&lt;ref name="nucfor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3FnEOg8tS4C&amp;pg=PA399&amp;dq=%22nuclear+forensics%22&amp;num=50&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nuclear%20forensics%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Forensic Analysis - Kenton J. Moody, Ian D. Hutcheon, Patrick M. Grant - Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiogenic isotopes==

===Lead isotopes===
Lead consists of four stable [[isotopes of lead|isotopes]]: &lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, and &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb. Local variations in [[uranium]]/[[thorium]]/[[lead]] content cause a wide location-specific variation of isotopic ratios for lead from different localities. Lead emitted to the atmosphere by industrial processes has an isotopic composition different from lead in minerals. Combustion of [[gasoline]] with [[tetraethyllead]] additive led to formation of ubiquitous micrometer-sized lead-rich [[particulate]]s in car exhaust [[smoke]]; especially in urban areas the man-made lead particles are much more common than natural ones. The differences in isotopic content in particles found in objects can be used for approximate geolocation of the object's origin.&lt;ref name="nucfor"/&gt;

==Radioactive isotopes==
[[Hot particles]], radioactive particles of [[nuclear fallout]] and [[radioactive waste]], also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) can be determined by [[mass spectrometry]] or by [[gamma ray spectrometer|gamma spectrometry]]. For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cobalt|Co]] and &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]. The [[Chernobyl accident]] did not release these particles but did release &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;[[Antimony|Sb]] and &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cerium|Ce]]. Particles from underwater bursts will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;[[Plutonium|Pu]]/&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu are also different for fusion and fission [[nuclear weapon]]s, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin.

==Applications==

===Archaeological studies===
In archaeological studies, stable isotope ratios have been used to track diet within the time span formation of analyzed tissues (10-15 years for bone collagen and intra-annual periods for tooth enamel bioapatite) from individuals; "recipes" of foodstuffs (ceramic vessel residues); locations of cultivation and types of plants grown (chemical extractions from sediments); and migration of individuals (dental material).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Forensics===
With the advent of stable [[isotope ratio mass spectrometry]], isotopic signatures of materials find increasing use in [[forensics]], distinguishing the origin of otherwise similar materials and tracking the materials to their common source. For example, the isotope signatures of plants can be to a degree influenced by the growth conditions, including moisture and nutrient availability. In case of synthetic materials, the signature is influenced by the conditions during the chemical reaction. The isotopic signature profiling is useful in cases where other kinds of profiling, e.g. characterization of [[impurities]], are not optimal. Electronics coupled with scintillator detectors are routinely used to evaluate isotope signatures and identify unknown sources.

A study was published demonstrating the possibility of determination of the origin of a common brown [[pressure sensitive adhesive|PSA]] [[packaging tape]] by using the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic signature of the backing polymer, additives, and [[adhesive]].&lt;ref&gt;James F. Carter, Polly L. Grundy, Jenny C. Hill, Neil C. Ronan, Emma L. Titterton and Richard Sleeman "Forensic isotope ratio mass spectrometry of packaging tapes" Analyst, 2004, 129, 1206 - 1210, {{doi|10.1039/b409341k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement of carbon isotopic ratios can be used for detection of [[adulteration]] of [[honey]]. Addition of sugars originated from corn or sugar cane (C4 plants) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins; in an unadulterated honey the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = González Martı́n | first1 = I.| last2 = Marqués Macı́as | first2 = E.| last3 = Sánchez Sánchez | first3 = J.| last4 = González Rivera | first4 = B.| title = Detection of honey adulteration with beet sugar using stable isotope methodology| journal = Food Chemistry| volume = 61| issue = 3| pages = 281–286| year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/S0308-8146(97)00101-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As low as 7% level of addition can be detected.&lt;ref name="honeycouncil.ca"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140101171222/http://www.honeycouncil.ca/documents/HivelightsNov2004.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1912">'''Kaji Pratha''' ({{lang-ne|काजी प्रथा}}) is the honorary hereditary practice that originated from medieval period in Nepal. After Shri Paanch Bada Maharaj Dhiraj [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] completed the "''Greater Nepal''", he honored five castes with the hereditary title of "Kaji". Initially, four castes  ''Basnyat, Khadka, Pande'' and ''Thapa'' were esteemed with the title and later the ''Kunwar'' clan was also subjected to this respectful designation. 

This honorary hereditary title is in existence even in today's time as respective 5 castes are till date corresponded to with the title "Kaji" prior to one's family name. The respect that is to be provided to these elite classes of Kshatriya was even implemented to the likes of Brahmans, the highest of the Hindu castes. 

Similarly, another form of Kaji System came into existence much later which was non-hereditary. The title "Kaji" was provided to the representative of the people's governing body. As it was non hereditary title this term was only enjoyed by the personal till he was incumbent to the King and the people.

'''Kvens''' ([[Kven language|Kven]]/[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''kveeni'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''kvener'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''kväner'', [[Northern Sami]]: ''kveanat'') are a [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] ethnic minority in [[Norway]]. They descended from [[Finnish people|Finnish]] peasants and fishermen who emigrated from the northern parts of [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]] to [[Northern Norway]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1996, the Kvens were granted minority status in Norway, and in 2005 the Kven language was recognized as a minority language in Norway.

==Name==
{{Main|Origin of the name Kven}}
The [[Origin of the name Kven|origin of the term Kven]] is disputed. There is no evidence that modern Kvens are descendants of the Kvens mentioned in a few ancient Norwegian and Icelandic sources. As a result of Norway signing the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] in 1999, the term Kven became for the first time an official name, the name of Finnish descendants with a long history in Norway who view themselves as a member of that particular ethnic minority group of Finnish descent. 

There is a theory among some academic groups that due to the discrimination and suppression by the Norwegian authorities the term Kven became derogatory in the late 19th century. Therefore, many Kvens  preferred to be called 'suomalaiset' (finns).&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Hyltenstam &amp; Tommaso Maria Milani: ''[http://odin.dep.no/kkd/norsk/dok/andre_dok/rapporter/043041-220005/dok-bn.html Kvenskans status:  Rapport för Kommunal- og regionaldepartement och Kultur- og kirkedepartement]''. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; But with the revitalization of the Kven culture in the 1970s, Kvens themselves started using the term. However, even in the 1990s there was a debate whether the Norwegian terms 'finne', 'finsk', or 'finskætted' (respectively a Finnish person, Finnish, and of Finnish origin) should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, V. (1985), Inngruppe- og utgruppe i kommunikasjon mellom etniske grupper. En teoretisk tilnærming til etnologisk analyse av kulturelle former. Arbeidsrapport nr. 2 fra prosjektet Finsk kulturforskning i Nord-Norge. Tromsø: Tromsø Museum/IMV. University of Tromsø. Norges allmennvitenskaplige forskningsråd.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, today the term Kven is accepted and used, for example, in the name of the Kven organization in Norway (Norske Kveners Forbund).

==Demographics==
The Kvens were registered as a separate group in the Norwegian censuses in the period 1845 to 1930. From the 18th century the Kvens started to comprise a significant part of the population in Northern Norway. In 1845 13.3% of the population in Finnmark, and 3.2% in Troms, considered themselves as Kvens. In 1854 the numbers increased to respectively, 19.9% and 7.0%. The peak was in 1875, with respectively 24.2% and 7.7%. The ratios were reduced to respectively 20.2% and 3.7%, in 1890, and 13.8% and 2.0% in 1900 (all numbers from).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Niemi, E. (1978), Den finske kolonisasjon av Nordkalotten – forløp og årsaker. Ottar, 103. 49-70.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1930 census there were 8,215 registered Kvens in Troms and Finnmark. In 1950, 1,439 people reported that they used the Finnish language in Troms (58 people) and Finnmark (1,381 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/arkiv/maanedens/1999/199906e.htm|title=Universitetsbiblioteket i Tromsø - juni 1999|website=www.ub.uit.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the number of Kvens was estimated to be about 10,000 to 15,000 in a parliamentary inquiry on national minorities in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odin.dep.no/krd/norsk/dok/regpubl/stmeld/016001-040003/hov005-bn.html|title=St.meld. nr. 15 (2000-2001)|first=Kommunal- og|last=regionaldepartementet|date=8 December 2000|website=Regjeringa.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, estimating the number of Kvens is difficult since there is no official definition of a Kven. Therefore, other studies have estimated the number of Kvens to be about 50,000–60,000, based on the criteria that at least one grandparent spoke Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;Saressalo, L. (1996), Kveenit. Tutkimus erään pohjoisnorjalaisen vähemmistön identiteetistä. Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran Toimituksia, 638. Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; But many of these may consider themselves to be Norwegian or Sami or a combination.

==History==
===Migrations===
[[File:Reindeer milking.jpg|thumb|A Kven woman milking a [[reindeer]] (late 19th century)]]

Danish/Norwegian tax records from the 16th century already list some Kvens living in [[North Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Niemi, E. (1994), Kvenene og staten – et historisk riss. I: Torekoven Strøm (ed.), Report from the seminar ”Kvenene – en glemt minoritet?” Monday 14.11.94 at the University of Tromsø/ Tromsø Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the famous [[Carta marina|map of Scandinavia]] by [[Olaus Magnus]] from 1539 shows a possible Kven settlement roughly in between today's [[Tromsø]] and [[Lofoten]] named "Berkara Qvenar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.lib.umn.edu/map/OLAUS/SEC/bsect.html|title=James Ford Bell Library · University of Minnesota Libraries|website=www.bell.lib.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kvens of this time are often connected to the [[birkarl]] organization in northern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Vahtola, Jouko. ''Tornionlaakson historia I''. Birkarlit, 'pirkkalaiset'. Malungs boktryckeri AB. Malung, Sweden. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In some early documents Kvens are also grouped together with the [[Sami people]], who are the indigenous people of Central and Northern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schnitler. {{lang|no|Grenseeksaminasjonsprotokoller 1742-1745}}. Volume I-III. Editors J. Qvigstad, K. B. Wiklund, Lars Ivar Hansen and Tom Schmidt. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main immigration of Kvens to Norway can be divided into two periods.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The first immigration was from about 1720 to 1820, when Finnish speaking people from the northern Finland and [[Torne River Valley]] moved to river basins and fjord-ends in [[Troms]] and the western parts of [[Finnmark]], to places such as [[Polmak]], [[Karasjok]], [[Porsanger]], [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] and [[Lyngen]]. 

The second immigration was after 1820 until about 1890 to the coastal areas of eastern Finnmark, motivated by the booming fishing industry in Northern Norway. In addition, it was also easier to get to America from there than from Northern Finland and many moved to Finnmark before continuing over the Atlantic.  Migration ended from problems in the fishing industry, population pressure, migration to America and increasing problems for Kven in buying land and getting Norwegian citizenship.

==Language==
The [[Kven language]] is a [[Finnic language]]. From a linguistic point of view, Kven is a [[mutually intelligible]] [[dialect]] of [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but for political and historical reasons, it received in 2005 status of a legal [[minority language]] in [[Norway]], within the framework of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].

Kven differs from Finnish since the Kven population was in effect isolated from other Finnish-speaking people. The Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian loanwords, and Finnish words that are no longer used in Finland are still used. In a 2005 government report, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used.

==Ethnic controversies==
In the 1990s there was a debate among Kvens whether they should be considered as an ethnic group of their own, or whether they were Finnish Norwegians. As well, during the process of legal recognition of the Kven language, there was a debate as to whether it should be considered an actual language or merely a dialect of Finnish, and whether the Kven language or Kven dialect of Finnish should be taught in schools.

Kven and Sami people share a common history of ''[[Norwegianization]]''. However, post-Norwegianization policies have treated them differently. Sami people have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of ''[[Finnmark Estate]]'' (the organization owning about 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami people too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people who think the Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people.

Lately, the [[Norwegian Kven Organization]] has attempted to get the Kvens recognized, similarly to the Sami people, as an indigenous people in Norway. This has made it important for some Kvens to show that their history stretches further back in time than commonly believed. There has been some recent unofficial adoption of the word "Kainu" as the new name for "Kven", in accordance with the hypotheses put forward by Finnish historians [[Jouko Vahtola]] and [[Kyösti Julku]]. Vahtola has hypothesized that words "Kven" and "Kainu(u)" are [[Origin of the name Kainuu|interchangeable]].

==Modern recognition==
The flag of [[Kvenland]] was hoisted at the [[Kiruna]] City Hall in [[Sweden]] on March 16, 2013, at 11:00, in celebration and honor of the first annual Day of the Kvens.  Hereafter, that date - March 16 - is meant to be recognized wider in the Kven communities of the north, and by others as well.

The date for the occasion was chosen from the 14th century signing of a state treaty between Sweden and Kvenland, known as Tälje Charter ("Tälje stadga" in Swedish).   In that treaty, the king of Sweden guaranteed the Kvens ("[[Birkarls]]") trading rights in the north (translation from Latin last printed in 1995, Wallerström, page 48).&lt;ref name="Wallerström, 1995"&gt;''Tälje stadga'' (Translation from Latin). Wallerström, 1995. Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Kiruna is a part of the [[Kiruna Municipality]].  It is the northernmost municipality of Sweden, and geographically it is Sweden's largest, covering roughly 4.604% of the total area of Sweden.

In the past, the [[Kven language]] spoken in Norway was considered a dialect of [[Finnish language]], much like the Finnic [[Meänkieli]] language spoken in northern Sweden.  Today, both are officially recognized minority languages in the areas where the languages are spoken.  The [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Meänkieli]] and [[Sami language|Sami]] all are officially recognized minority languages in the Kiruna Municipality in Sweden.

==Culture and media==
===Ruijan Kaiku===
{{Main|Ruijan Kaiku}}
'''Ruijan Kaiku''' is a bi-lingual newspaper ([[Kven language|Kven]]/[[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) that is published in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]. Currently one issue is published each month. The newspaper writes mostly about Kven issues, and about the work of strengthening Finnish language and culture in Norway. In addition the paper has stories about other Finnish organizations in Norway, and about other Finnish minorities in the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and surrounding countries. The newspaper's Chief editor is Liisa Koivulehto.

===Baaski festival===

''Baaski'' is a Kven culture festival held in [[Nordreisa]]. The first festival was in June 2007, but it is intended to be an annual event. The responsible organizers is Nordreisa municipality, and the first festival director was Johanne Gaup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvenkultursenter.no/baaski.asp|title=Startsiden - Halti kvenkultursenter IKS|website=www.kvenkultursenter.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kven costume===
In the late 1990s a Kven costume was designed. It is not a reconstruction of an old costume, but rather a new design based on pictures and other sources about the clothing and jewelry used by Kvens in the late 19th and early 20th century. The purpose of creating the costume was to unify and strengthen Kven identity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Kadonu Loru===
''Kadonu Loru'' is the only [[pop music]] single ever recorded in the Kven language. It is based on an old Kven [[nursery rhyme]] about making sausages. The artists are Karine Jacobsen and Kine Johansen respectively from [[Børselv]] and [[Lakselv]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The single was published by [[Iđut]].

==Organisations and institutions==
===The Norwegian Kven organization===
{{Main|Norwegian Kven Organization}}
The Norwegian Kven Organization (''Ruijan Kveeniliitto'' in Kven/Finnish and ''Norske Kveners Forbund'' in Norwegian) was established in 1987, and has currently about 700 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvener.no/|title=Norske Kveners Forbund|website=Norske Kveners Forbund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has local branches in: [[Skibotn]], [[Børselv]], [[Nord-Varanger]], [[Deatnu - Tana|Tana]], [[Lakselv]], [[Alta, Norway|Alta]], northern [[Troms]], [[Tromsø]], and [[Østlandet]].

The tasks of the organisation include working for a government report about the history and rights of the Kven population, improving the media coverage of Kven issues, and for the Norwegian government to establish a secretary (''statssekretær'') for Kven issues. In addition, reading and writing classes at the beginner to advanced level, establishing a Kven kindergarten, and to incorporate the Kven language in all education levels in Norway. Also, to establish a Kven culture fund, road and other signs in Kven, Kven names in official maps, and museums and centers for Kven language and culture.

===The Kven institute===
{{Main|Kainun institutti}}
The Kven institute (''Kainun institutti'' in Kven/Finnish and ''Kvensk institutt'' in Norwegian) is a center for Kven culture and [[Kven language|language]] located in [[Børselv]] in [[Porsanger|Porsangi (Porsanger)]] municipality in [[Norway]].

===Kven Language Board===
The Kven Language Board that was established in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakrad.no/Aktuelt/Kvensk-sprakrad-er-dannet/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513062744/http://www.sprakrad.no/Aktuelt/Kvensk-sprakrad-er-dannet/ |archivedate=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the leader Irene Andreassen, Terje Aronsen, Prof. Anna Riitta Lindgren, Assoc. Prof. Eira Söderholm, and Pia Lane. The first task is to create a standard for written Kven language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ságat]] Tuesday, April 19th, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1480">'''Lango''' is a community of [[Nilotic]] people originating in [[South Sudan]]. They are [[nomad]]ic [[agriculture|agriculturists]]. The Lango live in the [[Ikotos County]] area of [[Imatong State]]. This region borders [[Uganda]]; however, the inhabitants are distinct from the [[Lango of Uganda]].   

== Composition ==
The Lango comprises six subtribes, including the [[Ketebo people|Ketebo]], Lokwa, [[Logir people|Lokir]], [[Dongotono people|Dongotono]], [[Imotong people|Imotong]] and Lorwana. They originate from the Okol hill and Lolim mountain regions of northern Uganda, or from the [[Acoli people]] of Uganda and South Sudan.

The Lorwana tribe's language (okolye or okolie) is spoken mainly by Lorwana natives, though it was adopted by the Ketebo people in the 1940s when their language vanished. The Ketebo people are now integrated into the Lorwana community, though they speak a slight variant of okolie. The Dongotono Lango subtribe also speaks okolie, importing some words from the otuho language of the [[Lotuko people]].

==Alternative spellings==
The name "''Lango''" can also be spelled as ''Langgo'' or ''Lalangoni'' when referring to a male, or as ''Nalangoni'' for a female.

{{Context|date=October 2009}}

A '''low arousal approach''' deals with how staff handles patients who are easily [[arousal|aroused]] (in a non-sexual sense). These approaches aim to make staff avoid confrontational situations and to, instead, go for the [[path of least resistance]]".&lt;ref name="mcd98"&gt;McDonnell, Reeves, Johnson &amp; Lane, 1998, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of low arousal approaches is one of non-confrontation. In high-risk situations, responses that reduce arousal are adopted by carers and staff, especially when confronted by distressed individuals. These approaches became popular in services for people with [[intellectual disabilities]] in the [[UK]] in the mid-1990s. This [[humanistic]] and person-centred approach to [[crisis management]] was developed in response to the use of restrictive responses to crises such as restraint, seclusion, and chemical restraint. The avoidance of sanctions- and of consequence-based punishment strategies became an implicit part of the approach.

==Strategies==
A number of different strategies are employed in [[healthcare]] settings for the management of challenging behaviour. A theoretical rationale for a collection of short-term non-aversive [[behaviour management]] strategies described as low [[arousal]] approaches is to avoid the use of [[punish]]ing consequences to behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, McEvoy &amp; Dearden, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach acknowledges the potential role of cognitive behavioural frameworks in shaping staff behaviour.

===Components===
There are four key components considered central to low arousal approaches, and those include both [[cognitive]] and behavioural elements:
# Decreasing staff demands and requests to reduce potential points of conflict around an individual
# Avoiding potentially arousing [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], such as direct [[eye contact]], [[touch]], and removal of spectators to the incident
# Avoidance of [[non-verbal]] behaviours that may lead to conflict, such as aggressive [[Human position|postures]] and stances
# Challenging staff beliefs about the short-term management of challenging behaviours

==Evidence==
Few studies have been published that directly examine the application of these approaches. In a [[case study]], there was a significant reduction in verbal and physical [[aggression]] following the application of low arousal approaches with an adult with an intellectual [[disability]] in a [[hospital]] setting.&lt;ref name="mcd98"/&gt;

===Autism and arousal===
Arousal is not a new construct and was originally proposed as an explanatory theory for [[autism spectrum disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hutt, Hutt, Lee and Ounsted, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Two implications of this theory are that children and adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would be more reactive to sensory stimuli than the normal population, and they may be slower to [[habituate]] to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. There is some laboratory evidence of differences in physiological responses of individuals with ASD compared to non-autistic controls.&lt;ref&gt;Althaus, van Roon, Mulder, Mulder, Aarnoudse and Minderaa 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirstein Iversen and Ramachandran 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Engeland, Roelofs, Verbaten and Slangen, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies comparing autistic children to non-autistic controls, one studying the baseline [[heart rate]]s of each,&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, et al., (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and another comparing their baseline skin conductance responses.&lt;ref&gt;Hirstein, et al., (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyper- or hypo-arousal?===
Hyper-arousal is not universally accepted by all researchers. A recent review of sensory difficulties in autism concluded that the experimental evidence or hyper-arousal was at best mixed.&lt;ref name="ro"&gt;Rogers and Ozonoff, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of problems with this view. First, ASD is a [[heterogeneous]] condition and the assumption that hyper-arousal should be a general explanatory theory of autism was too broad. Second, sensitivity to arousing stimuli may be intermittently presenting in individuals with ASD. Third, the stimuli employed in habituation [[paradigm]]s cannot easily mimic real life non-laboratory-based events. Animal research on arousal has attempted to link deficiencies to conditions such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and autism.&lt;ref&gt;Garey, Goodwillie, Frohlich, Morgan, Gustafsson, Smithies, Korach, Ogawa and Pfaff, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, hypo-arousal in people with an ASD has also been proposed as a factor to specific stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;Rimland, 1964; DesLauriers and Carlson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; although with limited laboratory evidence.&lt;ref name="ro"/&gt; Repetitive movements may serve a dearousing function.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsbourne, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual sensory experiences have been reported in autobiographical accounts of people with an ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Shore, 2003; O'Neill and Jones, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory over-activity has been explained as a possible response to hyper-arousal.&lt;ref name="liss"&gt;Liss, Saulnier, Fein and Kinsbourne, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; An understanding of arousal and sensory experiences may have great explanatory significance for some forms of challenging behaviours.

===Stress and arousal===
Stress and anxiety has been proposed as a factor in challenging behaviours of people with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Howlin, 1998; Groden, Cautela, Prince and Berryman, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[Stress management#Transactional model|transactional model of stress and coping]] that emphasizes the interaction between an individual and his or her environment. In this model, [[stress (biological)|stress]] occurs when the demands of [[stressors]] outweigh coping responses.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus and Folkman (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; There is a clear interaction between environmental and [[physiological]] events. Implicit in this model is the cognitive appraisal of threat. Some individuals with an ASD have difficulties in regulating their emotional responses and even communicating this to carers.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; To help account for challenging behaviours, such as [[aggression]] and [[self-injury]], arousal may mediate stress. There is a strong association between arousal and sensory experiences of people with ASD.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;

==Arousal curve and information processing==
The majority of individuals spend time in a state of arousal [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]]. In the case of people with an ASD, two distinct arousal groupings have an effect on behaviour. A group of individuals will be hyper-aroused and highly reactive to environmental sensory stimuli.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt; At the opposite end of the distribution, a proportion of people are hypo-aroused. A number of people with ASD, who present with challenging behaviours, may experience either constant or intermittent states of hyper-arousal.

The '''Married Woman Property Association''' ([[Sweden|Swedish]]: ''Föreningen för gift kvinnas äganderätt''), was a Swedish women's rights organisation active in Sweden between 1873 and 1896. Its purpose was to work for the introduction of reformed laws in favor of women's equality with men. The association was founded with the goal to reform the marriage laws regarding the guardianship of men over their wife, and to make it possible for married women to handle their own economy. However, despite the name, they also worked for legal reform in other issues within women's rights. It is regarded as the first women's rights organisation in Sweden.  
==History==
The association was co-founded by [[Anna Hierta-Retzius]] and [[Ellen Anckarsvärd]] in 1873, while it was formally headed by the male parliamentarian [[Gustaf Fridolf Amlquist]]. The association is regarded to have been foremost an association for women of the upper classes and male liberal intellectuals. Among their members were [[Amanda Kerfstedt]] and [[Ellen Key]].

The association worked to affect public opinion in order to introduce legal reform regarding gender equality. Its first purpose, which gave the association its name, was to give married women control over their own property. This was a controversial subject: married women were legally minors under the guardianship of their husbands, and thus had not control over their own property, unless there had been a prenuptial agreement. What the association actually wished to achieve was, therefore, to abolish the guardianship of a husband over his wife. In 1874, a legal reform introduced the right for a professional married woman to control the money she earned after marriage. In 1884, a new reform allowed married women control over their inheritance and property. The same year, a reform declared unmarried women of legal majority at the same age as men: 21. However, these victories were not complete, as the guardianship of husband's over their wives were kept. 

The association worked for many other issues regarding reform in women's rights except for their main issue. During the 1880s, they had a campaign to increase the participation of women voters in the elections: since 1862, women of legal majority (unmarried, divorced and widowed women) had the right to participate in municipal elections if they met the property qualifications, and the association encouraged them to use this right: in the 1887 municipal election, the female voters participation consisted of 10-15 percent. 

In 1896, the association was absorbed by the [[Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet]] and dissolved.

'''Mono Lake''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|oʊ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|MOH|noh}}) is a large, shallow [[Salt lake|saline]] [[soda lake]] in [[Mono County, California]], formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in an [[endorheic basin]]. The lack of an outlet causes [[Hypersaline lake|high levels of salts]] to accumulate in the lake. These salts also make the lake water [[Alkalinity|alkaline]].

This desert lake has an unusually productive [[ecosystem]] based on [[brine shrimp]] that thrive in its waters, and provides critical habitat for two million annual migratory birds that feed on the shrimp and [[Ephydra hians|alkali flies]].&lt;ref name="mlcbirds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds of the Basin: the Migratory Millions of Mono|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/ecobirds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carle"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Water in California|last=Carle|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=0-520-24086-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the native [[Kucadikadi|Kutzadika'a]] people derived nutrition from the ''[[Ephydra hians]]'' pupae, which live in the shallow waters around the edge of the lake.

When the city of [[Los Angeles]] diverted water from the freshwater streams flowing into the lake, it lowered the lake level, which imperiled the [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds. The [[Mono Lake Committee]] formed in response and won a legal battle that forced Los Angeles to partially replenish the lake level.

==Geology==
Mono Lake occupies part of the [[Mono Basin]], an [[endorheic basin]] that has no outlet to the ocean. Dissolved salts in the runoff thus remain in the lake and raise the water's [[pH]] levels and salt concentration. The [[List of rivers of California#Mono Lake|tributaries of Mono Lake]] include [[Lee Vining Creek]], [[Rush Creek (Mono County, California)|Rush Creek]] and [[Mill Creek (Mono Lake)|Mill Creek]] which flows through Lundy Canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|263070|Lundy Canyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basin was formed by geological forces over the last five million years: [[basin and range]] crustal stretching and associated [[volcanism]] and faulting at the base of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Tierney2000p45"&gt;{{harvnb|Tierney|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five million years ago, the Sierra Nevada was an eroded set of rolling hills and Mono Basin and Owens Valley did not yet exist.

From 4.5 to 2.6 million years ago, large volumes of [[basalt]] were extruded around what is now Cowtrack Mountain (east and south of Mono Basin); eventually covering {{convert|300|sqmi|km2}} and reaching a maximum thickness of {{convert|600|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Tierney2000p45"/&gt; Later volcanism in the area occurred 3.8 million to 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Tierney2000p46"&gt;{{harvnb|Tierney|2000|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity was northwest of Mono Basin and included the formation of Aurora Crater, Beauty Peak, Cedar Hill (later an island in the highest stands of Mono Lake), and Mount Hicks.

Mono Lake is believed to have formed at least 760,000 years ago, dating back to the [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley eruption]]. Sediments located below the ash layer hint that Mono Lake could be a remnant of a larger and older lake that once covered a large part of [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], which would put it among the oldest lakes in North America. At its height during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]], the lake would have been about {{convert|900|ft|m}} deep.&lt;ref name="Harris2005p61"/&gt; Prominent old shore lines, called [[strandline]]s by geologists, can be seen west of the Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/long_valley/long_valley_sub_page_16.html|title=Mono Lake|work=Long Valley Caldera Field Guide|publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Mono Lake is in a geologically active area at the north end of the [[Mono–Inyo Craters]] volcanic chain and is close to [[Long Valley Caldera]]. Volcanic activity continues in the Mono Lake vicinity: the most recent eruption occurred 350 years ago, resulting in the formation of [[Paoha Island]]. [[Panum Crater]] (on the south shore of the lake) is an excellent example of a combined [[rhyolite]] [[Lava dome|dome]] and [[cinder cone]].

== Tufa towers ==
Among the most iconic features of Mono Lake are the columns of [[limestone]] that tower over the water surface. These limestone towers consist primarily of [[calcium]] [[carbonate]] minerals such as [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub href="endorheic basin"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This type of limestone rock is referred to as [[tufa]], which is a term used for limestone that forms in low to moderate temperatures.

=== Tufa tower formation ===
Mono Lake is a highly alkaline lake, or [[soda lake]]. [[Alkalinity]] is a measure of how many [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] are in a [[solution]], and how well the solution can neutralize [[acid]]s. [[Carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub href="Los Angeles"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup href="Bird migration"&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) are both bases. Hence, Mono Lake has a very high content of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]]. Through supply of [[calcium]] ions (Ca&lt;sup href="endorheic basin"&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), the water will precipitate [[Calcium carbonate|carbonate-minerals]] such as [[calcite]] (CaCO&lt;sub href="Lee Vining Creek"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Subsurface waters enter the bottom of Mono Lake through small springs. High concentrations of dissolved calcium ions in these subsurface waters cause huge amounts of calcite to precipitate around the spring orifices.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunn|first=James|date=1953|title=The origin of the deposits of tufa in Mono Lake|url=|journal=Journal of Sedimentary Petrology|volume=23|pages=18–23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tufa originally formed at the bottom of the lake. It took many decades or even centuries to form the well-recognized [[tufa]] towers. When lake levels fell, the tufa towers came to rise above the water surface and stand as the majestic pillars seen today (see Lake Level History for more information).

=== Tufa morphology ===
[[File:Thinolite_sketches.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thinolite_sketches.png|thumb|These are original sketches of thinolite made by Edward S. Dana from his book from 1884: ''Crystallographic Study of the Thinolite of Lake Lahontan''.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Dana, E. S. (1884). A crystallographic study of the thinolite of Lake Lahontan (No. 12). ''Govt. Print.

Russell]] made the first systematic descriptions of the Mono Lake tufa.&lt;ref&gt;Rusell, I. C. (1889). Quaternary history of Mono Valley, California: ''U. S. Geol. Survey 8th Ann. Rept. for 1886- 1887'', 261-394&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; The tufa occurs as "modern" tufa towers. However, you can also find tufa sections from old shorelines, when the lake levels were higher. These pioneering works in tufa morphology are still referred to by researchers today and were confirmed by James R. Dunn in 1953. The tufa types can roughly be divided into three main categories based on morphology:&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, I. C. (1883). Sketch of the geological history of Lake Lahontan: ''U. S. Geol. Survey 3rd Ann. Rept. for 1881-1882'', 189-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Lithoid tufa - massive and porous with a rock-like appearance
*Dendritic tufa - branching structures that look similar to small shrubs
*Thinolitic tufa - large well-formed crystals of several centimeters

These tufa types vary interchangeably both between individual tufa towers but also within individual tufa towers. There can be multiple transitions between tufa morphologies within a single tufa tower.

Through time, many hypotheses were developed regarding the formation of the large [https://www.mindat.org/min-11409.html thinolite] crystals (also referred to as [https://www.mindat.org/min-27112.html glendonite]) in thinolitic tufa. It was relatively clear that the thinolites represented a calcite [[pseudomorph]] after some unknown original [[crystal]].&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; However, the original crystal was only determined when the mineral [[ikaite]] was discovered in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly, H. (1963). " Ikaite", a New Mineral from Greenland. ''Arctic'', ''16''(4), 263-264.&lt;/ref&gt; Ikaite, or hexahydrated CaCO&lt;sub href="strandline"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is [[Metastability|metastable]] and only crystallizes at near-freezing temperatures. It is also believed that calcite crystallization inhibitors such as [[phosphate]], [[magnesium]], and [[organic carbon]] may aid in the stabilization of ikaite.&lt;ref&gt;Council, T. C., &amp; Bennett, P. C. (1993). Geochemistry of ikaite formation at Mono Lake, California: Implications for the origin of tufa mounds.

''American Mineralogist'', ''86''(11-12), 1530-1533.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ikka Fjord of [[Greenland]], ikaite was also observed to grow in columns similar to the tufa towers of Mono Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Buchardt, B., Israelson, C., Seaman, P., &amp; Stockmann, G. (2001). Ikaite tufa towers in Ikka Fjord, southwest Greenland: their formation by mixing of seawater and alkaline spring water. ''Journal of Sedimentary Research'', ''71''(1), 176-189.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led scientists to believe that thinolitic tufa is an indicator of [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] in Mono Lake because they reflect very cold temperatures.

=== Tufa chemistry ===
Rusell (1883) studied the chemical composition of the different tufa types in [[Lake Lahontan]], a large [[Pleistocene]] system of multiple lakes in California, Nevada, and Oregon. Not surprisingly, it was found that the tufas consisted primarily of [[Calcium oxide|CaO]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub href="File:Mono Lake Tufa.JPG"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. However, they also contain minor constituents of [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]] (~2 wt%), [[Iron oxide|Fe/Al-oxides]] (.25-1.29 wt%), and [[Phosphorus oxide|PO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] (0.3 wt%).
[[File:D18O_of_Mono_Lake.png|thumb|440x440px|The red line represents the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of a water mixture between lake water and riverine freshwater that depends on the fraction of lake water to riverine freshwater.]]

==== Carbon and oxygen isotopes ====
[[Isotopes of carbon|Carbon]] and [[Isotopes of oxygen|oxygen]] isotopic compositions of Mono Lake tufas have the potential to reveal many interesting things about how water bodies mix in Mono Lake, how the climate changed throughout time in the [[Mono Basin]], and how biology may or may not play a role in tufa formation. Steps have been made to understand the isotopic compositions of "modern" tufa and water isotopic composition in Mono Lake.

Mono lake water [[Total inorganic carbon|DIC]] has a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition of 2 ‰&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Peng, T.-H. and Broecker, W. (1980). Gas exchange rates for three closed-basin lakes. ''Limmol. Oceanogr., 25,'' 789-796.&lt;/ref&gt; (relative to PDB), and a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of -0.1 ‰ (relative to SMOW).&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Li., H.-C., Ku, T.-L., Stott, L. D. and Anderson, R. F. (1997). Stable isotope studies on Mono Lake (California). 1. d18O in lake sediments as proxy for climatic change during the last 150 years. ''Limmol. Oceanogr., 42,'' 230-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding rivers feeding into Mono Lake have a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of -14 to -17.5 ‰ and contains [[Total inorganic carbon|DIC]] with a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition of -14 ‰ .&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; We observe that both the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of Mono Lake are enriched compared to surrounding water. One explanation for the enrichment of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in Mono Lake water is [[evaporation]]. The lighter isotope (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) will preferentially be evaporated, leaving more of the heavier isotope (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) behind.

It is also important to note that tufa forms from a mixture between lake water and subsurface waters. Because the streams surrounding Mono Lake are [[Isotopic signature|depleted]] in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compared to the lake water, combining the two sources will result in a water mixture that is more depleted than lake water. The figure above shows how δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of a water mixture changes with the fraction of lake water component. As the fraction of lake water decreases, the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O decreases.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Li, H.-C. and Ku, T.-L. (1997). δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C- δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O covariance as a paleohydrological indicator for closed-basin lakes. ''Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 133'', 69-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carbonate hardness|total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration]] (ΣCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is much higher in the lake than in surrounding streams. Hence, this isotopic dilution effect is less significant for δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and water mixtures should be dominantly composed of δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C with lake water signatures.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; In theory, Mono Lake tufa should have a δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C composition reflecting the Mono lake water DIC composition, and a δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition reflecting a mixture between Mono Lake and surrounding riverine water. This is only if we assume that the subsurface waters have similar compositions to riverine water.

There is also a temperature-dependent fractionation between Mono Lake water and precipitating carbonates. The [[Clumped isotopes|clumped isotope]] composition (Δ47, representing the amount of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O in the carbonate) of Mono Lake tufa are 0.734-0.735 ‰.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The temperature and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of the corresponding water from which the tufa formed can be calculated using these Δ47-values&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S.T., O'Neil, J.R., 1997. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium oxygen isotope effects in synthetic carbonates. ''Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 61'', 3461-3475.&lt;/ref&gt; From these values, it is calculated that Mono Lake tufa formed at a temperature of ~15&amp;nbsp;°C in water. For δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, the calcite-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O fractionation is given by:

ε = 18.03(1000/T)-32.42&lt;ref&gt;Kim, S. T., &amp; ONeil, J. R. (1997). Temperature dependence of 18O. ''Geochimica Cosmochima Acta'', ''61'', 3461-3475.&lt;/ref&gt; ~ -30‰ (SMOW)

For δ13C, the calcite-DIC fractionation is roughly given by:

ε ~ 1-2 ‰ (PDB) at 25&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Chacko, T., Cole, D. R., &amp; Horita, J. (2001). Equilibrium oxygen, hydrogen and carbon isotope fractionation factors applicable to geologic systems. ''Reviews in mineralogy and geochemistry'', ''43''(1), 1-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calcite-aragonite fractionation is roughly given by:

ε ~ 2.7 ‰ (PDB) at 25&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

However, these fractionation effects do not account for [[salinity]]-dependency.

The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values of modern tufas are 28-32.5‰, which reflects a corresponding water mixture composition of -2‰ to 2‰.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Laura|date=2012|title=Kinetic isotope and trace element partitioning during calcite precipitation from aqueous solution|url=|journal=Berkeley: Thesis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This range is similar to the composition of a mixture between Mono Lake and riverine waters. However, this mixture appears to be largely dominated by Mono Lake water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Mono lake tufa have δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values that range from 5-8 for tufa of [[Aragonite|aragonitic]] composition&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and 7-9‰ for tufa of [[Calcite|calcitic]] composition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Horton, T. W., Defliese, W. F., Tripati, A. K., &amp; Oze, C. (2016). Evaporation induced 18 O and 13 C enrichment in lake systems: a global perspective on hydrologic balance effects. ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', ''131'', 365-379.&lt;/ref&gt; These tufas are a little enriched compared to modern lake water DIC.  As stated above, calcite/aragonite-DIC fractionation can only explain an enrichment of 1-3‰ compared to lake water, i.e. a tufa composition of 3-5‰. The reason for this small δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C enrichment of tufa is still unclear and requires follow-up studies. It could be related to changes in DIC composition of Mono Lake, riverine water, and subsurface water compositions in the immediate past, which in turn could be related to climate or biological productivity in the lake. However, it could also be related to the fact that we don't fully understand the isotopic composition of the subsurface waters that flow into Mono Lake. These subsurface waters may have a very different composition compared to both Mono Lake waters and riverine surface waters. In addition, secondary crystallization (e.g. formation of calcite from aragonite) or meteoric diagenetic effects could have some control on the isotopic composition as well. Lastly, scientists may have to revisit the salinity-dependency of calcite/aragonite-DIC fractionation to understand whether this 1-3‰ fractionation may actually be larger in a lake with conditions similar to Mono Lake.

== Lake level history ==
[[File:Lake_stands_and_isotopes.png|thumb|683x683px|In a closed lake system like Mono Lake, coupled evaporation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-degassing progresses will cause the lake water δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to increase. During stable low stands or high stands, there is no correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O. Importantly, a transformation to an open lake system may also cause δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O to become uncorrelated. Following increased precipitation and surface runoff, the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C will decrease.]]
An important characteristic of Mono Lake is that it is a [[Open and closed lakes|closed lake]]. This means that water does not flow out of the surface of the lake. Water can only escape the lake if it [[Evaporation|evaporates]] or is lost to [[groundwater]]. This may cause closed lakes to become very [[Salinity|saline.]] The lake level of closed lakes will be strongly dependent on [[Climate change|changes in climate]]. Hence, studying lake levels can reveal information about climate change in the past and present. Geochemists have observed that [[Carbonate rock|carbonates]] from closed lakes appear to have δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O with covariant trends.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Talbot, M. R. (1990). A review of the palaeohydrological interpretation of carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in primary lacustrine carbonates. ''Chemical Geology'', 80, 261-279.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this [[Covariance|covariation]] occurs because of coupled [[evaporation]] and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[degassing]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The lighter isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, will preferentially go to the gas phase with increased evaporation. As a result, δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in the remaining lake both become increasingly heavy. Other factors such as biology, atmospheric properties, and freshwater compositions and flow may also influence δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in lakes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Li, H. C. (1995). Isotope Geochemistry of Mono Lake, California: applications to paleoclimate and paleohydrology [PhD dissertation]. ''Available from University of Southern California, Los Angeles''.&lt;/ref&gt; These factors must be stable to achieve a covariant δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O trend.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As such, correlations between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C can be used to infer developments in the lake stability and [[Hydrology|hydrological]] characteristics through time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is important to note that this correlation is not directly related to the lake level itself but rather the rate of change in lake level. Three different studies with three different methods provide different resolutions to understanding the lake level history of Mono Lake (read below).

=== 150 year record ===
The [[Covariance|covariation]] between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O in lake water and lake level  in Mono Lake have been recorded over a 150-year time interval in Mono Lake.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record was compared to historic lake levels recorded by the USGS. The lake level and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record were observed to have a strong correlation with minor offsets. Changes in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of lake water were inversely correlated with lake level. This revealed six stages in lake level in the past 150 years:&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; high stands at 1845, 1880, and 1915 as well as low stands at 1860, 1900, and 1933. The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O record compared well to the recorded precipitation and streamflow of Nevada City in California. Decreases in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O correlated well with increases in precipitation as well as increases in streamflow and vice versa.

=== 10,000 year record ===
A [[Core sample|sediment core]] from Mono Lake reveals a 10,000 year record of carbonates ([[Radiometric dating|dated]] through ash beds).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Here δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C did covary when observed through long time intervals of &gt;5,000 years, whereas the correlation was not present during shorter time scales. It was found that the record revealed 5 periods of distinct lake conditions:&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

9.7 - 8.7 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Rising lake level.'' Decreasing δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O  and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C reflected an increased lake level. In fact, the lake level reached the Holocene High Stand. This high stand corresponded to a period of maximum effective [[moisture]] in the Great Basin.

8.7 - 6.5 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Dropping lake level.'' A sudden increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O  and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C suggested that lake levels dropped. Following, weak correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C suggested that lake levels stabilized.

6.5 - 5.9 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''Rising lake level.'' An increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C correlated with a decrease in lake level. The lake level drop continued until the Holocene Low Stand at 5.9 ka, which corresponded to a period of minimum effective moisture in the Great Basin.

2 - 0.6 [[Millennium|ka]]: ''[[Unconformity]].'' The gap between 6 - 2 ka could be attributed to shallow lake conditions. In addition, sediment types observed in the core between 2 - 0.6 ka largely reflected shallow water conditions.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Newton, M. S. (1994). Holocene fluctuations of Mono Lake, California: the sedimentary record. SEPM Special Publication, 50, 143-157.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Medieval Warm Period]], which occurred from 0.9 - 0.7 ka, the lake level was around the same as today.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In general, the period was dominated by a shallow, stable lake level with low covariance between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

490 – 360 years ago: ''High, fluctuating lake levels.'' This period corresponded to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The isotopic record had very high annual resolution. The lake levels were generally high but fluctuated a little resulting in low correlation between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C . At the end of this period, δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C evolved towards a trend of decreasing lake level.

Overall the lake levels of Mono Lake appeared to have corresponded to known climatic events such as periods of maximum or minimum effective moisture, the Medieval Warm Period&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; and the Little Ice Age.

=== 35,000 year record ===
Lake levels of Mono Lake during the [[Pleistocene]] have also been reconstructed using [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] inspection of paleoshorelines,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Lajoie, K. R. (1968). Late Quaternary stratigraphy and geologic history of Mono Basin, eastern California (PhD dissertation). ''Available through University of Southern California.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating|radio carbon dating]],&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Benson, L. V., Currey, D. R., Dorn, R. I., Lajoie, K. R., Oviatt, C. G., Robinson, S. W., ... &amp; Stine, S. (1990). Chronology of expansion and contraction of four Great Basin lake systems during the past 35,000 years. ''Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology'', ''78''(3-4), 241-286.&lt;/ref&gt; and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from sediments.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; These analyses helped reconstruct lake levels of the past 35,000 years.

36 - 35 ka: ''Rising lake level.'' Decreasing δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O revealed that lake level began to rise at about this time from a lake level altitude of 2015 m.

35 - 21 ka: ''High stable lake level.'' Little fluctuation in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O suggested a stable lake level. This stable lake level corresponded to two beds of silt that would have been deposited in a deep lake.

20 - 15 ka: ''Dropping lake level.'' There was a sudden fall in lake level at the beginning of this period. Sand delta terraces from this time period indicated a lake-surface altitude of 2035 m.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Recorded δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O increased over this time period, reflecting falling lake level.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

5 - 13 ka: ''Rising lake level.'' During this period, Mono Lake rose to its highest lake-surface altitude of 2155 m. This corresponded to a decrease in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O.

13+ ka: ''Dropping lake level.'' Following peak lake level, the lake level decreased to 1965 m at ~ 10 ka as evidenced by an increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and paleoshorelines.

This lake level record has been correlated with significant climatic events including [[polar jet stream]] movement, [[Heinrich event|Heinrich]], and [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] events. You can read about these in the section on Paleoclimate reconstruction.

=== Paleoclimate reconstruction ===
The reconstruction of lake levels through [[Isotopes of carbon|carbon]] and [[D18O|oxygen]] isotopes have revealed interesting results that can be correlated to dramatic [[Climate change|changes in climate]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. In the recent past, Earth experienced periods of increased [[Glacial period|glaciation]] known as [[ice age]]s. This geological period of ice ages is known as the [[Pleistocene]], which lasted until ~11 [[Millennium|ka]]. Lake levels in Mono Lake can reveal how the climate fluctuated. For example, during the cold climate of the Pleistocene the lake level was higher because there was less [[evaporation]] and more [[precipitation]]. Following the Pleistocene, the lake level was generally lower due to increased [[evaporation]] and decreased [[precipitation]] associated with a warmer climate. Mono Lake reveals the climate variation on 3 different time scales: [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger]] (repeats every 1,000 years), [[Heinrich event|Heinrich]] (varying repetition), and [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovich]] (repeats every 10,000 years).

==== Dansgaard-Oeschger ====
From the compilation of [[Δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] data over the past 51,000 years from lakes throughout the [[Great Basin]], including [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], [[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]], [[Owens Lake]], and Mono Lake, it has been observed that changes in lake level can be correlated to [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event|Dansgaard-Oeschger events]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Benson, L., Lund, S., Negrini, R., Linsley, B., &amp; Zic, M. (2003). Response of north American Great basin lakes to Dansgaard–Oeschger oscillations. ''Quaternary Science Reviews'', ''22''(21-22), 2239-2251.&lt;/ref&gt; The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from these lakes showed oscillations in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of carbonates from these four lakes. Oscillation between high δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and low δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O reflected cold/dry (low lake level with low precipitation) and warm/wet (high lake level with high precipitation) respectively. Read more about these isotopic effects in the Lake Level History section. Furthermore, [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) of the sediments from Pyramid Lake and Owens Lake were inversely correlated with δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and showed the same oscillations. TOC is often an indicator of the degree of biological [[Primary production|productivity]] in a lake. This would suggest that high productivity correlated with a warm/wet climate at Mono Lake, while low productivity correlated with a cold/dry climate at Mono Lake. The timing of these oscillations matched the timing of Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the [[GISP2]] core from 46 - 27 ka.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Minima in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and maxima in TOC correlated with 11 different Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Dansgaard-Oeschger events are fluctuations in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from [[ice core]]s that repeat every 1,000 years. They are thought to be related to global climatic events. However, the exact causes for these fluctuations are still unresolved.

==== Heinrich events ====
The lake level history of 36,000 years was investigated through correlations between δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records, [[radiocarbon dating]], and [[paleomagnetic secular variation]] from Mono Lake sediments as described in the Lake Level History section.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;Benson, L. V., Lund, S. P., Burdett, J. W., Kashgarian, M., Rose, T. P., Smoot, J. P., &amp; Schwartz, M. (1998). Correlation of late-Pleistocene lake-level oscillations in Mono Lake, California, with North Atlantic climate events. ''Quaternary Research'', ''49''(1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Peaks in the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records of Mono Lake sediments correlated with 3 [[Heinrich event]]s known from the sea [[Core sample|cores]] of the [[North Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Heinrich events occurred when massive amounts of [[iceberg]]s broke off from the [[ice sheet]]s and fell into the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; These Heinrich events have been observed to correlate with peaks in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compositions of carbonates globally. This pattern would generally indicate a global drop in temperature and a rising ice-volume. As water vapor moves from the [[Hadley cell|equator to the poles]], &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is preferentially precipitated compared to &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O. When the water precipitates at the poles, it has a very depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. Hence, ice sheets are vast reservoirs of &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and have a very depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. If the temperature dropped and &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O-containing ice-volumes grew, the remaining water bodies would experience a corresponding increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition. Three peaks in the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records of Mono Lake may reflect 3 episodes of vast growth of the Pleistocene ice sheets that resulted in massive iceberg break-off at the ice-water interface.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

==== Milankovich-scale events ====
The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from Mono Lake sediments also exhibit trends over longer timescales of ~10,000 years. From 35-18 [[Millennium|ka]], the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition of Mono Lake sediments were gradually decreasing. This decreasing trend was inversely correlated with an increase in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of sediments from a North Atlantic sea core.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;  This trend in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O suggested correlation with the southward movement of the [[polar jet stream]] from 35-18 [[Millennium|ka.]]&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; As the polar jet stream moved southward, it caused increased precipitation of isotopically depleted rain water.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Benson, L. V., &amp; Thompson, R. S. (1987). Lake-level variation in the Lahontan Basin for the past 50,000 years. ''Quaternary Research'', ''28''(1), 69-85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Antevs, E. (1948). ''The Great Basin, with Emphasis on Glacial and Postglacial Times: Climatic Changes and Pre-white Man. III''. University of Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this caused Southern water bodies like Mono Lake to become isotopically depleted, while Northern oceans became isotopically enriched.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  This movement of the polar jet stream was presumably cased by an increase in the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|Northern American ice sheet.]]&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Two δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O minima at 18 ka and 13.1 ka in Mono Lake sediments reflected two lake level high-stands of Mono Lake. These lake level high-stands presumably corresponded to two passages of the polar jet stream over Mono Lake that precipitated large amounts of rainwater with a depleted δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O composition.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Following, the polar jet stream was forced south of Mono Lake.&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; Furthermore, the sudden reduction in [[Total inorganic carbon|Total Inorganic Carbon]] (TIC) during 26 - 14 ka could be attributed to the [[Last glacial period|Tioga glaciation]].&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; The Tioga glaciation would have caused a high in-flux of detrital materials to Mono Lake. As a result, the TIC in Mono Lake sediments would be lowered during this time period.

==Limnology==
[[File:Mono Lake Tufa.JPG|thumb|300px|Mono Lake's "South [[Tufa]]" area]]

The [[limnology]] of the lake shows it contains approximately 280 million tons of dissolved salts, with the [[salinity]] varying depending upon the amount of water in the lake at any given time. Before 1941, average salinity was approximately 50&amp;nbsp;grams per liter (g/l) (compared to a value of 31.5 g/l for the world's oceans). In January 1982, when the lake reached its lowest level of {{convert|6372|ft|m|0}}, the salinity had nearly doubled to 99 g/l. In 2002, it was measured at 78 g/l and is expected to stabilize at an average 69 g/l as the lake replenishes over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name="mlcfaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake FAQ|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/faq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unintended consequence of ending the water diversions was the onset of a period of [[Meromictic|"meromixis"]] in Mono Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jellison|first=R.|author2=J. Romero |author3=J. M. Melack |year=1998|url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_43/issue_4/0706.pdf|title=The onset of meromixis in Mono Lake: unintended consequences of reducing water diversions|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|pages=704–11|accessdate=2008-11-13|issue=4|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time prior to this, Mono Lake was typically "[[Monomictic lake|monomictic]]"; which means that at least once each year the deeper waters and the shallower waters of the lake mixed thoroughly, thus bringing oxygen and other nutrients to the deep waters. In meromictic lakes, the deeper waters do not undergo this mixing; the deeper layers are more saline than the water near the surface, and are typically nearly devoid of oxygen. As a result, becoming meromictic greatly changes a lake's ecology.

Mono Lake has experienced meromictic periods in the past; this most recent episode of meromixis, brought on by the end of the water diversions, commenced in 1994 and had ended by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jellison|first=R.|author2=S. Roll|year=2003|url=http://www.monolake.uga.edu/public/files/Mono_Lake_Mixing.pdf|title=Weakening and near-breakdown of meromixis in Mono Lake|publisher=unpublished; online version|accessdate=2008-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030045630/http://www.monolake.uga.edu/public/files/Mono_Lake_Mixing.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===Aquatic life===
[[File:Ephydra_hians_mono_Lake_brine_fly.jpg|thumb|Large numbers of alkali flies at Mono Lake]]
[[File:Artemia_monica.jpg|thumb|''[[Artemia monica]]'', the Mono Lake brine shrimp]]
The hypersalinity and high alkalinity (pH=10 or equivalent to 4 milligrams of [[sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] per liter of water) of the lake means that no fish are native to the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living in an Alkaline Environment|publisher=Microbial Life Education Resources|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/k12/alkaline/preparation.html|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt by the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] to stock the lake failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Mono Lake|website=www.monolake.org|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The whole food chain of the lake is based on the high population of single-celled [[plankton]]ic [[algae]] present in the [[photic zone]] of the lake. These algae reproduce rapidly during winter and early spring after winter runoff brings nutrients to the surface layer of water. By March the lake is "as green as pea soup" with photosynthesizing algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake|work=Ecoscenario|url=http://www.fossweb.com/CA/modules3-6/Environments/activities/mono/content_old.html|accessdate=2007-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115927/http://www.fossweb.com/CA/modules3-6/Environments/activities/mono/content_old.html|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake is famous for the Mono Lake brine shrimp, ''[[Artemia monica]]'', a tiny species of [[brine shrimp]], no bigger than a thumbnail, that are [[endemic]] to the lake. During the warmer summer months, an estimated 4–6 trillion brine shrimp inhabit the lake. Brine shrimp have no food value for humans, but are a staple for birds of the region. The brine shrimp feed on microscopic algae.

Alkali flies, ''[[Ephydra hians]]'' live along the shores of the lake and walk underwater, encased in small air bubbles for grazing and to lay eggs. These flies are an important source of food for migratory and nesting birds.

===Birds===
Mono Lake is a vital resting and eating stop for migratory [[wader|shorebirds]] and has been recognized as a site of international importance by the [[Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mono Lake|work=Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network|url=http://www.whsrn.org/site-profile/mono-lake|accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nearly 2,000,000 [[waterbird]]s, including 35 [[species]] of shorebirds, use Mono Lake to rest and eat for at least part of the year. Some shorebirds that depend on the resources of Mono Lake include [[American avocet]]s, [[killdeer]] and [[sandpiper]]s. Over 1.5 million [[black-necked grebe|eared grebes]] and [[phalarope]]s use Mono Lake during their long migrations.
[[File:Mono Lake South Tufa Area (2013) 33.JPG|thumb|right|A female [[Audubon's warbler]] on tufa in the "South Tufa" area]]

Late every summer tens of thousands of [[Wilson's phalarope]]s and [[red-necked phalarope]]s arrive from their nesting grounds, and feed until they continue their migration to [[South America]] or the tropical oceans respectively.&lt;ref name="mlcbirds"/&gt;

In addition to migratory birds, a few species spend several months to nest at Mono Lake. Mono Lake has the second largest nesting population of [[California gull]]s, ''Larus californicus'', second only to the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah. Since abandoning the landbridged Negit Island in the late 1970s, California gulls have moved to some nearby islets and have established new, if less protected, nesting sites. [[Cornell University]] and [[Point Blue Conservation Science]] have continued the study of nesting populations on Mono Lake that was begun 35 years ago. [[Snowy plover]]s also arrive at Mono Lake each spring to nest along the remote eastern shores.

==History==
[[File:Captain John.jpg|thumb|Captain John, leader of the Yosemite-Mono Lake Paiutes]]

===Native Americans===
{{Further|Kucadikadi|Population of Native California}}
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Mono Lake are from a band of the [[Northern Paiute]], called the [[Kutzadika'a]].&lt;ref name=mono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa|title=Kutzadika'a People: Living in Harmony with the Mono Basin|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Northern Paiute language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictdl.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926145711/http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictdl.shtml|archivedate=2010-09-26|title=California Indians and Their Reservations: K|work=SDSU Library and Information Access|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kutzadika'a traditionally forage alkali fly pupae, called kutsavi in their language.&lt;!--- described in kutzadikaa.htm, next sentence ---&gt; Mono Lake was also referred to as Teniega Bah. The origin of the name "Kutzadika'a" is uncertain but could be a [[Yokutsan languages|Yokut]] Native American term for "fly eater".&lt;ref&gt;http://monolake.org/about/kutzadikaa&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Mono" is derived from "Monachi", a Yokut term for the tribes that live on both the east and west side of the Sierra Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Place Names of the High Sierra|first=Francis|last=Farquhar|year=1926|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/m.html|publisher=Sierra Club|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early contact, the first known Mono Lake Paiute chief was [[Captain John (Paiute)|Captain John]]. He was also referred to by the Paiute names of ''Shibana'' or ''Poko Tucket''. Captain John was the son of a Northern Paiute named 'older Captain John.'

The [[Mono tribe]] has two bands: Eastern and Western. The Eastern Mono joined the Western Mono bands' villages annually at [[Hetch Hetchy Valley]], [[Yosemite Valley]], and along the [[Merced River]] to gather [[acorn]]s, different plant species, and to trade. The Western Mono traditionally lived in the south-central Sierra Nevada foothills, including [[History of the Yosemite area|Historical Yosemite Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Indians and Their Reservations|work=SDSU Library and Information Access|accessdate=24 July 2009|url=http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictmp.shtml#monowest|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726214650/http://infodome.sdsu.edu/research/guides/calindians/calinddictmp.shtml#monowest|archivedate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present day [[Mono tribe#Tribal groups|Mono Reservations]] are currently located in [[Big Pine, California|Big Pine]], [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], and several in [[Madera County]] and [[Fresno County, California]].

===Conservation efforts===
[[File:Mono-lake-tufa-1981-003.jpg|thumb|Exposed [[tufa]] towers in Mono Lake; South Tufa, 1981]]
{{Main|California Water Wars}}

The City of [[Los Angeles]] diverted water from the [[Owens River]] into the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1913. In 1941, the [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] extended the Los Angeles Aqueduct system farther northward into the [[Mono Basin]] with the completion of the Mono Craters Tunnel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortieth Annual Report of the Board of Water and Power Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles|url=http://www.monobasinresearch.org/historical/40thannualreport.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the Grant Lake Reservoir on Rush Creek, and the Upper Owens River. So much water was diverted that [[evaporation]] soon exceeded inflow and the surface level of Mono Lake fell rapidly. By 1982 the lake was reduced to {{convert|37688|acre}} 69 percent of its 1941 surface area. "[By 1990, the lake had dropped 45 vertical feet and had lost half its volume]" relative to the 1941 pre-diversion water level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mono Lake|work=Mono Lake Committee|url=http://monolake.org/about/|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[alkaline]] sands and formerly submerged [[tufa]] towers became exposed, the water salinity doubled, and [[Negit Island]] became a [[peninsula]], exposing the nests of [[California gull]]s to predators (such as  [[coyote]]s), and forcing the gull colony to abandon this site.

In 1974, [[Stanford University]] graduate student [[David Gaines (environmentalist)|David Gaines]] studied the Mono Lake ecosystem, and he became instrumental in alerting the public of the effects of the lower water level.&lt;ref name=mlchist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monolake.org/mlc/history|title=History of the Mono Lake Committee|publisher=Mono Lake Committee|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]] funded the first comprehensive ecological study of Mono Lake, conducted by Gaines and undergraduate students from the [[University of California at Davis]], the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]], and [[Earlham College]]. In June 1977, the Davis Institute of Ecology of the [[University of California]] published a report, "An Ecological Study of Mono Lake, California," which alerted California to the ecological dangers posed by the redirection of water away from the lake for municipal uses.&lt;ref name=mlchist/&gt;
[[File:Mono Lake from Mount Dana (1).jpg|thumb|Mono Lake viewed from the summit of [[Mount Dana]]. Note near-landbridge at left, almost connecting Negit Island with the mainland shoreline.]]
Gaines formed the [[Mono Lake Committee]] in 1978. He and Sally Judy, a UC Davis student, led the committee and pursued an informational tour of California. They joined with the [[Audubon Society]] to fight a now famous court battle, the [[National Audubon Society v. Superior Court]], to protect Mono Lake through state public trust laws.&lt;ref name=mlchist/&gt; While these efforts have resulted in positive change, the surface level is still below historical levels, and exposed shorelines are a source of significant [[alkaline]] dust during periods of high winds.

[[Owens Lake]], the once-navigable terminus of the [[Owens River]] which had sustained a healthy ecosystem, is now a dry lake bed during dry years due to water diversion beginning in the 1920s. Mono Lake was spared this fate when the California State Water Resources Control Board (after over a decade of litigation) issued an order to protect Mono Lake and its tributary streams on September 28, 1994. Since that time, the lake level has steadily risen. In 1941 the surface level was at {{convert|6417|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=level&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Lake Levels|work=Mono Basin Research Clearinghouse|url=http://www.monobasinresearch.org/data/levelmonthly.php|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2013, Mono Lake was at {{convert|6380.6|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=level/&gt; The lake level of {{convert|6392|ft|m|0}} above sea level is the goal, a goal made more difficult during years of drought in the American West.

'''Monégasque''' (natively ''Munegascu'') is a variety of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic language]] spoken in [[Monaco]] as well as nearby in [[Italy]] and [[France]].

Monégasque is officially taught&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110224034322/http://www.monaco-mairie.mc/00_Actus/pdf/oct05/24_cerem.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the schools of [[Principality of Monaco|Monaco]] and spoken by a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents as the [[Grimaldi Family|Grimaldi]], [[princes of Monaco]], have a Ligurian origin. In [[Monaco-Ville]], street signs are printed in both French and Monégasque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monaco-iq.com/society |title=Society |publisher=Monaco-IQ |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Forming a part of the [[Western Romance languages|Western Romance]] [[dialect continuum]], Monégasque shares many features with the [[Genoese dialect]]. Though similar to the [[Intemelio dialect|dialect of Ventimiglia]], it does differ from the [[Mentonasc dialect|Menton's dialect]]. It shares similarities also with the [[Niçard dialect]] of the [[Occitan language]]. 

Monegasque, like all other Ligurian language variants, is derived directly from the [[Vulgar Latin]] of what is now northwestern Italy and southeastern France and has some influence in vocabulary, morphology and syntax from French and related Gallo-Romance languages.

Before the annexation of the [[County of Nice]] to [[France]] in 1860, the Niçois spoke a dialect very similar to Monégasque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gubbins|first1=Paul|last2=Holt|first2=Mike|title=Beyond Boundaries: Language and Identity in Contemporary Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WyS7i9UxowC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-555-4|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speakers ==

It is spoken in addition to [[French language|French]] by [[Monégasques]], mostly within the small nation of Monaco. Because Monégasques are only a minority in Monaco, the language was threatened with extinction in the 1970s.

However, Monégasque is now being taught in schools, and its continuance is regarded as secured.{{fact|date=August 2018}} In the old part of Monaco, street signs are written in Monégasque and French.

==Relation to Italian==
[[Image:Le comté de Nice et Oneille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monaco and [[Menton]] constituted the extreme western area of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (demarcated in green) in 1664.]]
[[Standard Italian]] is also a major language in Monaco. Italian nationals make up some 20% of Monaco's 35,000 permanent residents. Italian was the official language of Monaco when it was a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], from 1814 to 1861, leaving a legacy in some Monégasque words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/monaco.htm History of Monaco]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, for a long time after the [[Renaissance]], Monaco was the most westerly part on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of the [[Republic of Genoa]].

During the [[fascism|fascist]] occupation in 1942–43, the Principality of Monaco was incorporated into [[Italy]] and Monégasque was again considered a dialect of Italy. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] there were nearly 10,000 Italians in [[Monte Carlo]], and some of them (descendants of the followers of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who were forced to move from Nice to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] after 1861) even spoke Monégasque fluently.

== Orthography ==

Monégasque [[orthography]] generally follows [[Italian language|Italian]] principles, with the following exceptions:

* {{angbr|ü}} represents {{IPA|[ʏ]}}, as the French {{angbr|u}}.
* {{angbr|œ}} represents {{IPA|[e]}}, as the French {{angbr|é}}, not the French {{angbr|œu}}, as in ''bœuf'', which is how it is pronounced in Ligurian, which also uses the character {{angbr|ö}} to represent the sound.
* {{angbr|ç}} represents {{IPA|[s]}}, as the French {{angbr|ç}}: ''tradiçiùn'' comes from the Latin ''traditionem'', not from the Italian ''tradizione''.

== Samples==

Below is an excerpt from the [[Hymne Monégasque|Monégasque national anthem]], written by [[Louis Notari]]. In addition, there is an older French version of the anthem; its lyrics have a  different meaning. The choice between the two forms is generally subject to the occasion and the circumstance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despœi tugiù sciü d'u nostru paise&lt;br /&gt;Se ride au ventu, u meme pavayùn&lt;br /&gt;
Despœi tugiù a curù russa e gianca&lt;br /&gt;
E stà l'emblema, d'a nostra libertà&lt;br /&gt;
Grandi e i piciui, l'an sempre respetà&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following is a Monégasque rendering of the [[Hail Mary]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-monaco.html Pater Noster in Monégasque]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ave Maria,&lt;br /&gt;
Tüta de graçia&lt;br /&gt;
u Signù è cun tü&lt;br /&gt;
si benedëta tra tüt'ë done&lt;br /&gt;
e Gesü u to Fiyu è benejiu.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Santa Maria, maire de Diu,&lt;br /&gt;
prega per nùi, pecatùi&lt;br /&gt;
aùra e à l'ura d'a nostra morte&lt;br /&gt;
AMEN. (Che sice cusci.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''"Night hunting"''', known in [[Bhutan]] as ''Bomena'', is a traditional "courtship" custom that is practiced in some parts of [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Practice ==
"Night hunting", the traditional culture of nightly courtship and romance that is practiced mostly in eastern and central rural Bhutan. There is neither the word "night" nor the word "hunting" in the original terms. The original words can be best rendered as "Prowling for girls".

Young men go out at night to sneak into girls' windows to engage in sexual activities. The prowling can be solo or in groups depending on whether or not the man has a fixed date. It is the rural equivalent of an urban date. If one has talked with the girl in advance then it can be a solo activity but usually it happens after a gathering when friends decide to go prowling for girls. Most boys would have a girl in mind. Although they set out as a group, they disperse gradually as they find a partner.

Traditional two-story buildings makes the prowling difficult but the sliding window shutter with only wooden latches from inside makes it easier. Strategies vary from sneaking in the door to climbing up the side of a house to enter a window or even dropping in from the roof. The uniform architecture of Bhutanese houses, with same design of doors and windows also make it easier. The age old tradition has also come up with special tools to undo doors and windows. If the boy successfully infiltrates the dwelling, he still may be rejected by the girl he is pursuing. It takes a lot of persuasion especially for the first time. 

The prowling may be foiled due to wrong footing, which may wake up the whole family. They intruder may get chased away with hot water splashed on him, or be thrown out of the window. Strict parents chase the intruder or threaten him with marriage or a stick while liberal ones pretend to be asleep even if they know the prowler is around. This more likely if they know the prowler is a suitor they would like to have for their daughter. It is not difficult to guess who the prowler might be in small close-knit villages.

Boys generally attempt to complete the task and make a quick exit if the parents of the girl are in and may stay longer if the girl is alone. It is in some places a custom that a boy discovered in the morning by the parents shall become the husband of the girl, but usually the boy  and the girl make sure that the boy exits before the parents get up in the morning. If he oversleeps, they may still find a way to sneak out.

The practice is far more dramatic because this happens under pitch darkness and traditionally the whole family sleep in one large room, which is the kitchen and living room. The prowler must know pretty well where the girl sleeps in order to find the right bed. There are stories of boys getting into the wrong bed and the grannies yelling the boy out or having a good laugh or even quietly enjoying the visit.

The culture of night prowling is fading away due to socio-economic changes. With new metal latches and locks in many houses, it is difficult for young boys now to get into the house. With modern education, modern western form of romance and dating tradition is growing and young people are no more keen on this traditional practice but would rather exchange love letters and fix dates. 

There is also a general misunderstanding among urban elites who have not been through the tradition that prowling for girls is tantamount to sexual harassment and the union resulting from it, to rape. Thus, there are new regulations in place to discourage this practice. Other legal factors include the new paternity law with the penalty of 20% of the income per month until the child is 18 years old for fathering a child.

== Impact ==
As most intercourse is consensual, there is small risk of rape. However, a downside of night prowling has been rampant [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastardy]]. Bastardy and single motherhood were less of a problem in the traditional setting with extended families and grandparents always around to look after the child. However, the growing culture of nuclear families, the requirement for marriage certificates, requirement of a father to register the child as citizen, the increasing practice of western styled wedding culture are leading to an increased stigma for single motherhood. This subsequently is leading to the fall in sex outside wedlock and practices such as prowling for girls.

Modern education and the literature associated with it are spreading fast and with them a worldview and culture, that is influenced mostly by a western Christian moral ethos. This is fast replacing a more liberal and relaxed tantric Buddhist attitude to sex which was prevalent in Bhutan.

== In literature ==
In the book “Love, Courtship and Marriage in Rural Bhutan” (2009; {{ISBN|978-99936-23-15-1}}) by Dorji Penjore, the Centre for Bhutan Studies, discusses night hunting. According to the author, Bomena, a “custom whereby a boy stealthily enters a girl’s house at night for courtship or coitus with or without prior consultation”, is commonly misunderstood in Bhutan as ‘night hunting’. The use of a vernacular word Bomena, not ‘night hunting’, a term loaded with ethnocentrism and ignorance of the custom, tells a lot of this original village ethnography. 

The current discourse and understanding of Bomena, according to the author, are naïve, biased and misrepresented, heavily influenced by changing values especially among the urban societies. One common notion is that any rural culture is ‘inferior’ and all urban cultures are ‘superior’, and replacing the rural culture with urban ‘superior’ culture is seen as a way of emancipating the Bhutanese farmers from their ‘primitive’ culture, and advancing the country.

[[File:Matsuei.jpg|thumb|right|Onsen geisha Matsuei of [[Yuzawa, Niigata]], upon whom [[Yasunari Kawabata]] based one of the main characters in his novel [[Snow Country|''Snow Country'' (''Yuki Guni'')]], in 1934.]]
'''''Onsen geisha''''' (温泉芸者) is are [[Japan]]ese [[geisha]], or entertainers, who work in [[onsen]] ([[hot spring]]) resorts or towns. The term '''''onsen geisha''''' has a negative connotation in that the term has come to be synonymous with [[Geisha#Geisha and prostitution|prostitute]]. This is due to several reasons.

==Early history==
In pre–[[World War II]] history, the term "onsen geisha" had a negative connotation, as geisha who lived and worked at hot spring resorts or towns were often regarded as the lowest of geisha, they were unbound by contracts and could move to any other onsen town, and thus had no "history" or professional genealogy. During this period, some onsen geisha were sponsored by businessmen who made yearly visits; these patrons were known as ''danna''. Masuda Sayo, an onsen geisha in the late 1930s and early 1940s and author of ''[[Autobiography of a Geisha]]'', the first book of any kind about the geisha lifestyle, wrote that a typical geisha's contract was bought out by a danna for about 30 yen (around 20,000 yen today) and never for more than 100. Interaction with other customers beyond party entertainment was common; therefore, the concept of onsen geisha as prostitutes was not entirely incorrect in pre-World War II days.&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"&gt;{{cite book | title=Autobiography of a Geisha | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | author=Masuda, Sayo | year=2003 | pages=59–62 | isbn=978-0-231-12950-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masuda Sayo wrote that geisha in this time were taught some traditional geisha skills, but they were frequently pressured into having sex. [[Mizuage]] for onsen geisha always involved losing virginity, and geisha held onto a sense of pride amongst themselves for only having sex with their dannas. Even before debuting as full-fledged geisha, they practiced acting as sexy as possible to attract wealthier dannas, further bolstering the perception of onsen geisha as prostitutes. In addition, she wrote that many geisha had serious problems with alcohol due to the [[sake]] drinking contests they frequently participated in, which she said persisted in many geisha even after they retired.&lt;ref name="Autobiography of a Geisha"/&gt;

==Post-World War II==

In the period following [[World War II]], the abundance of [[Prostitution in Japan|prostitutes]] in onsen towns—such as [[Atami, Shizuoka|Atami]]—who marketed themselves to tourists as "geisha" caused some misconceptions. However, true modern-day onsen geisha are accomplished dancers and musicians.

In Atami, the official registry office regards long-time, proven geisha as separate from those who have not yet completed their first year.

Geisha banquets in onsen towns are markedly different from geisha engagements in the traditional [[hanamachi]] of [[Kyoto]] and [[Tokyo]]. Whereas geisha parties in Kyoto are usually small affairs in teahouses with five or six geisha, onsen geisha usually entertain tourists in the banquet halls of large hotels, often with 60 or 70 geisha in attendance. The modern surge of tourism, expendable income, and capitalization has caused onsen geisha, who historically entertained groups similar in size to those in Kyoto and Tokyo, to increase to these large affairs.

==Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force==
The inter-agency task force was set up by President [[Barack Obama]] in November 2009 to supersede President [[George W Bush]]'s [[Corporate Fraud Task Force]].&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; At the December 6, 2010, press conference, participating agencies were represented by [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] for the [[United States Department of Justice]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Executive Assistant Director Shawn Henry, [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) Director of Enforcement [[Robert Khuzami]], [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] (USPIS) Chief Postal Inspector Guy Cottrell, Deputy Chief Rick Raven of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), and Acting Director of Enforcement Vince McGonagle of the U.S. [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt; Other participating agencies included the [[U.S. Secret Service]] and the [[National Association of Attorneys General]].

==Scope of the investigation==
On December 6, 2010, the Task Force went public announcing that it had examined scams targeting  individual investors, not complex corporate fraud issues. In each case individual investors entrusted their money to individuals who presented "investment opportunities" promising superior returns. These investments were either fictitious or different from those claimed, and often involved [[Ponzi scheme]]s. [[Affinity fraud]] was directed at the savings of trusting but often uninformed people. Scams included fraud in commodities, real estate, foreign exchanges, business opportunities, and [[market manipulation]] (such as [[pump and dump]]).&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt; Khuzami explained that "fraud by well-known companies or high-profile executives gets the biggest headlines, but other scams are equally devastating to hard working families and retirees", and stressed that law enforcement will "pursue fraud in whatever form."&lt;ref name=cnbc/&gt;

''Operation Broken Trust'' included cases that were investigated already during the [[Presidency of George W.

Reactions to Holder's announcement about ''Operation Broken Trust'' were framed by the apparent lack of governmental efforts of prosecuting individuals who may bear  responsibility for the [[2008 financial crisis]], specifically since nobody at [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Citigroup]], and [[Goldman Sachs]] (other than [[Fabrice Tourre]]) has been charged criminally.&lt;ref name=eisinger&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/where-are-the-financial-crisis-prosecutions/  |author= Eisinger, Jesse| title=The Feds Stage a Sideshow, While the Big Tent Sits Empty |date=December 8, 2010 | publisher=[[Andrew Ross Sorkin#DealBook|DealBook]]| accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-trupp/operation-broken-trust-th_b_793292.html| author=Trupp, Phil|title='Operation Broken Trust': The Little Fish Fry While the Whales Swim in Oceans of Cash| date=December 7, 2010| publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]''|accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it was criticized as allocating resources to the wrong arena, described as a "[[sideshow]]",&lt;ref name=eisinger/&gt; and going for the "little fish".&lt;ref name=trupp/&gt; It was opined that rather than focusing on small-time operators, the government should prosecute individuals for their role in the 2008 financial crisis even if guilty verdicts were not assured; court proceedings would allow for transparency, serve as a deterrent, and provide lessons on how to prevent future grand scale fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.forbes.com/walterpavlo/2010/12/08/the-too-big-to-fail-are-also-too-big-to-prosecute/  |author=Pavlo, Walter  |title=The 'Too Big to Fail' are also 'Too Big to Prosecute' | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | date=December 8, 2010  |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Outreau trial''' was a 2004 criminal trial in northern [[France]] on various counts of [[Child Sexual Abuse|sexual abuse against children]]. The trial and the appeal trial revealed that the main witness for the prosecution, convicted for the abuse, had lied about the involvement of other suspects, who were in fact innocent. Several innocent suspects had nevertheless spent years jailed on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] and one died while in prison.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2015/05/19/comment-l-affaire-d-outreau-a-ebranle-la-justice-francaise_4636450_4355770.html |title=Comment l’affaire d’Outreau a ébranlé la justice française |website=Lemonde.fr |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials resulted in a national outrage in France, with journalists, politicians and the public opinion questioning how such a [[miscarriage of justice]] could happen, with innocent men and women being held for years in jail on unfounded suspicions.  In January 2006, a parliamentary inquiry was created, with President [[Jacques Chirac]] calling the affair a "judicial disaster".

==Outreau affair==
The "Outreau affair", which concerned an alleged criminal network in [[Outreau]], a working class town next to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region, began in November 2001. The first trial took place in [[Saint-Omer]] in 2004, and the [[Court of Appeal|appeal]] took place in [[Paris]] in 2005.

Eighteen people were accused. Mostly parents, they were charged with child sexual abuse and [[incest]] and their children were separated from them for much of this time. The affair began when some school teachers and social workers noticed “strange sexual behavior” from four children in a local school. Psychologists believed the children to be credible witnesses, but doctors found no evidence of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=Fouche/&gt; The parents were accused on the [[testimony]] of some of the children, which was then backed up by the [[confession (legal)|confession]]s of some of the accused.

The defendants were held in custody for from one to three years. In the first trial (in 2004), four of the eighteen admitted guilt and were convicted,&lt;ref name=Fouche&gt;{{cite news |last =Fouché |first =Alexandra |title =Outreau puts French justice in question |publisher =BBC News Online |date=2004-06-02 |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3852673.stm

Six further defendants denied the charges but were convicted and given light sentences{{Clarify|date=October 2013}} – they appealed their convictions, and were heard by the Paris ''[[Cour d'assises]]'' in autumn 2005. On the first day of the hearing, the prosecution's claims were destroyed, and all six were acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4490088.stm | work=BBC News | title=Six cleared over French child sex | date=December 1, 2005 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another defendant died in prison while awaiting trial.&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt;

==Judicial process==
===First trial===
The trial took place before [[Saint-Omer]]'s ''[[Cour d'assises]]'', composed of three professional judges and nine jurors.

The case involved an alleged ring of 17 persons, with the charges based on one woman's evidence and some corroborating statements from alleged victims. The alleged offenders were condemned on the grounds of certain adults' and, most of all, the children's testimony, together with psychiatric evidence. The children's testimony took place in "huis clos" (behind closed doors); such a procedure is normal in France for victims of sexual abuse, especially minors.

The six convicted persons who denied any responsibility appealed their convictions.

The woman who had given much of the evidence later confessed in court she had lied, and the children's revelations were found to be unreliable. Only four of the accused ever confessed, all the others insisted on their innocence: one died in jail during the investigation,&lt;ref name="lemonde.fr"/&gt; 7 others were acquitted during the first trial in May 2004, the last 6 during the second trial on the evening of December 1, 2005.

===Second trial===
The appeal took place before Paris' Cour d'assises, composed of three professional judges and twelve jurors, used as an appellate court for review of both facts and law.

On its first day, the prosecution's claims were dismissed, owing to the statement of the main prosecution witness, Myriam Badaoui, who had declared on November 18 that the six convicted persons "had not done anything" and that she had herself lied. Thierry Delay, her former husband, backed up her statement. During the trial, the [[psychology|psychological]] evidence was also called into question, as it appeared biased and lacking in weight. The denials of two children, who admitted that they had formerly lied, also contributed to the destruction of the prosecution's claims. One of the psychologists said on TV: "I am paid the same as a cleaning lady, so I provide a cleaning lady's expertise," which caused further public indignation.

At the end of the trial, the prosecutor (''avocat général'') asked for the acquittal of all of the accused persons. The defence renounced its right to plead, preferring to observe a minute of silence in favor of François Mourmand, who had died in prison during [[Detention of suspects|remand]]. [[Yves Bot]], general prosecutor of Paris, came to the trial on its last day, without previously notifying the president of the [[Cour d'assises]], Mrs. Mondineu-Hederer; while there, Bot presented his apologies to the defendants on behalf of the legal system&amp;mdash;he did this before the verdict was delivered, taking for granted a "not guilty" ruling, for which some magistrates reproached him afterwards.

All six defendants were finally acquitted on December 1, 2005, putting an end to five years of trials, which have been described by the French media as a "judicial foundering" or even as a "judicial [[Chernobyl]]".

===Remaining sentences===
Four people remained convicted after the appeal trial: Myriam Badaoui (who had not appealed her conviction), her husband, and a couple of neighbours. Myriam Badaoui, her husband, and one of the neighbours confessed that they had wrongfully accused other people to have been involved in the abuse cases, whereas only the four of them had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20051121.OBS5942/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718215836/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/20051121.OBS5942/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-18 |title=L'audience du vendredi 18 novembre - 21 novembre 2005 - L'Obs |website=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |date=2005-11-21 |accessdate=2016-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myriam Badaoui was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, her husband to 20 years.

==Aftermath==
===Questioning on French justice and media involvement===
The affair caused public indignation and questions about the general workings of justice in France. The role of an inexperienced [[juge d'instruction|magistrate]], Fabrice Burgaud,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article700777.ece Paedophile case that could bring down the Napoleonic system]",  Adam Sage, ''[[The Times]]'', 2006-04-04&lt;/ref&gt; fresh out of the ''[[Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature]]'' was underscored, as well as the undue weight given to children's words and to [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] expertise, both of which were revealed to have been wrong.

The [[Mass media|media's]] relation of the events was also questioned; although they were quick to point out the judicial error, they also had previously endorsed the "Outreau affair".

===Parliamentary inquiry===
After the second trial, the Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], the minister of justice [[Pascal Clément]] and President Chirac himself officially apologised to the victims in the name of the government and of the judicial institutions.

In January 2006, there was a special parliamentary enquiry (for the first time broadcast live on television) about this ''catastrophe judiciaire'' (judicial disaster), which had been called by President [[Chirac]] in order to help prevent a recurrence of this situation through alterations in France's legal system. The role of experts (who had drawn hasty conclusions from children's testimony) and child protection advocates, lack of legal representation, the responsibility of the judges (the prosecution's case depended in this instance on a single [[investigative magistrate]]) and the role of the [[mass media]] were examined.

The acquitted persons' hearing by the parliamentary enquiry caused a surge of emotion through the whole country. The affair was designated a "judiciary shipwreck".

===Fabrice Burgaud===
On April 24, 2009, the Conseil supérieur de la magistrature sentenced Burgaud to a reprimand (''réprimande avec inscription au dossier''), the lowest penalty in the French judiciary system. Since then the case was "dropped".

==Film==
In 2011 a film, ''[[Guilty (2011 film)|Présumé coupable]]'' (English title: ''Presumed Guilty'') was released, a drama documentary about the case from the viewpoint of Alain Marecaux, one of the innocent defendants, based on his memoirs.

In 2012 another film ''Outreau l'autre vérité'' (English title: ''Outreau the other truth'') was released. It is a documentary about the case from the viewpoint of some of the children, the experts and the magistrates. It paints a picture of how the press was manipulated by the defence lawyers, and how the words of the children were stifled.

== Murder and Investigation ==

On March 13, 2013, Parweeen Rehman was killed when four gunmen opened fire on her vehicle near Pirabad Police Station, ending her 28-year-long career for land and basic services rights for Pakistan's poor. Rehman has been an outspoken critics of the land mafias in Karachi and their political patrons.

Ms Rehman has complained in the past that she has received death threats. At one point some armed men stormed her offices and ordered her staff to leave.

The prime suspect in the murder of Rahman was arrested during a joint operation conducted by Karachi and Mansehra police in Mansehra. The suspect Ahmed Khan alias Pappu Kashmiri was arrested in Mansehra.

The very next day, police killed a Taliban operative named Qari Bilal in an encounter and claimed he was the murderer, resulting in a closure of the case.

On April 15, 2014, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had ordered authorities to conduct a fresh probe into Rehman's murder after a judicial inquiry had revealed that police officers had manipulated the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1170619/main-suspect-in-perween-rahman-murder-arrested-from-mansehra-police Main suspect in Perween Rahman murder arrested from Mansehra: police&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanoli|first1=Ishaq|title=Five men indicted in Perween Rahman murder case|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1398129/five-men-indicted-in-perween-rahman-murder-case|accessdate=29 March 2018|work=Dawn|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saints Rasyphus (Rasiphus) and Ravennus''' ({{lang-fr|Saints Rasyphe et Raven, Ravenne}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeo125.org/visites/vdautomne04.php VD automne 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) (fifth century&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Encyclopedia states that they were martyred in the 3rd century (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13681d.htm).&lt;/ref&gt;) are venerated as [[Christian]] [[saints]] and [[martyr]]s. According to Christian tradition, they were natives of [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] who fled their country during the [[Sub-Roman Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasions]]. They settled in [[Gaul]] and became [[hermits]]. They were then martyred, perhaps by [[Goths]] who adhered to [[Arianism]].

The myth of foundation associated with the parish church of [[Albinus of Angers|St-Aubin]] in [[Macé]], [[Normandy]], states that the two saints founded their [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] near the site of the current building, near a miraculous spring of water.&lt;ref name="Macé"&gt;[http://www.archeo125.org/visites/pageimageSE2.php Macé&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several versions of their martyrdom. The first states that they were tossed against a great block of [[sandstone]]. Their heads dented the stone but the two saints were not hurt (there are two visible prints in the church of St-Aubin of Macé that are considered to be the marks made by the heads of the two saints).&lt;ref name="Macé"/&gt; They were then [[decapitation|decapitated]] and buried near the present grounds of St-Aubin de Macé; a tombstone marks the site of their former grave.&lt;ref name="Macé"/&gt;

==Veneration==
The two saints were venerated as great healers, responsible for many miracles.&lt;ref name="Macé"/&gt; They were venerated in the [[diocese of Séez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13681d.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Seez&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[relics]] were taken from St-Aubin to [[Bayeux Cathedral]] during the [[Viking]] invasions. The relics were then taken to [[Caen]] during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref name="Macé"/&gt; Finally, they were taken to [[Poinson-lès-Grancey|Grancey]] in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], where they rest today.&lt;ref name="Macé"/&gt; Their [[feast day]] is 23 July.

A medieval text called ''Ravennus et Rasiphus mm. Baiocis'' exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhlms.fltr.ucl.ac.be/Nquerysaintrubrique.cfm?code_dossier=Ravennus&amp;rubrique=Ravennus%20et%20Rasiphus%20mm.%20Baiocis BHLms - Dossier hagiographique&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''residential community''' is a [[community]], usually a small [[town]] or [[city]], that is composed mostly of [[residency (domicile)|residents]], as opposed to [[commerce|commercial]] [[business|businesses]] and/or [[industry|industrial]] facilities, all three of which are considered to be the three main types of occupants of the typical community.

Residential communities are typically communities that help support more commercial or industrial communities with [[consumer|consumers]] and [[workforce|workers]]. That [[phenomenon]] is probably because some people prefer not to live in an [[urban area|urban]] or industrial area, but rather a [[suburb|suburban]] or [[rural area|rural]] setting. For that reason, they are also called [[commuter town|dormitory towns]], [[commuter town|bedroom communities]], or [[commuter town|commuter towns]].

An example of a residential community would include a small town or city outside a larger city or a large town located near a smaller but more commercially- or industrially-centered town or city, for instance [[Taitou, Gaocun|Taitou]] in Gaocun, Wuqing, Tianjin, China.

== China ==

In the [[mainland China|mainland]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], a '''community''' ({{zh | s=社区| t=社區| p=shèqū}}), also called '''residential unit''' or '''residential quarter''' ({{zh | s=小区| t=小區| p=xiǎoqū| links=no}}) or [[neighbourhood]] ({{zh | s=居民区| t=居民區| p=jūmínqū| links=no}}) or '''residential community''' ({{zh | s=居住区| t=居住區| p=jūzhùqū| links=no}}), is an urban [[residential area]] and its residents administrated by a [[subdistricts of the People's Republic of China|subdistrict]] ({{zh | s=街道办事处| t=街道辦事處| p=jiēdàobànshìchù| links=no}}). Every community has a community committee, neighborhood committee or residents' committee ({{zh | s=社区居民委员会| t=社區居民委員會| p=shèqūjūmínwěiyuánhuì| links=no}}) and every committee administers the dwellers living in that community.

Shequ ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 社区) are community institutions, consisting of participating citizens and chiefs, the latter ones being installed by the central governance. Shequ represent an attempt to restructure the relationship between state and urban community in China.&lt;ref&gt;Heberer, Thomas/Schubert,Gunter: Politische Partizipation und Regimelegitimität in China. Band I: Der Urbane Raum, Wiesbaden: VSVerlag 2008, pp 15-24,47-70,189-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social anthropologist]] [[Fei Xiaotong]] is considered the first to have proposed the introduction of the idea of shequ in China.&lt;ref&gt;Heberer, Thomas/Derichs, Claudia: Einführung in die politischen Systeme Ostasiens. VR China, Hongkong, Japana, Nordkorea, Südkorea, Taiwan (2): VSVerlag 2008, pp119-144.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of shequ started after the collapse of the previously existing social institutions  (''[[danwei]]'') during the mid-1990s. Shequ were supposed to relieve the state of certain duties and responsibilities by transferring them to citizens participating in the shequ. They take over responsibilities which in democratic states are assumed by organisations of the civil community.

The '''Romanian Statistical Yearbook''' ({{lang-ro|Anuarul Statistic al României}}) is an annual publication of the [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|National Institute of Statistics]] that presents data about the economic and social situation in [[Romania]].

The first yearbook appeared in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The second, from 1912, came to over 800 pages, and presented data regarding the country's economic and social evolution over the previous decade. A third edition, covering the years 1915-1916, was begun in 1916 but did not appear until 1919, due to World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The next yearbook, covering 1922, came in 1923, and was followed by annual editions through 1940, a few of them describing two years. The 1931 edition was notable for incorporating data from the 1930 census and the [[Romanian general election, 1931|1931 election]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the 1931-1932, 1933 and 1934 editions included detailed data about the main exports from the 1929-1932 period, as well as statistics relating to the census of school-age children. The 1934 yearbook contained detailed information about agriculture, particularly in regard to the surface area devoted to fruit trees, the state of [[zootechnics]] and the number of tractors. The 1939-1940 yearbook was the final one before the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] resumed their publication after a 17-year gap. Annual statistical communiqués helped compensate for this absence in the 1945-1948 period.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The next yearbook was published in 1957 and covered the years 1951-1955. Its authors noted that older data were adapted to current methodology, and that they were recalculated for the current national territory, which was smaller than that of [[Greater Romania]]. For the remainder of the regime's existence, which came to an end with the [[Romanian Revolution]] of 1989, yearbooks continued to appear annually.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The editions of 1987, 1988 and 1989 were brochures of around 100 pages that indicated exponential growth in all areas of economic and social activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 yearbook readopted the practice of including a number of indicators for the country's economic and social evolution. During the 1990s, the yearbook returned to a length of 700-1000 pages. Beginning in 1990, in the interests of transparency, relevance and credibility, the yearbook featured indicators previously hidden from public view. Examples include the use of economic resources, gross domestic product, national wealth, energy, housing and income, spending and consumption of the populace. The authors focused on aligning with international standards as well as including correct and comprehensive data for users of statistical information.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 yearbook appeared in a special jubilee edition commemorating 150 years of official statistics in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The yearbook includes the most recent data available in order to draw a picture of the economic situation and of the main economic indicators' evolution over the preceding few years.&lt;ref name="a14"&gt;''Anuarul'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into twenty-three chapters: geography, meteorology and environment; population; workforce; income, spending and consumption; housing and public utilities; security and social assistance; health; education; culture and sport; prices; National Accounts; investments and tangible assets; science, technology and innovation; agriculture and forestry; business activity; industry and construction; transport, post and telecommunications; international trade; domestic trade and market services; tourism; finance; justice system; international statistics.&lt;ref name="doua"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.revistadestatistica.ro/Articole/2010/A8_ro_4_2010.pdf "Două publicații statistice de sinteză ale INS"], in ''Romanian Statistical Review'', nr. 4 / 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The publication appears in print and comes with a CD-ROM that includes national and regional data in [[Microsoft Excel]].&lt;ref name="a14"/&gt;

'''Sassi Punnuh''' or '''Sassui Punhun'''  ({{lang-sd|سَسُئيِ پُنهوُن}}, {{lang-ur|سسی  پنوں|Sassi Punnun}}) is a love story from [[Sindi and Balochi]] folklore. The story is about a faithful wife who is ready to undergo all kinds of troubles that would come her way while seeking her beloved husband who was separated from  her by the rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Popular Folk Stories:Sassui Punhun|author=Dr.Nabi Bux Khan Baloach|publisher=Sindhi Adabi Board| place=Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan| year=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story also appears in [[Shah Jo Risalo]] and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. The other six tales are ''[[Umar Marvi]]'', ''[[Sohni Mahiwal|Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sorath Rai Diyach]]'' and ''[[Momal Rano]]'' commonly known as [[the Seven Queens of Sindh]], or the Seven heroines of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].

== Punnu ==
Mir Punnhun Khan (Mir Dostein Hoth) is the son of Mir Aalii, son of King Mir Hoth Khan, ancestor of the Hoths, a famous Baloch tribe in [[Balochistan]]. King Hoth was son of [[Mir Jalal Khan]], ruler of today's [[Balochistan]] (Pakistan) region in the 12th Century, and father of [[Rind (Baloch tribe)|Rind]], Lashari, [[Hoth]], [[Korai]], [[Talpur]] and [[Jatoi (Baloch tribe)|Jatoi]].

== Sassi ==
'''Sassi''' was the daughter of the '''Raja of [[Bhambore]]''' in [[Sindh]] (now in Pakistan). Upon  Sassui's birth, astrologers predicted that she was a curse for the royal family’s prestige. The Raja ordered that the child be put in a wooden box and thrown in the [[River Indus|Sindhu]]. A washerman of the [[Bhambore]] village found the wooden box and the child inside. The washerman believed the child was a blessing from God and took her home. As he had no child of his own, he decided to adopt her.

When Sassui became a young girl, she was as beautiful as the fairies of heaven. Stories of her beauty reached Punhun and he became desperate to meet Sassi. The handsome young Prince therefore travelled to Bhambore. He sent his clothes to Sassi's father (a washerman) so that he could catch a glimpse of Sassi. When he visited the washerman's house, they fell in love at first sight. Sassui's father was dispirited, hoping that Sassi would marry a washerman and no one else. He asked Punnhun to prove that he was worthy of Sassui by passing the test as a washerman. Punnhun agreed to prove his love. While washing, he tore all the clothes as, being a prince, he had never washed any clothes; he thus failed the agreement. But before he returned those clothes, he hid gold coins in the pockets of all the clothes, hoping this would keep the villagers quiet. The trick worked, and Sassui's father agreed to the marriage.

==Punnhun's brothers==
Punnhun’s father and brothers were against his marriage to Sassi (Punnhun being a prince and she being a washerman's daughter) and so, for their father's sake, Punnhun's brothers traveled to Bhambore. First they threatened Punnhun but when he didn't relent, they tried more devious methods. Punnhun was surprised to see his brothers supporting his marriage and on the first night, they pretended to enjoy and participate in the marriage celebrations and forced Punnhun to drink different types of wines. When he was intoxicated they carried him on a camel’s back and returned to their hometown of Kech.

== The lovers meet their end ==
The next morning, when Sassui got up, she realized that she was cheated. She became mad with the grief of separation from her lover and ran barefoot towards the town of Kech Makran. To reach it, she had to cross miles of desert. Alone, she continued her journey until her feet were blistered and her lips were parched from crying "Punnhun, Punnhun!". The journey was full of dangerous hazards. Punnhun’s name was on Sassui's lips throughout the journey. She was thirsty, there she saw a shepherd coming out of a hut. He gave her some water to drink. Seeing her incredible beauty, he tried to force himself on Sassui. Sassui ran away and prayed to God to hide her and when God listened to her prayers, land shook and split and Sassui found herself buried in the valley of mountains. When Punhun woke in [[Makran]] he could not stop himself from running back to Bhambore. On the way he called out "Sassui, Sassui!" to which the shepherd told Punnhun the whole story. Then Punnhun also lamented the same prayer, the land shook and split again and he was also buried in the same mountain valley as Sassui. The legendary grave still exists in this valley. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] sings this historic tale in his sufi poetry as an example of eternal love and union with Divine.

==Kech Makran==
The [[Kech District|Kech Makran]] is located along the Makran Coastal Highway in [[Baluchistan]], [[Pakistan]]. The fort of Punnhun whose construction dates back to 6000-8000
BC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kahopakistan.com/showthread.php?10750-Turbat&lt;/ref&gt; is located there.

== In music ==
The British musician [[Panjabi MC]] references the tale of Sassi in his 2003 song ''[[Jogi (Panjabi MC song)|Jogi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lyricstranslate.com/en/jogi-ascetic.html|title=jogi lyrics + English translation|website=lyricstranslate.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sex symbol''' is a [[Celebrity|famous person]] or fictional character widely regarded to be very [[sexual attractiveness|sexually attractive]].&lt;ref name=pam&gt;[[Pam Cook]], "The trouble with sex: Diana Dors and the Blonde bombshell phenomenon", In: Bruce Babinigton (ed.), ''British Stars and Stardom: From Alma Taylor to Sean Connery'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=vxmQJRr0vL8C&amp;pg=PA169 pp. 169–171]. Quote: "– the sex symbol is usually defined in terms of her excessive sexuality"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The term ''sex symbol'' was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars and [[Pin-up model|pin-up models]], including [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], and [[Raquel Welch]].&lt;ref name=Flexner&gt;{{cite book |title=Speaking freely: a guided tour of American English from Plymouth Rock to Silicon Valley |first=Stuart Berg |last=Flexner |authorlink=Stuart Berg Flexner |first2=Anne H. |last2=Soukhanov |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlANAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22sex+symbol%22 373] |isbn=0-19-510692-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was a reflection of the post-[[World War II]] increase of sexual and economic emancipation of women.&lt;ref name=pam/&gt; 

In the 20th century, sex symbols could be male as well as female: actors such as the romantic [[Sessue Hayakawa]] and the athletic [[Douglas Fairbanks]] were popular in the 1910s and 1920s. Archetypal screen lover [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s death in 1926 caused mass hysteria among his female fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Pamela |title=Last of the red-hot myths: what gossip over Rudolph Valentino's sex life says about the silents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/silent-but-deadly-rudolph-valentino-ken-russell-film-blu-ray |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--staff writers, no byline--&gt; |title=The Queen at 90: The key events of 1926, in pictures |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/21/the-queen-at-90-the-key-events-of-1926-in-pictures/hollywood-heart-throb-rudolph-valentino-died-unexpectedly-at-the/ |newspaper=The DailyTelegraph |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood, many film stars were seen as sex symbols, such as [[Errol Flynn]], [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Clark Gable]]. The "bad boy" image of the 1950s was epitomized by sex symbols such as [[James Dean]] and [[Marlon Brando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Weinberg, Thomas S.; Newmahr, Staci|year=2014|title=Selves, Symbols, and Sexualities: An Interactionist Anthology: An Interactionist Anthology|location=Los Angeles|publisher=Sage Publications|ISBN=1483323897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Elvis Presley]] obituary, [[Lester Bangs]] credited him as "the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America,"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|pp=58–59}} in the 1950s and 1960s, through his overtly suggestive dance moves.

==Fictional sex symbols==
With regard to fiction, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] states that the 1930s cartoon character [[Betty Boop]] is "the first and most famous sex symbol on animated screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/betty_boop_boop_oop_a_doop/|title=Betty Boop: Boop Oop a Doop|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rabbit]] (voiced by [[Kathleen Turner]]) from the 1988 live-action/animation crossover film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' has been described as a sex symbol as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16078068|title=Amanda Knox Is Like Jessica Rabbit|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Toot Braunstein]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) from the adult animated sitcom [[Drawn Together]] is also considered as a sex symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EGtTOAGYSWQC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=toot+braunstein+"sex+symbol"&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3abbT4WQvz&amp;sig=E11aFCGxuMVcueMdEAyuMO4QItA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw1r6Y0cTdAhWJQY8KHTogDlQ4ChDoATAGegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=toot%20braunstein%20"sex%20symbol"&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games have had a few characters that are considered sex symbols; one example would be [[Lara Croft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E1DF1238F93AA25752C0A96E958260|title=Video World Is Smitten by a Gun-Toting, Tomb-Raiding Sex Symbol|work=[[The New York Times]] | first=David|last=Barboza|date=19 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4_poll"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/S/sexsymbols/results/10-1.html |title=Channel 4 Top 100 Sex Symbols internet poll |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2001/06/24/do10.xml|title=Boom Raider|work=Telegraph|accessdate=March 5, 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has had several appearances in mainstream media.

'''Sitracima''' is the first [[Trade union|union]] to form in the [[maquila]] sector in [[Guatemala]]. The union was organized in 2001 by women working at the CimaTextiles factory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usleap.org/Maquilas/Choi/Update7-27-01.html ATTACKED MAQUILA WORKERS REACH SETTLEMENT IN GUATEMALA!]&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement with management in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpcs.umb.edu/labor_notes/files/29607.pdf Liz Claiborne Suppliers in Guatemala Sign First Union Contracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions deteriorate==

Conditions for the union have deteriorated, according to the women. While the women have faced intimidation since they first began organizing the union,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usleap.org/Maquilas/Choi/Update7-27-01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairlabor.org/all/news/cimatextile.pdf Fair Labor Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610090847/http://www.fairlabor.org/all/news/cimatextile.pdf |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they allege that threats have increased. The workers could not work from May 21 to May 26 because of a mandatory "vacation." As of May 30, the workers have nothing to do because management shifted all of the Cimatextiles production to the next-door ChoiShin factory (owned by the same Korean, company, Modas Choi &amp; Shin).&lt;ref&gt;Phone calls to Dr. Angelina Godoy from union leadership.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student Response==

On 17 May 2007 union leaders sent out an urgent plea for help to its internationalist allies, including Angelina Godoy, professor at the [[University of Washington]]. Dr. Godoy has led a human rights seminar to Guatemala each summer since 2005, and will lead another one in 2007. Each year, she and her students meet with the women of Sitracima, and discuss the nature of their struggle. The students, inspired by the clarity of the plea for help from people with whom they have a personal relationship, are currently organizing to pressure the Guatemalan government to enforce its labor law, to pressure the brands to defend their workers' rights, and to pressure the US government to intervene on the workers' behalf. They are regularly updating a blog with information directly from the workers, and about their actions on the workers' behalf, at [http://maquilaemergency.blogspot.com http://maquilaemergency.blogspot.com/].

Another student group devoted to labor conditions and workers' rights, Student Labor Action Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwj.org/projects/slap.html Student Labor Action Project] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091005101214/http://www.jwj.org/projects/slap.html |date=2009-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has created an online action page&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102523/http://www.unionvoice.org/campaign/cimachoi/ Online Action Page]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows visitors to its website to email representatives of Liz Claiborne, Macy's and Talbot's.

'''Social conflict''' is the [[Conflict (process)|struggle]] for [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] or [[Power (sociology)|power]] in [[society]].
Social conflict or group conflict occurs when two or more actors oppose each other in social interaction, reciprocally exerting social power in an effort to attain scarce or incompatible goals and prevent the opponent from attaining them. It is a social relationship wherein the action is oriented intentionally for carrying out the actor's own will against the resistance of other party or parties.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Dean G., Kim, Sung Hee, Eds., (2004, 3rd Edition) Social Conflict, Escalation and Settlement, McGraw Hill Higher Education, New York, NY {{ISBN|0072855355}} (&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict theory==
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
Conflict theory emphasizes interests, rather than [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[values]], in conflict. The pursuit of interests generates various types of conflict. Thus conflict is seen as a normal aspect of social life rather than an abnormal occurrence. Competition over resources is often the cause of conflict. The three tenets of this theory are the following: 1) Society is composed of different groups that compete for resources. 2) While [[Society|societies]] may portray a sense of cooperation, a continual power struggle exists between social groups as they pursue their own interests. Within societies, certain groups control specific [[resources]] and [[means of production]]. 3) Social groups will use resources to their own advantage in the pursuit of their goals. This often means that those who lack control over resources will be taken advantage of. As a result, many dominated groups will struggle with other groups in attempt to gain control. The majority of the time, the groups with the most resources will gain or maintain power (due to the fact that they have the resources to support their power). The idea that those who have control will maintain control is known as [[The Matthew Effect]].

One branch of conflict theory is [[critical criminology]]. This term is based upon the view that the fundamental causes of crime is oppression, resulting from social and economic forces operating within a given society. This perspective stems from German [[philosopher]], [[Karl Marx]], who believed the justice system and laws favour the rich and powerful in a society and that the poor are punished far more severely for much smaller crimes.

Another branch of conflict theory is the conflict theory of aging. This came about in the 1980s due to a setback in federal spending and a loss of jobs across the nation;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} the older generations competed with the younger generation for employment. Among those that were the worst affected were women, low-income families, and minorities. therefor, competition can seriously harm our daily life and society

==Karl Marx==

In the Critique of the Political Economy Marx writes:
In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At some stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters (legcuffs). Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.

In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic – in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and [[fight]] it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.

Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,[A] feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.
http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm

Karl Marx, a German revolutionary, emphasized his materialist views on ownership and means of production. He argued that what is most valued is a result of human labour and founded his ideas based on a capitalistic community, meaning a majority of the money is owned by only a small percentage. This causes a distinction between two classes, the industrialists and the working class. The industrialists, the ones that make up the small percentage, own the means of production. The working class are those earning their wages by selling their labour. Problems become noticeable  because the upper class is looking to get the most production possible for the least amount of money. A Surplus value is created; the profit industrialists hold on to caused by workers producing more than the employers actually need to repay the cost of hiring labourers. Another occurrence is exploitation; when workers receive less money than what their labour is worth. Marx believed that the gap between industrialists and the labourers would continue to grow. The industrialists would become more and more wealthy, and the labourers continue to move towards poverty. Conflict theory is seen throughout relationships and interactions between two groups of people including races, opposite sexes, and religions.

[[Max Weber]] and [[Karl Marx]] have two different approaches to the conflict theory. Marx supports the ideas of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]], claiming that individuals choose to engage in such rebellious and conflicting behaviour as a response to the inequalities of the capitalist system. Weber discusses the conflict of [[Social stratification|stratification]] and its effects on [[Political power|power]] in society. He stresses [[property]], prestige, and power as the main influences to the conflicting behaviours of groups in society.

Karl Marx argued:
"The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion to the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity -- and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally."

A commodity is a social use value produced by its owner not for personal consumption but for exchange. Marx believed that an [[entrepreneur]] has more and more to keep up with the more his company and power expands{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. It becomes more difficult each time his range of power increases. Eventually, the entrepreneur himself will become a commodity because he/she will no longer be able to keep up with their business and will have to put themselves (their company) up for sale on the market.

==Stratification==
Stratification is the distribution of a valued good in levels, or could be seen as the inequalities among individuals and groups. Weber determined that there are three levels of stratification and those include: property (economic class), prestige (status), and power (party). Property is related to control and ownership; prestige is the position that gains value determined by interactions with others; power is influence, relations, and position.

==Systems of stratification==
These systems share 3 characteristics. They are as follows:
# The rankings apply to social categories of people who share a common characteristic without necessarily interacting or identifying with each other.
# People's life experiences and opportunities depend on the ranking of their social category.
# The ranks of different social categories change very slowly over time.

==Conflict interests==
Conflict of interest is a type of conflict interest. We can define a conflict of interest as a situation in which a person has a private or personal interest sufficient to appear to influence the objective exercise of his or her official duties as, say, a public official, an employee, or a professional.
"Social conflict is not limited to hostile or antagonistic opposition; it is not wholly a clash of coercive powers as often is implied, but of any opposing social powers. Social conflict is usually recognized through violence and physical behaviour. Yet it's more that just fighting, and killing one another. At times it can deal with it throw a simple town in a conversation. It is acknowledged by someone's power."{{cite quote|date=March 2011}}

Dr. Coser,{{who|date=October 2016}} a sociologist, disagrees with the majority of American sociologists who, he contends, have badly neglected and misunderstood the concept and function of social conflict. He defines social conflict as '… a struggle over the values and claims to scarce status, power and resources in which the aims of the opponents are to neutralize, injure, or eliminate their rivals'.{{cite quote|date=October 2016}} He believes that the prevalent tendency is to look upon conflict as dysfunctional and pathological.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Social discount rate''' ('''SDR''') is the [[Interest rate|discount rate]] used in computing the value of funds spent on social projects. Determining this rate is not always easy and can be the subject of discrepancies in the true net benefit to certain projects, plans and policies. The discount rate is considered as a critical element in [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] when the costs and the benefits differ in their distribution over time, this usually occurs when the project that is being studied is over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.627.7762&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Valuing the Future: the social discount rate in cost-benefit analysis|author=Mark Harrison|citeseerx=10.1.1.627.7762|date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in cost benefit analysis ==
It may be used in estimating the value of creating a highway system, schools, or enforcing environmental protection, for example. All of these things require a [[cost–benefit analysis]] where policy makers measure the social [[marginal cost]] and the social [[marginal benefit]] for each project. Almost all new policies will not even be considered until after a cost–benefit analysis has been completed. The social discount rate can appear in both calculations either as future costs such as maintenance or as future benefits such as reduced pollution emissions.

Calculating the true social marginal cost can be a lot easier than measuring the social marginal benefit. Because of the uncertainty involved with calculating benefits, problems may arise e.g., should a dollar amount be put on time based on average wages, contingent valuations or revealed preferences? One of the big problems today is putting a value on a life. While some might say that a life is priceless, economists usually state the value to be somewhere between three and ten million dollars.&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt; Another problem is that because the current generation will often be paying for most of the costs while future generations will be reaping most of the benefit, whether current and future benefits ought to be weighed differently.

The proper discount rate should represent the [[opportunity cost]] of what else the firm could accomplish with those same funds.&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;Gruber, Jonathan (2007). "Chapter 8: Cost–Benefit Analysis" Public Finance and Public Policy, pp. 201–223&lt;/ref&gt; If that means that the money could be instead used to invest in the [[private sector]] that would yield 5% and that is the next best alternative for using that money then 5% would be the social discount rate. The government uses a variety of discount rates but something around seven percent is what the US [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) recommends for a pretax rate of return on private investments.&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;

== Calculation ==
The SDR is directly analogous to concepts found in [[corporate finance]] such as the [[Minimum acceptable rate of return|hurdle rate]] or the project appropriate [[Annual effective discount rate|discount rate]]; so the mathematics are identical. The benefit or cost per dollar can be calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\ (1/(1+r)^t) &lt;/math&gt;

where r equals the SDR and t equals time. For benefits or costs that have no end it is just
:&lt;math&gt;\ (1/r) &lt;/math&gt;

A higher SDR makes it less likely a social project will be funded. A higher SDR implies greater risks to the assumption that the benefits of the project will be reaped. A small increase in the social discount rate can matter enormously for benefits far into the future so it is very important to be as accurate as possible when choosing which rate to use.

There is a strong case for factoring in the equity issue when discounting benefits and costs of intergenerational projects such as those designed to combat climate change and environmental degradation.

The social discount rate is a reflection of a society's relative valuation on today's well-being versus well-being in the future. The appropriate selection of a social discount rate is crucial for cost-benefit analysis, and has important implications for resource allocations. There is wide diversity in social discount rates, with developed nations typically applying a lower rate (3–7%) than developing nations (8–15%).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The subject of a social discount rate, always a source of fierce debate between economists, has become highly controversial since the publication of the ''[[Stern Review]] on the Economics of Climate Change''. The publication exploded on the global warming scene in 2006 with its dire warning that global gross domestic product (GDP) was at future risk of a 20% reduction if there was a failure to invest 1% of world GDP now to reduce global warming. The Review did not use a single discount rate, but applied a stochastic approach whereby the discount rate varied with the expected outcomes, reflecting the interaction between growth and the elasticity of marginal utility, in line with [[Ramsey growth model|Frank Ramsey's growth model]]. However, critics questioned the findings on the basis that they were partly arrived at using an extremely low pure time preference rate of 0.1% in economic modeling.

There is no consensus among economists and, according to the survey, no "one-size-fits-all" solution to the choice of social discount rate, owing to national variations. A regular reassessment and readjustment of the social discount rate used by each country is therefore required.

== Differences between private and social ==
There are a number of qualitative differences between social and corporate discount rates and evaluation of projects associated with them. The governance of social project funding is different naturally, because estimating the benefits of social projects requires making ethically subtle choices about the benefits to others. For example, if it was presumed that a meteor will wipe out all life in a few years the SDR after the event is infinitely high. Alternately if we presume that the population will have many new and wonderful choices capturing benefits (i.e. they will be more wealthy) in the future that too raises the SDR of creating any given benefit. For example, choices about the SDR of [[environmental protection]] projects, such as funding the reduction of [[global warming]], place a greater valuation on future generations.

== Importance in global climate changes ==
This topic has recently been very controversial and highly debated. Since there is such a strong probability that the world will suffer significantly in the future due to global change in temperature, finding the correct social discount rate for the benefits of reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and other harmful greenhouse gases is very important. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The choice of an appropriate social time discount rate has long been debated. Some very intelligent people have argued that giving future generations less weight than the current generation is 'ethically indefensible.' Other equally intelligent people have argued that weighting generations equally leads to paradoxical and even nonsensical results."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/business/14scene.html Recalculating the Costs of Global Climate Change – New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The range in the social discount rate for a cost-benefit analysis in this issue range from zero to over 3%. Some argue that the only reason for discriminating against future generations is that these generations might cease to exist in the future. Thus the rate of time preference should equal zero since the probability for such a catastrophic event is so low (assumed to be 0.01% per year).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; This infers that there is equal weight given to all generations. However, to the extent that future generations are likely to be richer than those in the present, a positive discount rate should be applied reflecting the diminishing marginal utility of consumption. The [[Stern Review]] on the Economics of Climate Change is one such report that argues for zero discrimination of future generations, but applied a range of positive discount rates to its assessment based on the range of consumption projections predicted by climate models at the time. There is an important distinction here between discounting, which is partly a function of expected future consumption paths, and pure time preference, which the rate of discrimination through time. A common misconception is that the Stern Review applied a zero discount rate. In fact, the Stern review's stochastic projections applied many discount rates reflecting a range of consumption projections, all of them positive, even while it took the rate of time preference to be close to zero. This confusion is prevalent. [[William D. Nordhaus]] of Yale &lt;blockquote&gt;

"examines a model of climate change that is similar to the one used in the Stern Review but with a 3 percent social discount rate that slowly declines to 1 percent in 300 years rather than the 0.1 percent discount rate used in the Stern Review. In his model, the welfare of future generations is given less weight than the current generation's welfare. He finds that preventive measures like a tax on carbon emissions are certainly required. But they are of a much smaller magnitude than those recommended in the [Stern] report."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Stern Review did not apply a 0.1 percent discount rate, but it did apply a near-zero rate of time preference.

[[Honduras]] has a large Spanish community, distributed throughout the country. According to the National Institute of Statistics of Spain, 2,888 Spanish citizens live in Honduras as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/Datos.htm?path=/t20/p85001/a2017/l0/&amp;file=01001.px |title=Estadística del Padrón de Españoles Residentes en el Extranjero. Datos a 1-1-2017 |website=Instituto Nacioanl de Estadistica |access-date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The first Spanish citizen in Honduras was the [[conquistador]] [[Gil González Dávila]], who arrived in March 1524. He founded the villa of San Gil de Buena Vista. From there, he forged his way deeper inland, attempting to pacify the indigenous population while simultaneously fighting against other Spaniards who contested his territory. He also hoped to find the outflow of [[Lake Nicaragua]].&lt;ref name="Apuntes"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apuntes para la Historia de Honduras|author=Vera, Robustiano|date=1899|access-date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adventure Guide to Copan &amp; Western Honduras"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ar4Zf2QhhxIC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=Gil+Gonz%C3%A1lez+D%C3%A1vila+++conquista+de+Honduras&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a9pFTZDSEYaWsgPFmfW9Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Gil%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20D%C3%A1vila%20%20%20conquista%20de%20Honduras&amp;f=false|title=Adventure Guide to Copan &amp; Western Honduras|access-date=29 January 2011|author=Cindy Kilgore &amp; Alan Moore|publisher=Hunter|quote="Spanish conquistadores did not become interested in colonization of Honduras until the 1520s when Cristobal de Olid the first European colony in Triunfo de la Cruz in 1524. A previous expedition was headed by Gil Gonzalez Davila"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cortes-Hernan-LOC.jpg|right|thumb|253x253px|Hernán Cortés was one of the conquistadors of Honduras]]
Later, [[Hernán Cortés]], motivated by reports of the great wealth of the region, sent two expeditions; one by land and another by sea. The first expedition was led by [[Pedro de Alvarado|Pedro of Alvarado]] and the second by [[Cristóbal de Olid|Cristóbal of Olid]]. After being betrayed by Cristóbal of Olid&lt;ref name="Apuntes"/&gt;, Cortés decided to leave Mexico and take matters into his own hands, commanding an expedition that lasted nearly two years and ended in Trujillo, after surviving many dangers and hardships.&lt;ref name="Monthly Bulletin"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMNmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1658&amp;dq=NOMBRE+DE+LA+REPUBLICA+DE+HONDURAS&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WiEcTfhqiaixA5DXlMQK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Monthly Bulletin Bureau of The American Republics Washington D.C.|author=Jalhay, Henry|year=1899|access-date=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortés introduced cattle farming to the area, and founded the villa of the Nativity of Our Lady, near Puerto Caballos. Before his return to Mexico in 1526, he installed Hernando of Saavedra as governor of Honduras, and left instructions to treat the indigenous population well.

On 26 October 1526, Diego López of Salcedo was appointed governor of Honduras by the emperor, replacing Saavedra. The following decade was shaped by the personal ambitions of governors and conquistadors, which often came into conflict with the interests of governmental organisation. The colonial Spanish rebelled against their leaders, and the indigenous population rebelled against the Spanish landowners and their abuses.&lt;ref name="Apuntes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Americas|author=Pascal Girot|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1994|isbn=0-415-08836-4|pages=284–285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=honduras+francisco+de+montejo+pedro+de+alvarado&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LyxCTZKfDIa0sAPCm5nCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=honduras%20francisco%20de%20montejo%20pedro%20de%20alvarado&amp;f=false|access-date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creole people were the most determined to obtain independence for Honduras. Paralleling what occurred in the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], Honduras-born descendants of Spaniards began a movement to make the country independent, both from the Kingdom of Spain and from the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. Liberal reforms were initiated to give them more local control over the economy and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/historia/independiente/la_reforma_liberal.htm The liberal reform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521211220/http://www.historiadehonduras.hn/Historia/Independiente/la_reforma_liberal.htm |date=21 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of Honduran independence, towards the end of the era of free trade between Latin America and Spain, a large proportion of the Spanish people arriving in Honduras were Catalans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/boletinamericanista/article/viewFile/98420/164479 Spanish emigration to Latin America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Honduras was a country that received immigrants from diverse regions of the world. Spanish settlers typically came to start businesses in rural areas, cultivating crops such as coffee, bananas and sugar, which were exported to Spain and other European countries. Such foreign investment in Honduras was a first step towards developing a more robust economy, through the exploitation of natural resources and the generation of wealth and employment, however conflict arose when indigenous chiefdoms seized farms and ranches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.1mayo.ccoo.es/archivos/cdee_pdfs/PDF/INTRODUCCION.pdf Spanish immigration]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acceptance of treaties for the recognition of titles, at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, through the initiative of president [[Luis Bográn|Luís Bográn]], the Doctor Antonio Abad Ramírez y Fernández Fontecha ([[Cádiz]], 1855), Honorary Consul of Spain in Tegucigalpa and Rector of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras|Central University of the Republic of Honduras]], President of the [[Academia Hondureña de la Lengua|Scientific-Literary Academy]] and President of the Supreme Council of Public Instruction, organised "cultural missions" with the objective of hiring artists and teachers from Spain through orderly immigration.&lt;ref&gt;The Diplomatic Representation of Spain was not elevated to the rank of Embassy until 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccoo-honduras.blogspot.com/2006_12_12_archive.html Spanish emigration to Honduras]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish immigration to Honduras is protected by the ''Hispanic-Honduran Agreement for Social Cooperation'', which affirms&amp;mdash;among other things&amp;mdash;"The principle of equality and reciprocity in labour matters, so that Spaniards and Hondurans who work overseas in Honduras or Spain, respectively, enjoy the same labour rights as citizens, after having been accredited by the appropriate labour organizations", and which established the basis for the current cooperation between Spain and Honduras to further economic development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccoo-honduras.blogspot.com/2001/11/20-anos-de-la-firma-del-convenio.html 20 years of the signature of the Hispanic Agreement-Honduran of social cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is consistent with the ''Treaty of Peace and Friendship'', whose fifth article establishes that "the nationals of either of the two States will enjoy in the other those privileges have been granted or are granted to the citizens of the most favoured Nation, with the exception of those from Central America".

In 1996 the ''Treaty of Double Nationality between the Spanish State and the Republic of Honduras'' took effect, which makes citizenship of the two countries compatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccoo-honduras.blogspot.com/2003/06/actualizacion-del-convenio-de-doble.html Update of the Agreement of Double Nationality between the Realm of Spain and the Republic of Honduras]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Historical Memory Law]] of Spain has also allowed a large number of Hondurans of Spanish origin to recover their Spanish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccoo-honduras.blogspot.com/2010/12/102050-inscripciones-de-expanoles.html 102.050 registrations of Spaniards thanks to the Historical Memory Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spanish Culture in Honduras ==
[[File:Holy_Week_procession_Comayagua_Honduras_(1).jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|Holy Week in the city of Comayagua.]]The Spanish language is Spain's greatest contribution to Honduran culture, and continues to be the main cultural bond between the two countries.

Holy week is part of the Spanish inheritance of the Hondurans, a religious and secular festival that has been celebrated since colonial times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historiayarqueologia.com/photo/albums/tradiciones-semana-santa-en-comayagua |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815154855/http://www.historiayarqueologia.com/photo/albums/tradiciones-semana-santa-en-comayagua |archivedate=15 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Spaniards living in Honduras, and Hondurans who had previously studied in Spain, created the Honduran Institute of Hispanic Culture.

The Spanish community has participated actively for decades in the Festival Folclórico Internacional (International Folklore Festival) in [[San Pedro Sula]].

Honduras established the Cultural Centre of Spain in [[Tegucigalpa]] in 2007.[[File:Ccet-fotos-3.jpg|right|thumb|200x200px|The Cultural Centre of Spain in Tegucigalpa – CCET.]]

== Spanish communities ==
The city with the largest Spanish population in the country is San Pedro Sula, which is where European, American, and Latin American companies usually begin their investment and industrial projects.
* Associació Catalan d'Hondures, [[San Pedro Sula]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/catalunya-act/FitxaDetall.htm?idAct=81&amp;idEntitat=20&amp;idSubentitat=9&amp;imprimir=&amp;newLang=es_ES Associació Catalan d'Hondures]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the Councils of Residents in Guatemala and Nicaragua, Honduras is one of the last countries of the region without its own Council.

During the reconstruction work after [[Hurricane Mitch]], a network of associations of Spaniards, NGOs, and branches of the Spanish embassy organised national-level distribution for Spain's emergency assistance.

=== Spanish Diplomatic relations in Honduras ===
The Spanish embassy in Honduras not only takes responsibility for protecting Spanish citizens who reside in the country temporarily or permanently; through various civil organisations, it has also supported programs to combat poverty and malnutrition in Honduran children, as well as projects to preserve cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906063612/www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Tegucigalpa/es/home/Paginas/home_tegucigalpa.aspx Embassy of Spain in Honduras]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statistics New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|Tatauranga Aotearoa}}), branded as '''Stats NZ''', is the public service department of [[New Zealand]] charged with the collection of statistics related to the economy, population and society of New Zealand. To this end, Stats NZ produces [[New Zealand census|censuses]] and surveys.

==Organisation==
Statistics New Zealand employs people with a variety of skills, including statisticians, mathematicians, computer science specialists, accountants, economists, demographers, sociologists, geographers, social psychologists, and marketers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social and Population Statistics''' studies population, social conditions, [[standard of living]], census, and has a census planning manager as well as statisticians helping to develop new social statistics measures.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;
* '''Standards and Methods''' studies statistical methods, statistical education and research, solutions and capabilities, information management, and develops new methodologies.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;
* '''Collections and Dissemination''' services clients. There is one general manager in [[Christchurch]] and one in [[Auckland]]. It develops products and services, manages publishing and customer services.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;
* '''Organisation Direction''' maintains contacts with key government officials, does internal audits and business planning, manages international relations and the Official Statistics System (OSS), and advises on [[Māori people|Māori]] affairs.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;
* '''Industry and Labour Statistics''' studies business indicators, finance and performance, agriculture, energy and work knowledge and skills.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;
* '''Organisation Development''' focuses on services for the agency itself, including information technology management, quality assurance, application development and support, finances, corporate support, and human resources.&lt;ref name=snz1/&gt;

Many of the agency's powers, duties, and responsibilities are governed by acts of the New Zealand Parliament. The agency is a [[Public sector organisations in New Zealand|state sector organisation]] of New Zealand operating under the authority of the Statistics Act 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stats.govt.nz/about-us/legislation-policies-and-guidelines/ http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/policies-and-protocols.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities and activities ==
{{reports offered by Statistics New Zealand}}

The department conducts the [[New Zealand census]] every five years. The census is officially done on one day. The most recent census was on 5 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/census http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The count of ''usual residents'' (excluding visitors from overseas) on this day was 4,242,048;&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"&gt;[http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/pop-and-dwellings.aspx http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/pop-and-dwellings.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; they lived in 1,570,695 occupied dwellings;&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt; their median age was 38 years (half older, half younger);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/age-and-sex.aspx#&lt;/ref&gt; 598,605 identified themselves as "Maori" (14.9% of the population);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/cultural-diversity.aspx#&lt;/ref&gt; people had a median income of $28,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/income.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114125818/http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/income.aspx |archive-date=14 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a main source of information, and data collected from this census is often used for further purposes within the department as well as serving as benchmark information for numerous reports and surveys. For example, the census asks about the main means of travel to work, but by combining this with data from transport surveys, the department can issue detailed reports such as "Commuting Patterns in New Zealand: 1996-2006", with specific inferences such as "Over half of people who walked or jogged to work lived within 2km of their workplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Statistics New Zealand | date = July 2009 | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/commuting-patterns-in-nz-1996-2006/car-bus-bike-or-train.aspx | title = Commuting Patterns in New Zealand: 1996–2006 | accessdate = 31 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090813004604/http://www.stats.govt.nz/Publications/PopulationStatistics/commuting-patterns-in-nz-1996-2006/car-bus-bike-or-train.aspx | archive-date = 13 August 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is helpful for business purposes, government decision making, media purposes, foreign policy, journalism, public information, planning, and for many other uses. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New Zealand uses statistics from this agency about prices and wages to help develop economic indicators, exchange rate information, and the official cash rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of New Zealand | date = July 2009 | url = http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/az/2989605.html | title = A-Z listing of statistics | accessdate = 31 July 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090601171750/http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/az/2989605.html | archivedate = 1 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department supplies a wide variety of information. It reports on labour costs, incomes, civil unions and marriages, employment, electronic card transactions, food prices, retail trade, births and deaths, prices of capital goods, overseas trade, screen industry, international visitor arrivals, overseas merchandise, agriculture and fish stocks, water resources, building consents, electronic card transactions, English language providers, wholesale trade, local authority information, balance of payments data, manufacturing surveys, commuting patterns, mapping trends, culture and identity statistics, housing trends, work stoppages, gross domestic product, industrial energy use, and the list goes on and on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Statistics New Zealand | date = July 2009 | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/news_and_events/release-calendar.aspx | title = Release calendar August 2009 | accessdate = 31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it analyzes trends and publishes forecasts. The agency does not involve itself with political polling generally.

The agency provides information to the public. Many surveys and reports are available free of charge on its website; users can download spreadsheets electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Statistics New Zealand | date = July 2009 | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/ | title = Statistics New Zealand website | accessdate = 31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some private market research firms use the agency's vast database information as source material, combining it with value-added presentational software (such as sophisticated mapping programs), and then sell the re-packaged information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Caliper Corporation | year = 2008 | url = http://www.caliper.com/DataCDs/NewZealandData.htm | title = New Zealand Data CD | accessdate = 1 August 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090815231024/http://www.caliper.com/DataCDs/NewZealandData.htm | archive-date = 15 August 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information from demographers is used as source material by journalists for articles. Sometimes statistics can influence public policy. For example, Stats NZ demographers in 2008 spotted a trend of fewer women having children and wrote: "Deciding not to have children happens as a consequence of other life events.... Education, career, mortgages, changes in family and partners for many couples, childlessness is what happens while they are making other plans."&lt;ref name=stophaving1&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Sunday Star-Times | date = 30 March 2008 | url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/feature-archive/337885/New-Zealand-women-stop-having-babies | title = New Zealand women stop having babies | accessdate = 2 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report was picked up by journalists at the ''Sunday Star-Times'' to form the basis of an article with the headline "New Zealand women stop having babies". The article discussed ramifications, such as possible workforce shortages and increased cost of elderly care, as well as possible policy actions such as a "Working For Families" program.&lt;ref name=stophaving1/&gt; Newspaper headlines can influence public opinion which may impact policy decisions. Stats NZ information is used by government to explore tough problems; a research paper dated April 2009 used agency statistics when exploring how to handle gang violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = New Zealand Parliament | date = 3 April 2009 | url = http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/ParlSupport/ResearchPapers/b/c/7/00PLSocRP09021-Young-people-and-gangs-in-New-Zealand.htm | title = Young People and Gangs in New Zealand -- see footnote #2 | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agency data is quoted by a wide variety of sources, even in the footnotes of books. For example, in "Connecting the Clouds - the Internet in New Zealand", author Keith Newman cites agency statistics regarding telecommunications cost decreases (the Stats NZ report said "New Zealand average residential phone call pricing plummeted 50% between 1987 and 1993") and national finances (the Stats NZ report said "The current account deficit for the year ended March 2007 was $13.9 billion (8.5 percent of GDP)").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = nethistory.co.nz | author = Keith Newman | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nethistory.co.nz/index.php/Main_Page | title = Connecting the Clouds - the Internet in New Zealand (footnotes ch.1 #11; ch.8 #3) | accessdate = 3 August 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090908025220/http://www.nethistory.co.nz/index.php/Main_Page | archivedate = 8 September 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is used to help retailers spot trends and act accordingly. A newspaper article on decreased do-it-yourself (DIY) retail spending in 2008 quoted an agency source: "Figures from Statistics New Zealand show DIY spend has been tracking down with the retail sector." This information helps businesses adjust to new realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = The New Zealand Herald | author = Errol Kiong | date = 3 October 2008 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10537123 | title = Housing slump puts DIY stores at risk | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio programmes such as "Radio New Zealand National" have quoted agency data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Radio New Zealand National | author = | date = 22 July 2001 | url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/mediawatch/archive/2001/210723 | title = Programme Transcript | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some agency policies result in controversy. One gay activist felt Stats NZ was "breaking the law" by omitting a question on the 2006 census regarding sexual orientation; the article in the ''New Zealand Herald'' elaborated "Mr van Wetering and the Office of Human Rights Proceedings, the independent legal branch of the commission, expect to discuss the inclusion of the (sexual orientation) question in the 2011 Census with lawyers for Statistics New Zealand later this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = gay.co.nz | date = 25 February 2006 | url = http://www.qna.net.nz/news/683.html | title = Activist wants right to tick gay box | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some indications that the agency was seriously considering including a question on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Asexuality Aotearoa New Zealand (AANZ) website |year=2009 |url=http://www.asexuality.org.nz/news.htm |title=Statistics New Zealand is considering including a question on sexual orientation in future censuses |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912075339/http://www.asexuality.org.nz/news.htm |archivedate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency did [[focus groups]] exploring this possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Statistics New Zealand | year = 2006 | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/developments/sexual-orientation-focus-group-research.aspx | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130309170418/http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/people_and_communities/marriages-civil-unions-and-divorces/sexual-orientation-focus-group-research.aspx | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 9 March 2013 | title = Sexual Orientation Focus Group Research | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes controversies involve disputes over whether agency data was cited properly. One blogger, claiming to be a former Wellingtonian journalist who identifies himself or herself as "Poneke", accused the ''Sunday Star-Times'' of publishing misleading data about crime statistics. Poneke noted that “Statistics New Zealand now provide(s) the ability to query the New Zealand Police Statistics – allowing you to gather detailed crime information about your local area since 1994.” The blogger felt the agency was "impeccably impartial", but distrusted various media sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Poneke's Weblog | date = 31 December 2007 | url = http://poneke.wordpress.com/2007/12/31/propaganda/ | title = Lazy media run crime statistics propaganda without revealing National Party as source | accessdate = 3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way the agency makes data available to the public is by offering a ''Table Builder'' tool. It lets users access specific information from past surveys.&lt;ref name=tb1&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Statistics New Zealand |date= |url=http://www.aspdesign.co.nz/statsnz/tutorials/Homepage_VO/Homepage_VO_viewlet_swf.html |title=Tutorial -- Table Builder tool |accessdate=2 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425015437/http://www.aspdesign.co.nz/statsnz/tutorials/Homepage_VO/Homepage_VO_viewlet_swf.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it's possible to "build" a table about population changes in the Wellington region of married persons using Table Builder—married Wellingtonians (not separated) increased in number from 148,014 (in 2001) to 151,884 (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Statistics New Zealand | date =  | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/TableBuilder.aspx | title = Table Builder tool | accessdate = 9 August 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090803193416/http://stats.govt.nz/methods_and_services/TableBuilder.aspx | archive-date = 3 August 2009 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, of the 151,884 in the year 2006, 648 lived in the Lambton section. Essentially it allows users to efficiently retrieve specific information from past surveys and censuses. It's a quick way to retrieve counts and permits what some market researchers call "breakdowns". Columns can be chosen; rows can be chosen; and a table can be pulled together filtered by different variables. The agency does not yet offer end-users the capability to directly mine raw data to generate new statistics. Perhaps in the future users will have the power to access a virtual database of updated census counts, that is, to access a virtual database created "as if the census was taken when the table was being pulled together"—and by using filters, weighting, projections, and easy-to-use software tools, create data which describes "what's happening now". In the example, with such capabilities, one could say how many married (never-separated) Wellingtonians living in Lambton there were "right now". Further, projections could be made. But there is no evidence in the Stats NZ website that such a capability is yet offered, but it is possible this may happen in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |date= |url=http://wdmzpub01.stats.govt.nz/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx |title=Table Builder |accessdate=2 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318212839/http://wdmzpub01.stats.govt.nz/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following counts were derived by using Statistics New Zealand's ''Table Builder'' tool:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Statistics New Zealand |date=2006 |url=http://wdmzpub01.stats.govt.nz/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx |title=Age Group by Sex, for the Census Night Population Count, 1996, 2001, and 2006 |accessdate=2 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318212839/http://wdmzpub01.stats.govt.nz/wds/TableViewer/tableView.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics New Zealand develops statistical classifications and standards, and works with the corresponding national statistical offices with such nations as Australia, the United States, and Canada. It conducts ongoing research regarding the viability of these standards. Since the early 2000s, it has begun using the ''Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupation'' to describe a wide variety of jobs; for example, the code 111111 describes a chief executive or managing director, while the code 531111 describes a general clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/ClassificationCodeFinder.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113163251/http://stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/ClassificationCodeFinder.aspx |archive-date=13 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using standardized codes, high speed computers can sift and sort through large databases to produce summary reports.

It also provides technical assistance to developing countries in the Pacific rim, with a special focus on [[Pacific Island]] nations.

Statistics New Zealand is acknowledged as the statistical authority within government. While other branches of government generate statistics, Statistics New Zealand works with them to expedite the information as well as provide consulting services when appropriate. It is responsible for the first integrated programme of Official Social Statistics. It provides assistance, guidance and oversight to other government agencies regarding statistics when appropriate. For example, it works with the New Zealand Health Information Service regarding their management of statistical information - a downloaded spreadsheet showed there were 65,120 live births registered in 2007 in the nation, and the table listed Statistics New Zealand as a source of this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = New Zealand Health Information Service | date = July 2009 | url = http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/careers.aspx | title = Maternity Snapshot 2007 Table 1: Number of mothers and live births in 2007, by data source (Provisional) | accessdate = 31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It worked with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage to collect and publish cultural data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=July 2007 |url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/publications/cultural-policies/index.html |title=Cultural Policy in New Zealand (2007) |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019090438/http://www.mch.govt.nz/publications/cultural-policies/index.html |archivedate=19 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vision==
The department's "aim is that New Zealand increasingly gets the statistical information it needs to grow and prosper".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/our-strategic-direction.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120202441/http://stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/our-strategic-direction.aspx |archive-date=20 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has statistical excellence, integrity, confidentiality and data security, leading, connecting, and communicating as its values.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/our-values.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120202446/http://stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/our-values.aspx |archive-date=20 January 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It says on its website: "By following these values, we aim to deliver accessible, relevant, and timely statistics for all New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Confidentiality is not only a policy chosen by the department, but required by law. A section of the Statistics Act 1975 reads "No information from an individual schedule is to be separately published or disclosed [Section 37(3)], except as authorised by the Statistics Act (the Act permits others to see information from an individual schedule, but only when it is in a form that prevents identification of the respondent concerned, and then only under strict security conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/policies-and-protocols/statistics-act-1975.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114031230/http://stats.govt.nz/about_us/who-we-are/policies-and-protocols/statistics-act-1975.aspx |archivedate=14 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means government can not abuse personal information from a census by revealing (or threatening to reveal it) for dubious purposes. For example a particular person's income responses can not be handed over to a tax collection agency.

The agency maintains an open copyright policy stating that, apart from images and content with specific copyright statement, users are free to use the work provided that Statistics New Zealand is attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/about_us/about-this-site/copyright-terms-of-use.aspx| title=Copyright and terms of use| publisher=Statistics NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Statistics New Zealand uses many methods to collect, process, analyze, and publish data. [[Statistics]] can get complex. The agency has statisticians and mathematicians and survey experts whose chief duty is to examine how the agency approaches various projects and to suggest ways to improve efficiency, speed, and accuracy.

Some projects require advanced statistical tools to make sense of misleading data. For example, sometimes seasonality distorts data. "For example, in retail trade, December is a very high month due to Christmas sales. If we compare November sales with December sales, we would report an increase in sales. But this increase is largely due to seasonal fluctuations and is not an informative measure" according to a description from their website.&lt;ref name=seasonal1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent seasonal variables from distorting data, statisticians sometimes use complex programs, including X-12-ARIMA (derived from census bureaus from the US and Canada), to remove seasonal distortions.&lt;ref name=seasonal1/&gt; So, with the December sales bump removed, the seasonally adjusted retail sales data can reveal the ''true underlying trend''—are sales going up, holding steady, or declining? This is important information for retailers.

[[File:N2 Wellington Harbour.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Statistics New Zealand publishes trade information, export and import data, tourism, and so forth. This information assists government planners as well as business activity.]]
While the census counts every person, the department also conducts [[Statistical survey|surveys]] based on only a small sample of people. These samples are scientifically selected to represent the larger group. For example, the General Social Survey chooses a select number of households, approximately 8,000, which represent the nation as a whole, and surveys them every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Zealand General Social Survey - Statistics New Zealand |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/people_and_communities/Families/nz-general-social-survey-info-releases.aspx |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers with laptops conduct face-to-face interviews, and the result is information about "social wellbeing" including "housing, health, paid work, social connectedness, and human rights. It sometimes conducts specialty surveys about a specific industry or topic. For example, it published a biotechnology survey, based on a 10-page questionnaire developed by the agency, using scientific samples to choose respondents; the 2007 results can be downloaded to computers via the Internet. This particular report uses a long list of variables, such as "total exports" and "biotechnology exports to Asia" and "stage of development of biotechnology processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Statistical techniques such as [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] and weighting can reduce data gathering expenses while surveying, although it requires careful attention by statisticians. For example, census counts are rather straightforward in a statistical sense since it is a straight count of bodies, purchases, opinions, actions. But it is expensive to interview everybody. And there are many non-census topics requiring further study which the agency is asked to do. One way to reduce costs is by selecting smaller samples which hopefully represent the population being studied. This is a highly cost-effective way to get accurate information. Choosing a good sample sometimes requires complex statistical work to make sure the sample is, indeed, truly representative of the population under study. If conditions do not permit representative sampling but known benchmark statistics are known (possibly from earlier census data), it's still possible to generate accurate information by ''weighting the data'' to ''distort it back'', so to speak, to compensate for the distortion caused by the unrepresentative sample. For example, suppose an area of Wellington has a known percentage of women—say 53% -- which is believed to be accurate from a previous census count; a study is done a few years later; a sample is chosen; questionnaires are processed; but of the returning questionnaires, 57% are women. It's possible statistically to give men slightly greater weight to account for the discrepancy, and the result is more accurate data. The agency discusses different methodologies on its website.&lt;ref name=integratedw1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement explains why weighting is sometimes necessary: "Statistics New Zealand is improving the methodology used for the 2001 Household Economic Survey through the use of integrated weighting. This is a relatively recently developed method of adjusting the statistical output of a survey to match population benchmarks. In particular, it takes account of undercoverage in the survey of specified population groups. Integrated weighting improves the robustness and accuracy of survey estimates. It also reduces the effect of bias in estimates resulting from undercoverage, as well as reducing the level of sampling error for benchmark variables."&lt;ref name=integratedw1/&gt;

[[File:NZ Religious denominations by TA 2013.svg|thumb|280px|left|Statistics New Zealand publishes data in a wide variety of formats, including tables, charts, graphs, and maps like this one, which details religious affiliations (2013)]]
All statistical work presents opportunities for error, but it's possible to reduce error to manageable amounts. A statement reads: "An important aim of our ongoing work is to understand, manage, control and report on all known sources of error... which simply reflect the inherent variability that exists among the units we are seeking to measure... This variability manifests itself in ''sampling error'' when we use samples for cost-effectiveness reasons to estimate characteristics about a population. Sampling errors are relatively easy to measure.... Other sources reflect process, measurement and inference errors, and are referred to as ''non-sampling error''. It is not possible to eliminate all sources of error. However, our continued efforts at understanding and managing variability and error ensure we are exercising a high level of control on all known sources of error." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

What greatly facilitates statistical accuracy by reducing non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal questions such as wage and salary information. But people must answer these questions and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, he or she is still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Government of New Zealand - Parliament| date = 3 September 2007| url = http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0001/latest/DLM430900.html#DLM430900| title = Duty of persons to obtain census schedule (part 3 section 25)| accessdate = 1 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Census definitions and forms|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/info-about-2013-census-data/2013-census-definitions-forms/forms.aspx|website=Statistics New Zealand|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=7 January 2015|ref=questionnaire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125200910/http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/info-about-2013-census-data/2013-census-definitions-forms/forms.aspx|archive-date=25 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Government Blue Book New Zealand Table of Contents 1851.jpg|thumb|280px|right|In colonial times, there was a "Blue Book" of official statistics, compiled by various magistrates. Here's a photo of the table of contents dated 1851 for the southern island, then called "New Munster". Source = Statistics New Zealand (National Archives).]]
In the nation's early days, with a small population and before the advent of powered transportation and modern telecommunications, there was little need for statistics nor ability to create them. In the colonial years, sometimes magistrates and police officials collected data as part of their work.&lt;ref name=green1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After about the 1890s, the official information source presented to the public was called the ''New Zealand Official Yearbook'' compiled from various departments.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; Sometimes data about animals were collected (a census of poultry ceased in 1971); one census taker on horseback drowned while crossing a river.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; In 1956, the newly created Department of Statistics had 164 employees.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; Tabulating techniques improved. One source writes: "As both New Zealand's population and the complexity of the information sought grew, so did the size of the army of temporary clerks that was employed every five years by the Census and Statistics Office to process it. Sitting at long tables in large draughty or cramped rooms, they laboriously added, subtracted and calculated percentages. From the 1890s census data was written on cards which were sorted by hand. The drudgery of statistical work was gradually eased as adding and calculating machines and typewriters came into use, operated mostly by women. Tabulating machines were imported from the United States in the 1920s to process punched cards; this too was women's work," according to a book written by David Green in 2002.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; The agency grew in size. Tabulating machines were replaced by mainframe computers, then microcomputers, then the Internet. "Since the early 1980s computing has been done in-house, and in the 1990s personal computers and the Internet revolutionised the day-to-day experience of work at Statistics New Zealand," according to Green's book.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt;

Management positions have changed over time as well. The post of ''Government Statistician'' was created in 1910 within the Registrar-General's Office, before a separate Census and Statistics Office was set up in 1913. Before 1910 most statistics for the colony or dominion as a whole were the responsibility of the Registrar-General himself.

The well-regarded economist J.B. Condliffe worked at the agency after First World War, but no fully qualified mathematicians until after the Second, when in-house training in statistical methods also began. Since 1910, the post of Government Statistician has been held by different persons. From 1955 until 1994 the agency was known as the ''Department of Statistics'' until the name was changed to the current one.

The agency has grown in size and sophistication from its early beginnings. As times change, information needs change accordingly. For example, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, politicians became interested in the concept of [[sustainable development]]. The agency found ways to measure these trends to provide helpful information for planners. In August 2002, it published its first report on Sustainable Development Indicators, which measured variables such as water quality, energy usage, sustainability of cities, and youth development.

'''Tocal College''' is a heritage-listed agricultural college at 815 Tocal Road, [[Tocal, New South Wales|Tocal]], [[City of Maitland]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by Phillip Cox and Ian McKay and built from 1963 to 1965. It is also known as '''Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus'''. The property is owned by the C. B. Alexander Foundation. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 17 April 2013.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5061664|Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus and Movable Collection|hr=01908|fn=12/07581|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early history of Tocal site===

The College was established on land originally part of the colonial Tocal Estate which is located on a knoll in the [[Paterson River]] valley, NSW. Tocal is in the Hunter Valley region of NSW at the junction of the Paterson River and Webbers Creek. The Paterson River valley was once occupied by the [[Gringai]] clan of the Wanaruah (or [[Wonnarua]]) Aboriginal people. The diverse ecosystems that were once prevalent in the valley from the rainforest along the river banks to the wetlands, lagoons and surrounding paperbark forests provided an abundance of food, fresh water and materials. The land on which the [[Tocal Homestead]] and College is situated was used by the Gringai clan for many years. Grooves worn into rocks by grinding seeds and plants, indicate Tocal was a popular camp site for the Aboriginal people. "Tocal" is an Aboriginal word, and at one stage it was thought to mean "ducks-a-plenty" in the local Aboriginal dialect. However, the weight of recent evidence indicates Tocal simply means "big" or "plenty". Aboriginal grinding grooves have been located within the homestead complex at Tocal.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand&gt;Desgrand, Margaret "C.B. Alexander Agricultural College (Tocal) Nomination" (08-02-2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801 Colonel [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]] surveyed the area at the request of [[Philip Gidley King|Governor King]]. The first wave of Europeans were convict timber loggers as the alluvial river valley was abundant in red cedar. The Paterson River became known as the "Cedar Arm". The first land grant in the area was made to John Powell in 1818 on land by the river to the south of the town. The river was navigable and the town site was the third to be surveyed in the Hunter Valley and soon became an important river port. Tobacco, grains, grapes, wine and citrus fruits and were cultivated in the area. Shipbuilding also commenced with the development of the river trade.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

James Webber was granted land at Tocal in 1822 where he went on to produce tobacco and become an early pioneer of viticulture in the colony. Tocal's frontage to the tidal section of the Paterson River gave the property access to the port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]] and shipping access to [[Sydney]]. Webber built a two storey barn which is still extant and drained part of Tocal's wetland. By 1828 Tocal was 3,300 acres after Webber had added to the grant by purchasing adjoining Crown land. The farm land, stone barn, blacksmiths shop, barracks supervisor's cottage remain intact and as a whole include the land upon which the College was later built. Webber sold Tocal in 1834 and by 1843 it was in the hands of lessee Charles Reynolds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

Charles Reynolds leased the property from Felix in 1844. He has been described as a "genial man of dignity and intelligence" who was well respected by those (he) associated (with) in the agricultural industry in NSW as a cattle and horse breeder.  During the next 82 years, Charles and subsequently, his widow Frances, his son Frank and grandson Darcie, managed Tocal, to become one of the most important Hereford, Devon and thoroughbred studs in the country. In this period, the road through the property to [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] improved, although the river trade began to decline.   His son, Frank Reynolds finally managed to purchase Tocal from the Wilson family in 1907.  The establishment of the railway in 1911 dislocated the operation of the property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

In 1926, Jane (Jean) Alexander bought Tocal from the Reynolds family continuing the reputation of Tocal for its successful graziers. The Alexander family consisted of Jean, Isabella, Robert and Charles Alexander, all of whom were elderly and unmarried. By 1939 only Charles remained, and he invited his two nieces, Myrtle and Marquerita Curtis, daughters of his late sister Margaret, to reside with him at Tocal. Charles Boyd Alexander is noted for the introduction of new technologies replacing labour intensive farming operations, moving Tocal in the direction now associated with modern agriculture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5054&gt;Hathway 2003 p30&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Charles' death in 1947, the two sisters to remained at Tocal until their death just five days apart in 1985, at the ages of 94 and 97 respectively. When Charles Boyd Alexander died in 1947, he left a very large estate and a complex will. His intention was that his substantial estate, comprising not only Tocal but other property and assets, be used to help Protestant orphan and destitute children, for "their training to fit them for a life on the land".&lt;ref&gt;(The C B Alexander Presbyterian Agricultural College.1964, College Prospectus)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of the will's nature, an acceptable proposal for the use of the estate did not come before the Equity Court until 1963.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

It was due to the efforts of Edward Alan Hunt, MBE, a co- founder of the legal practice Hunt and Hunt, Bligh St, Sydney and honorary solicitors for the Presbyterian Church in NSW, that the Equity Court, in 1963, accepted the recommendation of the C. B. Alexander Trustees that the Presbyterian Church be allowed to use the bequest to establish an Agricultural College in the grounds of Tocal at [[Paterson, New South Wales|Paterson]] in addition to a boy's home at Emerald Hills, [[Leppington]], north of [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]]. By involving Leppington, the Church met the requirement that the bequest be used to help destitute children. Scholarships from Leppington would be offered at Tocal if any of the boys were to show a bent for advanced training in agriculture. On the other hand, the Alexander Estate could underwrite the cost of the home at Leppington and also build an Agricultural College at Tocal.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5055&gt;White 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The former would become known as the St Andrew's Presbyterian Agricultural College, Emerald Hills, Leppington, NSW, and the latter as the Charles Boyd Alexander Presbyterian Agricultural College. Hunt's fascination with Tocal that had begun as a child whilst on fishing trips to the Paterson River from his nearby home at Kirkton, near [[Belford, New South Wales|Belford]], was to continue for a life time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

===Architects and the Emerald Hills project===

In 1962, Philip Sutton Cox graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] with honours in architecture, with the award of the Royal Australian Institute of Architect's Silver Medal, and with already proven experience in the office of Bruce Rickard as well as a practice in New Guinea, where he designed a number of buildings some of which were published in Architecture Australia. Whilst many of his university colleagues travelled overseas to either northern Europe or North America, Cox was content to stay in Australia to work locally. His first post graduate position was with Figgis and Jefferson at 34 Alfred Street, Milson's Point.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5056&gt;Towndrow 1991 pp 94-98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

It was while working with this firm in 1962 that Cox's architectural talents were recognised by Edward Alan Hunt who was at the time commencing proceedings in the Equity Court, on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, for the use of the C. B. Alexander Trust. This eventuated after a visit by Hunt, to the home of Philip's father, Ron Cox. Philip's sister, Judith, was married to Edward Alan Hunt's son, David. Hunt was notably impressed by Philip's final year design project for an art gallery, and assured Cox that he would be able to offer him a commission in the near future.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5057&gt;Towndrow 1991 p102-103&lt;/ref&gt;The confirmation of the commission to [[Philip Cox]] from the Presbyterian Church to design the two colleges, Leppington and Tocal, materialised whilst he was still working with Figgis and Jefferson, and the initial intention was that Philip would continue with the project in association with Figgis and Jefferson. An initial sketch design for the "Emerald Hills" project, which was intended to be a country retreat for 40 adolescent boys who had committed juvenile offences, was completed by Cox in late 1962. The drawings bear the title 'Figgis and Jefferson and Philip Cox, Architects in Association, 36 Alfred Street, Milson's Point'.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5058&gt;NSW SL PXD 790/398&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings are indicated on the elevations more by means of the shadows cast than by line work, a style of drawing which Cox retained throughout his early career.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

However, Cox long realising that there were philosophical differences, parted the association, establishing Philip Cox and Associates and working solitary on the project in the back of a terrace at 68 Blues Point Road that he and his university friends, Louise Gowing, Philip Atkin, and David Gray, had jointly purchased in 1962, but were obliged to let to cover repayments. Through retained connections with Bruce Rickard, Philip Cox was introduced to Ian McKay and shortly after McKay leased part of the terrace, relocating from the premises he had shared with Bruce Rickard in [[Phillip Street, Sydney]], since 1957. The move was fortuitous. Cox, realising the need for a partner with a greater level of construction experience to make the venture possible, and sharing common architectural interests with McKay, an architect of nearly a decade of experience, the association of the two was inevitable. Both were keenly interested in the Australian landscape and its vernacular buildings, and both admired the architecture of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], as did many emerging architects in Sydney at the time, for its fundamental principles, celebration of form and structure, textural qualities of natural materials, and the close relationship between the interior of a building and its setting. To these shared interests were added McKay's fascination with Eastern mysticism and architecture, particularly that of [[Japan]], which was to strengthen over the period of their association.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

Born 23 September 1934, Ian David McKay grew up on a bush property near [[Coonabarabran]], NSW, the son of a farmer and stock and station agent. His grandfather, Ronald Thomas McKay, was a hydraulic engineer who was involved in the [[Snowy Mountains]] scheme and was a strong influence, as McKay recalls, for his innate understanding of mechanics and structure.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5059&gt;McKay, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Ian McKay enrolled in the founding year of architecture at the [[New South Wales University of Technology]], [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]] in 1949, and graduated in 1954. One of his first lecturers was [[Myles Dunphy]], whose knowledge of architectural history and understanding of structure including his ability to draw a large scale cross section of [[Chartres Cathedral]] in chalk on the blackboard, as well as his avid interest in conservation, of the Australian landscape, was a lasting source of inspiration.  Following graduation, Ian McKay travelled overseas to Europe and Asia, attending the international architecture congress on urbanism, CIAM X, in [[Dubrovnik]], returning to Sydney in 1956.  After establishing his own practice he shared an office, with Bruce Rickard, from 1957 through to 1962.  Rickard had graduated in the same year as McKay, but had spent several years abroad undertaking post-graduate including landscape architecture in Pennsylvania, before returning in 1957 having been deeply impressed by the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Through his interest in Japanese architecture, he became associated with Muller, Bert Read and Adrian Snodgrass. McKay quickly became one of a number of emerging architects working on Sydney's [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]].  By 1962, in just over five years in practice, McKay's work displayed both sensitivity to context, flexibility and dynamism in the robust use of natural materials and bold forms that explored the structural and textural properties of materials.  Whilst the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright is apparent in his works in this period including several houses, in the fluidity of planning incorporating bushland settings and the use of natural timber offset against robust brickwork to heighten their textural qualities, his work was not as derivative of Wright's work as was Rickard's.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5060&gt;Taylor 1972 p53&lt;/ref&gt; At the Hill House, [[Cootamundra]], he explored the structural possibilities of preformed plywood, and offset its textural qualities with reinforced concrete. His design of the multi-storey experimental vertical shopping block intended solely for women's retail "Lasade" at 70 [[Castlereagh Street]], Sydney, for which he received the "10 Best Building Award" in 1961, offset glazed and pressed bronze panels in a curtain wall facade with solid vertical bands of acid etched, precast concrete panels.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /

Work first commenced on the Emerald Hills project. The construction drawings for Emerald Hill are entitled as Ian McKay and Philip Cox, Architects in Association, 68 Blues Point Road, [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] and dated January 1963.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5061&gt;NSW SL PXD 790/405-407&lt;/ref&gt;  The design incorporated a series of pavilions arranged along a colonnade to form a series of courtyard spaces around the nineteenth century rural residence "Emerald Hills" which was to be restored as the warden's residence. Each of the pavilions each utilised low pitched roof forms that reinterpreted forms common in traditional farm buildings particularly skillion roofs that sailed above the lower scale colonnades to provide clerestory skylight.  A central bell tower provided a focus to the complex and relieving verticality to the long colonnades and low pitched roofscape, with the advantage that it was climbable.  A limited palette of material was maintained throughout. Recycled second-hand bricks were laid in enlarged mortar beds of an ochre colour and the joints struck flush to enhance the sense of solidity, and the roof structure consisted of exposed rough sawn timbers.  It was an intention that the architecture was to be domestic rather than institutional in character&lt;ref&gt;(Cox, 2008 p)&lt;/ref&gt;, drawing inspiration from the rural residence on the site. Their immediate client for the project was the Reverend Douglas Cole of the Presbyterian Social Services Department. Cole maintained a strong interest in ecclesiastical art and architecture as well as the sociological aspects in the rehabilitation of youths in the court system.  Much discussion and effort was therefore centred on architectural solutions that would promote 'individuality, identity and self-esteem, whilst ensuring that the boys could be part of the College community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5062&gt;Towndrow 1991 p104-105&lt;/ref&gt; It was this aspect of the project that keenly interested McKay,&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5063&gt;McKay December 12&lt;/ref&gt; and for which he developed a T-arrangement whereby bedroom accommodation was arranged around courtyards, and each room provided sleeping alcoves for three boys arranged around a common space. McKay and Cox designed much of the furniture including the refectory dining table and chairs, lighting fittings, and signage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The "Emerald Hills" project was awarded the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] for Outstanding Architecture by the [[Australian Institute of Architects|Royal Australian Institute of Architects]], the year of its completion, 1963.  Peter Johnson, one of the jurors, reported in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] as "the achievement of architectural values which derived form a deep concern for people who use the building.  It fits naturally into the undulating countryside and the simple materials used- here brick and natural timber- show a sincere and unaffected approach to designits character which is unselfconsciously Australian".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5064&gt;Towndrow 1991 p109&lt;/ref&gt; Freeland credited the 1963 award of the Sulman with legitimizing the Sydney School as more than a regional residential style, writing  'Initiated by a small coterie of Sydney architects, the style was impelled into prominence when the Sulman was made to the Presbyterian's Church's Leppington Agricultural College designed by McKay and Cox'.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5065&gt;Freeland 1968 p305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

===Tocal College===

The opportunity to further develop the ideas explored at Emerald Hills on a grander scale followed soon after with the development of the design for the college at Tocal, which was to be designed as a specialist college for 160 boys and staff on a fully operational farm. The fundamental requirements of the residential college at Tocal were complex and ranged from repetitive sleeping areas to the special use buildings such as a multi-purpose hall, chapel, dining room and kitchen complex for 120 students, residential accommodation for 60 students and associated common room and reading rooms, staff accommodation, classroom accommodation and laboratories, sporting facilities, and outbuildings for piggeries, dairy and poultry, bull pens, barns and stables.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

An established architect-client relationship, a larger scale of project, a more complex brief, and an expansive site incorporating a colonial homestead complex set within a spectacular regional landscape, provided the two architects with greater opportunities than at Emerald Hills to explore an architectural language derived from a response to the unique site. Ian McKay and Philip Cox were present at the first meeting of the College Council when the site of the College was chosen. Cox describes their first impressions: "The site on the crest of the hill overlooking the Paterson Valley was an inspiring one. Tocal is one of the loveliest of settings. It was with excitement and expectation that we wandered around the stone and timber outbuildings; these were some of the best we had ever seen, and were constantly a source for architectural thinking behind Tocal".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5066&gt;Towndrow 1991 p110&lt;/ref&gt;  The array of stone and timber farm buildings, barns, stables, woolsheds and pens, laid out around the Georgian homestead formed a village environment, suggesting an array of more intimate spaces to discover and framing dramatic views over the valley.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

It was the express wish of the benefactor, Charles Boyd Alexander, that the College be situated somewhere on the spur running parallel to the Tocal Road.  The reason for this was this spur was the least valuable farming land but afforded fine views over the Paterson River and Webber's Creek valleys and consequently over much of the 2,000 hectare property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5067&gt;McKay and Cox 1964 p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The site that Cox and McKay initially selected was at the top of this north facing spur. In the initial sketch design&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5068&gt;NSWSL PXD 790/455 and PXD 790/482&lt;/ref&gt;the College buildings were symmetrically arranged around a traditional enclosed cloistered quadrangle comprising quartered parterres with the chapel forming the four side isolating itself from the surrounding farm and the Tocal homestead complex, although the axial relationship with the homestead on the opposing hill was by this time firmly established.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The scheme, as it evolved, became far more responsive to its unique setting, drawing greater inspiration from the "village environment" of the historic homestead complex, and closely integrated with the surrounding landscape. The formal enclosed quadrangle evolved into an open sided quadrangle that embraced the views over the Georgian homestead complex and its encircling lagoon. The location of the College was shifted northwards and lower on the ridge, in order to create a direct visual relationship with the Tocal Homestead complex and its meandering lagoons. At the same time, the revised location enabled the incorporation into the quadrangle of a fine copse of existing trees, and was closer to the agricultural facilities, such as the dairy, poultry yards and the piggery located on the eastern side of Tocal Road near the river&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5067/&gt;.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5069&gt;Cox 14 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   The axial relationship with the homestead was retained but relaxed, as indicated on the final Regional Plan.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5070&gt;NSW SL PXD 790/467&lt;/ref&gt; The evolved scheme was consequently a unique response to its setting and far more dynamic.  It also allowed for loose extendable planning along the eastern and western wings, with each of the main functional elements grouped around its own courtyard, echoing the greater quadrangle.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The amplification of the village environment of the Tocal homestead complex, the clarity of structural expression and the use of vernacular materials, locally sourced and in a natural state were the fundamental principles for the design of the College. Cox explains: "Ian and I were resolved that in building this college we were bound to create a tradition that could last for centuries. Timber, brick and clay tiles were to be the vocabulary. No nonsense, no frills; pure structure. The buildings were to merge with the landscape; a complete marriage".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5071&gt;Towndrow 1991 p111&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more important inspirations for the vocabulary of the buildings was to be the barn designed by [[Edmund Blacket]], with its gothic like tracery of exposed timber structure, that Cox dubbed "the cathedral of barns".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5072&gt;Hathway, 2003 p23&lt;/ref&gt;  Cox later wrote:  'Most impressive was the uncomplicated way the buildings expressed every piece of structure allowing the anatomy to be clearly legible. There was a dignity here similar to the gothic buildings in Europe where the structural forces within are revealed and traced throughout.  These buildings reinforced our belief that the way ahead in architecture was to continue this tradition while employing more recent technologies and developing new forms and strategies'.&lt;ref&gt;( Cox et al 2008, p 122)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the design of the project these first responses and the initial vision were a constant reference point, with the result that the architects achieved a high level of integrity in the execution of the original design concept.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

Ian McKay and Cox worked seamlessly together throughout the entire project, almost always in agreement on even the most smallest of details and almost always arriving at the same opinion or conclusion for every decision&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5063/&gt;The only reason that their tasks on the project were divided, was due to time constraints, as the College was planned for the first student intake commencing January 1965. The strength of Cox's relationship with E A Hunt was such that it was more practical for Cox to focus on the main hall, whilst McKay had greater involvement with the chapel. The square plan form of the Chapel reflected the Presbyterian ideals of austerity and simplicity, and limitation of symbolic and ritualistic references. The altar tapestry provides the only biblical reference, depicting a passage from the Old Testament Isaiah.  The incorporation of the vertical spire was outside the scope of the brief, but both McKay and Cox considered it a necessary vertical focus to the complex as well as a regional landmark.  The inspiration for Cox's design of the hall was the barn of the Tocal Homestead designed by Edmund Blacket in 1867. This barn, dubbed by Cox as "the cathedral of barns" for its tracery of exposed structural timbers, of king post trusses supported by adzed poles and brackets shaped from tree roots, and closely spaced battens supporting the shingled roofing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

As with the "Emerald Hills", McKay and Cox designed much more than just the buildings, including furniture such as the Dining Room's refectory tables and chairs, the lectern, the communion table and chairs of the Chapel, the lighting fittings, fixtures, the commemorative plaques, and signage. The practice expanded in reputation and with employees, including Bob Hooper, Alan Ray and Roy Thistleton, and later Andrzej Ceprinski and Andrew Metcalfe. Both Cox and McKay acknowledge the work of Ceprinski whose enthusiasm, determination and his immense skill at drawing was as invaluable asset.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5073&gt;Towndrow p 111, Cox and McKay December 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The intensity and zealousness of the period and the challenges and difficulties entailed in a large scale project that was innovative in Australia, both in terms of its design and its construction. The drawings retained within the NSW [[State Library of New South Wales|State Library]] Pictures Collections, File Nos PXD 790/449a-551, entitled "C B Alexander Agricultural College, Tocal, Cox Richardson Architects &amp; Planners: selected works, 1967-1979, Architectural and Technical Drawings", bear the initials of Cox, McKay, Ceprinski and others.  Although the set of drawings is incomplete, their finely execution in ink and pencil, and their level of detail, is testament to the level of commitment to resolution of detail, the skill and the care of the architects involved.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The architects' working drawings were approved in November, 1963. The contract to build the College was awarded to Gardiner Constructions Pty Ltd of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in January 1964 and the first sod was turned for the start of the work on the main contract on 31st January 1964.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5074&gt;Tocal College Council, 1964, p5&lt;/ref&gt; McKay and Cox considered it essential to the design of the College to exploit skills and materials locally available, and they maintained at all times a close involvement and oversight of the construction of the College, from the preliminary selection of trees prior to felling and bricks through to the final detailing of furniture, fixtures, finishes, light fittings, landscaping, hardware and signage.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5059/&gt; Cox and McKay even wove the leather webbing for the chapel chairs and designed an alphabetic font for the Chapel's commemorative plaque.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5075&gt;Cox December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The architects investigated the availability of bricks of a texture and colour approximating the sandstock bricks utilised in the construction of the Victorian buildings in the Paterson valley.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5076&gt;Cox and McKay 1964 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The bricks, both for the walls and the paving, were fired in traditional catenary shaped kilns at a number of local brickworks as the capacity of each was limited for such a volume of brick required.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5077&gt;Cox 14 December 12&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland is a town renowned for its clay seams and its historic brickworks, now only one remaining.  The process produced a high degree of clinkers. Cox recounts the initial dismay of the client in utilising all bricks, including chipped bricks and clinkers traditionally rejected, and the use of thick mortar beds of bush sand with joints struck flush, that emulated the rough masonry of the Tocal farm buildings and achieved a sense of solidity rather than integral units.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5078&gt;Cox Dec 12&lt;/ref&gt; The stone keystones above every arched brick opening replicate the shape of the keystone above the entrance to the homestead's stone barn constructed 1830. The roof tiles were initially proposed to be terracotta shingles but the cost was prohibitive and Swiss pattern terracotta tiles were finally installed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5076/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The emphasis on timber craftsmanship derived from traditional wood crafting methods utilised in the construction of rudimentary Australian rural buildings, required the sourcing of skills and materials no longer easily acquired on the scale required.  Most of the structural timbers were to be hardwoods sourced within the region, ironbark, Brushbox and Tallowwood. Joinery timbers for the Chapel chairs was also locally available, although the timber for the Dining Room refectory furniture was sourced from elsewhere. The extensive lengths and cross sectional dimensions that presented a particular challenge, even at the time.  Local people "bushies" skilled with the broadaxe and adze, and carpenters versant with traditional jointing methods were sourced.  All timbers were brought to the site directly from felling in the forest, where they were barked, de-sapped and line dressed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5079&gt;Cox 14 Dec 12&lt;/ref&gt; Both McKay and Cox recall that the Tallowwood tree for the king pole of the chapel's spire was selected from a Barrington Tops forest by McKay in conjunction with a local miller, the tree felled and brought to the site, where it was barked, roughed squared (or hewn) with a broadaxe and laid on trestles such that the central axis was horizontal.  The rough squared trunk was turned every day for several months to ensure even seasoning, so that it its central axis would be straight. McKay recounts that one day it developed a slight bow, and astoundingly, the tree was straightened through releasing the tension on the outer curve of the trunk with a single powerful blow of a broadaxe. After this seasoning process, the trunk was adzed into its final shape.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5080&gt;McKay December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the adzing of over fifty Brushbox trunks to form the colonnade pillars was also undertaken on site by local woodworkers, as too was the construction of the bolsters, or brackets, supporting the roof of the main hall. Each bolster weighed 1 tonne, and comprised three pieces of ironbark that were first shaped and dressed with a broadaxe, before being morticed and tenoned together, and finally dressed with an adze.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5081&gt;Guide to Tocal NSW Agriculture p 37&lt;/ref&gt; Although technologically the use of traditional methods of construction demonstrates a return to the carpentry and bricklaying of the colonial era of the Tocal homestead, it was an intellectual and emotionally based departure. Roger Pegrum elaborates: "Joinery details at Tocal celebrate the skills of those who built a century and a half ago without the benefit of electric saws and routers.  Rafters sit squarely on beams, which are cut neatly into posts: Struts are halved over purlins; and the beautiful tusk tenon survives in a world just discovering the convenience of punched steel connectors".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5082&gt;Pegrum 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Both Cox and McKay explain that the knowledge and skills required to effectively craft timber using traditional tools and methods, and the lengths of timber in the cross sections required, are no longer available.  As well, structural statutory codes and standards are less flexible and almost would certainly now prohibit the suspended king pole of the chapel.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5083&gt;Cox and McKay Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

Norman and Addicoat (now Norman Disney Young) and Taylor, Thomson and Whitting were the consulting hydraulic and civil respectively&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5074/&gt;but specialist structural advice for the timber components of the project was provided by Professor Stan Shaw from the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5084&gt;Towndrow 1991 p 112&lt;/ref&gt; The architects undertook most of the structural design themselves, with the final calculations and certification provided by Shaw.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5077/&gt; This exemplifies the interest of the architects in structure and the role that structural expression played in the spatial design. The design of the chapel spire presented the most challenging of structural problems, the resolution of which required a unique jointing system utilising exposed stainless steel shear connector plates to connect the halved trusses to the king pole.  A concrete ring beam was required to take the thrust of the spire, which was greatest at the four corners of the chapel. McKay's earlier experimentations with the expressive qualities of reinforced concrete in the late fifties and early sixties provided the necessary understanding for integrating a contemporary material with timber that has been crafted using time honoured techniques. Cox recalls that the chapel's spire was so structurally unique incorporating a large scale timber structural joint, beyond the scope of calculations, that Shaw was never completely certain that the king pole would withstand being suspended over a void.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5077/&gt; Prior to any costing undertaken by a Quantity Surveyor, the architects undertook their own estimations of the first main contract works, in the order of 300,000 pounds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5076/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

Philip Cox advised the commission of Margaret Grafton for the chapel's alter tapestry. Made of hand spun wool dyed with natural dyes, it took 18 months to complete. This was the first Australian tapestry to be commissioned by an architect for a site specific project and was instrumental in establishing the incorporation of art works into large scale projects as common practise.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The first stage was completed in time for the first intake of fifteen Foundation students for the first term beginning 26 January 1965.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5085&gt;Tocal College Council, 1964, p1&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was Malcolm Henderson, who photographically recorded the construction of the College and retains the collection of slides..&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5086&gt;Henderson, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

On 5 November, 1965 the College was opened by Sir [[Robert Menzies]], then [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Also in 1965, Ian McKay and Philip Cox were awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal for Outstanding Architecture and later in 1966, the Blacket award, by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.  Cox and McKay also later received the "Building of the Decade Award" from Lend Lease, in 2005.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The College, even during its construction, attracted much interest from the architectural profession. Geoffrey Bawa visited the complex in 1965, remarking that it was "the only building in Australia that he admired".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5075/&gt;  However, not all shared similar views. The principles demonstrated, including the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, passive climate control, and loose extendable planning and the integration of the built form with the landscape, were an anathema to the prevailing modernist, international, institutional architecture of its time. Robin Boyd, an emerging architectural critic, considered the project far too retrospective and nostalgic.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5087&gt;Towndrow 1991 p 112 and Cox December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The College has been critically acclaimed in numerous written publications by architectural and structural critics, including those by J. M. Freeland and [[Jennifer Taylor (architect)|Jennifer Taylor]] and continues to revered as one of the most important late twentieth century works in Australia, being one of the entries in the Docomomo world survey and was one of the first 20 buildings to be considered under the modernism theme in Australia. It is noted as being an exemplary example of a group of buildings referred to in Apperly's' Identifying Australian Architecture' as illustrating late twentieth century Sydney regionalist architecture applied to a large scale non residential project, as well as Freeland "Architecture in Australia" follows on from his preceding accreditation that the award of the 1963 Sulman medal to Cox and McKay for the Emerald Hills project impelled the Sydney Style into prominence, further accredits the receipt of both the Sulman and Blacket awards in 1965 to Tocal College, along with the award of the 1964 Sulman medal to Woolley for the design of Goldstein Hall, as "the idiom was established".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5065/&gt;  Freeland summates the qualities represented as "Its underlying qualities were timeless but its appearance was uniquely mid twentieth century. In its development, application and appropriateness it was thoroughly and distinctly AustralianThe construction of the buildings, direct, simple and thoughtful, had a crafted quality and was often exposed as a powerful part of the design. Because it contained much that was Australian generated it seemed to hold a promise that after a century and a quarter Australian architecture might at last be going Australian".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5088&gt;Freeland 1968 pp305-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The first Principal was the Reverend Colin Ford, B.SC.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908-5085/&gt; Edward Alan Hunt MBE was the first Chairman of the College Council and remained in that office until the handing over to the state government in 1969, after which he continued his involvement with the College until his death in 1982.  In acknowledgement of his contribution, his ashes lie in the College chapel. Hunt's son David, and his wife Judy, Philip Cox's sister, have retained association with Tocal and assist in raising funds for conservation works to the buildings. The Presbyterian Church managed the college until 1970 after which it was transferred to the NSW Department of Agriculture as the CB Alexander Agricultural College, Tocal, after the passing of the C B Alexander Foundation Act in 1969. The extent of the Tocal property has been increased to the current 2,200 hectares through various land purchases since the College commenced including Athcourt Farm, Glendarra, Bona Vista, Dunnings Hill, Clements Farm and Numeralla. In 1972, the first female students were admitted.  Tocal is now operated by the NSW [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|Department of Primary Industries]]. The Tocal Field Days are regarded as the Hunter Valley's premier agricultural event as well as being a popular regional social attraction.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

In 2015 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the Tocal College CB Alexander Campus on their Country Register.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

== Description ==
Tocal College - C. B.Alexander Campus is the collection of buildings constructed in 1965 to a design by Cox and McKay. It includes the landscaping which is open and sparsely treed and the open landscape between the buildings and Tocal Homestead. The movable collection is limited to the following items: chapel tapestry, chapel chairs, chapel organ, tables and benches in dining room and conference room, padded leather chairs and small square occasional tables.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The Tocal farm estate comprises 2,200 hectares in the Hunter Valley region of NSW, approximately 15 kilometres north of Maitland. The estate extends along the valley floor at the confluence of the Paterson River and Webber's Creek, encircled by watershed ranges to the northwest and northeast, forming a remarkably beautiful contained setting.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The College forms part of the Tocal farm estate, and is set on a long low north facing ridge that overlooks the Paterson River and the lower ridge of the Tocal Homestead complex, the two separated by an extensive meandering lagoon. The first impression of the College via glimpses from Tocal Road through stands of Spotted Gums, is of a long low complex straddled along the ridge; of massive, shielding walls of [[sandstone]] coloured [[brickwork]], deeply folded into narrow window openings thrown into deep shadow, and above which rises a [[spire]] of unexpected height. The College entrance road winds up the ridge before straightening along the central axis that extends through the entrance vestibule and the Chapel's spire. The broad roof of the entrance vestibule sweeps low over the stepped entrance platform and from this unassuming arrival point one is led into a large open sided [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] where the spatial qualities and the architecture of the entire complex unfolds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The main campus buildings are arranged around a cloistered quadrangle, but European monastic references are tempered by its loose, open sided, formation.  The northern side of the quadrangle is ingeniously left open to direct the eye northwards to the colonial Tocal Homestead on the hill opposite, and to embrace the broader landscape setting, creating one unified and unique composition, encompassing College, Homestead and the Paterson valley setting.  The loose fit of the College buildings is reminiscent of Australian farm complexes, importantly the Tocal Homestead, whereby vistas to the surrounding landscape are framed by the array of farm structures.  Focus on the quadrangle is retained, and intensified, by the central placement of the College chapel with its dramatic spire, and by the encircling [[colonnade|colonnades]] that serve as the primary circulation between the main campus buildings, providing shade and shelter from conditions on the exposed ridge. The central placement of the chapel divides the quadrangle into two, more intimate, [[courtyard]] spaces, each assuming a different character through modelling of the ground plane.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The quadrangle is unified by the simple repetition of forms and structure, enhanced by the play of light and shadow, and by a limited palette of locally sourced materials; brick, timber, and terracotta tile, all chosen for their textural qualities. The rendition is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture, yet the selection of materials and their crafting is distinctly derived from local rural traditions.  The hovering, low pitched, stepped roof planes of the campus buildings are swept low over the colonnades supported at their perimeter by robust posts of raw adzed Brushbox baulks, supported on sandstone [[Plinth|plinths]] and girt by punched steel collar straps that add to the textual effect. Rubble drains, used in lieu of gutters, add texture to the ground plane. Copper gutters are only included where necessary over entrances and the like. A modular grid of 2,700mm (nine feet, zero inches) applied throughout orders the placement of structure and space. The repetition of colonnade posts, exposed projecting [[Rafter|rafters]], paired above each post, their ends painted white in traditional Japanese fashion, establishes a powerful unifying rhythm, intensified by the dark shadows cast on the ochre coloured pavement and walls. The unglazed terracotta tiled roofs have acquired a green tone of algae almost a verdigris colour that further adds to the rustic effect. Spaces between the main quadrangle buildings lead to smaller courtyards that are treated in the same manner.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The brickwork throughout the college is modelled to intensify its visual strength. Walls are buttressed, battered, and folded into reveals being supported at horizontal folds by concealed permanent formwork of reinforced concrete, openings are narrow and glass is deeply recessed to provide shade.   The selection of light earth toned, kiln fired bricks throughout, set in unusually thick, flush struck, beds of ochre coloured mortar, enhances the sense of solidity and references the underground brick silos, the stables and barns of the Tocal Homestead, as well as Webber's original cottage of 1822.  The brickwork is purposefully rough to confirm the rustic and robust nature of the buildings, every clinker or chipped brick utilised.  Similar coloured kiln fired bricks are used as paving throughout the colonnades and the interiors of the buildings, and the ground plane is modelled with sunken terraces, such that the walls appear to rise out of the earth.  Door openings are spanned by pointed arches locked by [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]] of honed sandstone, the shape of the keystones reminiscent of the Tocal stone barn of 1830.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The common palette of materials, of brick, timber and terracotta tile, and the extensive colonnades connecting the main campus buildings make for a unified complex but within this uniformity there are marked contrasts of architectural expression. Each of the main buildings flanking the quadrangle is necessarily varied in design by its function, maintaining an individual character and structure expression. Structural expression and the textural qualities of exposed natural finishes, form the major role in defining the character of each space. The timber structure is expressed and robust, referencing the timber woolsheds, barns and tank stands of the Tocal Homestead, yet the ingenuity of some of the College timber structures is such that commonplace structural terminology is not always applicable. Of these, the Chapel and the Edward Alan Hunt Hall, are structurally the most remarkable and innovative, and exhibit the highest level of brick and timber craftsmanship.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The Chapel, is pivotal to the design of the complex; cradled within the quadrangle, and centred on the north south axis that runs through the centre of the main entrance and the quadrangle in a northerly direction to the original Tocal homestead building. The building is square in plan with battered brick walls supporting a low [[clerestory]] above which a spire that rises a further 30 metres in height, its apex surmounted by a two metre high cast stainless steel cross. The dramatic form of the chapel's spire is not only a focal point to the College, but also a landmark that visually links the College complex with the Tocal Homestead and the surrounding Tocal farm estate.  In contrast to the lofty steeple, the low massive battered brick walls of the chapel enclose a cave like interior.  The level of natural light to the interior is minimal, channelled through deeply recessed and narrow openings confined to the east and west [[Aisle|aisles]], and its colour rendered by ochre coloured glazing. Four discreet shafts of light reveal the intricate tracery of roof timbers from small [[Gablet roof|gablets]] high on the steeple. Materials are left in their natural state; brick walls left as exposed face, floors of brick paving, off-form concrete using undressed timber boarding, and roof framing timbers exposed to view beneath ceilings of timber boarding. Despite the simplicity of the square plan form, the design of both the brickwork and the timber structure is highly complex and explores timber technology beyond that of the vernacular Tocal buildings. From the low battered external walls spring brick [[Buttress|buttresses]] that brace a massive concrete ring beam spanning between an inner line of brick pillars. These pillars play a dual role in forming side aisles on the eastern and western sides of the interior. From the four corners of the ring beam spring the low raked intercepting timber [[trusses]] that support both the  clerestory roof framing and the massive [[king post]] of the spire.  Both the trusses and the king pole are made from Tallowwood ([[Eucalyptus microcorys]]) sourced from forests within the locality, and barked, de-sapped and line dressed on site. The king post is composed of three lengths, each diminishing in thickness from an initial 450mm, as it ascends suspended over the chapel, over 30 metres in height. The load of the pole is transferred to the trusses by stainless steel shear plates sleeved between the laminated sections that compose the chords of each [[truss]].  Attention to detail extended to every aspect of the interior finishes and the construction: each concrete roof tile of the spire was double wired and further fastened to the timber [[Batten|battens]] with two brass screws. The raw medieval character of the chapel's interior is reinforced by the furniture and furnishings specifically designed for the space, including the face brick lectern and communion table, and the Blackwood (Acacia melanoxlyon) framed chairs with woven leather webbing designed by Cox and McKay, the organ, and the tapestry hung behind the alter that depicts a passage from the Old Testament Isaiah. Created by Margaret Grafton, and woven of hand spun wool dyed with natural dyes, its warm colours and soft texture contrast with the raw Spartan interior. The [[marble]] commemorative tablet, designed by the architects, rests directly beneath the king post.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The main hall, named after Edward Alan Hunt, is located to the western side of the main entrance and was designed as a multifunctional space, for theatre, badminton, basketball, gymnastics and other purposes.  For this reason it has a suspended timber floor of Brushbox rather than brick pavement utilised elsewhere in the common campus buildings.  The inspiration for the Hall was the barn of the Tocal Homestead designed by Edmund Blacket in 1867. This barn, dubbed by Cox as "the cathedral of barns" for its tracery of exposed structural timbers, of king post trusses supported by adzed poles and [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] shaped from tree roots, and closely spaced battens supporting the shingled roofing.  The enclosing walls of the hall are articulated by faceted buttresses, between which window and door openings are cradled, achieving massive depth.  In the tradition of medieval gothic churches, the roof trusses are supported by enormous brackets, each comprising three pieces of adzed ironbark mortised together. The brackets rest on off-form concrete [[Corbel|corbels]], that project from the brick work wall behind. From the bottom chord of each truss radiate a spray of struts supporting intermediary rafters, reminiscent of Aalto's [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]]. In the same plane as the bottom chord of each truss is a dia-grid that supports cylindrical timber lined light fittings. The faceted backdrop of the hall stage is constructed of Blackbutt ([[Eucalyptus pilularis]]).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The Dining Room complex is located at the northern end of the eastern arm of the quadrangle separated from the Chapel by a sunken courtyard. The interior of the Dining Room consists of a similar sunken brick paved floor, focused on a broad brick fireplace spanned by a deep off-form concrete beam. The roof structure is a simpler version of the E. A. Hunt Hall, consisting of roof trusses, from the bottom chord of which radiate a spray of struts supporting inter-mediatory rafters. The refectory style tables and seating benches and the light fittings, designed by the architects, are similar to their previous design for the dining room at Emerald Hills. The Kitchen is located adjacent to the Dining Room and opens onto a service courtyard.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The student accommodation forms the western side of the main quadrangle. The bedrooms are paired and arranged in long rows, accessed from the internal facing colonnades. Each row is linked by cross colonnades so as to enclose a series of intimate courtyards and frame glimpses of the broader landscape of the farm beyond. The design is additive, with potential for additional blocks should they be required in the future. Each row is covered by a simple [[skillion roof]] allowing the inclusion of clerestory windows for natural [[lighting]] and ventilation, while maintaining privacy. As elsewhere, the brickwork is folded inwards to form deeply recessed openings providing both sun shading and privacy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The classrooms complex and administrative offices are located at the southern end of the eastern arm of the quadrangle separated from the entrance vestibule by an intimate courtyard.  A separate entrance, a later addition, is marked by a tower form again reminiscent of Aalto's Saynatsalo Town Hall gives direct access to the Classrooms from the entrance [[driveway]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

The landscape of the campus reinforces the local setting and incorporates original scattered stands of Spotted Gum ([[Corymba maculata]]) with planted stands of She-Oak or Forest Oak ([[Allocasuarina torulosa]]), and under plantings of xanthorrhoeas, grevilleas and callistemons.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;&lt;ref name=desgrand /&gt;

=== Condition ===

The college buildings were reported to be in very good and highly intact condition as at 27 September 2012.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The complex is highly intact. The loose extendable nature of the original planning of the College purposefully anticipated the need for future additional residential rooms and teaching facilities, particularly the planning of the eastern and western wings.   One of the few alterations made to the original construction, is the alteration to the sunken courtyard to the East of the Chapel, whereby the original open pavement with ground covers providing margins to the brick pavers has been replaced by a homogeneous brick pavement.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The vision for the buildings was to mature with age and merge with the landscape. The selection of materials, such as hardwood timbers and facebrick, and the design of the buildings that incorporates large roof [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]], colonnades and deeply recessed openings, provides a high degree of weather protection.  The complex has proven to be durable and extremely low maintenance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

Tocal College - C. B. Alexander Campus represents the historical shift in institutional architecture from one dominated by international modernist trends to one that was more locally based in its ideology.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The architecture of Tocal College applies the design characteristics of the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional or Sydney School on an institutional scale. Expressive structural use of robust and enduring materials seamlessly integrated within its landscape setting was a groundbreaking approach to institutional design. The application of these design principles, previously only domestically applied, was to be influential in the history of Australian architecture. These principles established a new architectural approach which rivalled the prevailing institutional architecture which was based in international modernism. The locally based approach through choice of vernacular materials and forms, (such as the language of the Tocal barn) and the environmentally sensitive response to location is credited with being a truly Australian architecture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The architects of the College, Philip Cox and Ian Mackay, are highly regarded in the architectural profession and the College was an important accomplishment early in their respective careers.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

In 1965 Tocal College received the Australian Institute of Architects highest honour, the Sulman Medal , and  today is held in very high esteem by the architectural profession for its cultural value as a seminal work of architecture that played a significant role in the direction of Australian architectural practice in the latter half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

Tocal College is an outstanding example of the Sydney School style of architecture as applied on an institutional scale.
Tocal College is historically significant for its association with Tocal Homestead and Tocal Farm which is one of the oldest colonial properties in the [[Hunter Region]] and played a significant role in the history of agriculture in New South Wales. Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus continues to play a part in the agricultural history of the state by providing agricultural education.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The movable collection was designed to complement the design of the College and contributes to its integrity. The tapestry is a significant art work by renowned Australian textile artist Margaret Grafton and is integral to the aesthetic significance of the chapel interior.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 17 April 2013 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is located on the lands of the Tocal estate; Tocal Homestead is one of the oldest colonial homesteads in the Hunter Region and played an important role in the development of agriculture over the last 150 years. (Desgrand) Tocal is historically significant as the legacy of Charles Boyd Alexander of the Alexander family, owners of Tocal estate in the 20th century. Tocal College continues the agricultural tradition through provision of agricultural education.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus represents the historical shift in institutional architecture from one dominated by European Modernist trends to one that was more locally based in its ideology. The College design successfully adapted a previously vernacular approach to a large scale project which was a groundbreaking approach for its time. The high level of craftsmanship, the use of robust and enduring materials applied to  institutional buildings was a methodology which was to be influential in the history of Australian architecture. The esteem with which the architecture profession regarded the building was reflected in the award of the prestigious Sir John Sulman Medal in 1965.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

The Chapel's tapestry was the first Australian tapestry to be commissioned by an architect for a site specific project and was instrumental in establishing the incorporation of art works into large scale projects as common practise.  (Desgrand)&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is of significance as an important work in the career of one of the most eminent Australian architects, Philip Cox, who played a significant role in Australia's cultural history and the establishment of the notable architectural firm, the Cox Group which is recognised nationally &amp; internationally for its innovative work. The College marks the commencement of Cox's extensive architectural career.(Desgrand)
The College is also of significance as an important work in the career of Ian McKay, confirming his reputation for acute environmental sensitivity and his flexibility and inventiveness in design.  The design of the College provided an opportunity to synthesize the influences of Frank Lloyd Wright and traditional Japanese architecture evident in his earlier works to create a highly successful vigorous large scale work.(Desgrand)
Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is also associated with Leppington Boys Home ([[St Andrews, New South Wales|St Andrews]] Agricultural College) which was built prior to Tocal and was instrumental in enabling the C.B. Alexander bequest to be endowed to Tocal College. The college at Leppington was awarded the Sulman Medal in 1963 and the building was an architectural precursor to the college at Tocal.
Tocal College is associated with Edward Alan Hunt solicitor and Mayor of [[Parramatta]] who was the founder of the College and its first Chairman.
Australian artist Margaret Grafton, designed the tapestry in the chapel and went on to become a highly regarded Australian artist.
The College is associated with Charles Boyd Alexander, who is noted for the  introduction of twentieth century mechanised farming practises to Tocal, and who bequeathed Tocal and other property and assets to be used for the training of Protestant children for agricultural careers. (Desgrand)
The College has a minor association with Sir Robert Menzies who officiated at the opening in 1965.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is of State significance as an exemplary work of architecture that played an important role in the direction of architecture in Australia.
The design of the College demonstrates an unprecedented appreciation of the Australian rural vernacular in its use of bold simple forms, its rigorous expressive use of timber structure and the exploitation of hand crafted timber for its textural qualities.(Desgrand)
Whilst the emphasis on structural expression to render space is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture and gothic Europe, the work at Tocal was the first major exploration of structural expressionism incorporating an inventive use of locally sourced materials and a high level of craftsmanship derived from local rural traditions previously only associated with the rural vernacular tradition.(Desgrand)
The principles demonstrated in the design of the College epitomize the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style or "Sydney School" as it became known, including its loose extendable planning, the integration of the built form with the landscape, the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, and the emphasis on passive climate control.  In the application of these principles to a large scale institutional college, it was instrumental in establishing a new approach to rival the prevailing international modernist institutional architecture of its time. (Desgrand)
Architects Phillip Cox and Ian MacKay's uniquely Australian response to materials and location and is credited with being the beginnings of a truly Australian architecture. Notable architectural historian, J.M.Freeland, attributes Tocal College with bringing the "thoroughly and distinctly Australian" style into prominence.
The movable collection is aesthetically significant as it was specifically designed by the architects to complement the architecture of the College. In particular the chapel tapestry is a significant aesthetic element of the chapel interior.
The open sparsely-treed dry landscape is significant in its aesthetic role in defining the spatial arrangement of campus buildings. The open landscape between the college main quadrangle and the Tocal Homestead is also a significant aspect of the setting of the College and was a determining factor in the choice of location of the College and its orientation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campus is held in very high esteem by the architectural profession for its cultural value as a seminal work of architecture that played a significant role in the direction of Australian architectural practice in the latter half of the twentieth century. This is evidenced through numerous publications which demonstrate the high esteem of the profession for example: in the 60th Anniversary issue of the Architecture Bulletin November/December 2004, the building was nominated as the "Building of the Decade" for the 1960s (Degrand) and the DOCOMOMO survey of modernist buildings included Tocal College in their priority list of 20 buildings.
Graduates of C.B. Alexander Campus and the local community also have a special association with the place as evidenced by the popularity of the College open days.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Does not satisfy this criterion at a State level.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Does not satisfy this criterion at a State level.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1908/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

Tocal College - C.B. Alexander Campusis an outstanding example of the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional (Sydney School) style of architecture as applied on an institutional scale. The principles commonly demonstrated by the Sydney School including; the application of craftsmanship, the emphasis on clarity of structural expression, the use of locally derived forms and locally sourced materials, passive climate control, and loose extendable planning and the integration of the built form with the landscape, were an anathema to the prevailing modernist, international, institutional architecture of its time.

{{Christianity and gender|society}}

'''Women in Church history''' have played a variety of roles in the life of Christianity - notably as contemplatives, health care givers, educationalists and missionaries. Until recent times, women were generally excluded from episcopal and clerical positions within the Christian churches, however great numbers of women have been influential in the life of the church - from contemporaries of Jesus, to subsequent saints, theologians, [[doctors of the church]], missionaries, abbesses, nuns, mystics, founders of [[religious institute]]s, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs. 

[[Christianity]] emerged from [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] societies that placed men in positions of authority in marriage, society and government, and, whilst the religion restricted membership of the priesthood to males only, in its early centuries it offered women an enhanced social status and quickly found a wide following among women. In most denominations, women have been the majority of church attendees since early in the Christian era and into the present.&lt;ref&gt;David Murrow (2005, 2011), Why Men Hate Going to Church. Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson. {{ISBN|978-0785232155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as religious sisters and nuns, women came to play an important role in Christianity through convents and abbeys and have continued through history to be active - particularly in the establishment of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and monastic settlements. Women constitute the great majority of members of the [[consecrated life]] within the Catholic Church, the largest of the Christian churches. In recent decades, [[ordination of women]] has become increasingly common in some Protestant churches. [[laity|Laywomen]] have also been highly active in the wider life of churches, supporting the community work of parishes. 

Within [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], a particular place of veneration has been reserved for Mary, the Mother of Jesus, which has kept a model of maternal virtue central to their vision of Christianity. [[Marian devotion]] is however, generally not a feature of Protestantism.

===New Testament===
[[File:Cristo en casa de Marta y María, by Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Velázquez)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']], [[Diego Velázquez]], 1618. This Gospel episode suggests that Jesus broke with the conventions of his age and provided religious instruction to women.]]

The [[New Testament]] of the Bible refers to a number of women in Jesus' inner circle (notably his mother [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], for whom the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy hold a special place of honour, and St. [[Mary Magdalene]], who discovered the empty tomb of Christ), although the Catholic Church teaches that Christ appointed only male [[Apostles]] (from the Greek apostello "to send forth").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm Coppieters, Honoré. "Apostles." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wüger Kreuzigung.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Magdalene]] kneeling within a [[Stabat Mater (art)|Stabat Mater scene]] by [[Gabriel Wuger]], 1868.]]

Among the most famous accounts of Jesus directly dealing with an issue of morality and women is provided by the story of [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery]],  from [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|7:53-8:11}} in the [[Gospel of John]]. The passage describes a confrontation between [[Jesus]] and the [[scribe]]s and [[Pharisees]] over whether a woman, caught in an act of [[adultery]], ought to be [[stoning|stoned]]. Jesus shames the crowd into dispersing, and averts the execution with the famous words: "He that is without sin among you, let him [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|first cast a stone at her]]". According to the passage, "they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last", leaving Jesus to turn to the woman and say "go, and sin no more".

Another story contained in the Gospels concerning Jesus' attitude to women is the story of Jesus at the house of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. In this story Mary sits at Jesus' feet as he preaches, while Martha toils in the kitchen preparing a meal. When Martha complains to Mary that she should instead be helping in the kitchen, Jesus says that, on the contrary, "Mary has chosen what is better" ({{Bibleverse||Luke|10:38-42|NIV}}, [[New International Version]]).

From the very beginning of the early Christian church, women were important members of the movement, although much of the information in the New Testament on the work of women has been overlooked.&lt;ref name="MacHaffie"&gt;MacHaffie, Barbara J. ''Her story: women in Christian tradition.'' Fortress Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-8006-3826-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since sources of information stemming from the New Testament church was written and interpreted by men, many assumed that it had been a "man's church". Recently, scholars have begun looking in mosaics, frescoes, and inscriptions of that period for information about women's roles in the early church.&lt;ref name="MacHaffie" /&gt;

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that women were more influential during the period of Jesus' brief ministry than they were in the next thousand years of Christianity. Blainey points to several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to women: his meeting with the [[Samaritan woman at the well]], his [[anointing of Jesus|anointing]] by [[Mary of Bethany]], his public admiration for a poor widow who [[Lesson of the widow's mite|donated some copper coins to the Temple in Jerusalem]], his stepping to the aid of the woman accused of adultery, and the presence of Mary Magdalene at his side as he was crucified. Blainey concludes that "as the standing of women was not high in Palestine, Jesus' kindnesses towards them were not always approved by those who strictly upheld tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, Geoffrey. ''A Short History of Christianity'', Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

There were women disciples present at Jesus' crucifixion. Women were reported to be the first witnesses to the resurrection, chief among them again [[Mary Magdalene]]. She was not only "witness," but also called a "messenger" of the risen Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Maisch, Ingrid. tr. by Linda M. Maloney. Collegeville MN: Liturgical Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8146-2471-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assemblies in the homes of believers===
As time went on, groups of Christians organized within the homes of believers. Those who could offer their home for meetings were considered important within the movement and assumed leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Margaret. "Reading Real Women Through Undisputed Letters of Paul" in Women and Christian Origins, ed. by Ross Sheppard Kraemer and Mary Rose D'Angelo (Oxford: University Press, 1999), 204&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament Gospels acknowledge that women were among Jesus' earliest followers. Jewish women disciples, including [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Saint Joanna]], and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|8:1-3}} Although the details of these gospel stories may be questioned, in general they reflect the prominent historical roles women played in Jesus' ministry as disciples.

===Early spread of Christianity===
{{See also|Early Christianity#Women}}
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''Paul Writing His Epistles'', (16th-century depiction). There is much debate about [[St Paul]]'s attitude to women in the church, however his early letter to the Galatians defied prevailing culture and offered a vision of gender equality: "there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Jesus Christ".]]

Historian Geoffrey Blainey writes that women probably comprised the majority in early Christian congregations.{{sfn|Blainey 2011}} This large female membership likely stemmed in part from the early church's informal and flexible organization offering significant roles to women. Another factor is that there appeared to be no division between clergy and laity. Leadership was shared among male and female members according to their "gifts" and talents. "But even more important than church organization was the way in which the Gospel tradition and the Gospels themselves, along with the writing of Paul, could be interpreted as moving women beyond silence and subordination."{{sfn|MacHaffie p.4}} Women may also have been driven from Judaism to Christianity through the taboos and rituals related to the menstrual cycle, and a society preference for male over female children.&lt;ref name=Sawyer96&gt;Sawyer, Deborah F. Women and Religion in the First Christian Centuries. Vol. 1. London: Psychology, 1996. Print. Religion in the First Christian Centuries.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Short History of Christianity'', Geoffrey Blainey wrote that the early Christians were "sympathetic to women":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas neither the Jewish, nor the Roman family would warm the hearts of a modern feminist, the early Christians were sympathetic to women. [[Saint Paul|Paul]] himself insisted in his early writings that men and women were equal. His letter to the Galatians was emphatic in defying the prevailing culture, and his words must have been astonishing to women encountering Christian ideas for the first time: 'there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Jesus Christ'. Women shared equally in what is called the Lord's Supper or Eucharist, a high affirmation of equality.{{sfn|Blainey 2011, p.41}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Blainey goes on to note that "the debate about Paul's attitude to women will go on and on", for in later letters ascribed to Paul, it is written "let your women keep silence in the churches", although elsewhere Paul lays down rules for women for prayer and prophesying during religious services.

The early Christian texts refer to various women activists in the early church. One such woman was [[Priscilla and Aquila|St. Priscilla]], a Jewish missionary from Rome, who may have helped found the Christian community at Corinth. She traveled as a missionary with her husband and St Paul, and tutored the Jewish intellectual [[Apollos]]. Others include the four daughters of [[Philip the Evangelist]], from Caesarea, Palestine, who were said to be prophets and to have hosted St Paul in their home. However, some people, including the author of Acts, did not see women as true missionaries or leaders in their own right even though they did perform good acts in the community.&lt;ref name=EEC&gt;Ferguson, Everett. Encyclopedia of Early Christianity. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. N.p.: Taylor and Francis, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Widows for example were recognized as a group in society but were not admitted into the clerical rank. While women did have roles in early Christianity, as Christianity became formalized with sacraments and hierarchization or church office, women’s earlier public roles were restricted and regulated.&lt;ref name=EEC/&gt;

===Debatably Equal Partnership Between Men and Women===
Men and women in marriage have an equal partnership in the early church. In the bible, there are many quotes that explore this equality. One authentic Christian tradition is "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord" while "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it".&lt;ref name=EcumenicalReview&gt;"The Ecumenical Review." Seminars on Orthodox Spirituality and Role of Women in the Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are women supposed to love and put forth effort in a marriage, men are too. This equality gives a supportive base to marriage. Another quote from the bible is that “we are all one in Jesus Christ”.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 3:28&lt;/ref&gt; In the time of early Christianity it was a new concept that was being practiced and preached. The oneness of humankind between male and female was a defining feature of this new religion. As stated before, women were given equality by adding the title of deaconess. This tradition continued until the 15th century, and still persists in some women’s monasteries among the eastern churches. In Christian orthodoxy, the function of the two sexes is genuine (have equal roles) and seen as a mutual fellowship. Both men and women are to offer love and sacrifice, according to Jesus Christ. An orthodox text states that an Orthodox woman should not feel inferior to men simply because she cannot stand in front of the holy altar, for everything in the church is a result of cooperation.&lt;ref name=EcumenicalReview/&gt; The equality between the sexes in the Christian church gives women more power and does not limit their potential. While some positions were not allowed for women, they still were able to get involved with the church. The equal partnership between men and women is not only seen in the religious aspect of Christianity but also in the social and home life.

==Patristic age==
{{Main article|Women in the patristic age}}

[[File:Mary of egypt2.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Icon]] of the 5th-century hermit saint, [[Mary of Egypt]], surrounded by scenes from her life (17th century, [[Beliy Gorod]]).]]

During the early centuries of Christianity, there is evidence of a great deal of activity by women in the life of congregations. Women served as [[deacons]] and ladies of means like Lydia of Philippi acted as financiers. Women probably constituted the majority of Christians. Blainey notes that by around AD 300, women had become so influential in the affairs of the church that the pagan philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] "complained that Christianity had suffered because of them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Christianity|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4422-2589-3|location=Maryland|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by the close of the Patristic era, a male hierarchy had established itself over church affairs, with priests and bishops running the congregations.{{sfn|Blainey 2011}}

===Ministry restricted to men===
From the early [[patristics|patristic age]], the offices of teacher and [[sacraments|sacramental]] minister were reserved for men throughout most of the church in the East and West.&lt;ref name="Weinrich"&gt;{{Citation|author=William Weinrich|contribution=Women in the History of the Church|title=Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood|editor=John Piper and Wayne Grudem |publisher=Crossway 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church Fathers on the role of women===
[[Origen]] (AD 185-254) stated that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if it is granted to a woman to show the sign of prophecy, she is nevertheless not permitted to speak in an assembly. When Miriam the prophetess spoke, she was leading a choir of women ... For [as Paul declares] "I do not permit a woman to teach," and even less "to tell a man what to do."&lt;ref&gt;Origen, Fragmenta ex commentariis in epistulam i ad Corinthios&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Philip Schaff]] records early church fathers of the 3rd and 4th centuries as teaching, regarding 1 Cor. 14: 34,35,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Tertullian]], the second-century Latin father, wrote that "It is not permitted to a woman to speak in church. Neither may she teach, baptize, offer, nor claim for herself any function proper to a man, least of all the sacerdotal office." ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.iv.i.html "On the Veiling of Virgins"]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Women saints===
[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine]]
Women commemorated as saints from these early centuries include several martyrs who suffered under the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]], such as [[Agnes of Rome]], [[Saint Cecilia]], [[Agatha of Sicily]] and [[Blandina]]. In late Antiquity, [[Helena (Empress)|Saint Helena]] was a Christian and consort of [[Constantius Chlorus|Emperor Constantius]], and the mother of [[Emperor Constantine I]]. As such her role in history is of great significance as her son Constantine legalised Christianity across the Roman Empire, and became a convert himself - ending centuries of mistreatment of Christians. Similarly, [[Saint Monica]] was a pious Christian and mother of [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]], who after a wayward youth, converted to Christianity and became one of the most influential Christian Theologians of all history.

Other women contributed to the development of early [[Christian monasticism]], seeking redemption in the wilderness, as with the [[hermit]] Saint [[Mary of Egypt]] (c.AD 344-421) who is venerated in Western, Eastern, Oriental and African Christianity, for entering a life of penitence and prayer in the deserts beyond the Jordan River, after arriving from Egypt as a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09763a.htm MacRory, Joseph. "St. Mary of Egypt." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle ages ==
{{Main article|Women in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Vladimirskaya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Our Lady of Vladimir]], one of the holiest medieval representations of the [[Theotokos]].]]

As Western Europe transitioned from the Classical to Medieval Age, the male hierarchy with the Pope as its summit became a central player in European politics, however many women leaders also emerged at various levels within the Church. In the East, a similar male hierarchy prevailed around the Patriarch at Constantinople. However, women rose to play an active role in religion after the [[Fall of Rome]]: mysticism flourished and monastic convents and communities of women became powerful institutions within Europe. [[Marian devotion]] blossomed, setting a model of maternal virtue at the heart of Western civilization.

In the West, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was the major unifying cultural influence in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]] with its selection from Latin learning, preservation of the art of writing, and a centralized administration through its network of [[bishops]]. In the East, that role fell to the Orthodox Church and [[Byzantine Empire]] (the churches split in 1054). In the Roman Catholic|Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the priesthood and the ministries dependent upon it such as [[Bishop]], [[Patriarch]] and [[Pope]], were restricted to men. The [[first Council of Orange]] (441) forbade the ordination of women to the diaconate.&lt;ref name="Weinrich"/&gt;

With the establishment of [[Christian monasticism]], other influential roles became available to women. From the 5th century onward, Christian [[convent]]s provided an alternative for some women to the path of marriage and child-rearing and allowed them to acquire literacy and learning, and play a more active religious role. While non-aristocratic women were in many respects excluded from political and mercantile life in the Middle Ages, leading churchwomen were an exception. Medieval abbesses and female superiors of monastic houses were powerful figures whose influence could rival that of male bishops and abbots: "They treated with kings, bishops, and the greatest lords on terms of perfect equality;. . . they were present at all great religious and national solemnities, at the dedication of churches, and even, like the queens, took part in the deliberation of the national assemblies...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01007e.htm Montalembert, "The Monks of the West," Bk. XV., cited in Oestereich, Thomas. "Abbess." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

A major spokesman for the Church in the [[High Middle Ages]] (11th through 13th centuries) was [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref name="Aquinas"&gt;Aquinas, Thomas. ''St. Thomas Aquinas on Politics and Ethics.'' Ed. &amp; Trans. Paul E. Sigmund. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; one of the 33 [[Doctors of the Church|Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church]] and renowned 13th-century theologian.

===Virgin Mary and female saints===
[[File:Notre Dame de Paris by night time.jpg|350px|thumb|left|[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], Paris, is one of many important cathedrals named in honour of [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], the mother of Jesus.]]

Geoffrey Blainey, writes that women were more prominent in the life of the Church during the Middle Ages than at any previous time in its history, with a number of church reforms initiated by women. Blainey cites the ever growing veneration of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene as evidence of a high standing for female Christians at that time. Irish [[hagiography]] records that, as Europe was entering the Medieval Age, the abbess St. [[Brigit of Kildare]] was founding monasteries across Ireland. The Celtic Church played an important role in restoring Christianity to Western Europe following the [[Fall of Rome]], due in part to the work of nuns like Brigid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02784b.htm Grattan-Flood, William. "St. Brigid of Ireland." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Catherine. San Domenico.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Doctor of the Church]] St. [[Catherine of Siena]] was an influential 14th-century theologian who worked to bring the [[Avignon Papacy]] back to Rome.]]

The Virgin Mary became increasingly important to Christian worship through the Middle Ages. She was conferred such titles as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven. Mary Magdalene's Feast Day was celebrated in earnest from the 8th century on and composite portraits of her developed from Gospel references to other women Jesus met.{{sfn|Blainey 2011, pp 155-159}}

The art historian [[Kenneth Clarke]] wrote that, if art is taken as a guide, then only from the 12th century did the cult of the Virgin come to appeal to the popular imagination in the West. The great Cathedrals of France were dedicated to her: [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]], [[Laon Cathedral|Laon]], [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Rheims]]. [[Chartres Cathedral]] in particular honoured Mary with the elaborate splendour of its architecture. St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] preached of her as an ideal of beauty and mediator between humanity and God.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Clarke 1969"&gt;Clarke, Kenneth. ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Clare of Assisi]] was one of the first followers of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. She founded the [[Order of Poor Ladies]], a contemplative [[Monasticism|monastic]] [[religious order]] for women in the [[Franciscan]] tradition, and wrote their Rule of Life—the first monastic rule known to have been written by a woman. Following her death, the order she founded was named in her honor the Order of Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the [[Poor Clares]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12251b.htm O'Hara, Edwin. "Poor Clares." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[Catherine of Siena]] (1347–1380) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] tertiary and mystic of considerable influence who was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the church#Catholicism|Doctor of the Church]] in 1970. Considered by her contemporaries to have high levels of spiritual insight, she worked with the sick and poor, experienced "visions", gathered disciples and participated in the highest levels of public life through letters to the princes of Italy, consultations with papal legates and by acting as a diplomat negotiating between the city states of Italy. She counseled for reform of the clergy and was influential in convincing Pope Gregory XI to leave Avignon and restore the [[Holy See]] to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm Gardner, Edmund. "St. Catherine of Siena." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Monastic orders came to include key Catholic figures such as [[Doctor of the Church]] [[Teresa of Ávila]], whose influence on practices such as [[Christian meditation]] continues to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egan|first=Harvey D.|title=An Anthology of Christian Mysticism|year=1991|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-6012-6|page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Rowan.

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|upright|St. Joan of Arc]]
Arguably the most famous female Catholic Saint of the period is St. [[Joan of Arc]]. Considered a national [[heroine]] of France, she began life as a pious peasant girl. As with other saints of the period, Joan is said to have experienced supernatural dialogues which gave her spiritual insight and directed her actions - but unlike typical heroines of the period, she donned male attire and, claiming divine guidance, sought out the King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] of France to offer help in a military campaign against the English. Taking up a sword, she achieved military victories, before being captured. Her English captors and their Burgundian allies then arranged for her to be tried as a "witch and heretic", after which she was [[burned at the stake]]. A papal inquiry later declared the trial illegal. A hero to the French, sympathy grew for Joan even in England and in 1909 she was canonised a saint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08409c.htm Thurston, Herbert. "St. Joan of Arc."

==Monarchs from the Middle Ages to Post-Reformation==
[[File:St Olga by Nesterov in 1892.jpg|thumb|left|upright|St Olga of Kiev]]

A network of European monarchies established power throughout Western Europe through the Medieval period. Men were generally given precedence to reign as monarch, however aristocratic women could achieve influence. A number of such women were singled out as model Christians by Pope John Paul II in his [[Mulieris Dignitatem]] letter on the dignity and vocation of women: [[Olga of Kiev]], [[Matilda of Tuscany]], [[Hedwig of Silesia]], [[Jadwiga of Poland]] and [[Elizabeth of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_15081988_mulieris-dignitatem_en.html Pope John Paul II, ''Mulieris Dignitatem'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, August 15, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Russian ruler to convert to Christianity was [[Olga of Kiev]] around 950AD. She is an important figure in the spread of Christianity to Russia and commemorated by both the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Italian noblewoman Matilda of Tuscany (1046–1115) is remembered for her military accomplishments and for being the principal Italian supporter of [[Pope Gregory VII]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Saint Hedwig of Silesia (1174–1243) supported the poor and the church in Eastern Europe and Jadwiga of Poland reigned as monarch of Poland and, within the Catholic Church, is honoured as the patron saint of queens and of a "united Europe". Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1207–1231) was a symbol of Christian charity who used her wealth to establish hospitals and care for the poor.

[[File:Jadwiga by Bacciarelli.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint [[Jadwiga of Poland]] is the patron saint of queens n the Catholic Church.]]
As sponsor of [[Christopher Columbus]]' 1492 mission to cross the Atlantic, the Spanish [[Queen Isabella I]] of Castille (known as ''Isabella the Catholic''), was an important figure in the growth of Catholicism as a global religion. Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon had ensured the unity of the Spanish Kingdom and the royal couple held equal authority. The Catholic Monarchs then conquered the last Moorish bastion in Spain at [[Granada]] in January 1492 and seven months later, Columbus sailed for the Americas. The Catholic encyclopedia, credits Isabella as an extremely able ruler and one who "fostered learning not only in the universities and among the nobles, but also among women". Of Isabella and Ferdinand, it says: "The good government of the Catholic sovereigns brought the prosperity of Spain to its apogee, and inaugurated that country's Golden Age".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08177a.htm Amadó, Ramón Ruiz. "Isabella I." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Oct. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Queen Elizabeth I]]
[[The Reformation]] swept through Europe during the 16th Century, ending centuries of unity among Western [[Christendom]] and bringing [[Protestantism]] into being as both a political and religious opponent of [[Catholicism]]. The refusal of Pope [[Clement VI]] to grant an annulment in the marriage of [[King Henry VIII]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] saw [[English Reformation|Henry establish himself as supreme governor]] of the church in England. [[Mary I of England]], was his eldest daughter and succeeded the throne after the death of her Protestant younger half brother [[Edward VI]]. Mary was the daughter of Catherine of Aragon, and thus remained loyal to Rome and sought to restore the Roman Church in England. Her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed after her death in 1558 by her successor and younger half-sister, [[Elizabeth I]]. Rivalry emerged between Elizabeth and the Catholic [[Mary Queen of Scots]], finally settled with the execution of Mary in 1587. The religion of an heir or monarch's spouse complicated intermarriage between royal houses through coming centuries.

Consorts of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s were given the title of [[Holy Roman Empress]]. The throne was reserved for males, though women such as [[Theophanu]] and [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], controlled the power and served as de facto Empresses regnant. The powerful Maria Theresa acquired her right to the throne of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] by means of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], allowing for female succession - but had to fight the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] to secure her right to reign. Following victories, her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], was chosen as Holy Roman Emperor in 1745, confirming Maria Theresa's status as a European leader. A liberal-minded autocrat, she was a patron of sciences and education and sought to alleviate the suffering of the serfs. On religion she pursued a policy of [[cujus regio, ejus religio]], keeping Catholic observance at court and frowning on Judaism and Protestantism - but the ascent of her son as co-regnant Emperor saw restrictions placed on the power of the Church in the Empire. She reigned for 40 years, and had 16 children including [[Marie-Antoinette]], the ill-fated Queen of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09662d.htm Löffler, Klemens. "Maria Theresa."

The [[Protestant Reformation]], closed convents and effectively closed off the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women, as well as one which had provided some women a life in academic study.&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=3241 Allen, Charlotte. "The Holy Feminine." Journal of Religion, Culture, and Public Life, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] himself taught that "the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability of administering those affairs that are outside and concern the state…."&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin. ''Lectures on Genesis 3:11.''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many nuns who abandoned the monastic life was the wife of Martin Luther, [[Katherine von Bora]]. [[John Calvin]] agreed that "the woman's place is in the home."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.covenanter.org/JCalvin/titussermons/srmtts11.htm Calvin, John. "A Sermon of M. Iohn Caluine upon the ''Epistle of Saint Paul, to Titus.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Protestant churches upheld the traditional position,&lt;ref&gt;Chrysostom, John. ''The homilies: Of S. John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople, on the first epistle of St. Paul the apostle to the Corinthians (''[[Library of Fathers of the holy Catholic church]]''). Volume 2. Pub: F. and J. Rivington (1845) Web: 17 Jan 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?output=html&amp;id=G8QUAAAAQAAJ&amp;jtp=521]&lt;/ref&gt; and restricted ruling and preaching roles within the Church to men until the 20th century, although there were early exceptions among some groups such as the [[Quakers]] and within some [[Pentecostal]] [[holiness movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Discovering Biblical Equality (2nd ed. 2005)|author=Pierce and Groothuis|publisher=Downer's Grove, IVP|pages=36–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Knox]] (1510–1572) also denied women the right to rule in the civic sphere, as he asserted in his famous [[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women|First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]].

[[Baptist]] theologian Dr. [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] (1690–1771) comments on 1 Corinthians 14:34,35, stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Gen_3:16, "thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee". By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men. The extraordinary instances of Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, must not be drawn into a rule or example in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/1-corinthians-14-34.html Gill, 1 Corinthians 14:34]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Methodist founder [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and Methodist theologian [[Adam Clarke]] (1762–1832) both upheld male headship, but allowed that spiritual Christian women could publicly speak in church meetings if they "are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit" (Wesley),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godrules.net/library/wesley/wesley1cor14.htm], John Wesley's notes on the Bible, 1 Cor. 14:34,35&lt;/ref&gt; and that such were to obey that influence, and that "the apostle lays down directions in chap. 11 for regulating her personal appearance when thus employed.”  (Clarke)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godrules.net/library/clarke/clarke1cor14.htm Adam Clarke's commentary on the whole Bible], 1 Cor. 14:34,35&lt;/ref&gt;  Puritan theologian [[Matthew Poole]] (1624–1679) concurred with Wesley, adding, "But setting aside that extraordinary case of a special afflatus, [strong Divine influence] it was, doubtless, unlawful for a woman to speak in the church."&lt;ref&gt;Poole, ''Annotations upon the Holy Bible''  (1852)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Henry]] (1662–1714) in his commentary, entertains allowing “praying, and uttering hymns inspired” by women, as such “were not teaching”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.searchgodsword.org/com/mhc-com/view.cgi?book=1co&amp;chapter=014&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Very Short History of the World'', Geoffrey Blainey wrote that, in removing the institution of the convent, the Reformation at first indirectly reduced the power of women, for convents had been places where women could achieve power and influence, as in Zurich where the Benedictine abbesses had helped administer the town. However, the Protestant belief that all people should be able to read the Bible, wrote Blainey, led to an increase in female literacy, as a result of the opening of new schools, and the introduction of compulsory education for boys and girls in places like Lutheran Prussia beginning in 1717.&lt;ref name=Geoff&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin; 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned edit.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's Pietà]]

A general tenet of the Protestant reformers was that [[Marian devotion]] and the 'cult of Mary"  and the "cult of saints" should be rejected. Thus, in the communities of Europe and North America that adopted Protestantism, the centuries-old rituals and theology associated with Mary and formal sainthood that had been built up by the Catholic tradition were largely expunged in the aftermath of the Reformation. Apart from convents being closed, images of Mary were in many cases torn down or decapitated.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Clarke 1969"/&gt;

The Catholic Church meanwhile, responded to the [[Protestant Reformation]] with the [[Counter Reformation]], in which exuberant [[baroque architecture]] and art was embraced as an affirmation of the faith and new seminaries and orders were established to lead missions to far off lands&lt;ref name=Geoff/&gt; The importance of Marian devotion within Catholic life was kept firmly in place.  Thus a new divide had arisen in Christianity: on the one hand Catholicism and Orthodoxy maintained Mary's place in Christian art and ritual; while on the other side, the new Protestant churches greatly reduced her significance.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Clarke 1969"/&gt;

Renaissance and Baroque art produced new depictions of women in Christian art. According to Kenneth Clarke, while Mary had been in the Middle Ages "the supreme protectress of civilization" who had "taught a race of tough and ruthless barbarians the virtues of tenderness and compassion", during the Renaissance, Mary "became also the human mother in whom everyone could recognise qualities of warmth and love and approachability". These human qualities were presented by Catholic artists like Raphael, in his [[Madonna and Child]] portraits representing Mary with the infant Jesus, and [[Michelangelo]] in his [[pieta]] statue, depicting Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus following his crucifixion. During the Baroque period, religious depictions of women in Catholic Europe became not only exuberant, but often highly sensual, as with the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].&lt;ref name="Kenneth Clarke 1969"/&gt;

== Modern times ==
[[File:Gibson and Mother Marianne Cope.jpg|thumb|left|Catholic Sisters and the leper children of Hawaii in 1886. Catholic women played a central role in the developing or running of many the modern world's education and health care systems.]]

Amidst the backdrop of [[Industrial Revolution]] and expanding European Empires, a number of notable educational and nursing [[religious institute]]s were established by or for Catholic women during the 17th-19th centuries; Christian women played a central role in the developing or running of many the modern world's education and health care systems. Out of other Christian traditions arose women like [[Florence Nightingale]], who assisted with the development of modern nursing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/REnightingale.htm "Florence Nightingale"]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 21st century, several Protestant churches were ordaining women, but Christianity's heartlands were shifting away from Europe, and while vocations to the religious life were in decline in the West, conversions to Christianity and religious vocations were expanding rapidly in Africa and Asia.

[[File:Florence Nightingale CDV by H Lenthall.jpg|thumb|upright|Anglican and nurse, [[Florence Nightingale]] is widely credited with aiding the development of modern nursing.]]

Within Catholicism, the [[Sisters of Mercy]] was founded by [[Catherine McAuley]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1831, and her nuns went on to establish hospitals and schools across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10199a.htm Austin, Mary Stanislas.

The [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] was founded in the mid-19th century by Saint [[Jeanne Jugan]] near Rennes, France, to care for the many impoverished elderly who lined the streets of French towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12248a.htm Kelly, Blanche Mary.

Many Christian women were instrumental in the movement for [[women's suffrage]] which achieved its first successes in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century and spread across the democratic world. In the United States, the [[Quaker]] [[Grimké sisters]] were early advocates of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/slavery-and-anti-slavery/essays/angelina-and-sarah-grimke-abolitionist-sisters&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher [[Catherine Helen Spence]] led calls for women's suffrage, and ran for political office after the [[South Australian Parliament]] became the first modern jurisdiction to allow women to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/spence-catherine-helen-4627 Eade, Susan. "Spence, Catherine Helen (1825–1910)", ''Australian Dictionary of biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, organizations like the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] agitated for the same reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/national-council-of-women-of-canada National Council of Women of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the early twentieth century, Catholic women continued to join religious institutes in large numbers, where their influence and control was particularly strong in the running of primary education for children, high schooling for girls, and in nursing, hospitals, orphanages and aged care facilities.  The [[Second Vatican Council]] of the 1960s liberalised the strictures of Catholic religious life, particularly for women [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]]; however, in the latter half of the 20th century, vocations for women in the West entered a steep decline.

A number of beatifications and canonisations took place of Catholic women from all over the world: St. [[Josephine Bakhita]] was a Sudanese slave girl who became a [[Canossians|Canossian nun]]; St. [[Katharine Drexel]] (1858–1955) worked for Native and African Americans; Polish mystic St. [[Maria Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938) wrote her influential spiritual diary;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/newsletters/wst/ap0407.asp Morneau, Robert.

A number of Christian women are recalled as martyrs of the Second World War struggle against Nazism. Catholic Poland suffered under Nazi occupation, and a number of women are recognised for their heroism during the period: including 8 religious sisters and several laywomen of Poland's [[108 Martyrs of World War II]] and the 11 [[Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth]] murdered by the Gestapo in 1943 and known as the [[Blessed Martyrs of Nowogródek]]. Swedish born [[Elisabeth Hesselblad]]  was listed among the “[[List of Righteous among the Nations by country|righteous among the nations]]” by [[Yad Vashem]] for her religious institute's work assisting Jews escape [[The Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2010/07/08/niece-astonished-as-cause-of-sister-katherine-advances/ Caldwell, Simon. "Niece astonished as Cause of Sister Katherine advances", ''Catholic Herald'', July 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; She and two British women, Mother Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough and Sister Katherine Flanagan have been beatified for reviving the Swedish Bridgettine Order of nuns and hiding scores of Jewish families in their convent during Rome's period of occupation under the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|title=British Nuns ...

In modern times, after the [[Second Vatican Council]], four Catholic women have been declared [[Doctors of the Church]], indicating a re-appraisal of the role of women within the life of that Church: the 16th-century Spanish mystic [[St. Teresa of Ávila]], the 14th Century Italian mystic [[St. Catherine of Siena]], the 19th-century French nun [[St. Thérèse de Lisieux]] (called ''Doctor Amoris'' or Doctor of Love), and the 12th-century German nun [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]].

While Catholicism and Orthodoxy adhered to traditional gender restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, [[ordination of women in Protestant churches]] has in recent decades become increasingly common. As of 1996, over half of all American Protestant denominations ordain women,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FL6x77emSwYC&amp;q=%22american+protestant+denominations%22+%22ordain+women%22&amp;dq=%22american+protestant+denominations%22+%22ordain+women%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VhBcTLWoEIP68AalwtC9Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFgQ6wEwBg Hess, Beth B.; Markson, Elizabeth Warren, and Peter J. Stein, Peter J.,  ''Sociology'', Allyn and Bacon, 1996] {{ISBN|9780023546211}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some restrict the official positions a woman can hold. For instance, some ordain women for the military or hospital chaplaincy but prohibit them from serving in congregational roles. However, one-third of all seminary students (and in some seminaries nearly half) are female.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lwaAtqMDkuIC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=half+%22american+protestant+denominations%22+ordain+women&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2HjADHdZVC&amp;sig=JN4eBsTeAkNyoCGfgYyI720Gx1M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XaY_TJOFDsL98AaqyKntCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=half%20%22american%20protestant%20denominations%22%20ordain%20women&amp;f=false Kling, David William.

The [[Salvation Army]] elected [[Evangeline Booth]] as its first female [[General of the Salvation Army|General]] (worldwide leader) in 1934. Army founder [[William Booth]] insisted on gender equality, writing in 1908 that "Every officer and soldier should insist upon the truth that woman is as important, as valuable, as capable and as necessary to the progress and happiness of the world as man" and women have been prominent in leadership positions in the history of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.salvationarmy.org/ind/www_ind.nsf/80256e520050a2e280256b3b0048eb4b/80256e520050a2e280256c18005cdb07!OpenDocument "Women within The Salvation Army"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most famous women missionaries of the period was [[Mother Teresa]] of Calcutta, who was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1979 for her work in "bringing help to suffering humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/press.html "The Nobel Peace Prize 1979"]&lt;/ref&gt; She was beatified in 2003, just six years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_index_madre-teresa_en.html "Beatification of Mother Teresa", Vatican News Service, October 19, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christian women and religious have been prominent advocates in social policy debates - as with American nun [[Helen Prejean]], a [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille|Sister of Saint Joseph of Medaille]], who is a prominent campaigner against the [[death penalty]] and was the inspiration for the Hollywood film ''[[Dead Man Walking (film)|Dead Man Walking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2034720.htm "Sister Helen Prejean"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Fish Migration Day''' (WFMD) is celebrated every other year to raise global attention to the need for restored river connections for migrating fish to achieve healthier fish stocks and more productive rivers. The next World Fish Migration Day will be on 16 May 2020.

==History==
The concept of a day to celebrate fish migration was shown to be a success within the North Sea Region on May 14, 2011. In 2011, partners of the Living North Sea Project, funded by the European Union, participated to raise awareness about fish passage issues in the North Sea Region, including 25 locations in 7 countries. The day created publicity in both regional and national press, including social media, magazines, radio and tv stations (From Sea to Source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gough|first1=Peter|last2=Philipsen|first2=Peter|last3=Schollema|first3=Peter Paul|last4=Wanningen|first4=Herman|title=From Sea to Source, International guidance for the restoration of fish migration highways|date=2012|publisher=Regional Water Authority Hunze en Aa's|location=The Netherlands|pages=300|url=http://www.fromseatosource.com/?page=HOME}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After the success in 2011, a Dutch conservationist Herman Wanningen from the [http://www.worldfishmigrationfoundation.com World Fish Migration Foundation], reached out to various organizations worldwide, including [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]], and the Freshwater Fish Specialist Group of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (FFSG-IUCN) to create a global celebratory day, which is today known as the World Fish Migration Day. In 2014 the first ever WFMD took place and is now generally planned for every second year in May, under the coordination of the World Fish Migration Platform.

== Celebrity endorsements == 
On the occasion of World Fish Migration Day May 24, 2014, [[Sharon Dijksma]], the State Secretary of Economic Affairs in The Netherlands sent out message endorsing the WFMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from Sharon Dijksma|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lmEFw6GvIo|website=WFMD Youtube channel|publisher=WFMD2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeb Hogan from Nation Geographics’ [[List of programs broadcast by National Geographic Channel#M|Monster Fish]] television program, sent out a message during the 5th annual Fish Passage conference in June 2015, encouraging people to take part in this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fish Passage 2015 conference|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn__anZ97aw|website=You Tube|publisher=World Fish Migration Day|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities who have encouraged World Fish Migration Day Celebrations include:
* [[Melanie Schultz van Haegen]], 
* Giulio Boccaletti, Global Managing Director for Water at The Nature Conservancy
* Johan van de Gronden, CEO WWF Netherlands
* Richard Sneider, ICUN Global Chair

== Description ==
WFMD is a one-day event to create worldwide awareness of the importance of freshwater migratory fish and open rivers for the general public, especially students and their teachers, resource managers and engineers, and commercial and recreational anglers, as well as those individuals who influence public policy that affect rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Fish Migration Day|url=http://www.worldfishmigrationday.com|website=World Gish Migration Day|publisher=WFMD2016|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global initiative with activities organized to reach these audiences.

Around the world, coordination and promotion is done through  local activities supported and coordinated by a central office of the World Fish Migration Platform. The website is being developed and ambassadors are arising for national and continental satellite offices. At the individual event level, organizations undertake the development of an activity to raise awareness and involve local people and media about [[fish migration]] and [[Rivers|open rivers]]. Local events include a range of activities: field trips, events at a school or aquaria, the opening of a [[fishway]]s, races, food festivals, etc. At this local level, the logo and central message of the WFMD, connecting fish, rivers and people, is used to connect sites around the world. The day starts in [[New Zealand]] and will follows the sun around the world, ending in [[Hawaii]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
