The '''American Surety Building''' is a historic [[Early skyscrapers|skyscraper]] located at 100 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], opposite [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]]. It has been declared a landmark as one of [[Manhattan]]'s most influential early skyscrapers.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==History==
The building was constructed from 1894 to 1896, following designs by noted architect [[Bruce Price]]. It was one of Manhattan's first buildings with steel framing and curtain wall construction. At its original 21 stories, it was Price's first tall building and the second tallest building in New York.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Amercian_Surety_Building_1898.jpg|thumb|left|1898 drawing of the American Surety Building.]]In an interview, Price described his design as "a [[campanile]] with four [[pilaster]] faces, the seven flutes being represented by seven rows of windows". The building is set on an irregular, trapezoidal lot, and designed as a [[Neo-Renaissance]] tower clad in Maine granite with a 3-story base, a 12-story shaft, and a 6-story cap. (Its 4th and 15 stories are transitional.) The base is an Ionic entrance [[colonnade]] topped with sculptures in a classical style by [[J. Massey Rhind]]. Above rises a middle section of horizontally banded piers with vertical strips framing the windows, which culminates in a row of figural sculptures extending from the 14th to 15th stories. A further six-story cap (subsequently modified) featured a colonnade of Corinthian pilasters, stone [[cornice]], and a crowning parapet of gilded metal [[acroteria]] on the setback 20th and 21st stories.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The [[North American Trust Company]] was organized in early 1896, and at the start of 1898, the company was located in the American Surety Building at [[100 Broadway]].&lt;ref name=nyt-trenholm&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A Place for Colonel Trenholm; Head of North American Trust Company -- W.S. Johnston Succeeds Him in American Surety. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1898/01/20/archives/a-place-for-col-trenholm-head-of-north-american-trust-company-ws.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York City, United States |date= January 20, 1898| page= |access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920-1922, New York architect [[Herman Lee Meader]] supervised alterations, which included a new L-shaped annex that widened the tower from 7 to 11 bays, and addition of several stories, which greatly modified the original cap.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4556">The '''Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication''' is a research center at the [[Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. The center is dedicated to the study and advancement of ethics and responsibility in [[corporate communication]] and other forms of public communication.&lt;ref&gt;http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center is named for [[Arthur W. Page]], widely regarded as the founder of modern corporate [[public relations]], whose views have been distilled into the Page Principles: (1) tell the truth; (2) prove it with action; (3) listen to stakeholders; (4) manage for tomorrow; (5) conduct public relations as if the whole enterprise depends on it; (6) realize that an enterprise's true character is expressed by its people; and (7) remain calm, patient and good-humored.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/about/arthur-w-page/the-page-principles&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bringing the center to Penn State was the idea of alumnus Lawrence G. Foster, who retired as corporate vice-president of public relations at [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]. The launch was made possible by a $300,000 gift he and his wife Ellen made to the college. Foster worked on the project with Edward M. Block, retired vice-president of public relations at [[AT&amp;T]], and John A. Koten, retired senior vice president of corporate communications at [[Ameritech]]. All three played leading roles in the formation of [http://www.awpagesociety.com The Arthur W. Page Society], which functions as a separate entity.

==The Arthur W. Page Center Awards==
The Page Center annually honors individuals who, over the course of their careers, have demonstrated consistent and fervent commitment to the concept of “truth well told." Three icons of the profession are recognized each February at an awards dinner held in New York City. Hundreds of professionals attend as the honorees are given a Larry Foster Award for Integrity in Public Communication, named after the center's founder. Past honorees include Ann Barkelew, Dick Martin, Alan Murray,&lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/events/archive-awards2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill George (academic)|Bill George]], [[Gwen Ifill]] and John Onoda.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/events/archive-awards2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and projects==

The Page Center seeks to foster a modern understanding and application of the Page principles and Robert Wood Johnson’s business philosophy by supporting innovative research, educational or public service projects in a variety of academic disciplines and professional fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D276 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032301/http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center supports three ongoing programs, as set out below.

===Page/Johnson legacy scholars===
As of April 2018, the center has awarded more than $900,000 to scholars and professionals throughout the world to support research that makes important contributions to knowledge, practice or public understanding of ethics and responsibility in public communication or other principles of Arthur W. Page. Topics of research have included digital media, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, advocacy and fake news. &lt;ref&gt;http://bellisario.psu.edu/page-center/grants/legacy-scholar-grants&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oral history collection===
Printable transcripts, streaming video, and searchable indexed content provide history, analysis and individual comment on public relations and the media from the luminaries in the field.  To date, the Center has conducted 31 interviews and has transcribed and indexed many acquired videos from the Arthur W. Page Society and other contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D276 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720032301/http://pagecenter.comm.psu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page archive===
The Page Center also is the archive for Page’s previously uncollected papers and memorabilia and related research materials in the area of ethics in public communication and corporate responsibility.

'''''Asia Market Week''''' is a weekly [[business]] [[news]] programme on [[CNBC Asia]], airing on Fridays at 18:00 [[Hong Kong]] / [[Singapore]] / [[Taiwan]] time with [[daylight saving time]]. It also airs on [[CNBC World]] and [[CNBC Europe]] at various times during the week.

The programme is presented by [[Maura Forgarty]] and consists of highlights of the business news in Asia during the previous week. It runs for thirty minutes. The theme music on the programme is that which was used by '''''[[Today's Business]]''''' on CNBC US between 2000-2002.

The programme takes its name from the now defunct CNBC US program ''[[Market Week]] with Maria Bartiromo''. Internationally, the equivalent programme on CNBC Europe is ''[[Europe This Week]]'', a previous incarnation of which was called ''[[European Market Week]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Bankruptcy prediction''' is the art of predicting [[bankruptcy]] and various measures of [[financial distress]] of public firms.  It is a vast area of finance and accounting research.  The importance of the area is due in part to the relevance for [[creditor]]s and [[investor]]s in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt.

The quantity of research is also a function of the availability of data: for public firms which went bankrupt or did not, numerous accounting ratios that might indicate danger can be calculated, and numerous other potential explanatory variables are also available.  Consequently, the area is well-suited for testing of increasingly sophisticated, data-intensive [[forecasting]] approaches.

==History==
The history of bankruptcy prediction includes application of numerous statistical tools which gradually became available, and involves deepening appreciation of various pitfalls in early analyses.  Research is still published that suffers pitfalls that have been understood for many years.

Bankruptcy prediction has been a subject of formal analysis since at least 1932, when FitzPatrick published a study of 20 pairs of firms, one failed and one surviving, matched by date, size and industry, in ''The Certified Public Accountant''.  He did not perform statistical analysis as is now common, but he thoughtfully interpreted the ratios and trends in the ratios.  His interpretation was effectively a complex, multiple variable analysis.

In 1967, [[William Beaver]] applied [[t-tests]] to evaluate the importance of individual accounting ratios within a similar pair-matched sample.

In 1968, in the first formal multiple variable analysis, [[Edward I. Altman]] applied [[multiple discriminant analysis]] within a pair-matched sample.  One of the most prominent early models of bankruptcy prediction is the [[Altman Z-score]], which is still applied today.

In 1980, [[James Ohlson]] applied [[logit regression]] in a much larger sample that did not involve pair-matching.

==Modern methods==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Survival methods are now applied.

Option valuation approaches involving stock price variability have been developed. Under structural models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/09-10/finance/courses/hurdnotes2.pdf|title=Structural Modes of Credit Risk|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a default event is deemed to occur for a firm when its assets reach a sufficiently low level compared to its liabilities.

[[Neural network model]]s and other sophisticated models have been tested on bankruptcy prediction.

Modern methods applied by business information companies surpass the annual accounts content and also consider current events like age, judgements, bad press, payment incidents and payment experiences from creditors.

==Comparison of differing approaches ==

The latest research within the field of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Prediction compares various differing approaches, modelling techniques, and individual models to ascertain whether any one technique is superior to its counterparts.

Jackson and Wood (2013) provides an excellent discussion of the literature to date, including an empirical evaluation of 15 popular models from the existing literature. These models range from the univariate models of Beaver through the multidimensional models of Altman and Ohlson, and continuing to more recent techniques which include option valuation approaches. They find that models based on market data  - such as an option valuation approach - outperform those earlier models which rely heavily on accounting numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890838913000498 | doi=10.1016/j.bar.2013.06.009 | volume=45 | title=The performance of insolvency prediction and credit risk models in the UK: A comparative study | journal=The British Accounting Review | pages=183–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang, Wang, and Ji (2013) proposed a novel [[rule-based system]] to solve bankruptcy prediction problem. The whole procedure consists of the following four stages: first, sequential [[forward selection]] was used to extract the most important features; second, a rule-based model was chosen to fit the given dataset since it can present physical meaning; third, a genetic [[ant colony algorithm]] (GACA) was introduced; the fitness scaling strategy and the chaotic operator were incorporated with GACA, forming a new algorithm—fitness-scaling chaotic GACA (FSCGACA), which was used to seek the optimal parameters of the rule-based model; and finally, the [[Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation|stratified K-fold cross-validation]] technique was used to enhance the generalization of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yudong|author2=Shuihua Wang |author3=Genlin Ji |title=A Rule-Based Model for Bankruptcy Prediction Based on an Improved Genetic Ant Colony Algorithm|journal=Mathematical Problems in Engineering|date=2013|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/753251|url=http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/753251.pdf|page=753251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Biddle''' (December 24, 1745 – April 4, 1821) was a [[Pennsylvania]] statesman and a member of the prominent [[Biddle family]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

==Early life==

He was the son of William Biddle, 3rd (1698–1756) and Mary ([[née]] Scull) Biddle (1709–1789). His siblings included: Lydia Biddle, who married William Macfunn; John "Jacky" Biddle, who married Sophia Boone; [[Edward Biddle]], a lawyer, soldier, delegate to the [[Continental Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000440/|title=BIDDLE, Edward - Biographical Information|publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|website=bioguide.congress.gov|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who married Elizabeth Ross, sister of [[George Ross (delegate)|George Ross]]; Charles Biddle, and [[Nicholas Biddle (naval officer)|Nicholas Biddle]], Revolutionary War Navy captain.&lt;ref name="Biddle1883"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Biddle |first1=Charles |last2=Biddle |first2=James S. |title=Autobiography of Charles Biddle, vice-president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. 1745-1821 |date=1883 |publisher=E. Claxton and Company |location=[[Philadelphia, PA]] |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028831259 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, Biddle was a schoolmate and close friend of [[Mathias Aspden]] and [[Founding Father of the United States|Founding Father]] [[Benjamin Rush]].&lt;ref name="Rush1981"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rush |first1=Benjamin |title=Benjamin Rush's Lectures on the Mind |date=1981 |publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]] |isbn=9780871691446 |page=129 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sfpu7mMW9qIC&amp;pg=PA129 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], Biddle was a captain in the merchant service and participated in the work around of the British fleet's blockade of American ports.  He volunteered in the Quaker Light Infantry and, in 1778, he served under his brother, Commodore [[Nicholas Biddle (naval officer)|Nicholas Biddle]], aboard the [[USS Randolph (1776)|USS ''Randolph'']].&lt;ref name="DAR1904"/&gt;

===Political career===
Biddle served as [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Vice-President of Pennsylvania]] from October 10, 1785 until October 31, 1787 (also known as the [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania]]).&lt;ref name="upenn"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Biddle (1745-1821) |url=https://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/biddle_charles.html |website=www.archives.upenn.edu |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania University Archives]] |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served under [[John Dickinson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] and hosted [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Stewart2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=David O. |title=The Summer of 1787: The Men Who Invented the Constitution |date=2007 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |isbn=9781416554042 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NveNQBMwpLEC&amp;pg=PA231 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his term, he was an ''ex officio'' trustee of the University of the State of Pennsylvania (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]). He was a member of the [[Pennsylvania Senate]] from 1810 to 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cox | first = Harold | title = Senate Members C | publisher = Wilkes University | work = [[Wilkes University Election Statistics Project]]| date = | url =http://staffweb.wilkes.edu/harold.cox/legis/SC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was an associate of [[Aaron Burr]], having introduced Burr to his wife [[Theodosia Bartow Prevost|Theodosia]] shortly after the death of her first husband, [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]].&lt;ref name="Abraham2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abraham |first1=David |title=Aaron Burr - Adventurer |date=2013 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=9781481713146 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q6f1PiiP_6EC&amp;pg=PA7 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Biddle vacated his seat at Council on October 13, 1787 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania records that his Vice-Presidential term extended to October 31, the date of the next Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections. Biddle was elected Secretary of the Council on October 23.

{{Admiralty law}}
In a [[contract of carriage]], the '''consignee''' is the entity who is financially responsible (the buyer) for the receipt of a [[shipment]].  Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver.

If a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the ''sender'', the recipient is the ''consignee'', and the deliverer is the ''carrier''.

==A brief statement of law==
This is a difficult area of [[law]] in that it regulates the mass [[transport]]ation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that [[good (accounting)|goods]] will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or [[freight]] carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and [[fraudulent]] individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimate]] consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the [[documentation]]. The standard form of contract is a [[bill of lading]] which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a [[Charter-party|charter party]]. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. 

=== Documentation and legal requirements for delivery ===

A straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air [[waybill]] are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an "order" or "bearer" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the [[Hague Rules]], and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in [[Hong Kong]], there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in "The Rafaela S" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and "The Happy Ranger" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of [[cargo]] being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge [[port]].

=== Consignee rights ===

The rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the [[Warsaw Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the [[Montreal Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)
This is very important as per export documents.

The receiver can be different than that of the consignee.

===IMPORTANCE===
It is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received.
It helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of [[trade]] and payment.
It informs the selling price to the [[consignee]]. 
It helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer.</text>

'''Downtown Athens''' is the oldest of the main commercial and residential centers in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States]].  Downtown is generally considered to be the area bounded by Dougherty Street on the north, Broad Street and the [[University of Georgia]] campus on the south, Pulaski Street on the west, and Foundry Street by the east.

A [[Downtown Athens Historic District]] was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by Austin Kinsey in 1978.

The commercial and governmental heart of the city has traditionally been toward the eastern end of Downtown Athens, between Lumpkin and Thomas Streets. Recent developments, particularly between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets, have expanded the boundaries of the "central" part of the neighborhood. The term "Downtown Athens" can also mean this smaller, more commercial area, particularly when used in the context of the city's nightlife and restaurants. 

Some definitions of "Downtown" include the area west of Pulaski Street, which is a much more residential area characterized by historic homes, new infill construction, and some public housing. This part of Downtown Athens has the highest concentration of hotels {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} particularly along Broad Street.  The Prince Avenue commercial corridor is an important center of business, particularly for those living in the [[Boulevard (Athens)|Boulevard]] and [[Normaltown (Athens)|Normaltown]] neighborhoods.

The area has several hotels and apartment buildings, and more high-rise condos are either under construction or planned for the area. Some of these high-rises as well as the construction of the new Multi-Modal Transportation Center have the potential to redefine the area encompassing downtown Athens to stretch east to the banks of the [[Oconee River]].

[[Image:Dt athens.jpg|600px|thumb|center|A map of Athens with Downtown and UGA shaded. Note that the common definition of Downtown does not include the area west of Pulaski Street.]]

== Defining "Downtown Athens" ==

The exact delineation of what is "Downtown" differs for varying purposes. Some of the more common ones are:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! South         !! North             !! East            !! West            !! Function/context, etc.
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Hancock&amp;nbsp;St   || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St  || Pulaski&amp;nbsp;St || This is the boundary of the "no-cruising zone" established by Athens-Clarke County ordinance. ("No cruising" means no motor vehicle may pass the same point within the zone more than three times in an hour, during the hours of midnight to 4 a.m.) [http://library.municode.com/HTML/12400/level3/PIII_T3_C3-3.html#PIII_T3_C3-3_s3-3-64]
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Dougherty&amp;nbsp;St || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St || Pulaski&amp;nbsp;St || This is the common definition of Downtown, clearly distinguished from the rest of Athens by such things as building density, metered on-street parking, etc. Athens-Clarke County uses a distinctive street sign design (using the ACC logo on signs) within this boundary.
|-
| Broad&amp;nbsp;St || Dougherty&amp;nbsp;St/ Prince&amp;nbsp;Ave || Foundry&amp;nbsp;St || Milledge&amp;nbsp;Ave || This is a more generous area of Downtown, including the above in addition to the Broad Street and Prince Avenue corridors immediately to the west of the core of Downtown.
|}

== Cultural significance ==

The Downtown area is the cultural center of the city. Several dozen night clubs host performances of local, regional and national bands and artists.  The [[40 Watt Club]] at the corner of Washington and Pulaski and [[Georgia Theater]] on Lumpkin Street between Clayton and Washington are among the most well-known night spots where many bands have made the jump to a larger regional stage (See [[Music of Athens, Georgia]]).  The Classic Center, located on Thomas Street on the eastern edge of the neighborhood, is a multi-purpose facility containing a performing arts center, convention space, and banquet halls. It was a filming site for ''[[Blue Collar TV]]''.

== Restaurants and bars ==

Downtown Athens is home to award-winning restaurants&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitathensga.com/restaurants/award-winning-dining/&lt;/ref&gt; including The Last Resort and Weaver D's. Five &amp; Ten, a high class expensive restaurant is known for the famous chef, [[Hugh Acheson]], who was named Best Chef Southeast by the James Beard Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitathensga.com/restaurants/award-winning-dining/&lt;/ref&gt; and also on [[Top Chef: Masters (season 3)]].  Other notable restaurants include The Porterhouse Grill and De Palmas. There are a variety of eating options, ranging from higher-priced luxury dining, chain restaurants, ethnic food restaurants, and inexpensive bar food.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.yahoo.com/you-havent-tasted-pizza-athens-georgia-6872758.html?cat=22{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The streets, particularly on Thursday through Saturday, are filled with people and cars late into the night. Popular bars are on every street corner, including Magnolia's, Allgood, Blue Sky, Silver Dollar, General Beauregard's, Walker's Pub, Boars Head, Sandbar and Trappeze. There are around 80 bars in Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownathensga.com/businesses.php?category%3D29 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812061825/http://www.downtownathensga.com/businesses.php?category=29 |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, nightlife for this demographic has been concentrated in the neighborhood's rapidly changing "West End", the area between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets. Nightlife catering to a more mainstream college-age demographic remains in the eastern part of the neighborhood, especially along Broad and Clayton Streets. During the day, visitors of all ages can find a reason to visit Downtown Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pros-cons-downtown-athens-georgia-11203126.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728235949/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-pros-cons-downtown-athens-georgia-11203126.html |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shopping ==
Locally- owned fashion boutiques line the streets, including Encore, Heery's and Cheeky Peach that all include designer brand names. Catering to the city's diverse populations, vintage shops like Agora and Cillies host a variety of items. Many of these outlets reflect Athens's status as a university town and a small liberal city. In particular, independent music stores such as the world-famous Wuxtry Records and alternative shops are found along Clayton Street, as well as the Georgia Bulldogs fan shop known as The Red Zone.

== Government ==

The Athens-Clarke County unified government is located in the Downtown district.  Several local and federal government buildings are located along Washington Street, and the county adult health center is located just within the western boundary of Downtown.

'''Ely Calil''' (8 December 1945 – 28 May 2018) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] businessman holding [[United Kingdom|British]] citizenship. He was one of the richest men in Britain; ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'' estimated his wealth in 2010 to be around £350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
His ancestry can be traced back to 1920s or 30s when his family set up their home in what's today [[Turkey]] after leaving [[Lebanon]], but then returned to Lebanon after [[Ataturk]]'s policies discriminating against [[Christianity in Turkey|Christians]]. Before he was born, his family set up an oil mill for groundnut processing in Lebanon in 1941. His father, George Khalil, died in 1970, leaving behind two sons, him [Ely] and Bernard, and was said to have bequeathed £20 million to Ely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under fire: Lebanese millionaire who seems to know everybody|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/under-fire-lebanese-millionaire-who-seems-to-know-everybody-53489.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=26 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations ==
In 2002, Calil was arrested in [[Paris]] in connection with the [[Elf Aquitaine]] scandal but was released on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Calil was alleged to be part in the failed [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt|coup d'état in Equatorial Guinea]] and is currently sought by courts both in Equatorial Guinea and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaisse, Mark. ''Rich, Betrayed en Lonely. Reconstruction of the international plot against Equatorial Guinea'' (PREG Publications, Malabo, 2011){{pageneeded|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, he was sued by the Equatorial Guinean government for allegedly having raised $750 000 to finance the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK businessman sued for coup|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/UK-businessman-sued-for-coup-20040910|publisher=News 24 Archives|accessdate=10 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married his first wife, a [[Tennessee]] tobacco heiress named Frances Condon, at [[Roman Catholic]] church in Farm Street, [[Mayfair]] in 1972. The couple divorced in 1985, and the following year, Calil married a Lebanese socialite, Hayat Emma Morowa. The marriage also failed, and Calil married his third wife, Renuka Jaine, in 1989. He died on 28 May 2018 after falling down stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ely-calil-oil-wonga-coup-equatorial-guinea-simon-mann-mark-thatcher-a8382886.html|title=Ely Calil: The oil magnate who financed the failed 'wonga coup' in Equatorial Guinea|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FUCAFF''' ([http://www.fucaff.com Website]) is the [[acronym]] for the '''Federation of Uganda Customs Agents &amp; Freight Forwarders''', an exclusive umbrella association for member clearing firms or companies registered in [[Uganda]]. With the [[slogan]] ''Fostering Tax Compliance with Stakeholders'', it was formed in 2009 after [[UCIFA]] and its offshoot [[UFFA (Uganda)|UFFA]] to coordinate with [[Uganda Revenue Authority|URA]].

==Logistics==

The [[federation]]'s secretariat is based in Kinawataka, [[Kampala]] behind the Railway Crossing and fosters [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[freight forwarding]] management within the [[Northern Corridor]] - the Busiest Transport Network in East Africa. With [[integrity]] as a vital component in leadership, it is mandatory for member companies of FUCAFF to be registered with [[Uganda Revenue Authority]].

The '''Fiduciary Institute of Southern Africa''' (FISA) is a non-profit professional organisation. It represents [[fiduciary]] practitioners and sets high minimum standards for the industry .&lt;ref&gt;Personal Finance databank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;You magazine, 16 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and activities==
FISA was formed in 2008, when the Association of Trust Companies in South Africa (ATCSA), which was formed in 1932, was converted to a professional institute with individual membership.  A new constitution was adopted to reflect the change of name and membership. Prior to the change, members were the main [[trust companies]] in South Africa on a corporate membership basis.  After the change, members include employees of trust companies and individuals from the legal, accounting and financial planning professions.

FISA has approximately 700 individual members, who collectively manage assets in excess of R250 billion. They draft tens of thousand [[Wills]] each year and administer around 50 percent of deceased estates reported to the offices of the [http://www.justice.gov.za/master/m_main.htm Master of the High Court] in [[South Africa]].

Activities of FISA members include [[estate planning]], the drafting of Wills], administration of trusts and estates, [[beneficiary fund]]s, tax and financial advice and the management of client funds.

The organization is governed by a 10-person Council; the current Chairperson is Eben Nel. Regional councilors represent the regions of [[Gauteng]], [[Western Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[KwaZulu Natal]], and [[Free State (province)|Free State]]. The intention is to add other regional representation as membership grows. There are also seven special purpose committees comprising experts in the areas of trusts, estates, compliance, tax, education and training, and beneficiary funds.

FISA liaises with the Master's Office and the [[South African Revenue Service]] in order to participate in optimising legal and compliance processes. It engages with the [[National Treasury (South Africa)|South African Treasury]] on issues that affect the industry and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golegal.co.za/business/future-taxation-trusts |title=The future taxation of trusts |publisher=Go Legal |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100440/http://www.golegal.co.za/business/future-taxation-trusts |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercury, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/tax/plan-to-tax-capital-gains-as-income-will-kill-discretionary-trusts-1.1479432#.UvNDUPZ4J34 |title=Plan to tax capital gains as income will kill discretionary trusts - Personal Finance Tax &amp;#124; IOL Business |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2013-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
FISA aims to raise awareness and standards of fiduciary practice through education to benefit both practitioners and the public. FISA holds an annual conference at which practitioners and academics in the fiduciary field present and discuss topical issues.&lt;ref&gt;De Rebus, 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;InvestSA, 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 FISA introduced a professional examination, in co-operation with the [[University of the Free State]], which gives successful candidates the designation of Fiduciary Practitioner of South Africa (FPSA®).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investsa.co.za/fisa-ramps-up-fiduciary-profession-2/ |title=FISA ramps up fiduciary profession |publisher=Investsa |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.za/fiduciary-profession-sa/ |title=Fiduciary profession in SA |publisher=Money-Marketing |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach==
FISA works actively to educate the public about fiduciary issues. It has a public helpdesk on its website which contains a complaints procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fidsa.org.za/complaints/ |title=Complaints - FISA |publisher=Fidsa.org.za |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer education on executorships,  Wills,  and trusts&lt;. For the benefit of both its members and the public, the institute makes available the latest court decisions on fiduciary matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://fidsa.org.za/court-case-proprietary-rights-foreign-marriage/ |title=Court case: Proprietary rights of a foreign marriage - FISA |publisher=Fidsa.org.za |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also has an active media campaign through which it educates journalists on fiduciary matters and representatives talk about fiduciary issues on radio and television.

==Affiliations==
FISA has strategic alliances with other professional bodies such as the [[South African Institute of Tax Practitioners]], the Law Society of South Africa and the [[Financial Planning Institute]] with which it signed a memorandum of understanding in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Financial Planner, 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''general account''' "generally" refers to the combined or aggregate investments and other assets of an [[insurance company]] available to pay claims and benefits to which [[insured]]s or policyholders are entitled.  The general account may also be considered everything that is not represented by a [[separate account]]s of the firm, if such separate account has been established by the company.  Should a firm have no separate accounts, then its only account is the general account.  The term should not be thought of narrowly in terms of a [[bank account]] or [[general ledger]] account, but rather the broader concept introduced in the first sentence.

Policyholders of insurance policies (that are not associated with separate accounts) do not have a legal or other direct interest or right to the assets or investments of the insurance company's general account but rather these obligations for benefits or claims are general obligations of the company.  In this case, policyholders are subject to credit risk of the insurance company-- that is, should the insurance company fail or go bankrupt, the claims or cash values of policies are not directly backed or collateralized by the company's investments and other assets.  In the U.S., state insurance departments examine (audit) insurance companies to evaluate many things, principally to see if the company is sound and policyholder interests are protected. [[A.M. Best]] is an example of an insurance [[rating agency]] who evaluates and rates many companies on various factors such as financial strength, claims-paying and other policyholder servicing experiences.

'''Henry Whitworth "Harry" Hole''' (10 December 1855 – 23 June 1942) was a [[New Zealand]] [[cricketer]] who took 10 wickets on the first day of his only [[first-class cricket|first-class match]].

At the age of 19, Harry Hole was one of 10 players, five on each team, who were making their first-class debuts in the match between [[Nelson cricket team|Nelson]] and [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] at [[Victory Square, Nelson]], in February 1875. Wellington batted first, and Hole opened the bowling for Nelson. He bowled throughout the innings, taking 8 for 37 off 18 overs as Wellington were dismissed for 93. Nelson went in and made 100. Wellington batted again and were 40 for 5 at stumps on the first day. Hole again opened the bowling, and took the first two wickets but, "somewhat tired by his exertions", delivered only six overs before being relieved.&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1926.html| title = Nelson v Wellington 1874-75| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Colonist | date=27 February 1875 | page=3 | title= Interprovincial Cricket Match: Wellington versus Nelson| url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TC18750227.2.8| volume=XVII | issue=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Nelson Evening Mail | date=27 February 1875 | page=2 | title= Cricket Match: Wellington v.

Harry Hole moved to the [[North Island]], where he ran hotels and general stores in [[Taupo]] and then Kerioi in the [[Wanganui]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Wanganui Chronicle | date=13 January 1888 | page=2 | title= Local and General| url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WC18880113.2.10| volume=XXXI | issue=11685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Maggie Taylor in Wanganui on 23 December 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Wanganui Chronicle | date=24 December 1890 | page=2 | title= Local and General| url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WC18901224.2.9

In 1900 he lent his rural property at Tayforth, west of Wanganui, to the armed forces for several days of manoeuvres. About 1400 troops were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Wanganui Chronicle | date=20 April 1900 | page=2 | title= The Camp at Tayforth|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WC19000420.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1904 he had moved to a property north of [[Upokongaro]] on the [[Whanganui River]], where he farmed sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Wanganui Herald | date=23 November 1904 | page=7 | title= Round the District: Notes by "Rambler"| url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WH19041123.2.60| volume=XXXVIII | issue=11416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, at 83, he was "the second oldest bowler in Wanganui".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Evening Post | date=15 December 1938 | page=23 | title= Dominion Tourney| url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19381215.2.190.1 | volume=CXXVI | issue=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1477 until his death he was an [[Alderman]] (a member of the city council) of [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], and became even its [[mayor]] for a while.

By establishing "The Common Hungarian Trade" ({{lang-de|Gemeine Ungarische Handel}}, also known as Fugger–Thurzo company), he developed a very profitable business relationship with [[Jakob Fugger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kayo |last=Hirakawa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJ-dQpbfrysC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Thurz%C3%B3+family&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qRmJTMy5OdjPjAei1MWgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Pictorialization of Dürer's Drawings in Northern Europe in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries |page=48 |location= |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2009 |isbn=3-03911-725-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which held a de facto [[monopoly]] over [[copper mining]] and trade in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1500.

Thurzo first married Ursula Boehm and the couple had three sons: György Thurzó who married Anna [[Fugger]], later György Thurzó became the [[Local government in Kraków|mayor of Kraków]]; another son of [[Johann V Thurzo|János]], became the [[Bishop of Wrocław|archbishop]] of [[Breslau]] (today [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|Wroclaw]]); and their [[Stanislav I.

'''Liquidated damages''' (also referred to as liquidated and ascertained damages) are damages whose amount the parties designate during the formation of a [[contracts|contract]]&lt;ref name= Liquidated&gt;{{Cite web |  url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Liquidated+damages | title = Liquidated Damages  | format = w | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach (e.g., late performance).&lt;ref name= "Liquidated" /&gt;

When damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be 'at large' (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach).

==Common law==

Generally, at [[common law]], a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the wrongdoer/party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |court=UKHL |year=1914 |num=1 |litigants=Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amev-Udc"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|1986|litigants=Amev-Udc Finance Ltd v Austin |parallelcite=(1986) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 170 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plessnig "&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1989|litigants=Esanda Finance Corp v Plessnig  |parallelcite=(1989) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 131 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (in which case it is referred to as a [[penal damages|penal or penalty clause]]).&lt;ref name= "Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach" &gt;{{Cite journal |  url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1121823?uid=3738776&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100860664611 | title = Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach | journal = Columbia Law Review  | volume = 77 | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of [[specific performance]]. However, courts sitting in [[Equity (law)|equity]] will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the [[unjust enrichment]] of the enforcing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://law.jrank.org/pages/8310/Liquidated-Damages.html | title = Liquidated Damages  | journal = American Law Encyclopedia  | volume = 6  | format = w  | accessdate = 2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met. 
* First, the amount of the damages identified must roughly approximate the damages likely to fall upon the party seeking the benefit of the term.&lt;ref name= "Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach" /&gt;
* Second, the damages must be sufficiently uncertain at the time the contract is made that such a clause will likely save both parties the future difficulty of estimating damages.
Damages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as '''unliquidated damages''', and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a [[contingent liability|contingency]] which makes the amount of damages uncertain.

===Example===
For example, suppose Neal Townsend agrees to lease a store-front to Richard Smith, from which Richard intends to sell jewellery. If Townsend breaches the contract by refusing to lease the store-front at the appointed time, it will be difficult to determine what profits Smith will have lost because the success of newly created small businesses is highly uncertain. This, therefore, would be an appropriate circumstance for Smith to insist upon a liquidated damages clause in case Townsend fails to perform.

In the case of construction contracts, courts have occasionally refused to enforce liquidated damages provisions, choosing to follow the [[doctrine of concurrent delay]] when both parties have contributed to the overall delay of the project.

Contracts in the [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract|NEC3]] family use the term 'low service damages' (optional clause X.17) and generally include a Low Service Damages Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management|British Institute of Facilities Management]], Getting Started with the NEC3 Term Services Contract, accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The definition and scope extended===
In Australia, the definition of liquidated damages applies to the situations where upon the failure of a primary stipulation, imposes a detriment to the first party or a benefit to the second party by a secondary stipulation collateral to the primary stipulation (i.e. it does not have to be a breach).&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|2012|litigants=Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= }}.  {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca30-2012-09-06.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The law applied to bank and credit card charges===
UK bank and credit card customers were being charged as much as £39 for a single transaction that took them over their credit limit. Consumers argued these charges were well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter.

In 2007 the [[Office of Fair Trading]] investigated the charges being imposed on customers of credit card companies. In its report, the OFT claimed these charges were unlawful under UK law as they amounted to a penalty. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over £12, though this was not intended to indicate that £12 is a fair and acceptable charge. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred.

The credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers.

Receipt of liquidated damages and intimately linked with the purpose of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for seterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee.

In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled (''see [[Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc]]'') that terms in bank account contracts were not capable of being penal, bar those applicable to NatWest Bank customers between 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/55-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123082125/http://oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/55-08 |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that the charges were a charge for a service, and not a penalty for damages for breaching a contract term.

===Bank Fees===

In 2012, the High Court of Australia allowed an appeal against findings of the Federal Court of Australia that 'exception fees' imposed by the ANZ Bank could not constitute an unenforceable penalty. The High Court found that fees were not incapable of being characterised as penalties merely because they were not charged upon breach of contract.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

Conversely, in 2014, the federal court (Gordon J) described $35 late payment fees by ANZ Banking Group to customers who failed to make their monthly minimum credit card repayment as being “extravagant, exorbitant and unconscionable” and ordered for these fees to be reimbursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|35|2014|litigants=Paciocco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=5 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ANZ appealed.

In 2015, the full court  overturned Justice Gordon’s first instance judgment that credit card late payment fees charged by ANZ to its customers constituted penalties at law and equity (and were therefore largely unenforceable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|78|2015|litigants=Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Paciocco |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=5 June 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision otherwise upholds Justice Gordon's findings that honour, dishonour and overlimit fees charged by ANZ were not penalties, unconscionable or unfair. While the decision is very fact specific, it represented a major setback for other class actions based on penalties. Paciocco appealed to the High Court.

The last chapter of the bank fees saga took place in July 2016 where the High Court dismissed the appeal for leave and held that the full court was correct to characterise the loss provision costs, regulatory capital costs and collection costs as affecting the legitimate interests of the Bank.&lt;ref name="Paccioco"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|28|2016|litigants=Paccioco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= }} {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-28-2016-07-27.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court asserted that the fact that those categories of costs could not be recovered in an action for damages did not alter that conclusion. Further, neither the fact that the late payment fees were not genuine pre-estimates of damage nor the fact that the amounts charged were disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by itself rendered the late payment fees penalties. [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-28-2016-07-27.pdf High Court]

==Uniform Commercial Code==

In the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 2-718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-718|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.

This largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.

==Other legal systems==

===Civil law===

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems generally impose less severe restrictions on liquidated damages. For example, Article 1226 of the [[French Civil Code]] provides for ''clause pénale'', a variant of liquidated damages which combines compensatory and coercive elements. Judges may adjust excessive contract penalties, but such clauses are not generally void as a matter of French law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Joanne|title="Clause pénale" v. liquidated damages – any similarities?|url=http://kluwerconstructionblog.com/2010/02/24/%E2%80%9Cclause-penale%E2%80%9D-v-liquidated-damages-any-similarities/|website=Kluwer Construction Blog|accessdate=17 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121351/http://kluwerconstructionblog.com/2010/02/24/%E2%80%9Cclause-penale%E2%80%9D-v-liquidated-damages-any-similarities/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 420-1 of the [[Civil Code of Japan]] provides an even firmer basis to uphold contractual penalties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Code|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/content/000056024.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Justice (Japan)|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The parties may agree on the amount of the liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation. In such case, the court may not increase or decrease the amount thereof.
# The liquidated damages shall not preclude the demand for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right.
# Any penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.

In the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]], which follows a civil law system, liquidated damages are referred to as "stipulated damages".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Civil Code]], Article 2005: Parties may stipulate the damages to be recovered in case of nonperformance, defective performance, or delay in performance of an obligation. http://legis.la.gov/Legis/LawSearchList.aspx accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term “penal clause” under former article 2117 of the [[Louisiana Civil Code|Civil Code]].&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Mary Mobley v. Gary Mobley, No. 37,364-CA {{cite web |url=http://www.lex.uniba.it/ta/clausola%20penale%20louisiana%20court%20of%20appeal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073715/http://www.lex.uniba.it/ta/clausola%20penale%20louisiana%20court%20of%20appeal.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stipulated damages create a secondary obligation for the purpose of enforcing the principal obligation. The aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Civil Code, Article 2007 http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=109263 accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Stipulated damages may not be modified by the court (and will therefore be enforced) "unless they are so manifestly unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy".&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Civil Code, Article 2012 http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=109269 accessed 23 June 2015.

===Islamic law===

[[Islamic law]] prohibits ''[[gharar]]'' (uncertainty) in contracts, and liquidated damages provisions are a favored mechanism to overcome uncertainty regarding contractual damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Contract Law|url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/02_law.html|website=Saudilegal|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">In employment law, a '''Loudermill letter''' is a letter that public-sector employers may send to employees giving notice of their intent to suspend, demote, or terminate.

According to [[Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill]], the process that is due a public employee includes a pre-termination hearing that provides "oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story."  The Loudermill letter fulfills the requirement of (written) notice, and should include an explanation of the employer's evidence ("to act as a check for mistaken accusations"). To fulfill the remaining [[Due Process]] requirements, a Loudermill letter will also have to inform the employee of his opportunity for a [[Loudermill hearing]].

==Content of the letter==

The formal letter advising the employee that discipline is being considered, and offering the opportunity for the employee to discuss or present his or her version and mitigating evidence, may be the first time the employee is even aware that certain allegations have arisen or that an investigation has been concluded.

The letter usually states that the employee may contact his union representative. The governing contract language may also state that the union representative will receive a copy of the letter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6426">''''Marketing intelligence''' ('''MI''') is the everyday information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident decision-making in determining market opportunity, market penetration strategy, and market development metrics. Marketing intelligence is necessary when entering a foreign market.

Marketing intelligence determines the intelligence needed, collects it by searching environment and delivers it to marketing managers who need it. Marketing intelligence software can be deployed using an on-premises or [[software as a service]] (SaaS, or cloud-based) model. These systems take data from disparate data sources, like [[web analytics]], [[business intelligence]], call center and sales data, which often come separate reports, and put them into a single environment. In order to collect marketing intelligence, marketing managers must be in constant touch with relevant books, newspapers and trade publications. They must talk to various stakeholders like customers, distributors, and suppliers. In addition to this, they must also monitor social media and carry out online discussions. Marketing managers can design reports that correlate and visualize data coming from a variety of departments and sources (even, in some cases, external data.) This allows them to see current [[key performance indicators]] in real time (or as quickly as sources provide data) and analyze trends, rather than wait for analysts to deliver periodic reports.

Marketing intelligence systems are designed to be used by marketing managers and often viewed by employees throughout an organization. Notable systems on the market include Leadtime, Pardot, Marketo, and Hubspot. They may have [[user interfaces]] that closely resemble consumer software than the software around individual data sources, which are designed for use by analysts. Business intelligence, for example, can collect highly accurate, timely, granular data, but often requires IT support to build and edit custom reports.

Organizationally, marketing intelligence can be the name of the department that performs both the market intelligence and competitor analysis roles.  Business intelligence of any kind may also be their responsibility, in tandem with (or solely performed by) the Finance department, for measuring market share and setting growth targets, the [[mergers and acquisitions]] group for exploring acquisition opportunities, the legal department to protect the organization's assets or [[research and development]] for cross-company comparison of innovation trends and the discovery of opportunities through innovative differentiation.

Steps to be taken by a Company to improve its Marketing Intelligence

(1) Train and Motivate Sales Force: A company's sales force can be an excellent source of information about the current trends in the market. They are the "intelligence gatherers" for the company. The acquired facts can be regarding the company's market offerings, whether any improvements are required or not or is there any opportunity for new products, etc. It can also provide a credible source to know about competitor activities, consumers, distributors, and retailers.

(2) Motivate Distributors, retailers, and other intermediaries to pass along important intelligence: Specialists are hired by companies to gather marketing intelligence. In order to measure the quality of production, the way the employees are behaving with customers, quality of facilities being provided; retailers and service providers send mystery shoppers. Firms can also assess the quality of customer experience with the shops with the use of mystery shoppers.

(3) Network Externally: Every firm must keep a tab on its competitors. [[Competitive intelligence]] describes the broader discipline of researching, analyzing and formulating data and information from the entire competitive environment of any organization. This can be done by purchasing the competitor's products, checking the advertising campaigns, the press media coverage, reading their published reports, etc. Competitive intelligence must be legal and ethical.

(4) Set up a customer advisory panel: Companies can set up panels consisting of customers. They can be the company's largest customers or representatives of customers or the most outspoken customers. Many business schools set up panels consisting of alumni who provide their knowledge and expertise and help in constituting the course curriculum.

(5) Optimal usage of Government data resources: Governments of almost all countries publish reports regarding the population trends, demographic characteristics, agricultural production and a lot of other such data.  All this data must be or can be referred to as base data. It can help in planning and formulating policies for the companies.

(6) Information bought from external suppliers: Certain agencies sell data that can be useful to other companies. For example, television channels will require information on the number of viewership, ratings of TV programs, etc. An agency which calculates this information and generates this data will provide it to companies that need it.

(7) Collect Competitive Intelligence through online customer feedback: Customer's view about a product is essential for any company. Ultimately it's the customer who's buying the product. Hence customer feedback must be taken. Online platforms like chat rooms, blogs, discussion forums, customer review boards can be used to generate customer feedback. This enables the firm to understand customer experiences and impressions. It becomes easier for companies to apply a structured system to do so as it can then scan out the relevant messages without much of a trouble.

With the above steps being applied, a company's marketing intelligence system will prove to be beneficial to its effective functioning.

'''Markus Johannes Jooste''' (born 22 January 1961)&lt;ref name="styan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Styan |first1=James-Brent |title=Steinhoff en die Stellenbosse boys |date=2018 |publisher=LAPA Uitgewers |isbn=9780799371635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/MRjrIvkfM8rqVRz5xVuOkLXYQ-8/appointments|title=Markus Johannes JOOSTE – Personal Appointments (free information from Companies House)|work= companieshouse.gov.uk |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a South African businessman and the former CEO of [[Steinhoff International]]. He is an avid horse breeder, and in 2016 was reported to be one of Africa's richest people, worth $400 million.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Markus Jooste |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/markus-jooste/ |website=Forbes |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =news24a/&gt; Joining forces with [[Christo Wiese]] in 2014, they embarked on an aggressive international expansion programme.&lt;ref name="ing"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingham |first1=Mark N |last2=Hogg |first2=Alec |title=Ingham's Incisive Insights: Mark Ingham assesses Steinhoff: Top SA entrepreneurs combine to make magic |url=https://www.fin24.com/BizNews/mark-ingham-assesses-steinhoff-top-sa-entrepreneurs-combine-to-make-magic-20160926 |website=fin24.com |date = 26 September 2016 |accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jooste's sudden resignation from Steinhoff on 5 December 2017 was followed by an involved and protracted controversy concerning Steinhoff's accounting practices in its Central European business dating back to 2016,&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Turner |first1=Nick |last2=Pfanner |first2=Eric |title= Christo Wiese quits board as Steinhoff scandal deepens |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/steinhoff-chair-will-quit-supervisory-board-after-scandal-20171214 |accessdate= 13 June 2018 |agency=fin24.com |date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even 2014.&lt;ref name="cronje2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cronje |first1=Jan |title= Steinhoff accounting scandal may date back to at least 2014 - reports |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/steinhoff-accounting-scandal-may-date-back-to-at-least-2014-reports-20180301 |accessdate=13 June 2018 |agency=fin24.com |date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting uncertainty saw some €10 billion (R160 billion) of Steinhoff's value wiped off the markets in a matter of days,&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt; with further losses as the situation unfolded.

==Early life==
Jooste's father was a postal worker and an avid [[horse racing|horse race]] punter, instilling also in his son an interest in the races.&lt;ref name =news24a/&gt;&lt;ref name="mg1"/&gt; Jooste matriculated from [[Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="insider1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Wet |first1=Phillip |title=Steinhoff’s Markus Jooste gave his old school R10 million, but no-one wants to touch it |url= https://www.businessinsider.co.za/affies-ringfenced-r10-million-from-markus-jooste-of-steinhoff-2018-2 |website= businessinsider.co.za |publisher=Business Insider SA |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2017 fallout in his business empire, he donated R10 million to the school's old-boys trust in his personal capacity. The donation has since been ring-fenced pending possible claims.&lt;ref name="insider1"/&gt;

He obtained a BAcc degree from [[Stellenbosch University]] in 1982,&lt;ref name="bloom3"&gt;{{cite web |title=Markus Johannes Jooste |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=8596826&amp;privcapId=22533711 |website=Company Overview of Steinhoff Europe AG: Executive Profile |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently obtained an honours degree&lt;ref name="biznews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biznews.com/entrepreneur/2016/06/03/markus-jooste-on-losing-bids-building-steinhoff-and-drawing-inspiration/ |title=Markus Jooste - On losing bids, building Steinhoff and drawing inspiration. - BizNews.com|date=3 June 2016 |work=biznews.com |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Cape Town]] while completing his CA(SA) articles at a company then owned by [[Christo Wiese]].&lt;ref name="ns1"/&gt;&lt;!--details still vague here--&gt;

==Career==
After training as a chartered accountant in his 20s,&lt;ref name="biznews.com"/&gt; he was appointed financial director of a publicly listed company. At age 27 he became the financial director of GommaGomma, where he met German entrepreneur [[Claas Daun]], who coached him in business.&lt;ref name =news24a/&gt; On his part, Jooste convinced Daun in 1998 to merge his business with that of [[Bruno Steinhoff]] in Europe, and to list [[Steinhoff International]] on the JSE.&lt;ref name="ah1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hogg |first1=Alec |title=The Steinhoff story – revisiting the humble roots of today’s R260bn giant |url= https://www.biznews.com/sa-investing/2015/06/19/the-steinhoff-story-revisiting-humble-roots-of-a-r260bn-giant/ |website=BizNews |publisher= biznews.com | date = 19 June 2015 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jooste and Daun acted as non-executive directors of Steinhoff International from 1988,&lt;ref name="ns1"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Schreuder |first1= Nica |title=8 things you didn’t know about former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste |url= https://citizen.co.za/news/news-cns/1753566/8-things-you-didnt-know-about-former-steinhoff-ceo-markus-jooste/|accessdate=25 December 2017 |work=Business |agency=The Citizen |publisher=citizen.co.za |date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pc1"/&gt; and Jooste became its CEO in 2000. In his role as CEO, he built the company through numerous acquisitions from a small furniture manufacturer to a large corporation in the furniture industry. Piet Ferreira, a former investment banker who joined Steinhoff in 2002, was instrumental in structuring its public offerings and complex acquisitions during his 15 year tenure.&lt;ref name="zarx1"&gt;{{cite web |title=ZXTWI - Change to Board of Directors: Appointment of Independent Non-executive Director |url= https://www.zarx.co.za/news/detail/change-to-board-of-directors-ZXTWI-20170703-01 |website=zarx.co.za| date = 3 July 2017 |accessdate= 29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mg3"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greig |first1=Marylou |title=Individual DealMaker of the Year – 2016 |url= https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/companies-and-deals/individual-dealmaker-of-the-year-2016/ |website= moneyweb.co.za |date= 10 February 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, they acquired [[Conforama]] in 2011 for €1,207-million,&lt;ref name="mg2"&gt;{{cite web |title= Steinhoff shareholders approve Conforama deal |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2011-03-14-steinhoff-shareholders-approve-conforama-deal |website=mg.co.za |publisher=Mail&amp;Gardian | date = 14 March 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deal that boosted revenues and growth.&lt;ref name="reut1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reuters|title=Steinhoff profit surges on Conforama buy |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/Steinhoff-profit-surges-on-Conforama-buy-20120306 |accessdate= 27 December 2017 |agency= fin24|date=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 through 2017 saw acquisitions in South Africa, the United Kingdom and United States,&lt;ref name= "bloom"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bloomberg |title=Steinhoff rejects allegations of dishonesty in accounting |url= https://www.fin24.com/Economy/South-Africa/steinhoff-rejects-allegations-of-dishonesty-in-accounting-20170825 |website= fin24.com | date = 27 August 2017 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included [[Mattress Firm]] for $2.4bn,&lt;ref name="rl1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laing |first1=Robert |title=Steinhoff’s US business secures $225m loan despite parent’s woes |url=https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/retail-and-consumer/2017-12-27-steinhoffs-us-business-secures-225m-loan-despite-parents-woes/|accessdate=27 December 2017|work=Companies / Retail |agency=BusinessDay |publisher= businesslive.co.za |date= 27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poundland]] for £597m in depressed retail conditions.&lt;ref name="aayj1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Armstrong |first1=Ashley |last2=Yeomans |first2=Jon|title=Poundland bought by South African group Steinhoff for £597m |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/13/steinhoff-picks-up-poundland-for-597m/ |accessdate=27 December 2017 |work=Business|agency=The Telegraph|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being partially funded with Steinhoff shares, the very large premium paid for Mattress Firm prompted scrutiny by independent analysts.&lt;ref name="vdm"/&gt; The financial press initially ascribed the growth in Jooste's empire to either good luck or fortuitous timing, but the dissenting voices grew silent as Steinhoff raked in 36% growth in its 2014/2015 reporting year.&lt;ref name="mg1"/&gt; 

In March 2015 Steinhoff bought [[Pepkor]] from Wiese and his Brait holding company at R63 billion (then €4.8 billion), implying a very high [[price–earnings ratio|p-e ratio]] of 37. After a failed merger with [[Shoprite (South Africa)|Shoprite]] in December 2016, Jooste and Wiese raised new capital in 2017 to split off Pepkor's South African division, a move received with some skepticism, as it was seen as a way to pay off Steinhoff’s South African debt.&lt;ref name="thom"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1= Stafford |title=Steinhoff: a giant raises its head |url= https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/money-and-investing/2017-05-25-steinhoff-a-giant-raises-its-head/ |accessdate= 15 June 2018 |agency=BusinessDay |date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pepkor acquisition also occurred without a cautionary announcement, raising suspicions at the [[Financial Services Board (South Africa)|FSB]] about possible [[insider trading]] leading up to the deal.&lt;ref name="insider2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Steinhoff, Brait share movements probed for insider trading |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Financial-Services/Steinhoff-Brait-share-movements-probed-for-insider-trading-20150625 |website=fin24.com |date = 25 June 2015| accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split implied a 71% holding in new entity, Star, which managed more than 5,000 South African stores, more than any other retailer.&lt;ref name="lerc"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Lerche |first1=David |title=Star: the curse of an embarrassing parent |url= https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/companies-and-deals/star-the-curse-of-an-embarrassing-parent/ |accessdate= 15 June 2018 |agency=Moneyweb |date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2015 Steinhoff announced that [[Oldenburg]] authorities had carried out a 26 November raid on its European headquarters in [[Westerstede]], Germany,&lt;ref name="raid"&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany raids Steinhoff offices ahead of listing |url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/germany-raids-steinhoff-offices-ahead-of-listing-20151204 |accessdate=8 August 2018 |publisher=fin24.com |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to review its balance sheet treatment of transfers to subsidiaries or third parties. Three days later, on 7 December, Steinhoff International Holdings transferred its primary listing from [[JSE Limited|Johannesburg]] to [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange|Frankfurt]], as, in Jooste's words, the majority of the firm’s stores, customers and revenues were in Europe.&lt;ref name="jc"&gt;{{cite web|last1= Cronje |first1=Jan |title=A Steinhoff guide for dummies | date = 8 December 2017 |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/a-steinhoff-guide-for-dummies-20171208 |website=fin24.com |accessdate= 20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though describing it as "an important day in the history of Steinhoff", Jooste chose not to leave Cape Town to attend the event, citing "neck pain" which precluded travelling.&lt;ref name="hb1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dörnfelder |first1=Andreas |last2=Köhler |first2=Peter |title= Börsengang ohne Chef |website=handelsblatt.com |publisher=Handelsblatt |url= https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/maerkte/aktien/steinhoff-international-boersengang-ohne-chef/12688024.html |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinhoff's share price peaked at R90 a share in 2016, making it the 15th largest company listed on the [[JSE Limited|Johannesburg]] exchange.&lt;ref name="pc1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cairns |first1=Patrick |title=The funds most exposed to Steinhoff |url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/investing/the-funds-most-exposed-to-steinhoff/ |website=Moneyweb |publisher=moneyweb.co.za |date = 6 December 2017 | accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] employed over 130,000 people on five continents, and had become the second-largest home goods retailer in Europe after [[Ikea]]. In 2017, while its stock was held by some 340 investment funds in South Africa, in part due to its low volatility,&lt;ref name=pc1/&gt; its financial position began to worsen as its [[Operating margin|operating profit margin]] fell and [[net debt]] increased.&lt;ref name="mm1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwarzer |first1=Ursula |last2=Clausen |first2=Sven |title= Chef des Möbelherstellers Steinhoff im Visier der Justiz |url=http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/steinhoff-ermittlungen-gegen-markus-jooste-wegen-bilanzfaelschung-a-1164191.html |website=manager-magazin.de | date = 24 August 2017 |publisher=Manager Magazin|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its March 2017 accounts showed €3.1 billion in cash reserves,&lt;ref name="clpj1"/&gt; and €18 billion ($21 billion) of exposure to creditors.&lt;ref name="jb1"/&gt;

Steinhoff limited its effective tax rate to between 8% and 12% for years, notwithstanding the company tax rate of 28% in South Africa, a fact pointed out as a red flag in the wake of the Steinhoff fallout.&lt;ref name="vdm"&gt;{{cite web |last1=van der Merwe |first1=Marelise |title=Steinhoff may be 'the tip of the iceberg' |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-07-24-steinhoff-may-be-the-tip-of-the-iceberg | date = 24 Jul 2018 |website=mg.co.za |publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Manager Magazin]]'' revealed in August 2017 that Jooste was one of the managers being investigated in Germany.&lt;ref name="mm1"/&gt; Prosecutors suspected that inflated revenues in the hundred million [[Euro]] range may have been reported on the balance sheets of subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; On 4 December 2017 Steinhoff Holdings disclosed that it would release unaudited annual statements, and the next day Jooste resigned his position as CEO amid allegations of fraud and corruption.&lt;ref name=iol-a&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/revealed-this-is-what-markus-jooste-said-to-staff-in-personal-letter-12298757 |title=REVEALED: This is what Markus Jooste said to staff in personal letter {{!}} IOL Business Report|access-date=December 5, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after he also resigned from Phumelela Gaming &amp; Leisure, Kenilworth Racing,&lt;ref name="sp1"&gt;{{cite web|title= Jooste – So Many Questions |url= https://www.sportingpost.co.za/2017/12/jooste-so-many-questions/ |website= sportingpost.co.za |publisher= sportingpost |date=16 December 2017 |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mayfair Speculators.&lt;ref name="le1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ensor |first1=Linda |title= High Court delays bid to liquidate assets of former Steinhoff boss |url= https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/business/2017-12-22-high-court-delays-bid-to-liquidate-assets-of-former-steinhoff-boss/ |accessdate=25 December 2017 |work=Business |agency=Sunday Times |publisher=timeslive.co.za |date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Steinhoff scandal ===

===Investigations and litigation===
[[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] was tasked with an investigation into possible accounting irregularities or non-compliance with laws and regulations, and resumption of audited statements were subject to its outcome. German prosecutors confirmed in December 2017 that they were still investigating four current and former managers of a group (identified in the German press as Steinhoff), for accounting fraud.&lt;ref name="cronje6"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cronje |first1=Jan |title= German prosecutors still probing Steinhoff for possible accounts fraud |url= https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Retail/german-prosecutors-still-probing-steinhoff-for-possible-accounts-fraud-20171207 |accessdate=15 June 2018 |publisher=fin24.com |date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhoff announced in February 2018 that they had submitted a report on Jooste to the [[Hawks (South Africa)|Hawks]] on suspicion of fraud, for investigation and potential prosecution.&lt;ref name="cronje2"/&gt; 

Christo Wiese’s Titan Group instituted a claim of R59 billion ($4.8 billion) against the Steinhoff conglomerate to recover cash investments made in 2015 and 2016. The prospects of this claim are however complicated by the fact that Wiese had been Steinhoff director since 2013.&lt;ref name="Ziady"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ziady |first1=Hanna |last2=Xolisa |first2=Phillip |title=Christo Wiese to sue Steinhoff for R59bn — but Dutch law may not allow it |url= https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/2018-04-26-breaking-christo-wiese-to-sue-steinhoff-for-r59bn/ |accessdate=13 June 2018 |agency=BusinessDay |date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiese had a 22% shareholding in Steinhoff, the European component of which appears to have been subject to margin loans with different banks.&lt;ref name="steyn"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steyn |first1=Lisa |title=Focus shifts to Steinhoff's ex-chair Christo Wiese |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-01-26-00-focus-shifts-to-steinhoffs-ex-chair-christo-wiese |accessdate=8 August 2018 |agency=Mail&amp;Guardian |publisher=mg.co.za |date=26 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 [[Barclays Africa Group|Absa Bank]] and [[Investec|Investec Plc]] applied for the liquidation of Mayfair Speculators, when Mayfair's Steinhoff shares failed to provide sufficient collateral for its overdraft facilities.&lt;ref name="rvn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="le1"/&gt; Absa, who was owed R350 million, expressed suspicion about R1.5 billion of assets that were transferred as a [[dividend]] in specie to Mayfair's holding company in August 2017.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt; According to court documents, Mayfair owed Sanlam capital markets, Investec Plc and Absa more than R1.2 billion ($94 million) in total.&lt;ref name="rb1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bonorchis |first1=Renee |title= Markus Jooste’s troubles deepen – Lenders sue over racehorse company non-payment |url= https://www.biznews.com/briefs/2017/12/21/jooste-racehorse-company-lenders-sue/ |website=BizNews |publisher=biznews.com | date = 21 December 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayfair disclosed liabilities of R1 billion and assets worth R350 million.&lt;ref name="rvn"/&gt; The [[Western Cape High Court]] postponed the banks' application,&lt;ref name="le1"/&gt; and the lenders subsequently agreed to grant Mayfair extension until the end of 2018 to facilitate a favourable disposal of its real estate and racehorses.&lt;ref name="prins"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prinsloo |first1=Loni |last2=Bowker |first2=John |title= Steinhoff’s Markus Jooste thrown a lifeline by banks |url= https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/retail-and-consumer/2018-04-25-steinhoffs-markus-jooste-thrown-a-lifeline-by-banks/ |accessdate=13 June 2018 |agency=BusinessDay |date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, a Dutch shareholders association, [[:nl:Vereniging van Effectenbezitters|VEB]], filed for damages against [[Deloitte]] in [[Rotterdam]], for their failure in vetting the accounts of retailer Steinhoff Int. NV. The association planned to hold the directors, company, accountants, and potentially the banks that promoted Steinhoff's listing, jointly responsible.&lt;ref name="ster"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sterling |first1=Toby |title=Steinhoff’s Dutch shareholders file lawsuit against Deloitte |url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/companies-and-deals/steinhoffs-dutch-shareholders-file-lawsuit-against-deloitte/ |website=moneyweb.co.za |publisher=Moneyweb |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German raid of 2015 recovered documents supposedly signed by Andreas Seifert, co-managing director of furniture chain XXXLutz. Seifert denied ever having seen or signed the papers, and filed criminal charges for document forgery.&lt;ref name="mm1"/&gt; After filing additional lawsuits against Steinhoff in three countries, Seifert managed in April 2018 formalize his controlling stake in POCO, which Steinhoff disputed.&lt;ref name="matus"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Matussek |first1=Karin |last2=Simon |first2=Zoltan |title=Seifert, ending a bitter dispute |url= https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/retail-and-consumer/2018-04-26-steinhoff-sells-half-of-poco-to-andreas-seifert-ending-a-bitter-dispute/ |accessdate=14 June 2018 |agency=BusinessDay |date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Owner Markus Jooste.svg|thumb|right|150px|&lt;center&gt;Jooste's racing silks]]
Jooste entered the horse racing industry in the 1990s with 250 horses, and became the second biggest horse-racing investor in Africa,&lt;ref name="speck"/&gt; or perhaps the world.&lt;ref name="mg1"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Goss|first1=Mick |title=Who's Who In The Thoroughbred Zoo |url= http://www.summerhill.co.za/blog/2015/10/9/markus-jooste|website=Summerhill Stud |publisher= summerhill.co.za | date = 9 October 2015 |accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jooste and his son in law, Stefan Potgieter, manage their horse racing interests through Mayfair Speculators, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mayfair Holdings that was founded in 1987. In 2004 Jooste became a partner in Klawervlei Stud, together with Johan du Plessis, Danie van der Merwe and John Koster, and they chose the [[four-leaf clover]] as their emblem.&lt;ref name="dt1"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thiselton |first1=David |title= Klawervlei on a High |url=http://www.seantarryracing.co.za/info_det.asp?ID=146|website=Sean Tarry Racing Stables |publisher=seantarryracing.co.za |accessdate=25 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next decade other prominent investors joined the enterprise.&lt;ref name="mg1"/&gt; 

Jooste's first horse, the stallion National Emblem, was bought for R100,000 in 1993 and became a champion.&lt;ref name="ns1"/&gt; Mayfair Speculators owned South Africa’s best racehorse, Legal Eagle, a six-time Grade 1 winner, and Edict Of Nantes, a dual Grade 1 winner. They were sold in December 2017 for R3.2 million and R9.9 million respectively.&lt;ref name="speck"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Speckman |first1=Asha |title=Markus Jooste flogs his prize horses | date = 17 December 2017 |url= https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/sunday-times/20171217/283210148589185 |website=Final Furlong |publisher=Sunday Times |accessdate= 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, The Conglomerate won the [[Durban July Handicap|Durban July]] as an outsider.&lt;ref name="vcdj1"&gt;{{cite web|title=“Striker” gives first July victory to Ramsden and the Joostes |url= https://vodacomdurbanjuly.co.za/2016/07/05/striker-gives-first-july-victory-to-ramsden-and-the-joostes/ |website=vodacomdurbanjuly.co.za |date = 5 July 2016 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jooste, in various partnerships, was a regular buyer at racing sales. In 2014 he impressed with his buying power at [[Arqana]]'s premium sale in [[Deauville]]. In 2015 he added 12 yearlings to his stables at [[Tattersalls]] Book One,&lt;ref name="mg1"/&gt; for a total of ₤4.3 million.&lt;ref name="sp2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jooste Spends Big At Tattersalls |url= https://www.sportingpost.co.za/2015/10/tattersalls-october-yearling-sale-2015-jooste-spends-big-at-tattersalls/ |website= sportingpost.co.za |publisher=sportingpost | date = 10 October 2015 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, Mayfair acquired 9 yearlings at the yearling sale in [[county Kildare]], Ireland for €2.3 million in total.&lt;ref name="speck"/&gt; In partnership with [[John Magnier|MV Magnier]], they bought a filly at Tattersalls for ₤1.68 million in October 2017.&lt;ref name="sp3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayfair Speculators Hit Seven Figure Mark |url= https://www.sportingpost.co.za/2017/10/tattersalls-october-yearling-sale-book-1-mayfair-speculators-hit-seven-figure-mark/ |website= sportingpost | publisher= sportingpost.co.za |accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he was named Equus SA's racehorse owner of the year for the 10th time in a row.&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1= Stafford |title=Jooste’s horses: shutting the stable door... |url= https://www.businesslive.co.za/fm/money-and-investing/2017-12-21-joostes-horses-shutting-the-stable-door-/ |accessdate=27 December 2017 |agency= financialmail |publisher=businesslive.co.za |date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2017 Mayfair Speculators owned 350 horses in training, 100 mares for breeding,&lt;ref name="speck"/&gt; a considerable property portfolio, a 49% share in Klawervlei horse-breeding farm at [[Bonnievale, Western Cape|Bonnievale]],&lt;ref name="rvn"/&gt; and Steinhoff shares which were used as collateral.&lt;ref name="rvn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Niekerk |first1=Ryk |title=Absa applies for Jooste-linked company’s liquidation | date= 21 December 2017 |url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/companies-and-deals/absa-applies-for-jooste-linked-companys-liquidation/ |website=Moneyweb |accessdate= 21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayfair Speculators was also a shareholder in Cape Thoroughbred Sales (CTS), of which Jooste was a director.&lt;ref name="rvn"/&gt;

'''Mushroom management'''{{course assignment | course = Education Program:University College London/MSIN1003 Information World (Autumn 2014) | term = 2014 Q3}}, also known as '''Pseudo-Analysis''' or '''Blind Development''',  is a mocking term used to describe the running of a company where the [[Internal communications|communication]] channels between the [[management|managers]] and the [[employee]]s do not work properly.&lt;ref name=oxfordref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom management|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100218343|website=Oxford Reference|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term alludes to the stereotypical (and somewhat inaccurate) view of [[mushroom cultivation]]: "Kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure".

==Description==
Mushroom management is a style of [[management]] in which the personnel are not familiar with the ideas or the general state of the company, and are given work without knowing the purpose of this work, in contrast with [[open-book management]]. Mushroom management means that workers' curiosity and self-expression are not supported. The employees often have no idea what the company's overall situation is, because the leaders tend to make all the decisions on their own, without asking anyone else to give their opinion.&lt;ref name="maranna"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mar|first1=Anna|title=Mushroom Management|url=http://management.simplicable.com/management/new/mushroom-management|website=Simplicable- business guide|publisher=Simplicable|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can occur when the manager does not understand the employees' work (in a programming company, for example) and therefore cannot communicate effectively with the employees.&lt;ref name="CRS Press"/&gt;  
 
Mushroom management can also be found in environments that are unrelated to business. It can sometimes be found within schools, when students working in a group decide not to share information with the other students in the group. This means that they will appear more intelligent and hardworking during assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom Management|url=https://projectwiki.sis.uta.fi/wiki/Mushroom_Management|website=ProjectWIki|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
The main reasons for the development of mushroom management within a company can be found at the managerial level. Mushroom management often develops when managers see themselves as the sole decision-makers within the company, rather than the people who lead all the employees towards a shared success. This can often take place unintentionally: managers fear that their employees will discover important new ideas instead of them, which drives the managers to make bad decisions and prevent employees from taking an active role in their work. As a result, the employees end up doing this work in a mechanical, repeated fashion, without contributing in a more productive or active way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mushroom Management|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/leadership/articles/mushroom_management.htm|website=Changing Minds|publisher=Changing Minds|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The key feature of mushroom management is that the employees have limited responsibility over the company. The importance of the decisions they have to make is minimal, which can often reduce [[Occupational stress|workplace-related stress]].&lt;ref name="CRS Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=Colin|last2=Laplante|first2=Phillip|title=Antipatterns: Identification,Refactoring and Management|date=2006|publisher=CRS Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|pages=120-121|url=https://books.google.sk/books?id=6t3KzeaO7FIC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=mushroom+management+book&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aLAgIeqeCG&amp;sig=cfQNC15pWOowgYksgduyxQMzdkY&amp;hl=sk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WaRHVP-rD8bD7gbr_IDgBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mushroom%20management%20book&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The consequences of mushroom management can be extremely detrimental for everyone involved in the company. If the flow of information within a company is insufficient, the people involved often have a limited understanding of how to react in situations that require quick assessment and prompt [[decision making]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gregory|title=Mushroom Management- Don't keep your workforce in the dark|url=http://www.managerwise.com/article.phtml?id=304|publisher=ManagerWise|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a company that makes and sells shoes might research their customers' preferences and discover that these preferences have changed. However, if this piece of information is not passed on to the sales manager of an individual shop, then the shop will still display the "old" shoes and will not attract the customers' attention effectively. At the end of this process, the blame is sometimes even attributed to the shop assistants, because they are the employees in a direct contact with the customers.&lt;ref name="CRS Press"/&gt;

==Examples==

===Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers===
[[File:Richard S. Fuld, Jr. at World Resources Institute forum.jpg|thumb||[[Richard Fuld]], [[Lehman Brothers]] CEO.]]
During the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] in 2008, considerable information about the bank's management was revealed, including the way [[Richard S. Fuld, Jr.]], the former CEO, organised the bank. The bank had started to concentrate more and more on excessively risky mortgages; however, neither the employees nor the public were aware of the bank's financial situation.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harress|first1=Christopher|last2=Caulderwood|first2=Kathleen|title=The Death Of Lehman Brothers: What Went Wrong, Who Paid The Price And Who Remained Unscathed Through The Eyes Of Former Vice-President|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/death-lehman-brothers-what-went-wrong-who-paid-price-who-remained-unscathed-through-eyes-former-vice|website=International Business Times|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuld, together with other managers, had kept a significant amount of essential information secret, as well as lying to the investors and to all other involved parties. Everybody else had thought that Lehman Brothers were involved with a variety of investments, including both safe and risky investments; in reality, though, they had been working with a much more risky portfolio than was appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Montgomery|first1=Ashileigh|title=The Dearth of Ethics and the Death of Lehman Brothers|url=http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/case-studies/the-dearth-of-ethics-and-the-death-of-lehman-brothers|website=Sevenpillars Institute|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the bank became bankrupt, Fuld refused to take the blame for any of these events, even though he was responsible for the concealment of the information.&lt;ref name="ibtimes.com"/&gt;  

===Sinking of the ''Titanic''===
[[File:Stöwer Titanic.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' sinking.]]
Mushroom management can also occur during the handling of one-off, individual situations. When the ship ''[[Titanic]]'' hit an iceberg, only a few members of the crew were aware that the ship was going to sink. Most of the crewmen were not informed about the seriousness of the situation by the captain, which resulted in chaos and disorganisation. The captain attempted to act on his own, without incorporating the officers into his decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smart|first1=John M.|title=Saving the Titanic- Crowdsourcing to Find Hard Solutions, and Unlearning to Implement Them|url=https://eversmarterworld.wordpress.com/tag/mushroom-management/|website=Ever Smart World|publisher=John M. Smart|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
Sharing information with co-workers and employees is often unavoidable; however, one of the most important tasks for a manager is to differentiate between information that can be shared with others and information that cannot be shared. A company should not share all its information with its employees, because that could be even more damaging. Managers should learn how to distribute information and how to communicate with the people they are responsible for.&lt;ref name="maranna" /&gt; The best way to avoid mushroom management is [[Transparency (behaviour)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monty|first1=Scott|title=Why transparency and authenticity wins in business and in marketing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/17/why-transparency-and-authenticity-wins-in-business-and-in-marketing|website=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Good mushroom management==
Sometimes, mushroom management can be very helpful if it is handled carefully. This method involves the company's employees being divided into various groups, each of which has all the information which it specifically needs but nothing more, similar to a [[need to know]] approach taken in the military to control access to sensitive material. Meanwhile, the manager is in charge of giving each group the required information. This kind of management is extremely difficult, though, and requires considerable skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=Simon|title=I suck at mushroom management|url=http://consultingblogs.emc.com/simonmunro/archive/2008/10/20/i-suck-at-mushroom-management.aspx|website=EMC Consulting|publisher=EMC|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy of mushroom cultivation analogy==
The term refers to the stereotypical view of [[mushroom cultivation]], where mushrooms are "kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure".&lt;ref name=oxfordref/&gt; In fact, the most commonly cultivated mushroom, ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'' is grown on a [[pasteurized]] [[compost]] substrate, not raw [[manure]] (common raw ingredients in [[mushroom compost]] are horse manure and straw). The chemical and microbiological nature of finished compost is, however, quite different from raw manure.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Mushrooms are fungi rather than plants and therefore do not use photosynthesis. They can grow without light, but do not actually require darkness in order to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer DM. 2003. [http://extension.psu.edu/publications/ul210/view ''Basic Procedures for'' Agaricus ''Mushroom Growing'']. Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension.&lt;/ref&gt; Most mushroom cultivation is in fact done in dark locations (such as caves) for reasons of utility and to save on the expense of lighting, or, as with the case of the aforementioned ''Agaricus bisporus'', for appearance reasons. Light tends to give the mushrooms a brownish tint. Marketing research has shown the overwhelming customer preference for lighter specimens, so most of the producers try to limit light exposure. Some cultivated mushroom species, however, may need periodic exposure to light in order to induce fruition.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Paul Isenberg''' (April 15, 1837 – January 16, 1903) was a [[German people|German]] businessman who developed the [[sugarcane]] business in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

==Life==
Paul Heinrich Friedrich Carl Isenberg was born April 15, 1837 in [[Dransfeld]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite web |title= Finding Aid for Isenberg Collection |work= Kaua’i Historical Society |year= 2010 |author=Marylou Bradley and Carolyn Dettling |url= http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms_57_isenberg_collection.pdf |accessdate= September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister Daniel Isenberg (1807–1875), and mother was Dorothea (Strauch) Isenberg (1808–1871).
He came to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1858, and became known as Paul Isenberg.

Isenberg moved to the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] and first worked in [[Wailua, Kauai|Wailua]]. 
In October 1861 he married Hannah "Maria" Rice, daughter of [[William Harrison Rice]], who was born February 17, 1842, and died April 7, 1867.
They had two children, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg (1862–1949) and Daniel Paul Rice Isenberg (1866–1919) known as "Paul Jr."
He traveled back to Germany in 1869 where he married Beta Margarete Glade (born 1846) before returning to Hawaii. They had six more children:  Johannes "John" Carl Isenberg (born September 12, 1870), Heinrich Alexander Isenberg (born January 17, 1872), Julie Maria Pauline (Isenberg) Barckhausen (born November 1876), Clara Margarete (Isenberg) Wendroth (born 1878), Richard Menno Isenberg (born 1880) and Paula Bertha Johanna Isenberg (born 1883).&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;

Isenberg took over managing the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] at [[Lihue, Hawaii|Līhuʻe]] in 1862, after the death of his father-in-law who was previous manager.
The plantation was founded by diplomat [[Henry A. Peirce]], but struggled to make a profit until Rice built an irrigation system.
Isenberg made improvements to the [[cane sugar mill]] such as using an evaporating pan and steam pipes to concentrate the cane juice.
In 1872 the Lihue Plantation company was officially incorporated, and the {{convert |3300|acre}} expanded by {{convert |17000|acre}} at [[Hanamaulu, Hawaii|Hanamāʻulu]].&lt;ref name="lihue"&gt;{{cite web |title= Finding Aid for Lihue Plantation Collection |work= Kaua’i Historical Society |year= 2009 |author= Marylou Bradley |url= http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms45_lihue_plantation_finding_aid.pdf |accessdate= September 24, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213834/http://www.kauaihistoricalsociety.org/assets/finding_aids/ms45_lihue_plantation_finding_aid.pdf |archivedate= July 26, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 24, 1874 he was appointed to the upper House of Nobles in the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] by King [[Lunalilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5b09/3945a7b2.dir/Isenberg,%20Paul%20Daniel%20Rice%20I.jpg |title= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice I office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }} Note name not accurate&lt;/ref&gt;
He officially became a citizen of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Citizenship - Naturalization: page 51 Ieatmann - Ives |D29-000052 |q=Isenberg |dic=gene |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1877 he bought equipment for a new mill from [[George Norton Wilcox]] and installed it at Hanamāʻulu to be managed by [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]].&lt;ref name="lihue"/&gt;

In 1878 Isenberg retired as plantation manager, but kept an ownership interest while moving his family back to [[Bremen]] in Germany. He visited the islands at least every two years for legislative sessions. His brother Carl Isenberg then managed the plantation.
In 1881 Isenberg became a business partner with earlier German merchant Heinrich Hackfeld in his Hackfeld &amp; Company.&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg34bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although most other plantation laborers were Chinese or Japanese, Isenberg arranged for groups of workers from Bremen to settle on his company's plantations.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134–135}}
In the 1887 session of the legislature, he was one of the few who objected to the threat of military force that caused the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] to be called the "Bayonet Constitution".&lt;ref name="kingdom3"/&gt;{{rp|361–362}}

He died in Bremen on January 16, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Paul Isenberg Dies at Bremen, in the 66th Year of his Age |newspaper= Hawaiian Gazette |location= Honolulu |date= January 20, 1903 |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1903-01-20/ed-1/seq-6/ |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Big Five Hawaii}}
Hackfeld &amp; Company grew to be one of the "[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]" corporations that dominated the economy of the [[Territory of Hawaii]].
During [[World War I]], Hackfeld &amp; Company was seized by the U.S. government [[Alien Property Custodian]] along with other assets owned by Germans. It was sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to "American Factors" and the company's store [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]]. A 1920 lawsuit argued the price was below market value, and some former stockholders including John Carl Isenberg recovered some damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/462 |title= German Sugar's Sticky Fingers |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |volume= 16 |author= Frederick Bernays Wiener |year= 1982 |pages= 15–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, the name was further shortened to [[Amfac, Inc.]]

His son Paul Jr. married Annie Beatrice McBryde, daughter of neighboring sugar planter Duncan McBryde on October 19, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |Oahu (1832-1910) marriage record |D09-000108 |q=Isenberg |dic=gene |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 1891  [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] appointed him to the [[Privy Council]]. From 1898 to 1915 he was elected as representative to the house of representatives of the [[Territory of Hawaii]], and from 1902 to 1905 the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHc539/62b67ce7.dir/Isenberg,%20Daniel%20Paul%20Rice%20II.jpg |title= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice (II) office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He married Bertha Koepke on August 9, 1916, and they had one child, Dorothea "Dora" Jane Isenberg  (1917–1988), who married Joseph Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg33bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Daniel Paul Rice }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cole was first manager of the [[Kauai Museum|Kaua{{okina}}i Museum]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kauaʻi Museum |work= official web site |url= http://www.kauaimuseum.org/ |accessdate= October 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1887 his younger brother Johannes Friedrich Wilhelm "Hans" Isenberg (1855–1918) was brought in to be pastor of the first Lutheran church on the island for the immigrants who starting arriving in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Our History &amp; Heritage |work= official web page |publisher= Lihue Lutheran Church |url= http://www.lihuelutheran.com/ |accessdate= September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hans had married his own niece, Paul's first child, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg, known as Dora, in 1883.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;

The '''Phipps–McElveen Building''' at 525–529 Penn Avenue in [[Downtown Pittsburgh|downtown]] [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], [[United States|USA]]

==History==
The building was built in 1896 by [[Henry Phipps Jr.]], an early business partner of [[Andrew Carnegie]], real estate developer, and philanthropist. 

The building served as the location of the McElveen furniture store for about 20 years. By 1919 it was occupied by a clothier, Oppenhiem, Collins &amp; Company, who stayed there until the late 1930s. 

Thereafter it was occupied by [[Walgreens]], another furniture store, and a recreation center.&lt;ref name=nom&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=David L.|title=Phipps–McElveen Building|url={{NRHP-PA|H110781_01H.pdf}}|work=National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form|publisher=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=January 21, 2014|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 5, 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14253">In transportation, the '''Physical Internet®''' refers to the combination of digital transportation networks that are deploying to replace analog road networks. As the Internet has resolved itself into niche implementations for high-speed (fiberoptics), local area networks (Wifi), and local device (BlueTooth). ET3 and Hyperloop are currently high speed examples. JPods are examples of urban networks.

The Physical Internet Initiative's manifesto is "Transforming the way physical objects are handled, moved, stored, realized, supplied and used, aiming towards global logistics efficiency and sustainability."&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt; It attempts to achieve this by applying concepts from internet data transfer to real-world shipping processes.&lt;ref name="Trebilcock"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhl"&gt;Andel, Tom.

The Digital Internet does not transmit information: it transmits packets with embedded information. These packets are designed for ease of use in the Digital Internet. The information within a packet is encapsulated and is not dealt with by Internet. The packet header contains all information required for identifying the packet and routing it correct to destination.  A packet is constructed for a specific transmission and it is dismantled once it has reached its destination. The Digital Internet is based on a protocol structuring data packets independently from equipment. In this way, data packets can be processed by different systems and through various networks: modems, copper wires, fiber optic wires, routers, etc.; local area networks, wide area networks, etc.; Intranets, Extranets, Virtual Private Networks, etc.&lt;ref name="benoit6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Montreuil|first=Benoit|title=Towards a Physical Internet: Meeting the Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge, Logistics Research|year=2011|location=Vol. 3, No. 2-3|pages=71–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Physical Internet does not manipulate physical goods directly, whether they are materials, parts, merchandises or yet products. It manipulates exclusively containers that are explicitly designed for the Physical Internet and that encapsulate physical goods within them.&lt;ref name="benoit6" /&gt;

The vision of the Physical Internet involves encapsulating goods in smart, ecofriendly and modular containers ranging from the size of a maritime container to the size of a small box. It thus generalizes the maritime container that succeeded to support globalization and shaped ships and ports, and extends containerization to logistics services in general. The Physical Internet moves the border of the private space to be inside of the container instead of the warehouse or the truck. These modular containers will be continuously monitored and routed, exploiting their digital interconnection through the [[Internet of Things]].

The Physical Internet encapsulates physical objects in physical packets or containers, hereafter termed π-containers so as to differentiate them from current containers. These π-containers are world-standard, smart, green and modular containers. They are notably modularized and standardized worldwide in terms of dimensions, functions and fixtures.&lt;ref name="benoit6" /&gt;

[[File:P-containers.png|framed|Figure 1. Illustrating the modularity of unitary and composite π-containers]]
The π-containers are key elements enabling the interoperability necessary for the adequate functioning of the Physical Internet. They must be designed to facilitate their handling and storage in the physical nodes of the Physical Internet, as well as their transport between these nodes and of course to protect goods. They act as packets in the digital Internet. They have an information part analogous to the header in the digital Internet. The π-containers encapsulate their content, making the contents irrelevant to the Physical Internet.&lt;ref name="benoit8"&gt;Extract from Montreuil, B., R. D. Meller and E. Ballot, "Towards a Physical Internet: the impact on logistics facilities and material handling systems design and innovation," in Progress in Material Handling Research, Edited by K. Gue et al., Material Handling Industry of America, 23 p., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a physical perspective, π-containers must be easy to handle, store, transport, seal, snap to a structure, interlock, load, unload, build and dismantle.

From an informational perspective, each π-container has a unique worldwide identifier, such as the MAC address in the Ethernet network and the digital Internet. This identifier is attached to each π-container both physically and digitally for ensuring identification robustness and efficiency. A smart tag is attached to each π-container to act as its representing agent. It contributes to ensuring π-container identification, integrity, routing, conditioning, monitoring, traceability and security through the Physical Internet. Such smart tagging enables the distributed automation of a wide variety of handling, storage and routing operations. In order to deal adequately with privacy and competitiveness concerns within the Physical Internet, the smart tag of a π-container strictly restricts information access by pertinent parties. Only the information necessary for the routing of π-containers through the Physical Internet are accessible for everyone.&lt;ref name="benoit8" /&gt;

===CELDi Physical Internet Project===

Establishing the logistics system gain efficiency of the Physical Internet
was the focus of a research project funded by the U.S. National Science
Foundation (NSF) and conducted in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi).  The project found that the expected annual benefits of the Physical Internet, if adopted in the U.S., would be:  a reduction in costs of over $100B, a reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of over 200 Tg, and a reduction in driver turnover of up to 75% .

Retrieved on 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modulushca Project===

The objective of Modulushca project is to achieve the first genuine contribution to the development of interconnected logistics at the European level, in close coordination with North American partners and the international Physical Internet Initiative. The goal of the project is to enable operations with developed iso-modular logistics units of sizes adequate for real modal and co-modal flows of [[fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG), providing a basis for an interconnected logistics system for 2030. Modulushca will establish a robust and replicable methodology to develop and evaluate solutions for interconnected logistics looking at other elements of the supply chain. Two implementation pilots will be executed integrating key Modulushca developments in significantly different supply chains.

The Modulushca project aims to develop a new interconnected logistics organization based on [[containerization]] for FMCG supply chains. This new organization is motivated by the prominence of FMCG for Europe as an industry and as end consumer markets.

The analysis of FMCG supply chains shows dedicated, overlapped networks leading to fragmented flows of goods across Europe despite huge volumes. Actual operations of FMCG supply chains raise several issues relative to utilization of assets such as transportation means and warehouses; end customer service levels; [[ecological footprint]] with growing GHG emissions and materials wastes; and social responsibility with painful jobs. The main hypothesis explored here is that these facts are induced by the contemporary design of supply networks and operations. Thus a new logistic concept is required to solve these issues: the Physical Internet. This concept aims to change logistics as the Digital Internet changed computer networks. The Physical Internet is a new way to design more open and interconnected logistics networks and services, leading to a more efficient and sustainable way of moving, storing, realizing, supplying and using physical goods in general, including FMCGs.

The interconnection of logistics services is motivated by the inefficiency and the unsustainability of our current logistics organization, putting at risk the very core of our lifestyle. Transportation is a major problem with many negative well-known side effects such as oil dependency, CO2 emissions, congestion, and health-related issues for logistics personnel. Despite all efforts already undertaken to improve engine technologies, the flows are still growing, resulting in CO2 emissions growing too.

At least two approaches are currently explored to tackle this Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge.&lt;ref name="Trebilcock" /&gt; These approaches focus on logistics organization and they are based on the fact that to significantly improve the use of transportation, handling and storage means we need to re-establish the [[economies of scale]] that today are diluted by smaller, dedicated networks, as well as [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-in-Time]] replenishment policies.

The scope of MODULUSHCA project is:
* To set the landscape by elaborating the Physical Internet enabled interconnected logistics vision and by developing and demonstrating core components of this vision;
* To achieve both a simulation-based and a field-based proof of concept by gradually implementing and testing key functions of interconnected logistics and involving key stakeholder groups through all development and implementation phases;
* To ensure a global synchronization with concurrent projects in the USA and Canada within the international Physical Internet initiative, and pave the way for a common and early market implementation at the intercontinental level.

Modulushca efforts will lead to the development of a road map towards a fully interconnected logistics system by 2030. The road map will address the changes and necessary steps to change the logistics system gradually, exploiting progresses in digital, physical and operational interconnectivity, building on current players, assets and infrastructures.

An international consortium coordinated by PTV Group leads the project, with relevant partners as the companies Procter&amp;Gamble, Chep, Jan de Rijk Logistics and Poste Italiane; the Universities of Graz, TU Berlin, Laval and Lausanne; the research centers  ILIM, ITENE and MINES PARISTECH; and the consultancies Inception Consulting, Kirsen Global Security and Meware SRL.

===ATROPINE Project===

The goal of the project ATROPINE (Fast Track to the Physical Internet) is to demonstrate a Physical Internet region in Upper Austria. Researchers and industry partners join forces to design a Physical Internet model region with an open logistics system that follows standardized protocols. 

Through this ATROPINE project Upper Austrian businesses have the opportunity to be amongst the first to get to know new technologies, products and solutions in the Physical Internet research and business area. The project findings will show how companies can optimize transport costs through cooperation and how they can simultaneously increase productivity. Ecological benefits result from reducing the consumption of energy and resources and prevent pollution by lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

The project is managed by the LOGISTIKUM of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria and planned for two years (12/2015 - 12/2017). It is funded by the Upper Austrian government program 'Innovatives Oberösterreich 2020'. More information is available here: [http://www.logistikum.at www.logistikum.at]

The '''Public Relations Society of America''' ('''PRSA''') is a [[501(c) organization|nonprofit]] [[trade association]] for public relations professionals headquartered in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s, the society created its code of conduct, accreditation program and a student society called the Public Relations Student Society of America. In the 1970s and 1980s, its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents. PRSA created a definition of public relations in 1982, which was updated with a crowd-sourced version in 2011.

PRSA is governed by a Leadership Assembly that consists of delegates representing its membership, a board of directors and various committees and task forces. Positions are elected and served on a volunteer basis. PRSA hosts an accreditation program, industry awards, networking events and a code of conduct. PRSA also advocates on behalf of the public relations industry for changes in education and for the credibility of the profession.

==Organization==
PRSA is organized as a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization]] and governed by a set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well as anyone that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively.&lt;ref name="bylaws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/Governance/BylawsDocuments/Bylaws/PRSABylaws.pdf|title=Public Relations Society of America Bylaws|publisher=PRSA|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRSA has more than 100 chapters&lt;ref name="org"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Advertising &amp; Marketing Review|url=http://www.ad-mkt-review.com/public_html/docs/fs165.html|title=Colorado Chapter of PRSA celebrates 50-year History|first=Mary Pat|last=Adams|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ten districts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Network/Chapters/|title=More Than 100 U.S.-Based Chapters|publisher=PRSA|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300 student chapters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/AboutPRSA/Leadership/PRSASectionCouncil/index.html|title=Section Council|publisher=PRSA|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 interest groups.&lt;ref name="org"/&gt;

Since the 1970s, the PRSA had restricted the right to sit in the group's national assembly or to seek election to the national board to those possessing an [[Accreditation in Public Relations|APR certification]]. The requirement for the assembly was dropped in 2004, but was maintained for those seeking board membership. In 2010 a revolt led by [[Richard Edelman]] and a group calling itself "the Committee for a Democratic PRSA" called for the restriction to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odwyerpr.com/blog/index.php?/archives/921-PRSA-Leaders-Revolt-Vs.-APRs.html |title=PRSA Leaders Revolt Vs.

==Research and advocacy==
The Public Relations Society of America and the [[Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication]] commissioned studies in 1975 and 1987 on the state of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major.&lt;ref name="mass"&gt;Fischer, Rick. "Rethinking Public Relations Curricula: Evolution Of Thought 1975-1999." Public Relations Quarterly 45.2 (2000): 16-20. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 29 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career.&lt;ref name="mass"/&gt; PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=December 7, 2011|title=Public Relations: Coming to a B-School Near You|accessdate=October 24, 2012|url=http://www.businessweek.com/business-schools/public-relations-coming-to-a-bschool-near-you-12072011.html|newspaper=BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''real defense''' is a justification for a maker or drawer not to honor a [[negotiable instrument]] even if it has been transferred to a [[holder in due course]] (or "HDC") because it makes the instrument “void” according to [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §3-305 comment 1,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-305.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus the defense can’t be "cut off" by the transfer to an HDC.  Contrast this with personal defenses (such as failure of [[consideration]]), which cannot protect the maker against the claims by an HDC.

==Ten types of real defenses depending upon state law==
1. Fraud inducing obligor to sign instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms (also known as “(fraud in the factum”); this depends upon consideration of “all relevant factors”;

2. forgery of a necessary signature;

3. adjudicated insanity which renders the instrument void;

4. material alteration of the instrument, such as the amount;

5. infancy which renders the instrument voidable or void;

6. illegality which renders the instrument void;

7. duress at the time of making the instrument;

8. discharge of obligor in insolvency proceedings, or any discharge known to the HDC;

9. a suretyship defense, such as the holder knew an indorser was signing as a surety or accommodation party;

10. statute of limitation (generally 3 years after dishonor of a draft or 6 years after demand or other due date on a note).

'''Refaat El-Sayed''' (born 11 February 1946 in Egypt) is a businessman of Egyptian and Swedish nationality, who made most of his career in Sweden. At the beginning of the 1980s, he took command of a small [[biotechnology|biotech]] company, Fermenta, which he quickly turned into one of the success stories of the [[Stockholm]] stock exchange. El-Sayed soon became Sweden's richest man, and made the fortune of his employees and shareholders. A charismatic leader, he was a favourite of the media, and in December 1985 he was named "[[Swede of the year]]" by the TV news program ''[[Rapport (television programme)|Rapport]]''. The following month, Fermenta announced a partnership with Swedish industrial giant [[Volvo]]. El-Sayed was at the peak of his fame.

The fall from grace was brutal: just one month later, El-Sayed was accused of lying about his academic qualifications, as he had falsely asserted he was a Doctor of Science. The partnership with Volvo was broken. In 1992, El-Sayed became the CEO of another biotech company, Hebi Health Care.

== Early life ==
El-Sayed was born 11 February 1946 in a small town in Northern Egypt. As a teenager, he showed an early interest in [[microbiology]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 02:16 – 02:24 : ''Refaat El-Sayed föddes 1946...&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated to Sweden in 1966, and started working as a laboratory assistant at the Fiskeby paper mill in [[Norrköping]]. He then resumed his studies, at first in Stockholm, before joining the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences|University of Agricultural Sciences]] at [[Ultuna]] near [[Uppsala]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 02:50 – 03:11 : ''1966 kommer Refaat till Sverige...''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, he left Sweden for the [[United States]], where he worked as a consultant for [[SDS Biotech]], and studied at [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] in [[California]]. This helped him build a relationship network, which would become handy in later stages of his career. His ambition was to start a biotechnology company, and to develop his inventions and patents in the field of water purification. In the mid-1970s, he acquired his first company, which he renamed Mikrokem.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 04:12 – 05:05 : ''Efter det ägnar Refaat tid åt att resa...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, he turned his attention to Fermenta, a subsidiary of [[AstraZeneca|Astra]] located in [[Strängnäs]] near Stockholm. Fermenta's main output was raw materials used for the production of antibiotics, an activity considered at the time of low strategic value. It was an ageing, money losing business, which Astra was eager to get rid of. El-Sayed became the new owner after taking a loan of one million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] from [[Handelsbanken]]. But in order to develop itself, Fermenta needed even more money, and El-Sayed decided to go public, at a time that marked the start of a bull run for the Stockholm stock exchange.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 10:21 – 12:45 : ''1981 får Refaat upp ögonen på...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success ==
In the first half of the 1980s, the Fermenta stock price rose steadily, which allowed El-Sayed to embark on a campaign of acquisition. In early 1985, he notably bought [[Pierrel]] from Italian industrial [[Vittorio de Nora]]. Pierrel's activities were diversified; they included pharmacy, with the production of antibiotics, chemicals, with [[aspartam]], etc... El-Sayed's plan was to retain only the activities he was interested in, and to sell other operations for a profit. Through this campaign of acquisition, he was hoping to turn Fermenta into a giant in the biotechnology sector. Just after taking the control of Pierrel, El-Sayed presented his new board of directors, which included big names of the Swedish business scene, such as [[Ove Sundberg]] from [[AkzoNobel|KemaNobel]], [[Gösta Bystedt]] and [[Simon Liliedahl]] from [[Electrolux]], and advertising guru [[Leon Nordin]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 12:45 – 15:13 : ''När man nu i början på 1985...''&lt;/ref&gt;

After an aborted attempt at buying Swedish giant Kabi Vitrum, El-Sayed turned his attention to the American firm for which he had worked in the 1970s: he bought SDS Biotech for 500 million kronor. The Fermenta stock price rose from 85 to 230 kronor between January and December 1985. The Swedish media started to show interest in the Fermenta phenomenon – it had taken only a few years for the company to become a major actor in the pharmaceutical industry. El-Sayed was presented as an unusual corporate leader: at barely 10 000 kronor, his salary was at par with that of a worker of the Strängnäs plant, he was living in a flat in the outskirts of Stockholm, and he played amateur football in the Swedish third division. On 22 December 1985, the TV news program ''Rapport'' named him « Swede of the year » for his success as Fermenta's chief, for his unconventional management style, and for « putting the light on the important role played by immigrants in the Swedish society.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 21:53 – 24:53 : ''Att den tänkta affären mellan Fermenta...''&lt;/ref&gt; »

On 8 January 1986, El-Sayed appeared in front of TV cameras besides [[Pehr G. Gyllenhammar]], the most powerful man in Sweden's industry. Volvo and Fermenta announced a deal, through which Volvo was exchanging its participations in two pharmaceutical companies, Soneson and Pharmacia, against a 20% stake in Fermenta. With this deal, Fermenta was becoming a world giant in the pharmaceutical industry, with a market capitalisation of four billion kronor. The news made the front page of the [[Financial Times]]. It was said that it had taken El-Sayed only 10 minutes to win the favours of Gyllenhammar. The Fermenta stock reached a new high at 325 kronor, while El-Sayed was at the peak of his glory. He would remain there for a little over a month.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 26:38 – 29:55 : ''Vid årskiftet 85-86 står Refaat El-Sayed...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/business/ab-fermenta.html ''A.B. Fermenta'']. New York Times. 10 January 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The DSc scandal ==
In February 1986, researcher and environmental activist [[Björn Gillberg]], whom El-Sayed knew from his time at Ultuna, publicly accused Fermenta of pollution at the site of the Strängnäs plant. Gillberg also accused El-Sayed of lying about his academic qualifications, and of falsely claiming he was a Doctor of Science. Journalists who tried to verify these allegations discovered that according to some sources, El-Sayed was awarded his Doctor degree in California, while according to others, he had earned it in Sweden.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 30:55 – 32:18 : ''Men det var just här, i februari 1986...''&lt;/ref&gt;

This scandal had disastrous effects for El-Sayed and Fermenta. That he was not a Doctor was in itself a mere detail, which on one hand stripped him of the « genius » aura that had so far surrounded him, but on the other hand added to the myth of the self-made billionaire. But his 48 hours of awkward denial cost him the trust of the markets, of the business world.

== The fall ==
After the DSc scandal, the markets were unforgiving. The Fermenta stock price dropped, and the Volvo and Pharmacia shares were also slammed. El-Sayed was soon compelled to leave his position as CEO, while Volvo reminded in a press release that the partnership agreement was not yet finalised. Fermenta's new CEO [[Ove Sundberg]] granted Volvo full access to the company's books. El-Sayed remained optimistic in his public comments, but it became clearer and clearer that Volvo was going to backtrack, which was eventually confirmed on 25 February.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 34:33 – 40:31 : ''I två dygn hade han nekat anklagelserna...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/26/business/volvo-cancels-fermenta-link.html Volvo cancels Fermenta link]. New York Times. 26 February 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a financial disaster for El-Sayed, who had personally bought four millions of Fermenta shares with the intention of exchanging them with Pharmacia. The drop in the stock price meant he was soon riddled with debts amounting to more than a billion kronor.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;{{sv icon}} 42:42 – 43:26 : ''Och den spruckna Volvo-affären skulle...''&lt;/ref&gt;

For Fermenta however, optimism was still ''de rigueur:'' it showed a profit for the first quarter of 1986. But in May, . Nevertheless, two weeks later, El-Sayed made a comeback at the top of Fermenta. In the hope of clearing his debts, he attempted to sell the company to [[Montedison]], and later to [[Bayer AG|Bayer]], but with no success.

In December 1986, Fermenta's auditors discovered extensive irregularities in Fermenta's financial statements. Refaat El-Sayed was sentenced to five years in prison by the district court in 1989, as well as banning him from engaging in commercial activities on charges of fraud, gross indebtedness against creditors, unfair benefit of creditors and breaches of the Securities Market Act. In the following year, the Sveahov Court raised the sentence to six years. El-Saayed was released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fermenta : skandalen som alla vill glömma|url=http://www.affarsvarlden.se/hem/nyheter/article2579424.ece|last=Bränfeldt|first=Lars-Eric|work=Äffärsvärlden|accessdate=27 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermenta's board was also sentenced to daily fines for environmental crime.

== Hebi Health Care ==
El-Sayed's charisma had not yet vanished: Hebi Health Care soon gathered 45 000 shareholders, and its market capitalisation reached one half billion kronor.Hebi Health Care relocated part of its activities to Egypt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">The term '''Safe Work Procedure''' (SWP) originated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], and is predominantly used as a [[risk management]] tool by industries throughout Australia, particularly in the [[mining]] sector. SWPs are also referred to using other terms, such as [[Standard Operating Procedure]] (SOPre) (SOP). A Safe Work Procedure is a step by step description of a process when deviation may cause a loss. This risk control document created by teams within the company describes the safest and most efficient way to perform a task. This document stays in the Health &amp; Safety system for regular use as a template or guide when completing that particular task on site.

==Requirements of Safe Work ==

The document generally lists the associated hazards involved in performing a task, what risk score is associated with the hazards (using a [[risk matrix]]), what personal protective equipment is required, and the steps involved to complete the activity without incident.

The document is split up to meet the above requirements as follows;
*[[Procedure (term)|Step]]
*[[Hazard]]s
*[[Inherent risk]]
*[[Control measure]]s
*[[Residual risk]]

Each person involved in that task on site must ensure all sections of the SWP are followed.

Safe Work Procedures are also required for machinery and equipment that is used to perform commercial activities. The procedures are required to be enforced within the workplace and improved as conditions or equipment changes.

USA Book News. http://www.usabooknews.com/images/BBresults2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The book is featured in chapter one of "The Sales Gurus: Lessons from the Best Sales Books of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Andrew and the Editors of Soundview Executive Book Summaries (2010). The Sales Guru. Penguin Group. {{ISBN|9781591843382}}. https://www.amazon.com/The-Sales-Gurus-Lessons-Books/dp/1591845939&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of his son, Jeff wrote the book based on his 30 years of sales experience as a sales rep, sales manager and sales executive trying to perfect his selling techniques. The book was published in 2009 by Greenleaf Book Group Press.&lt;ref&gt;Koser, Jeff (2009). Selling to Zebras. Greenleaf Book Group. {{ISBN|978-1929774579}}. https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Zebras-Business-Pursue-Profitably/dp/1929774575&lt;/ref&gt;

"Jeff Koser wrote a book that I consider one of the best sales books I have read in the last decade. What made this book interesting was their methodology and process for identifying a company's best prospects. They developed a very scientific analytical model that can be used by any company." -[[Marc Kramer]], quoted from an article in ''The Entrepreneur''.

==Selling to Zebras, Inc.==
Koser created Selling to Zebras, Inc. as a consulting company in Wisconsin.  After a few years, with the help of long-time friend Brian Gallagher, revenues almost reached $1M a year. Jeff engaged multiple VC firms but none were interested in a small consulting company. So he struck up a deal with a local entrepreneur and software architect, Tom Bowe, to development a cloud-based sales automation software system based on the Selling To Zebras sales methodology&lt;ref&gt;Selling to Zebras, Inc. https://www.sellingtozebras.com&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Shefqet Stringa 2013-09-18 18-35.jpg|thumbnail|Shefqet Stringa]]

'''Shefqet Mehmetali Stringa''' was a banking pioneer in [[Albania]].

==Biography==
Shefqet Stringa was born in [[Elbasan]], a city in central Albania, to a very well educated family. His father was a financier of the Turkish administration during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman regime]]. He attended his school in Elbasan. During the [[academic term]] of 1917–1918, the mayor of the city of Elbasan, Aqif Bicaku, and the Austrian Colonel Zitkovski, gave scholarships to a group of students, including Shefqet Stringa. He continued his studies in the Business Academy of [[Wien]], and received a doctorate on 7 July 1922.

During his studies in Austria, Shefqet Stringa was active in the [[student organization]] "Albania", established in 1918. He was one,in a group of scholars who wrote a letter to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference in Paris]],who gave his contribution. In 1920 Shefqet and other students contributed their savings to help other Albanians publish the first Albanian magazine, ''Djaleria'', in Wien. After his graduation, he was employed by the Credit Bank in Wien but resigned in 1923 and returned to his homeland. From April 1923 until December 1924, he worked as a translator for the [[Chief financial officer|finance director]], while [[Zog of Albania|Ahmet Zogu]] was Prime Minister and Minister of the Foreign Exchange in Albania.

From 1930–1933, Stringa established the first [[private bank]]ing agency in Elbasan. In 1933 he became the director of the National [[Bank of Albania]]. One year later he was appointed a director of the Business Room for the city of Elbasan. In November 1939 Shefqet Stringa was appointed as a director of the Elbasan branch,financed by Banka di Napoli.He held the position until 1946.

He was offered the Executive Director's job for the  Bank of Albania, which he refused. Shefqet never agreed with a government, whose power didn't come from the people. This led to his arrest as a [[political prisoner]]. As someone who was accused of a crime against the state, he was not given the right to present a defense before the court. Shefqet Stringa died on 31 October 1947 without any trial at court. He left his wife, Razije, and three sons, Dashamir, Mehmetali, and Adhurim.&lt;!-- Citation Needed --&gt;

The municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos&amp;nbsp;— the city itself, (also the seat), [[Eugênio de Melo]] and [[São Francisco Xavier]]. The last one is known for its natural sites and [[ecotourism]].

The district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).

However, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.

=== Topography ===
[[Highland (geography)|Highlands]] predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from {{convert|660|to|975|m|abbr=on}}. The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (''Mantiqueira Range''), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500&amp;nbsp;ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.

In the [[urban area]], there are rolling [[plateaus]] and [[hills]].
The lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the ''Paraíba do Sul'' river, at an elevation of 550 m.

The municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m.

The climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the [[Climate of Brazil|country]], the tropical climate of most of the country and the [[subtropical highland]] climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.

Technically, the city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between ''Cfa'' and ''Cwa'' climatic types in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/brag/v66n4/22.pdf |title=Climatic classification in São Paulo State |publisher=Instituto Agronômico de Campinas |accessdate=September 11, 2016|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month of 17&amp;nbsp;°C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hotttest month of 24&amp;nbsp;°C. With [[global warming]] it is very likely that the city's climate will transition to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification) in the near future.

Frosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. There's no record of snow precipitation in the city.

The peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have a colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls (about once per decade).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monteverdemg.com.br/vm-clima.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, ''Aldeia do Rio Comprido''. The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the [[Society of Jesus]]. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of [[Jacareí]] today.

The farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several [[Jesuit Reductions]] in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the [[Bandeirantes]].

On September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as [[slaves]]. However, a [[turmeric]] conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.

Nevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.

The initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest [[Manoel de Leão]], whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.

In 1692, documents named the village as ''Residência do Paraíba do Sul''; in 1696 as ''Residência de São José''.

At the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.

After the definitive [[Suppression of the Jesuits#Portugal|expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire]] in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. [[Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão]], had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the [[Viceroy]] to create [[civil parishes]], known as ''[[freguesias]]'', and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).

Then, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a [[town hall|hall]] and a [[pillory]], passing over the status of civil parish; and the name '''Vila de São José do Paraíba''' was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the ''Estrada Real'' (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.

=== Cotton and coffee ===
In the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.

In the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of '''São José dos Campos''', followed by the creation of a [[judiciary district]]  in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in [[Vale do Paraiba|Paraíba Valley]], which started to take off in 1870.

In 1886, after the opening of the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil]] railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.

=== Hydro-mineral retreat and industrialization ===
[[File:Inauguração_da_Fábrica_da_General_Motors_em_São_José_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inaugura%C3%A7%C3%A3o_da_F%C3%A1brica_da_General_Motors_em_S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_dos_Campos_(SP)_pelo_Presidente_Juscelino_Kubitschek.tif|thumb|Inauguration of the General Motors Factory in São José dos Campos by President Juscelino Kubitschek, 1959.]]The call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by [[sanatorium]]s became noticed at the

beginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became to be known as ''the Sanatorium City''. The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.

With the advent of [[antibiotics]] in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.

The industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the ''[[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica|Technological Institute of Aeronautics]] '' in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.

== Government ==
São José dos Campos has a "strong mayoral" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. The current mayor is [[Felicio Ramuth]], from the political party [[Brazil's Social Democratic Party|PSDB]] and was elected in 2016.

=== The state administrative region of São José dos Campos ===

{{wide image|São josé dos campos.jpg|1000px|São José dos Campos.}}

The city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Chile]].

São José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.

The city uses a [[ring road]] system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:

*[[Brazilian Highway System|BR-116]] (federal highway), which crosses the urban area of São José. It runs in a north-south direction in the country, near but not on Brazil's coastline. The section that connects Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo is known as Presidente Dutra. It is widely used inside the urban area of São José dos Campos for commuting purposes;
*[[Rodovia Carvalho Pinto|SP-070]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia Carvalho Pinto which connects [[São Paulo]] to [[Taubaté]];
*[[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|SP-065]] Connects São Jose dos Campos to [[Campinas]]
*[[Rodovia dos Tamoios|SP-099]] (state highway) also known as Rodovia dos Tamoios which connects São José to the coastal lowlands of the city of [[Caraguatatuba]];
[[File:Tamoios.JPG|thumb|right|[[SP-099|Tamoios Highway]]]]
*[[SP-050]] (state highway) - the old road which connects São José dos Campos to [[Campos do Jordão]] and the southern region of [[Minas Gerais]].

The city is also served by a railway (the former [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Central do Brasil]]), administered by [[MRS Logística]], which today only carries freight.

The ports of [[São Sebastião, São Paulo|São Sebastião]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]] can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.

The [[São José dos Campos Airport]] ([[IATA]]: SJK, [[ICAO]]: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]] and [[TRIP Linhas Aéreas]] fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.

It is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista ("São Paulo's East Cone"). [[Infraero]] and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.

São José dos Campos receives [[natural gas]] from two gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

It has also a large network of [[fiber optics]], with [[broadband]] services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Industry ===
[[File:Embraer175-01.jpg|thumb|Embraer Aircraft: the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, the company is headquartered at São José dos Campos]]

In contrast to the rural town in 1950s, today São José is an important manufacturing center and holds a large array of industries. Over 1,251 industries are in the municipality and nearby 47,000 inhabitants work for industries. The three main industries are [[automotive]], [[Petroleum|oil]]/[[petrochemical]] and [[aerospace]]. There are significant [[pharmaceutical]], [[consumer durables]], [[chemical]], and [[telecommunication]] companies in the city.{{Specify|date=November 2014}}

It is also known as the "Brazilian aeronautics capital" because it is home of [[Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology|CTA]] and one of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world, [[Embraer]].

===International Trade===

=== Service industry ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary]] sectors of industries.

For instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Yet even though most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.

Two technological parks and five (one in project) [[business incubators]] have been created within universities or industrial facilities.

There are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage [[Oil refinery|Refinery]] of [[Petrobrás]]. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.

Univap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of [[Chemical substance|materials]], [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]], [[information technology]], [[aerospace]], [[energy]], [[Natural environment|environment]] control, [[biotechnology]], [[bioinformatics]], [[chemical engineering]], and [[software]] among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new [[think tanks]]: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).

As a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several [[logistics]] providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.

Commerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the [[Vale do Paraíba]], the northern coast of São Paulo and southern [[Minas Gerais]].

'''Theofanis Tombras''' ({{lang-el|Θεοφάνης Τόμπρας}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''Theophanes Tompras'', [[Orthographic transcription|transcr.]] ''Theofanis Tombras'' or ''Tobras''), 1932 - 8 January 1996)&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"&gt;Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]] officer (colonel of [[Military communications|signals]]) who ended up as deputy governor of [[OTE|Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A (OTE)]] (1981–1984) and finally governor and general manager of OTE (1984–1989). During his tenure, OTE became the highest-revenue [[state-owned enterprise]] in Greece. He also oversaw the completion of its large  complex in [[Marousi]] and the relocation of its operations there.

He was also engaged in other businesses, and became a manufacturer, with fruit processing facilities in [[Argolis]].

==Life==
Theofanis Tombras was born in 1932 in [[Merbaka]] (Agia Trias) in Argolis.&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"&gt;Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Hellenic Military Academy]] and joined the Signal Corps. In the 1960s, as a captain, he served in the predecessor agency to the [[Hellenic National Intelligence Service]] and was accused of being a member of the clandestine [[Apostasia of 1965#The ASPIDA scandal|ASPIDA]] organization, an accusation of which he was eventually absolved, as he was of accusations of wiretapping the telephone conversations of political opponents of [[Andreas Papandreou]].&lt;ref&gt;Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996, «Πέθανε ο Τόμπρας»&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in the resistance to the [[Greek military junta]]. After the electoral victory of [[PASOK]] in October 1981, he was made a deputy governor of OTE; later in February 1984, he became its governor. After amendments to its [[articles of organization]] in 1987, his title was changed to general director.

Under his direction, a signal effort began in the area of telephone modernization, and when it was recognized by his rivals&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"&gt;Αυριανή, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; even while they pointed out a certain concern for the reputation of the organization, they were considerably pleased by the reasoning behind the work being done.&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"/&gt; However, at certain times he was accused of high-handedness. He took the law into his own hands, to the detriment of the first president of OTE [[Tasos Mandelis]], when he summoned the Governing Board of OTE and had a loaded pistol placed on the boardroom table,&lt;ref name="kathnedos7138"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|author=Vasilis Nedos|title=Ο 20ετής «εναγκαλισμός» Siemens - ΟΤΕ|trans-title=The 20-year "embrace" of Siemens-OTE|language=el|publication-place=Athens|publication-date=13 July 2008|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_13/07/2008_277586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although he arranged for armed bodyguards who were not police (as is often the case for plain-clothes bodyguards in Greece), they themselves were of dubious origin.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt; The display of force was viewed at the time as a [[publicity stunt]] designed to [[bullying|intimidate]] [[journalists]]&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |last=Quinn |first=Patrick |date=May 23, 1989 |title= Former Minister Accused, Senior Official Jailed In Financial Scandal|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Former-Minister-Accused-Senior-Official-Jailed-In-Financial-Scandal/id-4f56ec99e0832b5f644b58c715b7d00d|newspaper=[[Associated Press]] Archives|location=Athens |access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He maintained a public friendship with the prime minister [[Andreas Papandreou]], had a slight connection to well-known billionaire [[Sokratis Kokkalis]],&lt;ref name="kathnedos7138"/&gt; and with the reporters [[Nikos Kakaounakis]] (editor of the newspaper ''To Kalami'') and Makis Kouris (editor of the ''[[Avriani]]''). Indeed, ''To Kalami'' had published on numerous occasions transcripts of cassettes that contained personal conversations of [[Constantine Karamanlis]], and the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party had denounced Tombras as the source of those cassettes.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

==1989==
Tombras was cast out of the general directorship of OTE on 2 July 1989, that is, the same day that a new cabinet under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]] came to power.

After the return of the PASOK government in the summer of 1989, Tombras was accused of making deposits totaling to a then-[[Greek drachma]] equivalent of $12.5 million [[US dollar|USD]] in OTE money in the [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Bank of Crete]] at below-market interest to help shore up the bank's finances,&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; allegedly part of a scheme known as the [[Andreas Papandreou#.22Koskotas scandal.22.2C trial and return to power|Koskotas Scandal]]. Subsequently  he was accused of illegal telephone wiretapping of the political opponents of PASOK. On the first charge he was acquitted, and on the second he did not arrive in court because the parliament dismissed the prosecution after the acquittal of Andreas Papandreou in the Koskotas affair and the dramatic change in the political climate in January 1992.&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

==Death==
Tombras spent the last years of his life in his native Argolis, where he engaged in the fruit-processing trade, which he had originally entered in 1982.&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt; For all that, he remained active in the affairs of PASOK, especially in view of the succession of Andreas Papandreou in late 1995, where he supported [[Gerasimos Arsenis]].&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt; He died of cardiac arrest on 8 January 1996; at the same time Andreas Papandreou was ill and being treated at the Onaseio Cardiac Centre.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt; His funeral was attended by then-Speaker of the [[Parliament of Greece]] [[Apostolos Kaklamanis]]; then-[[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection|Minister of Public Order]] [[Sifis Valirakis]]; then-Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|Greek National Intelligence Service]], Admiral [[Leonidas Vasilikopoulos]]; PASOK parliamentarians and party members, and [[Sokratis Kokkalis]].&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

The '''toothpaste tube theory''' is a jocular metaphor stating that increasing pressure eventually forces some sort of release, just as when one squeezes a [[toothpaste]] tube, toothpaste comes out. It is used to explain [[social behavior|social]] and [[Theories of political behavior|political behavior]], as well as relationships involving abstract concepts.

== Applications of the theory ==
In [[administrative law]], the toothpaste tube theory describes problems of displacement, for instance, where discretion or accountability are shifted elsewhere. In the case,  [[Byrnes v. LCI Communication Holdings Co.]] an appeals court rejected one formulation of the toothpaste tube theory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.employee-leasing.org/Employee_Leasing_CaseLawDetail57042/Page9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[labor law]], the toothpaste tube theory&lt;ref&gt;''Taking back the workers' law,'' Ellen J. Dannin&lt;/ref&gt; means employer and employee relations are always under pressure.

In [[economics]], the toothpaste tube theory&lt;ref&gt;''Britain's Economic Prospects Reconsidered'' Alec Cairncross, and Ditchley &lt;/ref&gt; may be applied to, for instance, exports. Under this formulation, when home demand is squeezed, exports are extruded.

== Other formulations ==
Some versions of the toothpaste tube theory observe that there are [[diminishing returns]].&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche, Erik Pema Kunsang, Kerry Moran, and Marcia Binder, ''Fearless Simplicity''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center''' ('''U-PARC''') is a one-million-square foot (93,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), high-security research park campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Comprising 53 buildings situated on over {{convert|85|acre|km2}}, U-PARC is located {{convert|14|mi|km}} from [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] in [[Harmar Township, Pennsylvania]] adjacent to the [[Pennsylvania Route 28|Route 28]] expressway and [[Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)|Interstate 76]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://e-ditionsbyfry.com/Olive/AM3/TEQ/Default.htm?href=TEQ%2F2009%2F10%2F01&amp;pageno=26&amp;view=document | first=Matt | last=Pross | title=Tech Mecca | journal=Pittsburgh Teq | publisher=Pittsburgh Technology Council | location=Pittsburgh | volume=15 | issue=6 | page=26 | date=2009-09-10 | accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as the research laboratories of [[Gulf Oil]] in 1933 and moved to Harmar Township in 1935. It served many decades as one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs engaging in petroleum, chemical, polymer, refining, and nuclear research. At its peak, it employed over 2,000 scientists and engineers and had an annual budget of $100 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1985|r=1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). Upon Gulf Oil's acquisition by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Oil]] in 1985, the research park was donated to the University of Pittsburgh in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region.

U-PARC is home to more than 100 different companies from around the world, including several [[Fortune 500]] Companies.  In addition, the university's [[Swanson School of Engineering]] maintains laboratories and its Manufacturing Assistance Center at the site. It also serves as the home to the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences|School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences]]' Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies.

In addition to the companies that rent occupy the facilities at U-PARC, the University of Pittsburgh's [[Swanson School of Engineering]] maintains research groups and laboratories at the site, including the Manufacturing Assistance Center. Beginning in 2010, the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences]] initiated a Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies headquartered at U-PARC.&lt;ref name="PhysAssist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shrs.pitt.edu/pa.aspx?id=753&amp;nav=756 | title=Program in Physicians Assistant Studies | publisher=University of Pittsburgh School of Health &amp; Rehabilitation Sciences | accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pittnews.com/news/article_e72d5a8d-670d-50f5-9e9b-d1682e056758.html | first=Eva | last=Bugos | title=Pitt gains physician assistant program| date=December 7, 2009 | newspaper=[[The Pitt News]] | location=Pittsburgh | accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space for the Physician's Assistant program includes classrooms, breakout rooms, student lounge, computer room, conference room and offices for faculty and administration.&lt;ref name="PhysAssist" /&gt;

==Manufacturing Assistance Center==
The Manufacturing Assistance Center (MAC), located in Building A-11 of U-PARC, is a working factory opened in November 1994 as an initiative of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Swanson School of Engineering]]'s Department of Industrial Engineering that offers technical assistance and educational resources to the academic and industrial community of [[Western Pennsylvania]]. It also serves as an incubator for manufacturing innovation and as a center for technology transfer.  The MAC provides access to advanced manufacturing technology, encourages its adoption, and assists in training and educating students in its use. The center comprises a synergistic network of laboratories encompassing machine tooling, computer-aided design and manufacturing, metrology, materials tracking, and human issues.

The MAC began following a 1990 survey of 550 Western Pennsylvania manufacturers by the Department of Industrial Engineering that revealed the need for manufacturing support services in this part of the state.&lt;ref name="aboutMac"&gt;{{cite web | title=About the MAC | url=http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/about_mac.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611165320/http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/about_mac.htm | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh | archivedate=2007-06-11 | accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response a concept of shared manufacturing was created by Pitt School of Engineering professors Dr. Bopaya Bidanda and Dr. [[David I. Cleland]], and a proposal describing how the MAC would meet this need resulted in a $2.3 million grant from the [[Economic Development Administration]] of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]].  The center's purpose is to provide research and educational support to the University of Pittsburgh, as well as to provide small and mid-sized manufacturers of Western Pennsylvania with the tools to compete in the global marketplace.  As such, area manufacturers can receive demonstrations on new equipment and manufacturing processes, perform pilot manufacturing, and conduct limited production utilizing the resources available in the MAC labs. In addition to these services, the MAC also provides training on [[computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining, [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM), and [[computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM), plus a variety of other concepts, such as materials requirements planning, total quality management, and team development, that are utilized by modern manufacturing organizations.  Working in partnership with private industry, the MAC is part of the development of the regional RoboCorridor, promoting automation and agile [[robotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engr.pitt.edu/mac/ |title=Manufacturing Assistance Center | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAC's {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} of available space contains a working factory, classrooms, and administration offices and supplies secure space for startup companies wishing to access its facilities. The factory has a 5-ton and a 1-ton overhead crane, a loading dock, 220 and 480 volt 3-phase power, a paint room, and welding booths. The space is subdivided into classrooms, a conference room, a computer laboratory designed for CAD/CAM training, offices and training areas for manual, welding training, and CNC and [[Electrical discharge machining|EDM]] machine tool and precision grinding training. The facility also includes two classrooms seating 24 and 12 students, respectively, as well as five offices, a metrology lab, and a computer lab. There are five additional rooms available on the basement floor for offices, storage, a small production setup area, along with a test facility with a garage entrance and access to a 1-ton overhead crane.&lt;ref name="aboutMac" /&gt;

[[Reuters]]. August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Prime Minister of South Ossetia|Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of South Ossetia]] from 5 August 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} President of South Ossetia: [http://presidentrso.ru/edicts/detail.php?ID=2616 Decree on the Head of the Government of the Republic of South Ossetia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805180617/http://presidentrso.ru/edicts/detail.php?ID=2616 |date=2009-08-05 }} (5 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International|UPI]]: [http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/08/05/South-Ossetia-names-new-prime-minister/UPI-16191249487087/ South Ossetia names new prime minister] (5 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; to 26 April 2012, as well as Acting President from December 11, 2011 to April 19, 2012. 

Brovtsev had served in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Strategic Rocket Forces]].&lt;ref name="minprof"/&gt; From 2005 until his appointment to a political post, Brovtsev was head of the board of directors of [[Russia]]n construction company [[Vermikulit]] based in the city of [[Chelyabinsk]].&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

==Political life==

Of Russian ethnicity, he was born in Chelyabinsk-65 (now [[Ozyorsk, Chelyabinsk Oblast|Ozyorsk]]) in 1969.

Despite having no previous connection to South Ossetia,&lt;ref&gt;Tskhurbaev, Alan (21 August 2009), [http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=355314&amp;apc_state=henh South Ossetians Puzzled by Leaders]. [[Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting]] Caucasus Reporting Service No. 507&lt;/ref&gt; Brovtsev became Prime Minister of S.Ossetia after his predecessor, [[Aslanbek Bulatsev]], was fired, according to the official decree, on health reasons, on 4 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} President of South Ossetia: [http://presidentrso.ru/edicts/detail.php?ID=2616 Decree on A.S. Bulatsev] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805180617/http://presidentrso.ru/edicts/detail.php?ID=2616 |date=2009-08-05 }} (4 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 24 out of 27 MPs voted in favour of Brovtsev as the new PM. There were no other candidates.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;Georgia Times: [http://www.georgiatimes.info/en/articles/18328.html Brovtsev was confirmed the PM of South Ossetia] (5 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Brovtsev came under heavy criticism from various sides. It was claimed that he did not manage Russia's monetary aid to rebuild destroyed South Ossetian buildings very well.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Power_Struggle_Under_Way_In_South_Ossetia/2018098.html|title=Power Struggle Under Way In South Ossetia|date=19 April 2010|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the South Ossetian parliament called for Brovtsev to resign, and brought a [[motion of no confidence]] to the parliamentary debating floor, which was discussed on 5 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://osinform.ru/21591-parlament-yuzhnoj-osetii-obsudit-vopros-o.html|title=Parliament of South Ossetia will discuss distrust in the government on May 5|date=4 May 2010|publisher=OSInform|language=Russian|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May, president [[Eduard Kokoity]] appeared before parliament, reiterating his support for Brovtsev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://osinform.ru/21622-yeduard-kokojty-v-yuzhnoj-osetii-net.html|title=Eduard Kokoity: South Ossetia does not have a government crisis|date=5 May 2010|publisher=OSInform|language=Russian|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament still passed a motion, creating a commission to review the government's activities. The commission is to be led by deputy chairman of parliament and former Prime Minister [[Zurab Kokoyev]], and among its other members is also former Prime Minister [[Merab Chigoev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cominf.org/node/1166483145|script-title=ru:Вадим Бровцев: Правительство РЮО справляется со своими обязанностями|date=5 May 2010|publisher=IA "Republic"|language=Russian|accessdate=6 May 2010|location=Tshkinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Brovtsev has hit back by pointing at recent polls taken by the International Center of Political Analysis (MTsPA), which show an approval rating for Kokoity of 12.4%, with 66.3% of respondents having a negative opinion. Brovtsev, on the other hand is credited 37.8% positive and 10.9% negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpa.info/news1.html|title=The economic and socio-political situation in the Republic of South Ossetia|date=23 March 2010|publisher=International Center of Political Analysis|language=Russian|accessdate=5 May 2010|location=Kiev - Minsk - Tskhinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kokoity's advisor [[Kosta Dzugaev]] called the poll "lies", stating that the MTsPA had never done any actual research in South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cominf.org/node/1166482947|script-title=ru:Коста Дзугаев: Президент-победитель не нравится тем, кого он победил|date=14 April 2010|publisher=IA "Republic" (South Ossetian government)|language=Russian|accessdate=5 May 2010|location=Tskhinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTsPA has been linked to the website rsoinform.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://osinform.ru/21173-sam-sebya-ne-poxvalish-nikto-ne-poxvalit.html|script-title=ru:Сам себя не похвалишь — никто не похвалит (итоги расследования)|date=14 April 2010|publisher=OSInform|language=Russian|accessdate=6 May 2010|location=Tshkinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt; a news agency reporting favorably about Brovtsev, which at first sight appears to be an official government information service. South Ossetian government press agency [[OSinform]] states, however, that it is not official and not registered in South Ossetia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://osinform.ru/21184-wwwrsoinformru-ne-zaregistrirovano-v-yuzhnoj.html|title=rsoinform.ru не государственное СМИ и не зарегистрировано в Южной Осетии|date=14 April 2010|publisher=OSInform|language=Russian|accessdate=6 May 2010|location=Tskhinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that Brovtsev himself is linked to these institutions.&lt;ref name="rferl"/&gt;

In an effort to defend himself against media attacks, Brovtsev has sued several media. Apparently the lawsuit at first included OSInform, leading to a somewhat embarrassing situation for Brovtsev, who did not know OSInform is the South Ossetian state information agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://osinform.ru/21547-vadim-brovcev-ya-nedavno-uznal-chto-osinform-yeto.html|title=Vadim Brovtsev: I recently learned that OSinform is our state media|date=30 April 2010|publisher=IA "Republic"|language=Russian|accessdate=6 May 2010|location=Tshkinvali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brovtsev is married and has two children.&lt;ref name="minprof"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt;

[[Image:Tomb william a clark jr.jpg|thumb|Tomb of philanthropist William A. Clark Jr., [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]]]
'''William Andrews Clark Jr.''' (March 29, 1877 – June 14, 1934) was a [[Los Angeles]]-based philanthropist and the youngest surviving son of copper baron and U.S. Senator [[William Andrews Clark]] Sr. and his first wife, Katherine.

==Early life==
William Andrews Clark Jr. was born on March 29, 1877 in [[Deer Lodge, Montana]]. His father was [[William A. Clark]] and his mother was Katherine Louise Stauffer.&lt;ref name=Trib&gt;{{cite news |title= Daughter of Connellsville's controversial billionaire dies |url= http://triblive.com/x/dailycourier/news/s_739448.html |newspaper= The Tribune-Review |date= May 28, 2011 |access-date= Jan 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in France and in the New York area and graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a bachelor's degree in law in 1899.

==Career and hobbies==
Clark was a partner in the law firm Clark &amp; Roote in [[Butte, Montana]]. He also served on the boards of several of his father's mining and industrial concerns.

===Book collection===
In the mid-1910s, he began collecting antiquarian and fine press books as a serious hobby (he had dabbled in book buying previous to this). In 1919, he hired bibliographer Robert E. Cowan to consult on book-buying purchases and to help with the compilation of a printed library catalog. The first volume of this was printed in 1920 by San Francisco printer John Henry Nash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt2m3nf2td/|title=Records of William Andrews Clark Jr. and the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library          Clarkive.Pre-1934|website=www.oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
He founded the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], which debuted in the [[Trinity Auditorium]] in 1919, and bequeathed his library of rare books and manuscripts, the [[William Andrews Clark Memorial Library]], to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] upon his death in 1934. He also helped to fund the construction of the [[Hollywood Bowl]].

==Personal life==
In 1902, he married Mabel Duffield Foster (1880 – January 1, 1903), who died of [[septicemia]] following the birth of their son, William Andrews Clark, III ("Tertius") (December 2, 1902 – May 15, 1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/01/02/101963629.pdf|title=MRS. W. A. CLARK JR., DEAD.; Was Daughter-in-Law of Montana Senator--Illness Dated from Birth of Her Son.|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son died in a plane crash in [[Arizona]] in 1932.

In 1907, he married Alice McManus (1883–1916), a native Nevadan, and they moved their permanent home to Los Angeles in the early 1910s ([[Clark County, Nevada]] is named for his father). Their house at Adams Boulevard and Cimarron Street occupied the grounds that the [[Clark Library]] still stands on today.

===Death===
He died on June 14, 1934, at Salmon Lake, Montana. He is entombed in the family mausoleum which he built on the island in Sylvan Lake at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]. Both of his wives and his son are also in the mausoleum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.allanellenberger.com/book-flm-news/hollywood-forever-cemetery/]&lt;/ref&gt;
