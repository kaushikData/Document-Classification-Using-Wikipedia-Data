      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16506">The '''American system of manufacturing''' was a set of [[manufacturing]] methods that evolved in the 19th century. The two notable features were the extensive use of  [[interchangeable parts]] and [[mechanization]] for production, which resulted in more efficient use of labor compared to hand methods. The system was also known as '''armory practice''' because it was first fully developed in [[armory (military)|armories]], namely, the United States Armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Harpers Ferry Armory|Harpers Ferry]] in [[Virginia]] (later [[West Virginia]]),&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[inside contracting|inside contractors]] to supply the [[United States Armed Forces]], and various private armories.  The name "American system" came not from any aspect of the system that is unique to the American national character, but simply from the fact that for a time in the 19th century it was strongly associated with the American companies who first successfully implemented it, and how their methods contrasted (at that time) with those of British and continental European companies. In the 1850s, the "American system" was contrasted to the British [[factory system]] which had evolved over the previous century. Within a few decades, manufacturing technology had evolved further, and the ideas behind the "American" system were in use worldwide. Therefore, in manufacturing today, which is global in the scope of its methods, there is no longer any such distinction.

The American system involved semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s and [[jig (tool)|jigs]] to make standardized, identical, [[interchangeable parts]], manufactured to a [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]], which could be assembled with a minimum of time and skill, requiring little to no [[wikt:fit#Verb|fitting]].

Since the parts are interchangeable, it was also possible to separate manufacture from assembly, and repair—an example of the [[division of labor]]. This meant that all three functions could be carried out by semi-skilled labor: manufacture in smaller factories up the supply chain, assembly on an [[assembly line]] in a main factory, and repair in small specialized shops or in the field. The result is that more things could be made, more cheaply, and with higher quality, and those things also could be distributed further, and lasted longer, because repairs were also easier and cheaper. In the case of each function, the system of interchangeable parts typically involved substituting specialized machinery to replace hand tools.

Interchangeability of parts was finally achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and [[machine tools]], which were developed primarily for making textile machinery. These innovations included the invention of new machine tools and jigs (in both cases, for guiding the [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tool]]), fixtures for holding the work in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

==Use of machinery==
English machine tool manufacturer [[Joseph Whitworth]] was appointed as a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. Accompanied by another British commissioner, he traveled around several states visiting various manufacturers, and as a result published a highly influential report on American manufacturing, from which he is quoted:

{{quote| The laboring classes are comparatively few in number, but this is counterbalanced by, and indeed, may be one of the causes of the eagerness by which they call in the use of machinery in almost every department of industry. Wherever it can be applied as a substitute for manual labor, it is universally and willingly resorted to….  It is this condition of the labor market, and this eager resort to machinery wherever it can be applied, to which, under the guidance of superior education and intelligence, the remarkable prosperity of the United States is due.&lt;ref&gt;{{Roe1916}}. {{Citation | title = Report of the British Commissioners to the New York Industrial Exhibition | place = London | year = 1854}}.&lt;/ref&gt; | Joseph Whitworth, 1854}}

==Other characteristics==
The American system contributed to efficiency gains through division of labor. Division of labor helped manufacturing transition from small artisan's shops to early factories. Key pieces of evidence supporting efficiency gains include increase in firm size, evidence of returns to scale, and an increase in non-specialized labor. The need for firms to train uneducated people to perform only one thing in the productivity chain allowed for the use of non-specialized labor. Women and children were employed more frequently within larger firms, especially those producing furniture and clothing.{{Citation needed |date=July 2015}}.

==History==
In the late 18th century, [[France|French]] General [[Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] suggested that [[musket]]s could be manufactured faster and more economically if they were made from interchangeable parts. This system would also make field repairs easier to carry out under battle conditions. He provided patronage to [[Honoré Blanc]], who attempted to implement the [[Gribeauval system|''Système Gribeauval'']], but never succeeded.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; Until then, under the British [[factory system]], skilled machinists were required to produce parts from a design.  But however skilled the machinist, parts were never identical, and each part had to be manufactured separately to fit its counterpart—almost always by one person who produced each completed item from start to finish.

Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]], and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 [[Block (sailing)|sailing blocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Enlightenment &amp; measurement |publisher=Making the modern world |url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true |place=[[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Portsmouth dockyard | place =UK |url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Block |title=Collections |publisher=Science museum |contribution-url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/ |place=UK | type = exhiblet}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=KR |title=The Portsmouth Block-making Machinery |place=London |year=1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title= The Production Line at Portsmouth Block Mill | journal=Industrial Archaeology Review |volume=VI |year=1982 |pages=28–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cooper |first=CC |title=The Portsmouth System of Manufacture |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=25 |year = 1984 | pages =182–225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan |title=The Royal Dockyards 1690–1850 |place=Aldershot |year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Coad |first=Jonathan | title =The Portsmouth Block Mills : Bentham, Brunel and the start of the Royal Navy's Industrial Revolution |year=2005 |isbn=1-873592-87-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkin |first=Susan |title=The application of emerging new technologies by Portsmouth Dockyard, 1790–1815 |publisher=The Open University |type=PhD Thesis |year=1999}} (copies available from the British Thesis service of the British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last=Cantrell |editor1-first=J | editor2-last =Cookson |editor2-first=G |title=Henry Maudslay and the Pioneers of the Machine Age |place=Stroud |year=2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the ''American System of Manufacturing'', even though it originated in England.

The [[Lowell system]] is also related to the American system during this time.  It emphasized procuring, training, and providing housing and other living necessities for the workforce, as well as using semi-automated machines in a centralized factory building or complex.

Gribeauval's idea was conveyed to the US by two routes. First, Blanc's friend [[Thomas Jefferson]] championed it, sending copies of Blanc's memoirs and papers describing his work to [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Knox]].  Second, artillery officer [[Louis de Tousard]] (who had served with [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]]) was an enthusiast of Gribeauval's ideas. Tousard wrote two influential documents after the [[American Revolution]]; one was used as the blueprint for [[West Point]], and the other became the officer's training manual.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The War Department, which included officers trained at West Point on Tousard's manual, established the armories at [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] and [[Harper's Ferry]] and tasked them with solving the problem of interchangeability. The task was finally accomplished in the 1820s. Historian [[David A. Hounshell]] believes that this was done by [[Captain John H. Hall]], an [[Inside contracting|inside contractor]] at Harper's Ferry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt; In a letter dated 1822 Hall makes the claim he achieved interchangeability in 1822.&lt;ref name ="Cowan 1997"/&gt; But historian [[Diana Muir]] argues that it is more probable that it was [[Simeon North]], a Connecticut arms contractor manufacturing guns for the US Army. North, not Hall, was the inventor of the crucial [[milling machine]] in 1816, and had an advantage over Hall in that he worked closely with the first industry that mass-produced complex machines from mass-produced [[interchangeable parts]], the Connecticut clock-making industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Diana | last = Muir | title = [[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]] | publisher = University Press of New England}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}  By 1815 the idea of interchangeability was well established in the US government system of procurement; Congressional contracts stipulated this quality in muskets, rifles and pistols ordered after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = James Burke (science historian)| first = James | last = Burke | title = Connections | publisher = Little, Brown &amp; Co | origyear = 1978 | year = 1995 | ISBN = 0-316-11672-6 | page = 151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Interchangeability of firearms parts at the U.S. armories was found to have been in use for a number of years by the time of the 1853 British Parliamentary Commissions Committee on Small Arms inquiry.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984" /&gt;

A critical factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the slide rest lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One of the most important and versatile of these machine tools was [[David Wilkinson (machinist)#Wilkinson lathe|David Wilkinson's lathe]], for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.&lt;ref name="Thompson2009"&gt;{{cite book | title=Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790–1865 |last=Thompson |first= Ross |year=2009 |publisher =The Johns Hopkins University Press |location= Baltimore, MD |isbn= 978-0-8018-9141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}

[[Eli Whitney]] is generally credited with the idea and the practical application, but both are incorrect attributions. Based on his reputation as the inventor of the [[cotton gin]], the US government gave him a contract in 1798 for 10,000 muskets to be produced within two years. It actually took eight years to deliver the order, as Whitney perfected and developed new techniques and machines. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott apologizing for the delays, Whitney wrote:
{{quote| One of my primary objectives it to form tools so the tools themselves shall fashion the work and give to every part its just proportion – which when once accomplished, will give expedition, uniformity, and exactness to the whole…  In short, the tools which I contemplate are similar to engraving on a copper plate from which may be taken a great number of impressions, perfectly alike.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cowan |first= Ruth Schwartz |title= A Social History of American Technology | publisher=Oxford University Press | place =New York |year=1997 |pages=7–8 |isbn= 0-19-504606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=July 2015}}}}

Whitney did use machinery; however, there is no evidence that he produced any new type of metalworking machinery.&lt;ref name= "Cowan 1997" /&gt; After completing the initial contract, Whitney went on to produce another 15,000 muskets within the following two years. Whitney never actually expressed any interest in interchangeability until 1800, when [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Oliver Wolcott, Jr.|Wolcott]] exposed him to the memoirs of Blanc,&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt; but he spent far more time and energy promoting the idea than developing it.

In order to spread knowledge of manufacturing techniques, the War Department made contractors open their shops to other manufacturers and competitors.  The armories also openly shared manufacturing techniques with private industry.&lt;ref name = "Thompson2009" /&gt; Additionally, the idea migrated from the armories to industry as machinists trained in the armory system were hired by other manufacturers. Skilled engineers and machinists thus influenced American [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.&lt;ref name= "hounshell-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States |last= Thomson |first = Ross | year = 1989 | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | isbn = 978-0-80781867-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late to adopt the interchangeable system were [[Singer Corporation]] sewing machine (1870s), [[reaper]] manufacturer [[Cyrus McCormick|McCormick Harvesting Machine Company]] (1870s–80s)&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt; and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s)&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1985"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930 | volume = 2: Steam Power |last=Hunter |first= Louis C. | year=1985 |publisher = University Press of Virginia | location = Charlottesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as locomotive makers. Large scale of production of bicycles in the 1880s used the interchangeable system.&lt;ref name = "hounshell-1984" /&gt;

The idea would also help lead to the American "Golden Age" of manufacturing when [[Henry Ford]] mass-produced the automobile. Mastering true interchangeability on the assembly line, the Ford plant produced standard model cars. These efficient production strategies allowed these automobiles to be affordable for the middle class.

===Pre-Industrial Revolution===
{{more citations needed |date=November 2006}}
The idea of interchangeable parts and the separate assembly line was not new, though it was little used. The idea was first developed in [[East Asia]] during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]] over 2200 years ago – bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable. [[Venice]] during the late Middle Ages had ships that were produced using pre-manufactured parts, [[assembly line]]s, and [[mass production]]. The [[Venetian Arsenal]] apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first [[factory]].

'''Arch Wilkinson Shaw''' (August 4, 1876 – March 9, 1962)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100459975 "Arch Wilkinson Shaw (1876—1962)]" at oxfordreference.com.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[entrepreneur]], [[publisher]], [[editor]] and [[management theorist]] who applied the ideas of [[scientific management]] in the areas of offices and the tertiary sector.

During the First World War, Shaw served as Secretary of Commercial Economy Board, and later served as member of the board of directors of the [[Harvard Business School]].

== Biography ==
=== Youth, education and early career ===
Shaw was born in 1876 in [[Jackson, Michigan]], son of James Franklin Shaw and Estelle Jane (Fenn) Shaw. After attending public school, he quit his studies at [[Olivet College]]. He would eventually obtained his AM degree from Olivet College in 1914, and would obtain his doctor of laws from [[Northwestern University]] in 1927.

Shaw broke off his studies at the Olivet College before graduating in 1899, at the age of 23, and founded, with Louis C. Walker, the Shaw-Walker Company in Muskegon Michigan,&lt;ref name="GLS 1952"&gt;G. Lynn Sumner. "System - Magazine sensation of its time," in: ''How I Learned the Secrets of Success in Advertising.'' North Audley Media, 1952. p. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in office supplies and plugs and files.

=== Further career ===
Four years later, in 1903, while still in the board of directors of the firm, he founded the Shaw Company, which published the reviews ''System'', ''The Magazine of Business'', specializing in the service and offices (typing, office furniture, etc.), and ''Factory''.&lt;ref name="MTC 1958"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Copeland |first=Melvin T. |title=Arch W. Shaw | author-link= Melvin T. Copeland|journal= Journal of Marketing  |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=313–315 |jstor=1247125
|date=January 1958 |registration=yes  |doi=10.2307/1247125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also published books on [[management]]. Shaw sold it in 1928 to the [[McGraw-Hill Company]].

Shaw took a sabbatical in 1910, when his business was flourishing, to study the [[economy]] at Harvard University in Cambridge, where he especially appreciated the courses by [[Frank William Taussig]], which demonstrated its influence later on in his writings. He also befriended the Professor of economic history [[Edwin Francis Gay]], first dean of [[Harvard Business School]]. In 1911, Shaw became lecturer, inaugurating the first course in Business Policy, and became a member of the board of the Harvard Business School. He wrote the article'' Some Problems in Distribution Market,'' published in August 1912 in the ''Quarterly Journal of Economics,'' which became a seminal article in marketing studies. With E. Gay, he then helped found the Harvard Bureau of Business Research, which he helped to fund. He was also a shareholder and member of the board of the [[Kellogg Company]].

Shaw argued in his books and ''System'' journal, that the federal government should be involved in the collection and data processing for business. In 1917, when the United States were about to enter war, he persuaded the [[Council of National Defense]] to create the Commercial Economy Board, of which he became the secretary. This council then became the conservation division of the [[War Industries Board]] under his responsibility.&lt;ref name="MTC 1958"/&gt;

He died in [[Winnetka, Illinois]] on March 9, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Arch Shaw Dies, Ex-Publisher, 85. Business Magazine Leader Was Adviser to Hoover |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/11/archives/arch-shaw-dies-expublisher-85-business-magazine-leader-was-adviser.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 11, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''System, Magazine of business'' 1900-1927 ===
[[File:System, first number of first volume, December 1900.jpg|thumb|System, first number of first volume, December 1900]]
The journal ''System'' was first published in December 1900 by the Shaw-Walker Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100006275 System, Magazine of business], catalog record at hathitrust.org, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the second volume in December 1901 it went with the subtitle "The magazine of business." In the very first article, entitled ''The Cost of Production.'' one of the initial aims of the magazine was described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our next few issues we hope to present to our readers a cost system, which, while not applied in the sense of a balance ledger system, with all of its intricate problems, will furnish facts, sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes and one which will largely aid the progressive manager to establish his own costs in a satisfactory manner as well as point out to his superintendent any weaknesses existing in the factory, thereby profiting by a speedy remedy of excessive costs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Shaw. "The cost of production," ''System,'' Volume 1, issue 1, (Dec. 1900) p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1903 A.W. Shaw Company was founded and the ''System'' magazine became their flagship publication&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshan. ''A Delicate Experiment: The Harvard Business School, 1908-1945.'' 1987, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and a sensation of its time.&lt;ref name="GLS 1952"/&gt; Jeffrey L. Cruikshan (1987) recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under Shaw's direction, ''System'' attempted to take a practical approach to business. It was a successful magazine, and it grew steadily in size and influence during Shaw's tenure as editor. (In 1927, ''System'' was purchased by McGraw-Hill. and renamed ''[[Business Week]].''). But ''System,'' as Shaw saw it. faced a difficult question: how to uncover the principles that must underlie the evolving practice of business. It was a question that Shaw himself had faced in 1906, when he had helped Northwestern University design an undergraduate business curriculum.&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few years late at Harvard Business School Shaw and Edwin Francis Gay were faced with a similar challenge when they were designing the curriculum for the business graduate studies.&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"/&gt;

Arinobu was the father of photographers {{nihongo|[[Rosō Fukuhara]]|福原 路草|Fukuhara Rosō|1892–1946}}, {{nihongo|[[Shinzō Fukuhara]]|福原 信三|Fukuhara Shinzō|1883–1948}} and {{nihongo|[[Nobuyushi Fukuhara]]|福原 信義|Fukuhara Nobuyushi|1897–1958}}, who would gain  fame as {{nihongo|[[Tōru Namiki]]|並木 透|Namiki Tōru}}.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Art Beat: [http://www.tokyoartbeat.com/event/2005/DFFB.en  "Masters of Light – Photographic Works of Shinzo, Nobutatsu and Nobuyoshi Fukuhara"]&lt;/ref&gt;  His sons became quintessential ''mobo'', or "modern boys"—the sobriquet coined to describe the young, sophisticated, up-to-date young men who frequented the fashionable Ginza district in the late 1920s&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Eric Mark.

Grandson {{nihongo|[[Yoshiharu Fukuhara]]|福原義春|Fukuhara Yoshiharu|1931–}} continues this family tradition of fostering the development of Japanese photography.

== Shiseido ==
{{quote|Beauty is universal, thus the products which serve beauty should also be universal.|Yushin Fukuhara, company founder}}

As Shiseido has grown to become an international cosmetics giant, the company has managed to avoid some of the pitfalls and problems which have attended generational transitions in other successful family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon
-Rouvinez, Denise. (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AbfTcruXZnAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=arinobu+fukuhara&amp;source=web&amp;ots=RjONsarzz5&amp;sig=e5D8PYxnV07PQWPbzH1RHYBZo4Y&amp;hl=en#PPA89,M1 "Sharing Wisdom, Building Values: Letters from Family Business Owners to their Successors,'' p. 89.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Arinobu's grandson, Yoshiharu Fukuhara, joined Shiseido immediately after receiving his B.A. in economics from Keio University, Tokyo, in 1953. He was appointed President &amp; CEO of Shiseido in 1987, then Chairman of the Board in 1997 and Honorary Chairman in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.dmc.keio.ac.jp/Alumni_essay_1.html  Keio alumni essay]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Fukuhara leaders in the Shiseido hierarchy were:
* 1st President: Fukuhara, Shinzo—son of company founder
* 2nd President: Fukuhara, Nobuyoshi—younger brother of company's 1st president 
* 3rd President: Fukuhana, Yoshibaru—son of company's 2nd president

== Japan Pharmaceutical Association ==
Arinobu served as the third president of the {{nihongo|[[Japan Pharmaceutical Association]]|日本薬剤師会|''Nippon Yakuzaishi Kai''}}, 1907–1909.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Pharmaceutical Assn.: [http://www.nichiyaku.or.jp/e/e3.html  JPA presidents]&lt;/ref&gt;  During his administration, JPA applied for and obtained approval from the Japanese government to become what was known as a "corporate juridical person" (public corporation).&lt;ref&gt;Japan Pharmaceutical Assn.: [http://www.nichiyaku.or.jp/e/e2.html  JPA history]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arinobu Fukuhara House ==
[[File:Arinobu Fukuhara House, full view.jpg|thumb|Full view of the Arinobu Fukuhara House]]
The commissioned house was designed and built in 1920, but the site near a hot spring left the building vulnerable to the cataclysmic [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] which collapsed it.

'''Beatrice Keene (Webber) Corliss''' (October 21, 1910–January 12, 1995) was an American politician who served as the first female [[List of mayors of Gloucester, Massachusetts|Mayor of]] [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].

==Early life and business career==
Corliss was born on October 21, 1910 in Gloucester. She graduated from [[Simmons College]].&lt;ref name="Public Officers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1963-1964|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicofficersof19631964bost#page/138/mode/2up|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professionally, she worked as an accountant for [[Birds Eye]] before becoming the assistant treasurer of Consolidated Lobster.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatrice Corliss, 84; was legislator, first woman mayor of Gloucester|work=The Boston Globe|date=January 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also aided her husband's business by picking strawberries and raspberries.&lt;ref name="Raspberry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Mary Sarah|title=She Went From Raspberry Patch to Beacon Hill|work=The Boston Daily Globe|date=March 20, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Corliss political involvement began as a member of the Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs of Gloucester, an organization whose activities included supporting candidates for appointed office.&lt;ref name="Raspberry" /&gt;

In 1951, Corliss attempted her first run for office as a candidate for Gloucester school committee. She was successful and was reelected in 1953. In 1955, she was the highest vote-getter in the city council election and was elected mayor by her fellow councilors (at the time, the position of Mayor was a ceremonial one while the government was run by a city manager).&lt;ref name="Raspberry" /&gt; She was reelected to the city council in 1957 and was once again chosen to serve as Mayor.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

In 1960, Corliss was a candidate for the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in the 2nd Essex District after incumbent [[Barclay H. Warburton III]] chose to retire. As the district only included three wards in Gloucester, she had to branch out and campaign in the district's other municipalities ([[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] [[Essex, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Georgetown, Massachusetts|Georgetown]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]], and [[West Newbury, Massachusetts|West Newbury]]). She defeated six male candidates to win the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination. During her tenure in the House, Corliss served on the Ways and Means, Towns, and Harbors and Public Lands committees.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raspberry" /&gt;

Corliss was also a delegate to the [[1960 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref name="Public Officers" /&gt;

From 1964 to 1969, she served as the appointments secretary for Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Volpe]].&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Corliss and her husband later moved to [[Northfield, Vermont]]. She died on January 12, 1995 in Northfield.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

'''Benjamin Howard''' (1760 – September 18, 1814) was a Congressman from [[Kentucky]], the first governor of the [[Missouri Territory]] and a brigadier general in the [[War of 1812]].

Howard was born in Lexington, Kentucky (then part of Virginia) and graduated in 1797 from the [[College of William &amp; Mary]].  He was elected to the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] in 1800.  He served in the 10th and 11th Congresses from Kentucky from 1807 until April 10, 1810. One week later, on April 17, 1810, [[James Madison]] appointed him [[Missouri Governor|Governor]] of the [[Louisiana Territory]] (the [[Louisiana Purchase]] district north of modern-day [[Louisiana]]), which was later renamed as the [[Missouri Territory]] in June 1812.

He resigned his post during the War of 1812 to become brigadier general of the Eighth Military Department.  During the conflict he and [[Nathan Boone]] ([[Daniel Boone]]'s youngest son) attacked [[Sac (tribe)|Sac]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] positions in [[Illinois]] and established [[Fort Clark (Illinois)|Fort Clark]] by [[Peoria, Illinois]].

He fell ill on the way back and died in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  His original burial location is unknown, although likely somewhere in downtown St. Louis. He was moved to the Old Grace Church Graveyard just north of downtown St. Louis (11th and Warren Street) sometime between 1817 and 1844. He was then (allegedly) reinterred in [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]] sometime after 1851. However, the cemetery has no record of Howard's body; therefore, the true location of his body remains a mystery.

Benjamin Howard is the namesake of [[Howard County, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named|publisher=The [[State Historical Society of Missouri]]|author=Eaton, David Wolfe|year=1916|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bitemporal Modeling''' is an [[Information modeling|information modeling technique]] designed to handle historical data along two different [[timeline]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/timeNarrative.html#dimensions|title=Temporal Patterns|work=martinfowler.com|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it possible to rewind the information to "as it actually was" in combination with "as it was recorded" at some point in time. In order to be able to do so, information cannot be discarded even if it is erroneous. Within, for example, [[financial reporting]] it is often desirable to be able to recreate an old [[report]] both as it actually looked at the time of creation and as it should have looked given corrections made to the data after its creation.

Implementations of Bitemporal Modeling are mostly done using [[relational database]]s. As such, Bitemporal Modeling is considered different from [[Dimensional modeling|Dimensional Modeling]] and complementary to [[database normalization]]. The [[SQL:2011]] standard provides language constructs for working with bitemporal data. However, many of current solutions are still vendor-specific.

== Philosophy ==
Bitemporal modeling uses bitemporal structures as the basic components. This results in the databases which have a consistent type of temporality for all data.

== Benefits of Bitemporal Modeling ==
By focusing on completeness and accuracy of data Bitemporal Modeling facilitates the creation of complete audit trails of data. Specifically this allows for queries which provide:

# The most accurate data possible as we know it now
# Data as we knew it at any point in time
# When and why the most accurate data we had changed

{{Contract law}}

A '''bonus clause''' is a clause in a contract that rewards the contractor for doing more than the letter of the contract; particularly, to finish the job early. It is in apposition to a [[Penal damages|penalty clause]] where the contractor loses by providing less than the letter of the contract, or providing it later than agreed.

The aim of a bonus clause is to give a [[win-win situation]] whereby the contractor wins by getting more money for finishing early, and the holder of the contract wins by having a product earlier to market.

'''''Cashin' In''''' is an American [[business]] analysis program, the fourth and last show of ''[[The Cost of Freedom]]'' business block, on Saturdays at 11:30 am ET on the [[Fox News Channel]]. [[Eric Bolling]] hosted from January 2013 until August 2017.  The show was originally hosted by FNC senior business correspondent [[Terry Keenan]] until her departure from the network September 2009. [[Cheryl Casone]] hosted from September 2009 until January 2013.

After taking over the hosting duties, Bolling announced a new direction for ''Cashin' In'': "While we work hard, pay our taxes and just try to make ends meet, law makers from DC to state houses across America are "Cashin' In". We will use this show as a megaphone, calling out Washington for the waste, fraud and abuse of our tax dollars." Bolling delivered this new message at the end of the January 26, 2013 episode. On September 8, 2017, Eric Bolling was fired by Fox News Channel.

In December 2017, it was announced that the ''Cost of Freedom'' block will be replaced by a new two-hour show, ''[[Cavuto Live]]'', hosted by [[Neil Cavuto]], beginning on January 20, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Fox News Channel Taps Neil Cavuto to Anchor Live Two-Hour Saturday News Program|url=http://press.foxnews.com/2017/12/fox-news-channel-taps-neil-cavuto-to-anchor-live-two-hour-saturday-news-program/|agency=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/neil-cavuto-anchor-saturday-morning-two-hours-fox-news-channel-1202226128/ |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=Neil Cavuto To Anchor Two Hour ‘Cavuto Live’ On Fox News Channel’s Saturdays |date=December 13, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Segments==
* Stock Smarts: The opening of the show starts with a debate over what is going to possibly happen in the next week in the stock market, based on headlines and history, and how it will affect one's bottom line.
* Best Bets: "Best Bets" opens the floor to the panelists to choose any number of stocks which they believe could go up and "make you money".
* Stock of the Week: The "Stock of the Week" is the choice that the panel believes will "take off in the next five trading days."
* Money Mail: The closing of the show usually ends with a segment dedicated to the e-mails sent into the show, asking about stocks people own or if a specific stock is worth buying or avoiding.

==''Cashin' In'' Challenge==
Every year the show has been on the air, a "''Cashin' In'' Challenge" between the regular panelists has been held. The Challenge's rules are:
* Each player has $10,000 in play money
* Each player can hold as much cash as they like
* Each portfolio can have up to five different securities
* Each stock and bond transaction will carry a $15 brokerage fee
* There will be no transaction fee for funds, but loads and expenses will apply

For the last three years of the contest, [[Dagen McDowell]] (who is not a professional money manager, unlike her counterparts) has come up on top of all the others in the end.

'''''Castillo v. Case Farms of Ohio''''',  96 F Supp. 2d 578, is a case involving poor working conditions for migratory workers.  It established that an [[Agency (law)|principal / agent]] relationship existed between Case Farms and America's Tempcorps (ATC) that allowed Case Farms to be liable for its agent's actions.

==Facts==
[[Migrant workers|Migrant farm workers]] were recruited in Texas by America's Tempcorps to work in Case Farm's [[Ohio]]-based chicken processing plant.  They were given a bus ticket and $20 for three days of food. Upon arriving they found themselves living in conditions called "distressing and deplorable" by the court.  The employees were packed in to unfurnished rooms infested with cockroaches and rats.  The workers slept on the floor and were transported in an overcrowded van.

==Issue==
The working conditions were largely not refuted.  At issue was 1) whether or not American's Tempcorps (ATC) was an agent of Case Farms, and 2) if agency existed, whether that agency make Case Farms liable for ATC’s actions.

==Complaint==
The plaintiffs alleged:
*Violations of the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act]] (AWPA)
*Violations of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]
*[[Breach of Contract]]
*[[Fraud]]
*[[Negligence|Negligent]] Misrepresentation

==Plaintiff’s Argument==  
Castillo argued that agency relationship existed between ATC and Case Farms, and the scope of that relationship included both the [[Agency (law)|express authority]] to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ plant, and the [[Agency (law)|implied authority]] to do all things proper, usual and necessary to exercise that authority.

==Defendant’s Argument==  
Case Farms argued, to the extent that an agency relationship existed, the scope of that agency was limited solely to informing recruits about the availability of work at Case Farms’ processing plant.  They also contended that the workers recruited by ATC were not full-fledged Case Farms workers (despite the fact that the work, pay rates, and supervision of these workers were essentially identical to Case Farms employees.)

== The Court's Analysis ==   
1) A principal may be liable for the acts of a purported agent based on an actual agency relationship created by the principal’s express or implied delegation of authority to the agent.

2) A principal is liable only if those actions are taken in the scope of the agent’s employment.
Express actual authority exists “where the principal has made it clear to the agent that he wants the act under scrutiny to be done.”

3) Giving an agent express authority to undertake a certain act also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise that express authority.

The evidence at trial supported the contention that Case Farms expressly authorized ATC to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ Ohio plant, and that such an express agency existed with the scope of recruiting and hiring migrant workers.
The evidence also supported the contention that the housing and transportation activities were well within the agents implied authority—based on Case Farms’ unique recruiting challenges, the great distances the migrant workers sought were required to travel, and Case Farms outsourcing of this difficult recruiting task to ATC.

== Holding ==   
America's Tempcorps was an agent of Case Farms, ATC’s actions were attributable to Case Farms for the purpose of assessing compliance with the [[Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act|AWPA]], and Case Farms was liable for ATC’s actions..

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">In [[organizational development]], '''chaos theory''' is a subset of more general [[chaos theory]] that incorporates principles of [[quantum mechanics]] and presents them in a [[complex system]]s environment. To the observer the systems seem to be in chaos. Organizational Development of a business system is the management of that apparent chaos. The term “Managing Organized Chaos” is used in the book by the same name Managing Organized Chaos – Business Planning 1.0, to describe the daily management of an entity (business) engaged in continual activity.

{{Competition law}}

'''Conscious parallelism''' is a term used in [[competition law]] to describe pricing strategies among competitors in an [[oligopoly]] that occurs without an actual agreement between the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/RSCAS/Research/Competition/2006(pdf)/200610-COMPed-Allendesalazar.pdf |title=Oligopolies, Conscious Parallelism and Concertatio |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.

This practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors. Courts have held that no violation of the antitrust laws occurs where firms independently raise or lower prices, but that a violation can be shown when "plus factors" occur, such as firms being motivated to collude and taking actions against their own economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;
Kevin Scott Marshall, Stephen H. Kalos, ''The Economics of Antitrust Injury and Firm-specific Damages'' (2008), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe industry-wide assumption of terms other than price. For example, all competitors in an industry might make only long-term leases of products such as heavy machinery, leaving lessors with no opportunity to make a short-term lease of that product from any competitor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8041">{{Other uses|Pitch (disambiguation){{!}}Pitch}}

An '''elevator pitch''', '''elevator speech''', or '''elevator statement''' is a short description of an idea, product, company, or oneself that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time. This description typically explains who the product/company is for, what it does, why it is needed, and how it will get done. For the latter, when explaining an individual, the description generally explains one’s skills and goals, and why they would be a productive and beneficial person to have on a team or within a company/project. An elevator pitch does not have to include all of these components, but it usually does at least explain what the idea, product, company, or person is and why it/they are valuable.

An elevator pitch can be used to entice an investor, executive in a company, or explain an idea to a founder’s parents. The goal is simply to convey the overall concept or topic in an exciting way. Unlike a [[Sales_presentation|sales pitch]], there may not be a clear buyer/seller relationship.

The name—elevator pitch—reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes. 

== Background information and history ==
There are many origin stories for the elevator pitch or elevator speech. One commonly-known origin story is that of Ilene Rosenzweig and Michael Caruso, two former journalists in the 90s. According to Rosenzweig, Caruso was a senior editor at [[Vanity_Fair_(magazines)|Vanity Fair]] and was continuously attempting to pitch story ideas to the Editor-In-Chief at the time, but could never pin her down long enough to do so simply because she was always on the move.&lt;ref&gt;http://presentingrob.blogspot.com/2016/01/elevator-pitches-brief-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; So, in order to pitch her ideas, Caruso would join her during short free periods of time she had, such as on an elevator ride. Thus, the concept of an elevator pitch was created, as says Rosenzweig.

However, there is another known potential origin story that dates back prior to the story of Rosenzweig and Caruso. [[Philip_B._Crosby#Works|Philip Crosby]], author of “The Art of Getting Your Own Sweet Way” (1972) and “Quality Is Still Free,” (1996) suggested individuals should have a pre-prepared speech that can deliver information regarding themselves or a quality that they can provide within a short period of time, namely the amount of time of an elevator ride for if an individual finds themselves on an elevator with a prominent figure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-confidant.info/2012/the-history-of-the-elevator-speech/&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, is meant to allow an individual to pitch themselves or an idea to a person who is high up in a company, with very limited time.

Crosby, who worked as a quality test technician, and then later as the Director of Quality at [[ITT_Inc.|International Telephone and Telegraph]], recounted how an elevator pitch could be used to push for change within the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://asq.org/quality-progress/2011/05/one-good-idea-going-up.html&lt;/ref&gt; He planned a speech regarding the change he wanted to see and waited at the ITT headquarters elevator. Crosby stepped onto an elevator with the [[Chief_executive_officer|CEO]] of the company in order to deliver his speech. Once they reached the floor in which the CEO was getting off, Crosby was asked to deliver a full presentation on the topic at a meeting for all of the general managers.

The concept of an elevator pitch, as created by Crosby, did not receive much popularity until two statisticians, Gerry Hahn from [[General Electric]] and Tom Boardman, a professor at the [[University_of_Colorado|University or Colorado]], started to push the concept onto other statisticians. The two pushed this concept in order to help other statisticians in promoting what they have to offer. Boardman pushed the concept much further than Hahn, resulting in the elevator pitch, or elevator speech, ultimately being linked to Boardman and his professional life.

Another origin story for the elevator pitch is from [[Elisha_Otis|Elisha Graves Otis]], the inventor of a device meant for elevator safety, which dates back to the 1850s. In 1852, Otis began developing a device that would improve the safety of elevators, specifically related to the hoists used to lift heavy equipment to upper floors.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/03/29/the-first-ever-elevator-pitch/&lt;/ref&gt; The device was created out of steel wagon spring meshing and provided a backup catch and hold mechanism if the rope lifting the elevator gave way. In 1854, in the Crystal Palace Exposition in New York in front of a big audience, Otis revealed his device. He did so by lifting an elevator, like normal, but as it was positioned approximately halfway up the elevator shaft, the rope was cut. The elevator platform was held in place by Otis’ device. This can be known as the first elevator pitch ever.

== Aspects of an Elevator Pitch ==

An elevator pitch is meant to last the duration of an elevator ride, which can vary in length from approximately 15 seconds to two minutes. Therefore, the main focus of an elevator pitch should be making it short and direct. According to the Idaho Business Review&lt;ref&gt;https://idahobusinessreview.com/2012/02/22/the-elevator-pitch-for-every-professional/&lt;/ref&gt;, the first two sentences of any elevator pitch are the most important, and should hook or grab the attention of the listener(s). Information in an elevator pitch, due to the limited amount of time, should be condensed in order to express the most important ideas or concepts within the allotted time. 
[[File:Business_agreement_handshake_at_coffee_shop.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Business agreement at coffee shop]]
Furthermore, the Idaho Business Review suggests individuals who use an elevator pitch deliver it using simple language, and avoiding statistics or other language that may disrupt the focus of the listener. Bloomberg Businessweek suggests that an important lesson to think about when giving an elevator pitch is to “adjust the pitch to the person who is listening, and refine it as you and your business continue to grow and change.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrgriffin.org/FHSWEB/ENT/articles/ThePerfectElevatorPitch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When delivering an elevator pitch, individuals are encouraged to remain flexible and adaptable, and to be able to deliver the pitch in a genuine and fluent fashion. By doing so, the intended audience of the pitch will likely be able to follow the information, and will not interpret it as being too scripted.

== Advantages of utilizing Elevator Pitches ==

Advantages to conducting an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, include convenience and simplicity. For instance, elevator pitches can be given on short notice and without much preparation due to the pre-planning of the content being delivered within said pitch.&lt;ref&gt;https://idahobusinessreview.com/2012/02/22/the-elevator-pitch-for-every-professional/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, elevator pitches allow the individual who is giving the pitch the ability to simplify the content and deliver it in a less complicated manner by providing the information in a cut-down fashion that gets right to the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/36831/wow-project|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|title=The Wow Project|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8549">'''Experience management''' is the activity where organizations measure and improve the various experiences they provide, not only to customers, but to all their [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] like vendors, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. It is premised on the idea that experiences are a distinct economic offering, that create economic value and competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy|title = Welcome to the Experience Economy|publisher = Harvard Business Review|author = B.

Organizations are increasingly collecting experience data as opposed to operational data, since experiences are seen as a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2017/03/02/ryan-smiths-qualtrics-capitalizes-on-the-rise-of-the-experience-economy/#1e9a9d276221|title = Ryan Smith's Qualtrics Capitalizes On The Rise Of The 'Experience Economy'|publisher = Forbes |author = Bruce Rogers|date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = http://www.haaga-helia.fi/en/opinto-opas/opintojaksokuvaukset/DES8RB024|title = Experience Management|publisher = Haaga-Helia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience management platforms provide various services to automate the process of identifying and improving experiences across an organization.&lt;ref name=Signage /&gt;

Broader than [[customer experience]], experience management now encompasses customer experience along with other areas, such as [[brand management|brand experience]], [[employee experience design|employee experience]] and product experience, which are all seen as interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = http://www.marketing-trends-congress.com/archives/2010/Materiali/DoctoralColloquium/Kreuzer.pdf|title = An embodied cognition approach to the study of consumer brand knowledge|publisher = Marketing Trends Congress|author = Maria Kreuzer|date = November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 24 March 2017|url = https://www.amazon.com/Enhancing-Employee-Experience-Organizational-contribute/dp/3639138163|title = Enhancing the Employee Experience: Organizational practices that contribute to employee engagement|publisher = VDM Verlag|author = Linda Heska|date = 10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 29 March 2017|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/building-a-design-driven-culture|title = Building a design-driven culture|publisher = McKinsey&amp;Company|author = Jennifer Kilian, Hugo Sarrazin, and Hyo Yeon|date = September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1994 Steve Haeckel and Lou Carbone collaborated on a seminal early article on experience management, titled "Engineering Customer Experiences," where they defined experience as "the 'take-away' impression formed by people's encounters  with  products,  services  and  businesses — a perception produced  when  humans  consolidate  [[sense|sensory  information]]." They argued that the new approach must focus on total experience as the key customer [[value proposition]].&lt;ref name=Schmitt /&gt;

The concept reached a wide audience in 1999, when it was popularized by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore in their book ''[[The Experience Economy|Experience Economy]]''.&lt;ref name=Schmitt&gt;{{cite book|last = Schmitt|first = Bernd |date = 2011|title = Experience Marketing: Concepts, Frameworks and Consumer Insights|url = https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/globalbrands/files/Experience%20Marketing%20-%20Schmitt%20-%20Foundations%20and%20Trends%202011.pdf|publisher = Columbia Business School|page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[Bernd Schmitt]] published ''Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/335|title = Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands|publisher = Columbia Business School|author = Bernd Schmitt|date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, experience management emerged as a complex field unifying the experiences of brands, employees, products and more. It was acknowledged that generating new experiences for end customers requires designing better experiences for internal players of an organization. Value is created by focusing on the experiences of everyone involved in or affected by a new offer, such as customers, employees, suppliers, and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 29 March 2017|url = https://hbr.org/2010/10/building-the-co-creative-enterprise|title = Building the Co-Creative Enterprise|publisher = Harvard Business Review|author = Venkat Ramaswamy and Francis Gouillart|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

To create and manage the experiences, businesses must evaluate, implement, integrate, and build experiences from a fragmented landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www.forrester.com/report/Vendor+Landscape+Digital+Experience+Platforms/-/E-RES104302|title = Vendor Landscape: Digital Experience Platforms|publisher = Forrester|author = Mark Grannan, Danielle Geoffroy|date = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such needs are met by experience management platforms, which help automate the process of measuring and improving experiences across an organization by coordinating content, customer data and core services, and unifying marketing, commerce and service processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = https://www.loyalty360.org/loyalty-today/article/11-tech-trends-you-can-bet-your-customer-experienc|title = 11 Tech Trends You Can Bet Your Customer Experience Budgets On, Today through 2020...|publisher = Loyalty 360|author = MCorpCX|date = 3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Signage&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= 25 March 2017|url = https://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/intel-webinar-zooms-in-on-digital-experience-management-platforms-2/|title = Intel webinar zooms in on digital experience management platforms|publisher = Digital Signage Today|author = Bradley Cooper|date = 21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience management platforms compare multiple layers of data and statistics to enable organizations to identify any experience gaps. They connect [[operational database]]s with human feedback, analyzing respondents' emotions, beliefs, and sentiments for a holistic view of the experiences they provide. Their methods include [[artificial intelligence]], [[predictive analytics]], and [[statistical models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate = 25 March 2017|url = http://www.heraldextra.com/business/local/qualtrics-quantifies-and-enhances-the-experience-economy-in-new-platform/article_92d96208-2556-5a04-9aad-5172da9d412f.html|title = Qualtrics quantifies and enhances the 'experience economy' in new platform|publisher = Daily Herald|author = Karissa Neely|date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

While the term ''experience management'' is predominantly used in business, it has another meaning.

In [[Business law|business or commercial law]], an '''extraordinary resolution''' or '''special resolution'''&lt;ref&gt;Some jurisdictions use both terms, but meaning slightly different things.  For example, in the United Kingdom, an extraordinary resolution is a resolution passed by not less than 75% of the members, and a special resolution is a resolution passed by the same majority, but having given then members not less than 21 days' notice of the intention to put the resolution to a vote, see section 378 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] passed by the [[stockholder|shareholders]] of a [[company (law)|company]] by a greater majority than is required to pass an [[ordinary resolution]]. The precise figures vary in different countries, but commonly an extraordinary resolution must be affirmed by not less than 75% of members casting votes, whereas an ordinary resolution only requires a bare majority.

Extraordinary resolutions are generally only required in certain specific situations required by statute.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], to [[Liquidation#Voluntary liquidation|liquidate]] a company voluntarily on the ground that it cannot by reason of its insolvency continue its business, requires an extraordinary resolution.

However, in certain circumstances a company may wish to amend its [[Company (law)#Corporate constitution|constitutional documents]] to provide that an extraordinary resolution needs to be passed prior to the company engaging in any reserved matters, purely as a matter of internal organisational control.

==Early life==

Boccardi was born in Milan, Italy in October 1967. His father was the founder of the Istituto Finanziario Ambrosiano, a financial institution with interests in construction, real estate, and insurance.  Boccardi attended the Leone XIII school in Milan, and then the Ophenaimer. He continued his studies in the United States, attending [[Villanova Preparatory School]], in Ojai, California, but was unable to finish his junior year when his family’s holding company's collapsed.

At age 19 Boccardi established himself as a [[commodities trader]] in Monte Carlo.  In his early twenties he began to invest in condominium development in Italy and in the South of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/ecco-michael-tiranno-po-padrino-e-po-007.html Ecco Michael Tiranno via Il Giornale]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affaritaliani.it/giochiescommesse/legginews.asp?id=140611115921&amp;refresh_ce L'America Punta sull' online Italiano via Affari Italiani]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2008/aug/28/man-who-would-be-king/|title=The man who would be king|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/2007-01-16/casinos-jeux-brouilles/920/0/6031|title=Archives - Le Point.fr|first=Le Point,|last=magazine|website=Le Point.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockdirt.com/john-mayor-gets-drum-lessons-from-scott-phillips/4055/ Fabrizio Boccardi Hosts Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boccardi has attempted to buy a Las Vegas casino, since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2001/0528/060a.html|title=Long Live the King|first=RiShawn|last=Biddle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nevadabusiness.com/issues/NBMDecember1999ViewIssue.pdf|title=Nevada Business Journal Up Front Pg. 8|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;At that time, he signed an agreement to buy the New Frontier Hotel &amp; Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, for $270 million owned at the time by [[Phil Ruffin]]. The price Boccardi was willing to pay in 1999 for the aged New Frontier Hotel &amp; Casino, was considered too high by the lenders and gaming analysts as a result Boccardi was forced to pull out during due diligence and terminate the agreement with Ruffin. Phil Ruffin sold the New Frontier to El Ad Properties in 2007 at more than $1.2 billion, the 36 Frontier acres sold for more than $33 million an acre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PressReleases1999_4th/Oct99_LVGrowingMarket.html Boccardi Capital intends to build something bigger than a Megaresort via Hotel Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/mar/14/200-million-bid-for-desert-inn-called-flaky/ 200 million bid for Desert Inn via The Las Vegas Sun 03/14/2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.lasvegassun.com/news/1998/dec/11/french-italians-team-up-on-nevada-casino-complex/|title=French, Italians team up on Nevada casino complex|date=11 December 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1999/oct/07/bullish-european-investors-eye-casinos/|title=Bullish European investors eye casinos|date=7 October 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/magnate-stays-quiet-about-plans-134686|title=Magnate Stays Quiet About Plans|website=www.casinocitytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Boccardi offered $200 million for the Desert Inn Hotel &amp; Casino, but his offer was considered too low by owners Starwood Hotel &amp; Resorts and was then sold to Las Vegas casino owner [[Steve Wynn]] for $275 million.

Fabrizio Boccardi has announced plans to use his media properties such as Tiranno, Tyrant and Tyrant Knight to launch a global gaming and hospitality brand which will include the construction of the Seven Sins Megaresort, the same casino depicted in the Michael Tiranno the Tyrant book series, films and comics.  In an interview with Robin Leach via the Review Journal in 2017, Boccardi confirmed that the timing for his casino and hospitality plans to be realized will be primarily determined by the level of success of the film property with the announced title The Seven Sins, a story of money, power and a new type of superhero based on adaptations inspired by the book series of Michael Tiranno the Tyrant aka the Tyrant Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/robin-leach/comedy-vietnamese-fusion-at-black-sheep/|title=Comedy &amp; Dolls at Planet Hollywood; Vietnamese fusion at Black Sheep|date=1 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/news/tyrant-creator-aims-meld-fiction-fact-214957826.html|title=In 'Tyrant,' creator aims to meld fiction, fact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-acquires-rights-to-prose-antihero-the-tyrant/|title=DC Comics acquires rights to prose antihero The Tyrant|date=10 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://knpr.org/dc-blog/so-its-novel-and-comic-book-and-hotel-casino|title=So, it's a novel AND comic book AND hotel-casino?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oneenergydream.blogspot.com/2010/01/fabrizio-boccardi-la-vita-e-le-opere.html|title=Fabrizio Boccardi: la vita e le opere!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-73230651.html|title=Las Vegas Review-Journal Gaming Chips Column.|date=15 April 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://knpr.org/taxonomy/term/12269/all  Visionary Investor Fabrizio Boccardi Interview via KNPR Radio Nevada retrieved on 06/13/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Media Properties==

===Dark Light Dawn===

It was announced  Fabrizio Boccardi&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm9038106/bio?ref=mmnovbio|title=Fabrizio Boccardi|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a new media property named Dark Light Dawn. The first book 
in the series has been announced for publication in North America by Macmillan Publishing Group on August 1, 2017.  The book is written by Jon Land and created and owned by Fabrizio Boccardi.
According to media articles Dark Light Dawn is also set for other media such as film and television.

Inspired by recent geopolitical events, rising terrorism, and religious conflicts, the novel meshes an action-packed, paranormal tale with an entirely fresh take on the action horror thriller genre. Dark Light Dawn creatively blends scientific principles, superstition, biblical elements and the inexplicable of the universe, culminating in a celebration of free will and the power of human nature itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebigthrill.org/2017/07/dark-light-dawn-by-jon-land-and-created-by-fabrizio-boccardi/|title=Dark Light: Dawn by Jon Land and created by Fabrizio Boccardi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/amp/c.php?url=Creator-and-Producer-Fabrizio-Boccardis-Reinvention-of-the-Supernatural-Genre-in-Media-S|title=Creator and Producer Fabrizio Boccardi's Reinvention of the Supernatural Genre in Media Sparks Curiosity|website=www.broadwayworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-light-dawn-a-conversation-with-jon-land-and_us_5981d0ffe4b02be325be0259|title='Dark Light: Dawn,' A Conversation with Jon Land and Fabrizio Boccardi|first=Mark|last=Rubinstein|date=2 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/topshelfmagazine/docs/topshelf_magazine_august_2017_opt|title=Topshelf Magazine - August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rifflebooks.com/list/164990 Riffle Editor’s Choice via Riffle Books retrieved 12/31/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20171102/review-supernatural-twist-blistering-pace-makes-this-thriller-hard-to-put-down Providence Journal Review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-2872-4 Dark Light Dawn Publisher Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://noirjournal.tumblr.com/post/163935958800/dark-light-dawn/amp Noir Journal Review of Dark Light Dawn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exchange.dp.la/store/recent?category=FBFIC015000 Dark Light Dawn via Digital Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3215029&amp;R=3215029 Black Scorpion via Toronto Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chipublib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1882493126_dark_light Dark Light Dawn via Chicago Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.friscolibrary.com/portal/Dark-light--dawn-Jon-Land--created-by-Fabrizio/YtLzgrjR7gc/ Dark Light Dawn via Frisco Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://halloweenincorporated.com/index.html Dark Light Dawn the best of Halloween via Halloween Incorporated received 01/05/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://booktrib.com/2017/08/jon-land-dark-light-dawn/ Jon Land's 'Dark Light Dawn' Comes with a Vengeance via Booktrib 08/04/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://podbay.fm/show/384365039/e/1501639200?autostart=1 Beyond The Cover with guests Jon Land and Fabrizio Boccardi via Suspense Radio retrieved on 01/07/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blogtalkradio.com/fran-lewis/2017/09/06/dark-light-dawn DARK LIGHT DAWN 09/06 by Fran Lewis via Books Podcasts retrieved on 01/07/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gumshoereview.com/php/Review-id.php?id=5873 "Dark Light Dawn” via the Gumshoe Review retrieved on 01/07/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://spl.overdrive.com/media/239AF536-96E5-4069-8A44-C7E812955571 DARK LIGHT DAWN via Seattle Public Library retrieved on 01/07/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridger.com/opinion/20180119/readers-guide-the-end-of-alzheimers-at-oak-ridge-public-library “Readers Guide” via the Oak Ridger retrieved on 01/27/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-review/dark-light-dawn “Dark Light Dawn’s book review” via RT Book Review - retrieved on 02/11/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifiandscary.com/more-2017-science-fiction-horror-novels-to-look-for-july-december/ “Science Fiction Horror Novels to look for July-December” via SCI-Fi &amp;

'''Financial repression''' comprises "policies that result in savers earning returns below the rate of [[inflation]]" in order to allow banks to "provide cheap loans to companies and governments, reducing the burden of repayments".&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|title=China Savers Prioritized Over Banks by PBOC|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-25/china-savers-prioritized-over-banks-by-pboc-as-repression-eases.html|work=Bloomberg|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be particularly effective at liquidating [[government debt]] [[Denomination (currency)|denominated]] in domestic currency.&lt;ref name=redux/&gt; It can also lead to a large expansions in debt "to levels evoking comparisons with the excesses that generated [[Japan]]’s [[Lost Decade (Japan)|lost decade]] and the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]]" in 1997.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

The term was introduced in 1973 by [[Stanford]] economists Edward S. Shaw and [[Ronald I. McKinnon]]&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Edward S. ''Financial Deepening in Economic Development''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, Ronald I. ''Money and Capital in Economic Development''. Washington, D.C.: [[Brookings Institution]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; in order to "disparage growth-inhibiting policies in [[emerging markets]]".

== Mechanism ==

Financial repression consists of the following:&lt;ref name="logd"/&gt;
#Explicit or indirect capping of interest rates, such as on government debt and deposit rates (e.g., [[Regulation Q]]).
#Government ownership or control of domestic banks and financial institutions with barriers that limit other institutions from entering the market.
#High [[reserve requirements]].
#Creation or maintenance of a [[Captive market |captive domestic market]] for government debt, achieved by requiring banks to hold government debt via [[capital requirements]], or by prohibiting or disincentivising alternatives.
#Government restrictions on the transfer of assets abroad through the imposition of [[capital controls]].

These measures allow governments to issue debt at lower interest rates. A low [[nominal interest rate]] can reduce debt servicing costs, while [[negative interest rates|negative real interest rates]] erodes the real value of government debt.&lt;ref name="logd"/&gt; Thus, financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by inflation and can be considered a form of [[taxation]],&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart, Carmen M. and Rogoff, Kenneth S., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly'']. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively a form of [[debasement]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill H. Gross|Bill Gross]], [http://www.pimco.com/EN/Insights/Pages/The-Caine-Mutiny-Part-2.aspx "The Caine Mutiny Part 2"], PIMCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the financial repression tax was computed for 24 [[emerging market]]s from 1974 to 1987. The results showed that financial repression exceeded 2% of GDP for seven countries, and greater than 3% for five countries. For five countries ([[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Zimbabwe]]) it represented approximately 20% of [[tax revenue]]. In the case of [[Mexico]] financial repression was 6% of GDP, or 40% of tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannini, Alberto and de Melo, Martha, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117587  "Government Revenue from Financial Repression"], ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', Vol. 83, No. 4 Sep. 1993 (pp. 953-963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial repression is categorized as "[[macroprudential policy|macroprudential regulation]]"—i.e., government efforts to "ensure the health of an entire financial system.&lt;ref name=redux&gt;Carmen M. Reinhart, Jacob F. Kirkegaard, and M. Belen Sbrancia, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/06/pdf/reinhart.pdf "Financial Repression Redux"], IMF Finance and Development, June 2011, p. 22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===After World War II===
Financial repression "played an important role in reducing [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]" by keeping [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real]] interest rates for government debt below 1% for two-thirds of the time between 1945 and 1980, the United States was able to "inflate away" the large debt (122% of GDP) left over from the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name=redux/&gt; In the [[UK]], government debt declined from 216% of GDP in 1945 to 138% ten years later in 1955.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news|title=The great repression|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18834259?story_id=18834259|work=The Economist|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===China===
[[China]]'s [[Economy of China|economic growth]] has been attributed to financial repression thanks to "low returns on savings and the cheap loans that it makes possible". This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed [[investment]]s for [[economic growth]]. However, because low returns also dampens [[consumer spending]], [[Household final consumption expenditure|household expenditures]] account for "a smaller share of [[GDP]] in China than in any other major economy".&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; However, as of December 2014, the [[People’s Bank of China]] "started to undo decades of financial repression" and the government now allows Chinese savers to collect up to a 3.3% return on one-year deposits. At China's 1.6% inflation rate, this is a "high real-interest rate compared to other major economies”.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===After the 2008 economic recession===
In a 2011 [[NBER]] working paper, [[Carmen Reinhart]] and Maria Belen Sbrancia speculate on a possible return by governments to this form of debt reduction in order to deal with high debt levels following the [[2008 economic crisis]].&lt;ref name="logd"&gt;Carmen M. Reinhart and M. Belen Sbrancia, [https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2011/res2/pdf/crbs.pdf "The Liquidation of Government Debt"], IMF, 2011, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

"To get access to capital, [[Austria]] has restricted capital flows to foreign [[subsidiaries]] in central and eastern Europe. Select [[pension fund]]s have also been transferred to governments in [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Ireland]] and [[Hungary]], enabling them to re-allocate toward [[sovereign bond]]s."&lt;ref name=alli/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics{{who|date=October 2016}} argue that if this view was true, investors (i.e., capital-seeking parties) would be inclined to demand capital in large quantities and would be buying capital goods from this capital. This high demand for capital goods would certainly lead to [[inflation]] and thus the [[central bank]]s would be forced to raise interest rates again. As a boom pepped by low interest rates fails to appear these days in industrialized countries, this is a sign that the low interest rates seem to be necessary to ensure an equilibrium on the capital market, thus to balance capital-supply—i.e., savers—on one side and capital-demand—i.e., investors and the government—on the other. This view argues that interest rates would be even lower if it were not for the high government debt ratio (i.e., capital demand from the government).

[[Free-market]] economists argue that financial repression [[Crowding out (economics)|crowds out]] private-sector investment, thus undermining growth. On the other hand, "[[postwar]] politicians clearly decided this was a price worth paying to cut debt and avoid outright [[Default (finance)|default]] or draconian spending cuts. And the longer the gridlock over fiscal reform rumbles on, the greater the chance that 'repression' comes to be seen as the least of all evils".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gillian Tett]], [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0af29588-7a5b-11e0-af64-00144feabdc0.html "Policymakers learn a new and alarming catchphrase"], ''Financial Times'', May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, financial repression has been called a “[[stealth tax]]” that "rewards debtors and punishes savers—especially [[Pensioner|retirees]]" because their investments will no longer generate the expected return, which is income for retirees.&lt;ref name=alli&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Repression 101|url=http://us.allianzgi.com/EducationAndPlanning/InvestmentThemes/Pages/Financial_Repression101.aspx|website=[[Allianz]] Global Investors|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amerman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amerman|first1=Daniel|title=The 2nd Edge of Modern Financial Repression: Manipulating Inflation Indexes to Steal from Retirees &amp; Public Workers|url=http://www.financialsense.com/contributors/daniel-amerman/2011/09/12/the-2nd-edge-of-modern-financial-repression|work=Financial Sense|date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] interest rates lower than they would be in more competitive markets. Other things equal, this reduces the government’s interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to [[Government budget balance|deficit reduction]]. However, when financial repression produces negative [[real interest rate]]s (nominal rates below the inflation rate), it reduces or liquidates existing debts and becomes the equivalent of a tax—a [[Transfer payment|transfer]] from creditors (savers) to borrowers, including the government."&lt;ref name=redux/&gt;

'''François-Louis Cailler''' (1796–1852) was the first Swiss producer of [[chocolate]], founder of the [[Cailler]] chocolate company.

He first tasted Italian chocolate at a local fair and spent four years in [[Turin]] ([[Italy]]) learning the art of chocolate making. When he returned to [[Switzerland]], he set up the first Swiss chocolate factory in Corsier, near [[Vevey]] in 1819. In 1825, he opened a second factory, which he later sold to his son Julian and son-in-law [[Daniel Peter]].

His great innovation was the development of a smooth chocolate that could be formed into bars. This was a worldwide sensation.

In 1875, [[Daniel Peter]] had the idea of combining the chocolate with his neighbor [[Henri Nestlé]]'s condensed milk to make [[milk chocolate]]. The Caillers and Peter eventually merged with the operation of [[Charles-Amédée Kohler]] (the inventor of hazelnut chocolate) to form the firm of Peter, Cailler, Kohler.
In 1904, the "branches" were invented. These are sticks of chocolate. In 1937, the chocolate bar called Rayon was invented. The company was later purchased by the manufacturing giant [[Nestlé]], in 1929.

'''Hyperconsumerism''', '''hyper-consumerism''', '''hyperconsumption''' or '''hyper-consumption''' refer to the consumption of goods for non-functional purposes&lt;ref name="Sirgy2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Joseph Sirgy|title=Handbook of Quality-of-Life Research: An Ethical Marketing Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxEHYNDzGO0C&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=30 November 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0172-7|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated significant pressure to consume those goods exerted by the modern, [[capitalist]] society, as those goods shape one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="Städtler2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Tierney|title=Key Perspectives in Criminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-u1NoSEEJR4C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=1 May 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill International|isbn=978-0-335-22914-7|pages=124–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frenchy Lunning]] defines it curtly as "a [[consumerism]] for the sake of consuming."&lt;ref name="Lunning2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frenchy Lunning|title=Fanthropologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5d0Q9fdinQUC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=9 November 2010|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7387-2|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In a hyper-consumption society, "each social experience is mediated by market mechanisms", as market exchanges have spread to institutions in which they played lesser (if any) role previously, such as universities.&lt;ref name="GabrielLang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yiannis Gabriel|author2=Tim Lang|title=The Unmanageable Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPA8OhyoHnAC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=9 May 2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-1893-0|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BondebjergGolding2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ib Bondebjerg|author2=Peter Golding|title=European Culture And The Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ9p6ms74AsC&amp;pg=PT74|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2004|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-111-6|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal identity===

Hyperconsumerism is fueled by [[brands]], as people often form deep attachment to product brands, which affects people's identity, and which pressure people to buy and consume their goods.&lt;ref name="Städtler2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raphael Städtler|title=Celebrity Scandals and their Impact on Brand Image: A Study among Young Consumers: A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geYcb_YZk4UC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=19 April 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-89715-5|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"/&gt;

===Product lifecycle===

Another of the characteristics of hyperconsumerism is the constant pursuit of novelty, encouraging consumers to buy new and discard the old, seen particularly in [[fashion]], where the [[product lifecycle]] can be very short, measured sometimes in weeks only.&lt;ref name="BondebjergGolding2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Arnold|title=Ethical Marketing and The New Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgohhaXFMqcC&amp;pg=PT30|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=27 October 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-68546-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspicuous consumption===

In hyperconsumerism, goods are often [[status symbols]], as individuals buy them not so much to use them, as to [[Conspicuous consumption|display them to others]], sending associated meanings (such as displaying wealth).&lt;ref name="Sirgy2001"/&gt; However, according to other theorists, the need to consume in hyper-consumption society is driven less by competition with others than by their own [[hedonistic]] pleasure.&lt;ref name="Paris2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Paris|title=Affluence, Mobility and Second Home Ownership|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcnD5vXj-_AC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-54891-5|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious characteristics===

Hyperconsumerism has been also said to have religious characteristics,&lt;ref name="Bhaskar2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Bhaskar|title=Interdisciplinarity and Climate Change: Transforming Knowledge and Practice for Our Global Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xE2Oa2wKQ0YC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=25 January 2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-57387-0|pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been compared to a new religion which enshrines consumerism above all, with elements of religious life being replaced by consumerist life: (going to) churches replaced by (going to) shopping malls, saints replaced by celebrities, penance replaced by shopping sprees, desire for better life after death replaced by desire for better life in the present, and so on.&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Sayers|title=The Trouble With Paris: Following Jesus in a World of Plastic Promises|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2osXF-V9XhkC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=3 June 2008|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-7460-4|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Sayers notes that hyperconsumerism has [[commercialized]] many religious symbols, giving an example of religious symbols worn as jewelry by non-believers.&lt;ref name="Sayers2008"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Hyperconsumerism has been associated with [[cultural homogenization]], [[globalization]], [[Eurocentrism]], Eurocentric [[modernizations]], and consequently, the spread of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=6 February 2013|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been blamed for environmental problems owing to excessive use of limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interview by Sophie Morris |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/think-you-love-shopping-its-the-marketing-scam-of-the-century-849922.html |title=Think you love shopping?

'''IQTELL''' was a productivity app that allowed users to manage email, tasks, projects, calendars, contacts, [[Evernote|Evernotes]] and more in a single app.  IQTELL was available as a web app, as well as an [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app. All user information was automatically synced between all devices. iOS and Android apps supported offline access. The app could be used to implement concepts and techniques described in the book ''[[Getting Things Done]]'' by David Allen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/iqtell-puts-gtd-notes-and-email-in-a-single-productivi-1539006627 "IQTELL Puts GTD, Notes and Email in a Single Productivity App"]. ''Lifehacker''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IQTELL was created by Ran Flam&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baselinemag.com/careers/slideshows/how-to-deal-with-email-when-youre-on-vacation.html "How to Deal With Email When You're on Vacation"]. ''Base Line'', By Dennis McCafferty  |  2014-07-03&lt;/ref&gt; and released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itproportal.com/2013/04/16/4-productivity-tools-help-you-get-things-done-iqtell-wunderlist-tracky-basecamp/ "4 Productivity tools to help you get things done: IQTell, Wunderlist, Tracky, Basecamp"]. ''IT Pro Portal'', 16 May 2013 By Kate Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, mobile apps for iOS and Android were released.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.maclife.com/article/news/overnight_recap_google_maps_out_beta_iqtell_amazon_coin_android "Overnight Recap: Google Maps Out of Beta, IQTELL, Amazon Coin on Android"]. ''Mac Life'', February 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Premium and Platinum subscription plans were introduced (while maintaining the free user version).

In April 2017, a new web app was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iqtell.com/2017/04/launching-new-web-app/ "Launching our new web app"]. ''IQTell Productivity Blog'', April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2017, all IQTell services have been closed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iqtell.com/2017/06/the-future-of-iqtell/ "The future of IQTell"]. ''IQTell Productivity Blog'', June 29, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productivity Methods ==

IQTell was designed to fit in with the ''Getting Things Done'' (GTD) productivity methods. Users may have had utilized GTD lists, such as Inbox, Actions, Projects, Someday, Ticklers, and Reference information to process their Inbox items into relevant GTD lists.&lt;ref name=tr&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/iqtell-is-ready-to-super-charge-your-mobile-productivity/ "IQTELL is ready to super charge your mobile productivity"]. By Jack Wallen, ''Tech Republic'', February 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/clear-your-head-while-quickly-navigating-your-inbox-with-iqtell-contexts/ "Clear your head while quickly navigating your inbox with IQTELL contexts"].By Jack Wallen. ''Tech Republic'', March 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the web app, iOS and/or Android apps, users could deploy macros/shortcuts to quickly process their email.&lt;ref name=muo&gt;[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/inbox-control-iqtell-might-answer/ "If Your Inbox Is Out of Control, IQTELL Might Be the Answer "].  ''MakeUseOf''. By Dann Albright on 26th March, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Email was turned into tasks (actions), projects, etc.&lt;ref name=tr /&gt; The original email was removed from the email inbox.&lt;ref name=muo /&gt;  The email became a part of the items created (e.g. actions, project, etc.) and could also be viewed in the All Mail folder (if [[Gmail]]), or the Archive folder (if non-Gmail). Users had flexibility to use the out-of-the-box macros/shortcuts as well as edit/create additional macros.

IQTELL features included email, calendars, contacts, list management, sharing and collaboration with team members. All of the features were compatible with commonly used organization software such as Evernote&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askyourandroid.com/applications/productivity-applications/iqtell-manage-your-emails-tasks-and-projects-the-smart-way/ "IQTELL: Manage your Emails, Projects and Tasks the smart way']. ''Ask Your Android''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iCloud]].

==Career==
Kotler is an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] and played with computers and programmed since an early age. He started his career with the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name="GeekBreach"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Current"&gt;{{cite news | last=Masserini | first=John Lucas| title =SafeBreach Raises $4 million In First Funding Round| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Security Current| date =8 July 2015| url =http://www.securitycurrent.com/en/news/ac_news/safebreach-raises-4-million-in-first-funding-round| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving in the military, Kotler worked at Radware where he became the [[Security operations center|Security Operation Center]] Team Leader.&lt;ref name="SCMag"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kotler | first=Itzik| title =Web 2.0: Attack of the JavaScript malware| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''[[SC Magazine]]''| date =30 July 2008| url =http://www.scmagazine.com/web-20-attack-of-the-javascript-malware/article/113132/| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Kotler (along with colleague, Tomer Bitton) demonstrated at DEF CON how a hacker could feasibly spread [[malware]] through software updates for applications like [[Skype]]. At the conference, Kotler and Bitton released a tool known as Ippon ("game over" in [[judo]] parlance) that could ask users on a public Wi-Fi network to update a specific application. If the users agreed, they would download malware instead of the updated version of the application.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCCO"/&gt;

Kotler left Radware in 2010 and joined a digital security firm, Security Art. Kotler served as the company's CTO. In May 2011, Kotler presented at the HackInTheBox conference in [[Amsterdam]] where he demonstrated how a [[Stuxnet]]-like malware could physically destroy servers in a [[Denial-of-service attack#Permanent denial-of-service attacks|permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attack]].&lt;ref name="Watch"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rubens | first=Paul| title =Stop Software Attacks From Destroying Your Servers| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Serverwatch.com]]| date =30 June 2011| url =http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3936741/Stop-Software-Attacks-From-Destroying-Your-Servers.htm| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2011, Kotler and [[Iftach Ian Amit]] presented at DEF CON, demonstrating how a bot master could communicate with [[botnets]] and with "zombie machines" using [[VoIP]] conference calls. Their open-source software, Moshi Moshi, illustrated how they could send instructions to and receive data from botnets and infiltrated networks using any phone line (including payphones).&lt;ref name="NW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NWScary"&gt;{{cite news | last=Greene | first=Tim| title =10 scariest hacks from Black Hat and Defcon| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[Network World]]| date =10 August 2011| url =http://www.networkworld.com/article/2868939/lan-wan/10-scariest-hacks-from-black-hat-and-defcon.html#slide3| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler also hosted a "Hack-a-thon" in 2011 with the goal of teaching hackers new techniques and improving information security.&lt;ref name="GeekIL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobesHack"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first=| title =ריצת המרתון של ההאקרים| newspaper =[[Globes]]| location = | pages = | language =Hebrew | publisher =| date =27 June 2011 | url =https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000658245| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Security Art, Kotler went on to co-found SafeBreach with Guy Bejerano in September 2014.&lt;ref name="Marker"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first=| title =סקויה ושלמה קרמר משקיעים 4 מיליון דולר בחברת אבטחת מידע ישראלית| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language =Hebrew | publisher =[[TheMarker]]| date =8 July 2015 | url =http://www.themarker.com/technation/1.2678804| accessdate =21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotler serves as the company's CTO.&lt;ref name="GeekBreach"/&gt; In July 2015, SafeBreach announced that it had raised $4 million in funding from [[Silicon Valley]]-based [[Sequoia Capital]] and [[angel investor]], [[Shlomo Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Globes01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; One of the company's primary services is a simulated "war game" that seeks to find breaches in a network's system.&lt;ref name="Globes01"/&gt;

Kotler is the author of "Reverse Engineering with LD_PRELOAD," an article published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kotler|first1=Izik|title=Reverse Engineering with LD_PRELOAD|url=https://securityvulns.com/articles/reveng/|accessdate=14 October 2015|publisher=Security Vulns|date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article discussed how [[Dynamic linker|LD_PRELOAD]] can be abused in order to highjack functions and inject code and manipulate applications flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ligh|first1=Michael Hale|title=The Art of Memory Forensics: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118824993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Kotler wrote for and presented at the 22nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Buffer Overflow Methods or Smack the Stack|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/491.en.html|website=Chaos Communication Congress|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation "Advanced Buffer Overflow Methods" was used in various academic papers and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heelan|first1=Sean|title=Automatic Generation of Control Flow Hijacking Exploits for Software Vulnerables|url=http://www.cprover.org/dissertations/thesis-Heelan.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2015|publisher=Univbersity of Oxford|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CSE 277 - Computer Security|url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi12/cse227-a/227wi12Lec2.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2015|publisher=ECSD.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muller|first1=Tilo|title=ASLR Smack &amp; Laugh Reference|url=https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh/TEACHING/S2014/ECE458/aslr.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2015|publisher=Seminar on Advanced Espoitation Techniques|date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional work includes speaking at BlackHat USA and RSA Europe in 2008 on the topic of a prototype Javascript malware called Jinx,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://publishing.yudu.com/Anwgx/RSAConfEuro08Bro/resources/15.htm|title= RSA Conference Europe 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Javascript to be next core malware language|url=http://www.itnews.com.au/news/javascript-to-be-next-core-malware-language-126967|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=itNews|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizing two additional hackathons proving the concept of Trojan in Python that infects Python files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doherty |first1=Stephen |title=THis Python Has Venom! |url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/python-has-venom |accessdate=20 October 2015 |publisher=Symantec |date=7 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206115837/http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/python-has-venom |archivedate= 6 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jackass Investing: Don't do it. Profit from it.''''' is a book written by [[Michael Dever]] published by Ignite LLC in 2011. Dever is the founder and CEO of [[Brandywine Asset Management|Brandywine Asset Management, Inc.]], an investment management firm founded in 1982.&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;

The book has also been released under the title '''''Exploiting the Myths: Profiting from Wall Street's misguided beliefs.'''''&lt;ref name="Opalesque" /&gt;

==Overview==
''"Jackass Investing"'' is a best-selling&lt;ref name="Opalesque" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Philly.com" /&gt; investment book that challenges conventional investment wisdom&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt; and presents an entirely new system of thought.&lt;ref name="futures201107" /&gt;  The book describes 20 common investment myths&lt;ref name="Opalesque" /&gt; and explains why each is a myth and not a fact.&lt;ref name="futures201107" /&gt;

The book is based on the trading philosophy of author [[Michael Dever]].  Dever's trading philosophy is based on broad strategy and market diversification.&lt;ref name="automatedtrader" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FinancialTrader" /&gt;

According to Dever, the definition of "Jackass Investing" is taking unnecessary risk.&lt;ref name="aiCIO" /&gt;

The book was published in 2011, but Dever initially developed the idea for the book in 1999.&lt;ref name="jpost" /&gt;  He decided to write ''"Jackass Investing"'' to systematically refute major investment myths by presenting the truth.  He believes that most investment professionals preach similar "myths" that prohibit investors from creating truly diversified portfolios.

Dever introduces the concept of "return drivers" and explains how to use them to create trading strategies, which are the components necessary to create a truly diversified portfolio.&lt;ref name="futures201107" /&gt;  A return driver is the core underlying reason that drives the price of a market.&lt;ref name="Opalesque" /&gt;

==The Myths==
The "myths" include the following:
*Myth #1:  Stocks Provide an Intrinsic Return
*Myth #2:  Buy and Hold Works Well for Long Term Investors
*Myth #3:  You Can't Time the Market
*Myth #4:  "Passive" Investing Beats "Active" Investing
*Myth #5:  Stay Invested So You Don't Miss the Best Days
*Myth #6:  Buy Low, Sell High
*Myth #7:  It's Bad to Chase Performance
*Myth #8:  Trading is Gambling - Investing is Safer
*Myth #9:  Risk Can Be Measured Statistically
*Myth #10: Short Selling is Destabilizing and Risky
*Myth #11: Commodity Trading is Risky
*Myth #12: Futures Trading is Risky
*Myth #13: It's Best to Follow Expert Advice
*Myth #14: Government Regulations Protect Investors
*Myth #15: The Largest Investors Hold All the Cards
*Myth #16: Allocate a Small Amount to Foreign Stocks
*Myth #17: Lower Risk by Diversifying Across Asset Classes
*Myth #18: Diversification Failed in the '08 Financial Crisis
*Myth #19: Too Much Diversification Lowers Returns
*Myth #20: There is No Free Lunch

'''Jamilla Abbas''', is a [[software engineer]], [[businesswoman]] and [[entrepreneur]] in [[Kenya]]. She is the co-founder and [[chief executive officer]] of MFarm Kenya Limited, an internet-based organisation that helps farmers find the best farm implements, seeds, access to weather reports and market information.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nu-viz.org/news/jamila-abbas-tech-entrepreneur-to-direct-new-vision-foundation-in-kenya |title=Jamila Abbas, tech entrepreneur, to direct New Vision Foundation | date=5 February 2017 | accessdate=20 December 2017 | publisher=New Vision Organization (NVO) |author=NVO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Jamila was born in Kenya and attended local schools for her pre-university education. She attended [[Strathmore University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Software engineering]].&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Girls-who-created-social-network-for-farmers-/1056-1085706-oxqkwxz/index.html |title=Girls who created social network for farmers |accessdate=20 December 2017 | date=7 January 2011 | newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |first=John |last=Makeni |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following her graduation from Strathmore University, Jamila was hired by [[Kenya Medical Research Institute]] (KEMRI). She also became member at iHub, a technology community, where techies gather to exchange ideas. There, she was reconnected with Susan Oguya, a friend from university. In September 2010, Jamila and Susan decided to actively do something about the plight of Kenyan small-scale farmers, using technology.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

The two women, also  joined ''AkiraChix'', another forum for women with interest in information technology. There, they met three other Strathmore University students, Linda Omwenga, Lillian Nduati, and Catherine Kiguru. The five of them decided to enter IPO48, a software development competition. The event, involved 100 contestants, organised in seventeen teams. The objective was to develop a computer application, which can be turned into a markatable business, all within 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

The competition was organized by ''HumanIPO'', from [[Estonia]]. In November 2011, the five women won the competition, with their M-Farm application, that connects farmers with agro-suppliers, cooperatives and enables them to access current market prices for their produce in a timely manner. The five ladies also won the top prize of KSh1 million (approx. US$10,000).&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

The group used their prize money to incorporate M-Farm Kenya Limited, with Jamila Abbas as [[CEO]], Susan Oguya as [[Chief Operations Officer|COO]]. Linda Omwenga and Catherine Kiguru were marketing officers and Lillian Nduati was the public relations officers.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Other considerations==
Ms. Abbas concurrently serves as the country director of [http://www.nu-viz.org/ New Vision Foundation], a Minneapolis-based non-profit organisation.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

'''Joseph Patrick Kennedy III''' (born October 4, 1980), is an American lawyer and politician serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MA|4}} since 2013. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], his congressional district extends from the western suburbs of [[Boston]] to the state's [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]]. A son of former Representative [[Joseph P. Kennedy II]], he worked as a [[Peace Corps]] volunteer and as an assistant district attorney in the [[Cape and Islands]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]] offices before his election to Congress.

Kennedy is a grandson of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and former [[United States Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. "Bobby" Kennedy]], a grand-nephew of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], and a great-grandson of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.|Joseph Patrick Kennedy]], former [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. His great-grandmother [[Rose Kennedy]] was the daughter of [[John F. Fitzgerald]], a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Mayor of Boston.

Born in [[Brighton, Massachusetts]], Kennedy was raised in the Boston area with his twin brother, Matthew Rauch "Matt" Kennedy. After graduating from [[Stanford University]] he spent two years in the [[Dominican Republic]] as a member of the Peace Corps, and earned his law degree at [[Harvard Law School]] in 2009. He resigned as a prosecutor in early 2012 to run for the seat held by retiring Congressman [[Barney Frank]]. He was sworn into office in January 2013 and sits on the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]].

==Early life and career==
Kennedy was born October 4, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000379 |title=Kennedy, Joseph P. III |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], a neighborhood of [[Boston]], to Sheila Brewster (Rauch) and [[Joseph P. Kennedy II|Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy II]]. He was born eight minutes after his fraternal twin brother, Matthew. He and Matt are the eldest grandsons of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy]] and [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/magazine/joe-kennedy-iii.html?pagewanted=all | title = Keeping Up With the Kennedys | author = Edith Zimmerman | work = [[The New York Times]] | date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2012/03/18/for_the_kennedy_clan_he_is_generation_next/|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |title=For the Kennedy clan, he is Generation Next |date=March 17, 2012 |author=Jacobs, Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was raised in Brighton and in the coastal town of [[Marshfield, Massachusetts|Marshfield]], also spending summers on [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref name="capecod-2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100228/NEWS/2280329/-1/news |title=Not your average Joe (Kennedy) |work=[[Cape Cod Times]] |date=February 28, 2010 |author=Vosk, Stephanie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512064256/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20100228%2FNEWS%2F2280329%2F-1%2Fnews |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From birth, Kennedy was engulfed in politics; in 1980, his parents were working on the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1980|presidential campaign]] of U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], the boys' great-uncle. Kennedy's father was elected to Congress in 1986. The pressures of political life strained Joseph and Sheila's marriage, and they divorced in 1991. The twins spent the following years moving between Brighton and Cambridge.&lt;ref name="globe-2012" /&gt;

[[File:Joseph P Kennedy III in Dominican Republic.png|thumb|left|Kennedy (left) in the Dominican Republic as part of the Peace Corps]]
After graduating from the [[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols]] School in Cambridge, Kennedy along with his brother enrolled in [[Stanford University]], where he majored in [[management science]] and engineering.  Kennedy's reputation as a [[teetotaler]] earned him the college nickname "Milkman", as his teammates on the club [[lacrosse]] team would jokingly order him glasses of milk at bars.&lt;ref name="globe-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natjour" /&gt; While at Stanford, Kennedy roomed with future [[NBA]] player [[Jason Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/news/20130429/jason-collins-gay-nba-player |title=Why NBA center Jason Collins is coming out now |date=April 29, 2013 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 2003, Kennedy joined the [[Peace Corps]]; a fluent speaker of Spanish, he worked in the [[Puerto Plata Province|Puerto Plata]] province of the [[Dominican Republic]] from 2004 to 2006, helping local tour guides in the 27 Charcos reserve in the Río Damajagua Park.

In April 2006, Kennedy returned to Massachusetts, where he and his brother co-chaired Ted Kennedy's [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2006|re-election campaign]]. That fall, Kennedy enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name="globe-2012"/&gt; While in school, Kennedy worked for the [[Harvard Legal Aid Bureau]], providing legal aid to low-income tenants with foreclosure cases in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]]. As he was a prosecutor, Kennedy worked as a technical editor for the ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'', on a staff with his classmate and future wife, Lauren Anne Birchfield.&lt;ref name="globe-2012"/&gt; In 2007 he and Birchfield co-founded ''Picture This: Justice and Power'', an after-school program for youths in Boston's [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joseph Kennedy III joins Middlesex DA's Office|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x1153512415/Joseph-Kennedy-III-joins-Middlesex-DAs-Office |deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 12, 2013|newspaper=[[The MetroWest Daily News]]|date=August 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412074131/http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/x1153512415/Joseph-Kennedy-III-joins-Middlesex-DAs-Office|archivedate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/spotlight/alumni-pursuits/related/joe_kennedy_iii_election.html |title=The Next Generation |work=Alumni Pursuits |publisher=[[Harvard Law School]] |year=2012 |author=Newburger, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began an internship at the [[Cape and Islands]] [[District Attorney]]'s Office in 2008.&lt;ref name="da-2011" /&gt;

After receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from Harvard Law School in 2009, Kennedy was hired at the Cape and Islands Office as an assistant district attorney (DA).

In January 2012, Kennedy announced he would form an exploratory committee to run in the newly redrawn [[Massachusetts's 4th congressional district|4th congressional district of Massachusetts]].

'''John Wickström''' (until ca. 1889 '''Johannes Wickström'''; 13 December 1870—7 June 1959) was a [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[engineer]] and [[entrepreneur]].

Wickström was born in [[Kvevlax]], Ostrobothnia. He emigrated to the United States at age of 19 and settled in Chicago, where he studied engineering. Wickström specialised on [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engines]] and founded company for automobile production, but, eventually, his interest focused on [[Inboard motor|boat engines]].

Wickström returned to Finland in 1906 and founded a boat engine factory together with his brother Jakob. The engines became reputable and sales grew until the 1950s, when imported [[outboard engine]]s started to replace the heavy middle engines.

Wickström was married twice.

== Early life ==
Wickström was born as '''Johannes Wickström''' in Vassor village, [[Kvevlax]], Ostrobothnia. His father Johan Wickström was a [[coppersmith]], manufacturer and painter. The family had nine children, the oldest of which died at a young age. He attended primary school in his home village, but, from a young age, he worked in his father's workshop. He was interested at testing and creating; after seeing a picture of a [[bicycle]] on a [[Sweden|Swedish]] newspaper, he built one for himself.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Emigration to America ==
As many other Ostrobothnians at the time, Johannes became interested in emigrating to the United States. After completing his school and [[confirmation]], he borrowed money from his uncle for travelling over the Atlantic and left Finland in 1889. In the United States, he changed his name to John. Typical to [[Finnish Americans|Finnish immigrants]], he became employed in a mine, but, due to his metalworking skills, he soon got a job in a plumbing company, after which he moved to a Chicago engineering company that produced pumps for pumping water inside skyscrapers. The company tested combustion engines, which were still undeveloped. Wickström studied [[mechanical engineering]] in [[North Park College]], Chicago and was awarded some patents related to engines. Wickström's two younger brothers Mickel and Jakob moved to Chicago as well.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

[[File:Caloric.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Wickström with his family driving his 1898 Caloric car in Chicago in 1899.]]
[[File:Caloric II.JPG|200px|thumb|left|John and Jakob Wickström and 1901 introduced Caloric II.]]
Soon, Wickström focused solely on combustion engines and founded Chicago Motor Cycle Coach Co. for automobile production in 1898. The first car, branded the Caloric, was produced in the same year. Caloric featured a 10–12-[[Horsepower|hp]] [[petrol engine]], and it gained attention on streets of Chicago.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; The car was further developed and at the early 20th century an upgraded Caloric II was introduced. Reportedly, Caloric was displayed in the first Chicago Automobile Exhibit in 1901.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Immonen |first1=Mari |year=2016 |title=Moottorikuningas John Wickström |trans-title=Engine king John Wickström |journal=Suomen Historia |language=Finnish |location=Vaasa |publisher=Viipalemediat Oy |issue=2./2016 |pages=60–67 |issn=2342-7981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, less than ten Caloric cars are known to be produced.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

Wickström kept his focus on boat engine production. He ran the Chicago Caloric Engine Company with his business partners. The company built boat engines and repaired cars in its premises located on Wabash Avenue. The boat engines were used at lakes [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]] and [[Lake Superior|Superior]].&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; Wickström was involved in a third company called Economy Engine Company.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Return to Finland ==
Wickström had difficulties finding financing for engine development; he had to focus the production on existing, although still profitable, models. By using the property he had collected during his stay in the United States, Wickström believed he would be able to continue development of fishing boat engines in Finland, which was still an untapped market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

Upon returning to Finland in 1906, Wickström had to create a market for his engines. Ostrobothnian fishermen, used to propelling themselves by rowing or sailing over many generations, were wary of combustion engines. In order to convince the potential clientele about the benefits of engine power, Wickström arranged an American-style show event in which he tugged two boats loaded with people by a motor boat up along the [[Kyrönjoki]] River. Despite the excessive load, the travelling took less than one third the time compared to rowing. Consequently, Wickström's engines gained a lot of attention and the demand grew high enough that Wickström could start serial production.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Wickström engine production ==
Wickström founded a boat engine factory in [[Palosaari]], [[Vaasa]] together with his brother Jakob who also returned from America; the third emigrated brother Mickel stayed permanently in the United States. The factory was opened in autumn 1906, and, in addition to boat engines, the company produced [[stationary engine]]s for Finnish farmers to power [[Threshing machine|threshers]] and other machinery. Production of Wickström-engines grew over time and, in 1910, the brothers opened a new facility in [[Vaskiluoto]], close to Vaasa harbour. The company name became Bröderna Wickströms Motorfabrik Ab in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and Wickström-Veljesten Moottoritehdas Oy in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ("Wickström Brothers' Engine Works Ltd.").&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; At the beginning, the brothers produced Caloric engines based on drawings which they had brought with them from America. As the engines turned out to be too complex and unreliable, the company developed modern [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Kerosene|paraffin]] engines, which replaced the older portfolio.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

{{Reduced pull quote|right|Perdition will come, if our Lord or Wickström's engine won't help.|Fishermen's saying.|&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;}}
Wickström engines changed the fishermen's way of living drastically. Due to their higher speed, the fishermen could travel home every evening, instead of bunking in fishing lodges. In 1912, 150 Ostrobothnian fishing boats featured engines. Among Finnish fishermen, Wickström's products reached a reputation of ultimately reliable power units.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

[[File:Wickström engine brochure 1933.jpg|200px|thumb|Wickström engine brochure from 1933.]]
After the modest start, demand grew especially after World War I, and the facilities were enlarged several times. In the 1930s, the annual production was about 1,000 units,&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; and the portfolio consisted of a number of marine and stationary engine models. The company bought production licences for British [[R A Lister and Company|Lister]] diesel engines.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; At the turn of the 1950s, the headcount reached almost 200, and the company produced thousands of engines per year. By that time, few other engine producers had started production in Vaasa, and the city became the centre of the Finnish small engine production. Wickström was the leading producer of small engines, and any other boat engine brands were an exception in the area.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; As demand of stationary engines decreased after World War II, the company focused exclusively on boat engines. Wickström engines were exported to Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Japan and Canada.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

The Wickström Brothers' Engine Works had a good reputation as an employer, and workers typically made long careers in the factory. Wickström led the company until the end of his life, and he was an appreciated manager.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; He believed that the robust middle engines, which the company produced, would stay competitive on the market; he considered outboard engines to be rubbish and did not believe in their future. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; After Wickström's death in 1959, the company kept existing for a couple of decades. By then, the Wickström company had lost the spirit of innovation, although the main reason for its decline was the spread of outboard engines and subsequent disappearing of its market.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wickström married Ida Maria née Östman (1873–1952) in 1892. Their children were Sigrid Ingeborg (b. 1893), Werner Theodor (b. 1897), Roy John Elias (b. 1901) and Alma Ellida (b. 1902). The couple was divorced in 1919;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt; as divorcing was rare and generally not socially accepted at the time, a possible reason could have been rumours about Wickström's illegitimate son in the United States.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt; In the same year, Wickström married Julia Wilhelmina née Bergsten, with whom he had Ingrid Brita Maria (b. 1920) and Johannes Carl-Gustav (b. 1922).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;

At an early age, Wickström committed to total abstinence from alcohol, and he took part in [[temperance society]] activities.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; In Chicago, he was a member of the local Swedish–Finnish temperance society (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsföreningen Topelius), and he was chairman of the Swedish–Finnish Temperance Federation (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsförbundet).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt; In Finland, Wickström supported prohibition.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

Wickström was a founding member of the Finnish [[Odd Fellows]] fraternity in 1925. He was member of the Vaasa city council.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

Wickström financed his birth municipality Kvevlax, his former school in Vassor village and craft school Kvevlax Slöjdskola. Many craft school students were inspired by Wickström's example, becoming entrepreneurs themselves.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: John Wickström II"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Vaasa City Theatre presented a play about Wickström's life. The performance, written by [[Antti Tuuri]] and directed by [[Erik Kiviniemi]], had its premiere in autumn 2015. [[Jorma Tommila]] starred in the main role.&lt;ref name="Suomen Historia: John Wickström"/&gt;

'''Reginald Boulos''' (born 1956) is a former President of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of [[Haiti]], a third generation [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-Haitian, medical doctor, an entrepreneur and businessman, and philanthropist.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-fairbanks/haitians-dont-deserve-our_b_539841.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Reginald Boulos was born in 1956, son of Carlos and Aimee (née Abraham) Boulos. Dr. Boulos and is one of 6 children (Frantz Boulos, Kathleen 
Boulos Weckering, Senator Rudolph Boulos, Marie Boulos, Dr. Carlo Boulos). Along with his brother Dr. Carlo Boulos, they attended and earned a medical degree in 1981 from the Port-au-Prince School of Medicine in Haiti.  Reginald then furthered his education by graduating in 1982 with a Master of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the [[Tulane University]] [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health]] in [[New Orleans]]. He conducted research with an associate professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He also holds certification from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] for senior executives.
 

==Business endeavors==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2011}}
In 1996, Dr. Boulos left the medical practice to start a new career in business development. While representing his family's Boulos Investment Group, he became the Chairman of Intercontinental Bank S.A. (1996–1998) and negotiated a merger with [[Sogebank]], one of Haiti's largest banks. In 2003, Dr. Boulos orchestrated the re-engineering of one of the oldest daily newspapers in Haiti, Le Nouveau Matin.  From 2000 to 2010, Dr. Boulos created and developed Delimart, a chain of supermarkets, Autoplaza, a leading car dealership and Megamart, a membership food discount store. Recently, he organized renovation of a landmark Hotel in Haiti, El Rancho, re-opening as an NH.

==Philanthropy==
Dr. Boulos is a longstanding champion of social improvement in Haiti.  In 1992, he founded the Fond de Parrainage National (FPN), which today finances the education of close to 20,000 elementary school children in Haiti.  He is still its Chairman.  From 1982 to 1996, he was Chair and General Manager of the Centers for Development and Health, a Haitian non-governmental organization that provides services and integrated health care to the populations of disadvantaged areas of the country since 1974.  Under his leadership, the Center developed and managed the most comprehensive health program in Haiti, providing health and social services to 550,000 people.  He is also the founder of Haiti's Child Health Institute, a research institution and the Haitian Institute for Community Health, a training institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdshaiti.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstructing Haiti==
Dr. Boulos believes the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] presents new opportunities for Haiti, especially for business growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haitiaccountability.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Boulos proposed that donors allocate at least 50% of all funds and guarantees to formal [[Small and Medium Enterprises]] (SME) and micro-enterprise financing, encourage broad ownership of larger companies, and implement SME set-asides, especially in the housing and construction sectors.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; Behind his recommendations, Dr. Boulos' principles are those of accountability, equality, and "independence from international aid.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;" Dr. Boulos is active in the reconstruction of Haiti, and is the Business Sector Representative for the HRIC - Haiti Reconstruction Commission, or also known as the CIRH - Commission Interimaire Pour La Reconstruction D'Haiti, which is co-chaired by former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and Haitian Prime Minister [[Jean-Max Bellerive]].&lt;ref&gt;http://haitirewired.wired.com/profiles/blogs/list-of-representatives-haiti?xg_source=activity&lt;/ref&gt;"But with foreign aid flowing and a sympathetic world watching, Boulos envisions a new Haiti: one focused on quickly creating jobs while purging its ruling class of the cronyism that helped make this one of the world's poorest countries."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/14/AR2010021403322.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[business]], a '''revenue center''' is a [[division (organization)|division]] that gains revenue from product sales or service provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=revenue center|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/revenue-center.html|publisher=Businessdictionary.com|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manager in revenue center is accountable for revenue only.

==Overview==
A revenue center is one of the five divisions of a responsibility center – cost center, revenue center, profit center, contribution center and investment center.&lt;ref name="Tulsian2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Tulsian|title=Cost Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2kbrUHIuk0C&amp;pg=SA1-PA15|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=1 July 2006|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-062043-8|pages=1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost centers, like revenue centers, only monitor costs, thereby making them a counterpart to the revenue center.&lt;ref name="Jensen1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C. Jensen|title=Foundations of Organizational Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-TP-fxGJDQC&amp;pg=PA351|accessdate=20 October 2014|year=1998|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-64342-0|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue centers only measure the output (in fiscal standings) and are therefore marketing establishments which are exempt from profit generation and accountability thereof.&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pradip Kumar Sinha|title=Case Study in Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz1xH9eYZMEC&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=20 October 2014|year=2007|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=978-93-80064-10-9|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a revenue center performance is measured by comparing actual sales to projected ones (as well as number of sales or revenue per time scale). Quota and budget comparisons are also used as a performance indicator.&lt;ref name="NeedlesCrosson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Belverd Needles|author2=Susan Crosson|title=Managerial Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te4WAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-285-67528-2|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jawaharlal2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jawahar Lal|title=Cost Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMr8a2gQ-4UC&amp;pg=PA844|accessdate=22 October 2014|edition=3|date=1 August 2002|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-048274-6|page=844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revenue center has costs, however to the manager of a revenue center this is of little importance as revenue is his sole performance indicator.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James W. Bush|author2=Daniel Johnston|title=International Oil Company Financial Management in Nontechnical Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYIqxibXy1kC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=22 October 2014|date=1 January 1998|publisher=PennWell Books|isbn=978-0-87814-597-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all costs are ignored in a revenue center. For example, the manager of a revenue center is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs).&lt;ref name="Palanivelu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=V.R. Palanivelu|title=Accounting for Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzkX7v7wQBEC&amp;pg=PA406|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=978-81-318-0119-2|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sales office (the most widespread example of a revenue center), maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to product sale and manufacturing are not included in such expenses.&lt;ref name="GHOSH2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. GHOSH|title=MANAGEMENT CONTROL SYSTEMS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLk11itaLrIC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=20 October 2014|date=1 January 2005|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-2844-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revenue center becomes a profit center if the latter is encompassed, thus making a profit center a blend of both a cost and revenue center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahesh Kulkarni|author2=Suhas Mahajan|title=Management Accounting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFdzpFzpVtUC&amp;pg=SA6-PA8|accessdate=19 October 2014|year=2008|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=978-93-80064-15-4|pages=6.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a revenue center the manager usually has control over issues regarding marketing and sales. This is delegated to him because both of the spheres require extensive knowledge that is explicit to the local market. However, the revenue center manager will not be given control over decision on quantity or product mix. If the manager is given control over these decisions problems can arise (see below).&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"/&gt;

Technological advancements have been able to reduce expenses in revenue centers as well as bring non-traditional (online) revenue centers to non-retail companies that work in manufacturing or service industries. This can be done by setting up websites which offer products directly from the supplier. This reduces cost by shortening the distribution channel and cuts out wholesalers and retailers.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Revenue Center|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-revenue-center.htm|year=2014|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with Revenue Centers==

One of the biggest problems in a revenue center is that costs are mostly ignored. If costs are not monitored by another division of the business, profits can be hindered. Furthermore, the manager of a revenue center does not have the insight required for marketing decisions, consequently responsibility for a marketing decision cannot be given to a revenue center manager. Setting prices on products or services is an example of revenue center managers being unable to undertake marketing decisions.&lt;ref name="casestudyinmarketing"/&gt;

It is easy to calculate the performance of a revenue center as revenue is the only variable being performed against. However, this means that performance evaluations are also limited to one variable which is usually not enough to see the performance of a business division.&lt;ref name="KinneyRaiborn2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Kinney|author2=Cecily Raiborn|title=Cost Accounting: Foundations and Evolutions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm3uBQP7cTIC&amp;pg=PA509|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=31 May 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-97172-2|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure revenue centers hardly exist. This is due to the fact that costs cannot be completely ignored. Usually (as stated above) revenue center managers control expenses.&lt;ref name="KinneyRaiborn2012"/&gt;

Revenue center managers should not be allowed to make marketing decisions. For example, if a revenue center manager is allowed to set the revenue target, he will maximise revenue. This will cause the marginal revenue to become zero.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

In large companies with multiple products revenue centers will be responsible for meeting revenue target for each product. The problem will arise if all revenues are added together into a total of all products. The revenue manager will then be able to make up any losses in revenue by taking the revenue from the ones that outperformed the targets to the ones that underperformed, thereby causing a loss in overall profits.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

Businesses may decide to open revenue centers when entering new markets or industries. The initial cost of these centers is high and it is highly likely that a lot of time is required in order for those centers to become profitable and cover the start-up expenditures.&lt;ref name="BushJohnston1998"/&gt;

==Background==
Seow Poh Leng, the second son of Seow Chye Watt,&lt;ref name="song"&gt;Song Ong Siang (1923) ''One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore''.London : J. Murray. pp 474 - 475&lt;/ref&gt; came from humble beginnings. He spent two years in a Chinese school and completed his schooling at the [[Anglo-Chinese School]]. After passing his [[Senior Cambridge]] examinations, he decided to become a teacher. He competed for the [[Queen's Scholarships]] in 1902. He failed to win the much-coveted prize, and attributed his failure to the fact that he had to divide his time between his duties as a pupil teacher and preparing for the examinations.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"&gt;[[Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malayan Branch Published by The Branch, 1923 Item notes: v.26 1953; p. 117. 118, 119 and Journal By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch, Published 1958, Pgs 117, 119 &amp; 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to help support his family, he was forced to take up additional work. After school each day he would sell [[nonya]] cakes and [[nasi lemak]] cooked by his mother and sisters. One day, when he saw some of his pupils in the distance, he threw all of his food away fearing they would see him and lose respect for him. He was punished when he returned home.

Later, Seow moved on from teaching to become the manager of the [[Ho Hong Bank]]. He was also a cashier at [[John Little (department store)|John Little]] &amp; Co for many years, before he entered the [[rice]] business. His chequered career included stints as a chemist's assistant, schoolmaster, lawyer's clerk, stock-broker, insurance agent and company liquidator.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese in Southeast Asia and Beyond By Qinghuang Yan, {{ISBN|981-279-047-0}}, {{ISBN|978-981-279-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the promoters of the [[Eastern United Assurance Corporation]] Ltd. (EUA), [[Chinese Commercial Bank]] (CCB) and [[Ho Hong Bank]] (HHB). He founded HHB in January 1917&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/limboonkeng/EN/SE06-Entrepreneur-02.html Lim Boon Keng - A Life To Remember (1969-1857), Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218091357/http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/limboonkeng/EN/SE06-Entrepreneur-02.html |date=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Lim Peng Siang]], Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]] and others, and served as its secretary and general manager. HHB was the first Straits Chinese institution to enter the field of worldwide banking and established connections with [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and many others, in order to facilitate direct trade between the Chinese in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and people in other parts of the world. Later, HHB was amalgamated with CCB and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC).&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Readings in Malayan Economics By Thomas Henry Silcock Compiled by Thomas Henry Silcock Published by Published by D. Moore for Eastern Universities Press, 1961; 458, 459, 460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Business Enterprise By Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown; p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capital and Entrepreneurship in South-East Asia By Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown, 1943- Brown Published by St. Martin's Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-312-12096-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-12096-2}}; p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

According to government archives, Seow was responsible for the development of a row of nine terrace houses along Cairnhill Road. The same records show that he owned bungalows in [[Emerald Hill Road]] and Lorong 20 Geylang Road, and had additions and alterations done to them.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore National Archives -- Maps &amp; Building Plans 1918, 1926, 1927, 1929 -- Microfilm No: CBS 105, Microfilm No: CBS 1105, Microfilm No: CBS 1038&lt;/ref&gt; He bought  117 Emerald Hill in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Magazine Publishing Co.,Ltd., 1992: Singapore: days of old, Page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Seow Poh Leng was concerned with public welfare and engaged in many different roles and activities in this area. He suggested constructing a short connection road between Emerald Hill Road and Cairnhill Circle.&lt;ref&gt;(Vide Government Records -- Singapore Improvement Trust -- File Reference No: SIT 945/31, File Opened 16/08/1936, File Closed 04/08/1954, Microfilm No.: HDB 1028 Blip No: CD No .: PDF No. Access: 01.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with the Singapore and South Malaya Boy Scouts Association since its inauguration, holding the position of secretary and treasurer, and did much to interest parents in the movement. Other activities included organising charity and social concerts and entertainment. His contributions to the ''Straits Chinese Magazine'' dealt with such subjects as education and social reform.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

A love of [[theatre]] ran in the family. According to Sir Song Ong Siang, Seow took part in amateur theatricals in the 1930s. He was a lover of [[Shakespeare]] and named his seaside bungalow in Siglap "Titania" and his house on Emerald Hill Road, "Oberon."&lt;ref&gt;Emerald Hill, the Story of a Street in Words and Pictures: The Story of a Street in Words and Pictures By Kip Lin Lee, National Museum (Singapore), National Museum (Singapore) Published by National Museum, 1984; pp. vi, 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered modern and loved artistic activities such as acting and singing, and served as the Hon. Secretary to the Straits Chinese Recreation Club in 1905.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama By Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn Contributor Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn Published by Columbia University Press, 2007; Item notes: v.1; {{ISBN|0-231-14032-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-231-14032-4}}; p. 775&lt;/ref&gt;

Seow was a keen sportsman on the football field and in club sports, a tennis player and a chess player. He was one of the early members of Tanjong Katong Swimming Party, now the Chinese Swimming Club, where he once held the office of vice-president. During the early years of the volunteer movement, he served in its ranks.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

In 1936 His Excellency The Governor appointed him to be a member of the Council of Raffles College.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 3 November 1936, Page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 he was elected to membership of the Council of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 22 May 1937, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from The Hawker Bill, in which he played a major role, he was also associated with other subjects he believed to be of  importance to the common man like championing pedal rickshaws&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 27 April 1936, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; and the abolition of water meter rents.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 7 November 1936, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawker Bill==
[[Hawker centre|Hawkers]] had been considered by some people to be a nuisance. In 1903, a bill was drafted by the Chinese Protectorate to provide licensing of hawkers and setting aside spaces where hawking was allowed. In 1905, Municipal Commissioners asked that the Municipal Ordinance be amended to provide them with the necessary powers to register hawkers and bring them under control, but this was refused by the Governor. There were numerous other activities through the years intended to regulate and control the number and activities of hawkers. The view among some people was that the evils of hawking were becoming more serious year on year.&lt;ref name="hawker"&gt;Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore printed at the Government Printing Office in Singapore by W. T. Cherey, Government Printer, 1932 incorporating (1) Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore dated 4 November 1931, (2) Minutes of a meeting between the committee (W. Bartley, R. Onrart, J. A. Black, Gaw Khek Khiam, S. Q. Wong and Dr. K. Ragunatuan) and Seow Poh Leng dated 25 August 1931, (3) Memorandum from Seow Poh Leng to the President of the Municipal Commissioners of Singapore dated 1 June 1931 relating to a meeting on 9 March 1931, (4) Annexment I of "C" being a reprint of The Hapless Hawker: A Plea for Humane Treatment by Seow Poh Leng, J. P., M. C. in the Malaya Tribune 23 March 1931, (5) Annexment II of "C" being a reprint of "The Hapless Hawker: A Time To Make Allowances" by Seow Poh Leng in the ''Malaya Tribune'' 26 March 1931, "The Hapless Hawkers: And The Death of the Rev. W. E. Horley M. B. E." by Seow Poh Leng in the ''Malaya Tribune'' 4 April 1931, (6) Annexment IV of "C" being a table of comparative prices (hawkers versus shops or markets) of common articles during the last week in May 1931, provided by Seow Poh Leng (7) Attachment to Annexment IV of "C" being a supplementary schedule of comparative prices (hawkers versus shops or markets) handed in by Seow Poh Leng to meeting of hawkers committee on 25 August 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, the Governor of Singapore appointed a committee "to investigate the hawker question in Singapore and to make recommendations as to any change in policy in this respect which may be considered advisable", consulting and taking evidence from the Municipal Health Officer, the police, Superintendent of Town Cleansing, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Clerical Union, [[Teo Chew]] guilds, Indo-Ceylon Club and the Straits Chinese-British Association.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

Seow championed the plight of hawkers who he felt were being treated callously and without any regard for the social benefits they were bringing, or for their own precarious economic situation. Through articles in the newspaper, including a self-composed poem, depositions and meetings with the committee. He sought to achieve a fair and balanced outcome that would take into consideration the needs of the masses who were not European, and who relied on the lower-priced food and non-food merchandise provided by the street hawkers of Singapore, exposing in the process the constant brutality hawkers faced from the authorities and bribery hawkers often had to resort to in order to continue to operate.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Seow's family lived in a shop house along Emerald Hill Road opposite Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]], whom he had worked for on a part-time basis. When Lim heard that Lilian LuckNeo Tan's family were looking for a groom for her, he recommended Seow to them. Lilian's family wanted a kind and good man for her and it did not matter to them if he was from a poor or rich family. Lilian was the great grand daughter of famous philanthropist Tan Tock Seng. Her father was Tan Soon Toh and her mother was Lin Neo (Jambol) Seow. Tan Soon Toh's father was [[Tan Kim Ching]], Siamese Consul General in Singapore and the person who introduced the schoolteacher, Anna Hariette Leonowens, to the King of Siam.&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|no=8678|name=The English Governess at the Siamese Court by Anna Harriette Leonowens}} (Project Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hobden, Heather ''The King of Siam's Eclipse: the total solar eclipse of August 18th 1868 and other fateful eclipses in Thailand'' ({{ISBN|978-1-871443-32-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cavenagh Private Letterbooks Volume XI Oct 1865 To Oct 1868 and Volume VII 10th Jul 1863 To 27th Dec 1863''. University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Tan Kim Ching was the son of [[Tan Tock Seng]].&lt;ref name="Edwin Lee 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;Lim, Betty (1994) A Rose on My Pillow: recollections of a Nyonya. Singapore : Armour Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilian Tan was a refined lady, spared from having to do household chores. Her family lived in a three-storey house along River Valley Road. When the time came for her to be bethrothed, her parents decided the groom should marry into their family which was a common practice at the time. This meant that her husband would come and set up home in her family's house. Their marriage produced three children - (Seow Sieu Jin, Amy Seow Guat-Cheng and Betty Seow Guat-Beng - later Mrs Betty [[Lim Koon Teck]]).&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;

One evening, Lilian was out riding in the family's horse carriage and happened to pass by Bidadari, the Christian cemetery. She noted how peaceful it looked and mentioned that she would like to be buried there when her time came. When the first [[influenza]] epidemic hit Singapore, Lillian succumbed to the virus. She died in October 1918 at the age of 32. In accordance with her wish for a [[Christian]] burial, Seow asked a pastor to baptise her and she was buried at Bidadari. Lilian's mother later converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 17 October 1918, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Seow remarried a few years after Lilian's death. His new wife, Polly Tan Poh Li (daughter of [[Tan Boo Liat]]) was his niece. Lilian's mother thought it would not be a bad thing for Seow to marry her.&lt;ref name="Edwin Lee 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerald Hill, the story of a street in words and pictures by  Kip Lin Lee, National Museum (Singapore), Published by National Museum (Singapore), 1984&lt;/ref&gt; His children by Polly were Eugene Seow Eu Jin and Rosie Seow Guat Kheng.&lt;ref&gt;Seow Poh Leng By Lee, Hwee Hoon (2009-01-14) National Library Board Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seow Poh Leng medal==

An [[alumnus]] of the Anglo Chinese School, Seow instituted a medal in 1936 to be awarded to the top ACS boy at the Senior Cambridge/GCE "O" Level Examinations.

'''Seán FitzPatrick''' (born 25 May 1948) was former chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] until he resigned in December 2008 amid [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|mounting revelations over hidden loans]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean FitzPatrick Anlgo Irish Bank loan book http://www.sneachta.org/index.php?title=Sean_FitzPatrick&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price which in turn led to its [[nationalisation]] on 21 January 2009.

In an [[RTÉ Radio 1]] interview on ''[[The Marian Finucane Show]]'' in October 2008, FitzPatrick denied critics' charges that the bank had been reckless in making too many big loans to property developers as Ireland's [[property bubble]] grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Marian Finucane]]; Sean FitzPatrick|date=October 2008|title=Sean FitzPatrick on "The Marian Finucane Show"|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2008/pc/pod-v-071008-37m24s-marian.mp3|format=[[MP3]]|medium=Radio Broadcast|publisher=[[RTÉ Radio 1]]|location=[[Donnybrook, Dublin]]|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While saying he was grateful for the state's help, he refused to offer taxpayers an apology, saying

== Early life ==
He was born in [[County Wicklow]], [[Ireland]]. His father was a small farmer and his mother was a [[civil servant]] who left the workforce to raise her children.&lt;ref name="lunchtime"&gt;{{cite news|title=Implosion of a legend in his own lunchtime|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/implosion-of-a-legend-in-his-own-lunchtime-26642764.html|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzPatrick's only sibling, his older sister, [[Joyce O'Connor|Joyce]], would go on to become the sixth [[President of National College of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="docklands"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lifting a lid on Anglo’s links to the docklands|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/lifting-a-lid-on-anglos-links-to-the-docklands-26514005.html|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzPatrick was educated locally at [[Presentation College, Bray]]. Following this he attended [[University College Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/bankruptcy-hasnt-curbed-luxury-lifestyle-of-outsider-sean-fitzpatrick-3179760.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Bankruptcy hasn't curbed luxury lifestyle of 'outsider' Sean FitzPatrick | date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
FitzPatrick was chief executive of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] from 1986 until 2005, when he became its chairman.  He resigned from that position in December 2008 when details of secret loans he had taken out with the bank were revealed.

FitzPatrick was appointed to a number of positions by  [[Fianna Fáil]] politicians. In 1998 the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government [[Noel Dempsey]] appointed FitzPatrick to the [[Dublin Docklands Development Authority]] where he served until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, C.

== Resignation ==
When news of his secret loans became public and FitzPatrick resigned as chairman, the resulting furore also swept from office Ireland's chief banking regulator, [[Patrick Neary]]. FitzPatrick, while Anglo Irish chairman, had borrowed more than €100 million from the bank and hid the loans from auditors for eight years. The former multi-millionaire banker defaulted on the loans following a series of major business setbacks, valuable shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank once worth €80 million is now worthless followed by a failed oil venture in Africa and a stake in a casino in Asia stalled. His property investments in Ireland and Hungary were also hit by the international slump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/fitzpatrick-not-paying-off-euro100m-loan-interest-1901222.html|title=FitzPatrick not paying off €100m loan interest|date=1 October 2009|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=18 March 2010|first=Sam|last=Smyth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both FitzPatrick and the bank said in statements on his resignation that his handling of the loans was neither illegal nor a breach of Irish banking regulations. But an apologetic new chairman O'Connor told shareholders that FitzPatrick's loans were "wrong and unacceptable".

The following day, headlines in the Irish papers illuminated the popular mood: "Seán FitzPatrick Should Go To Jail" competed with "If FitzPatrick Lived in New York, He'd Have Been Arrested By Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2009-01-28-sean-fitzpatrick-irish-bank_N.htm?csp=34 | title=Irish stand united in hatred of banker Seán FitzPatrick | work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=18 March 2010 | date=30 January 2009 | author=David J.

'''Social Fund for Development''' ([[Egypt]]) was established in 1991 by a Presidential decree # 189 and with support of the United Nations Development Programme.  SFD was created with a capital of 1.1 Billion Egyptian Pounds to alleviate the hardship created by the returning Egyptian workers from the Gulf area as a result of the [[First Gulf War]]. According to Magdy Moussa, Middle East Regional Director at Plant Finance, "SFD was regarded as a social safety net associated with the Government of Egypt's agreement to undertake its extensive Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program."&lt;ref&gt;Magdy Moussa (January 2007). ''Regulation and Supervision of Microfinance in Egypt''. Essays on Regulation and Supervision series, Microfinance Regulation and Supervision Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt; SFD focuses on [[sustainable development]] projects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Also according to Moussa, a prominent focal point for SFD is promoting self-employment through microcredit projects.

Major donors are: the [[World Bank]], the [[European Union]], [[Germany]], [[JICA]], [[Kuwaiti Development Fund]].

'''Suleiman Bakhit''' ([[Arabic]]: سليمان بخيت) is a [[Jordan]]ian entrepreneur who produces superhero comics in various media for [[Arab]] youth.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =Upbin| first =Bruce| title =Arab Superheroes Vs. Arab Extremism| work =Forbes| date =July 12, 2011| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/07/12/pow-crash-blam-superheroes-vs-arab-extremism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as "fighting to change how the West sees Arab youth — and how Arab youth see themselves — one superhero at a time."&lt;ref name=ted&gt;{{cite web| last =Eng| first =Karen| title =POW!

==Early life and education==
Bakhit is the son of [[Marouf al-Bakhit]], who served twice as prime minister of Jordan.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Bakhit has said that when he was a child, "I once had an art teacher who refunded my parents' money and advised me never to try again."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Suleiman studied at the [[University of Minnesota-Twin Cities]].&lt;ref name=link&gt;{{cite web| title =Suleiman Bakhit | work =LinkedIn| url = http://jo.linkedin.com/pub/suleiman-bakhit/16/108/764}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original intention was to study mechanical engineering, but after "a couple years," he reportedly "found it utterly intolerable." Instead, he chose to pursue a master's degree in human resources development. His graduation thesis on this subject was "adopted by the Jordanian government."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=theac&gt;{{cite web| title =The Accidental Comic Artist| work =The Accidental Career| url = http://www.theaccidentalcareer.com/suleiman_bakhit.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at the University of Minnesota when [[9/11]] occurred. As president of the university's international student union, he began an "awareness campaign" to combat anti-Arab prejudice. The campaign received considerable media attention and shortly afterwards, Bakhit has said, "four college kids attacked me on my way home late one night. They started with racial slurs, then attacked me with beer bottles. I suffered many scars and injuries that led to surgeries." He decided, "Well, either I pack my bags and go home to Jordan, or I do something. And I decided the best way to fight racism is to start with the young. So I began talking to schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 about Middle Eastern culture and what happened to me on 9/11, spreading a very simple message: Not all Middle Easterners are terrorists, and [[Al Qaeda]] is like the [[KKK]]."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Eventually he "started realizing that mythology and stories have such great power to bridge cultural divides"&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; and also "realized the power of empowering youth and women through positive role models in a medium they can relate to: comics."&lt;ref name=theac/&gt;

In addition, he "realized that actually, no, there aren’t any Arab equivalents to Western superheroes. Yes, there’s [[Aladdin]] and [[Sinbad]], but no one has ever done an animation or comic book based on the actual mythology from within the culture." This recognition led Bakhit to do "a couple of years of hardcore research, reading ancient texts, doing six month's archeological research in the Arab desert. I even learned [[Hebrew]]. I wanted to read Aramaic so I could read the Dead Sea Scrolls for inspiration. Meanwhile, I started to teach myself to draw, and came up with some characters based on my knowledge of Arab culture. It was a journey towards discovering my own culture more than anything else." Over time, he has said, he became convinced that his calling was to create "characters and stories based in Arab tradition to spread the culture of tolerance."

==Return to Jordan and Aranim Media Factory==
Consequently, he dropped out of the master's program in human resource development, returned to Jordan, and, in 2006, registered his company, Aranim. The name "comes from a combination of 'Arab' and 'anime.'"&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

After returning to Jordan, Bakhit was physically attacked there, too, "this time," he has said, "for being such…a voice for moderation."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; According to his account, once he had "started publishing my comic books, especially the ones that fight extremism and terrorism, I got attacked outside of my office by a couple of extremists. One of them hit me with a razor blade in my face. He was trying to take out one of my eyes. Because it was late at night and I drive a motorbike, I had to cauterize my own wound with a pocketknife before getting to a hospital. That's how I ended up with a big, massive scar on my face."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

Aranim Media Factory, based in [[Amman]], has become one of the largest producers of comics in the Arab language, it produces comic books, TV and film cartoons, digital comic strips, manga, creative media, and social-media games.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=link/&gt;&lt;ref name=theac/&gt; His goal is “to entertain but more importantly to inspire Arab boys and girls to believe that real opportunities to be leaders are well within their grasp.”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; He describes himself as "dealing in hope and tolerance" and says that he wants "to build the Arab Disney."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; He has said: "I go to a lot of poor areas and ask the kids, 'Who are your role models?' Sometimes they say Zarqawi and Bin Laden. But in one neighborhood I gave them comics and when I went back a few months later; the superheroes were now their role models. It doesn't even have to be real people they look up to. There's a huge lack of positive role models in the region. Superheroes are an aspiration for what we want to be."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Bakhit develops "the concepts, characters and stories" for his comic books, and has a team of writers and artists who translate his ideas into the final product. He also runs "focus groups to gauge what kids respond to." He and his programmers, Jordanian natives, "learned from scratch how to program games. We bought books on Amazon and literally taught ourselves how to program, using blogs and online communities for support." He has said that his firm is "the only Arab company in the entire Arab world that creates social games in-house at the quality that we do."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

As an example of the fact that his stories "have deep Middle Eastern mythologies ingrained in them," Bakhit has explained that "in ancient Arabic mythology, fire has seven types, each color corresponding to a different one. So I gave Naar — which means 'fire' — the first hero of my first comic, the power of the seven flames. The story is about a group of kids who wake up in a future post-apocalyptic Middle East to discover they have superpowers." He has created another comic "based on Jordan's real-life all-female counterterrorism team," an example of his belief "in empowering young women," and has created a character named Element Zero, "a special agent, kind of the Arabic Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, who fights terrorism locally."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

In January 2010, Bakhit founded Aranim Games.&lt;ref name=link/&gt; As of July 2011, his firms had sold 1.2 million copies of print comics. In 2011, Aranim Games launched "a FarmVille-style social game called Happy Oasis" which allows players to build a "garden in traditional Islamic style."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; In 2012, he invented an iPhone game that he described as "combining the Arab Spring and Animal Farm." He has also produced "a web TV show based on Element Zero character."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

==Other activities==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], Bakhit and another TED Fellow, [[Adrian Hong]], created "sort of a channel between Libya and Jordan to try to help some of the injured civilians come to Jordanian hospitals." As a result, "over 15,000 injured civilians got treated in Jordanian hospitals."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

Bakhit was named a 2011 [[TED (conference)|TED]] Global Fellow.&lt;ref name=theac/&gt; He spoke at the TED Global conference in [[Edinburgh]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Bakhit is scheduled to speak at the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]] in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/pdfs/OFF14Speakers.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421115035/http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/pdfs/OFF14Speakers.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swedish Trade Council''' ({{lang-sv|Exportrådet, or Sveriges Exportråd}}) was an organisation formed after a parliamentary decision July 1, 1972 in cooperation between the [[Government of Sweden]] and representatives from the Swedish business community, through the Swedish Foreign Trade Association ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Allmänna Utrikeshandelsförening}}). Its mission was to promote Swedish exports on behalf of the Swedish industry and government.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 1972:31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the organisation was merged with the government agency [[Invest Sweden]], to form a new organisation named [[Business Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Sweden - ny organisation för ökad export och investeringsfrämjande|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/16916/a/207093|publisher=[[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=21 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728015008/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/16916/a/207093|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malay styles and titles#Tan Sri|Tan Sri]] '''Tan Koon Swan''' ({{lang|zh|陈群川}}; born 24 September 1940) is a controversial [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian political]] and [[Economy of Malaysia|corporate]] figure. He was the fifth president of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), a component party of [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition; from November 1985 to September 1986.

== Personal life==
Tan was born in [[Puchong|Puchong New Village]] in [[Selangor]] on 24 September 1940 to a poor family.&lt;ref name=mca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tan-koon-swan/ |title=Tan Koon Swan |work=Malaysian Chinese Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152102/http://www.mca.org.my/en/about-us/about-mca/history-zone/former-presidents/tan-koon-swan/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped out at his parent's hawker stall while still in school.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1082&amp;lpg=PA1082#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary |editor= Leo Suryadinata |author=Ho Khai Leong |pages=1081–1083 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year= 2012 |isbn=978-9814345217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied in a missionary school, and after leaving school, he worked as a clerk with [[Tenaga Nasional#Lembaga Letrik Negara (1965-1990)|Lembaga Lektrik Negara]] (LLN) while studying part-time to finish his High School Certificate (HSC). He also worked as a laboratory technician with LLN, then moved on to be an investigator of Inland Revenue Board and a tax consultant with [[Esso]].&lt;ref name=mca /&gt;

Tan married his first wife, Catherine Chong, who is a [[paraplegic]] and they have two children meanwhile he together with his second wife, Penny Chang, have another three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2009/08/01/duo-show-its-possible-to-overcome-failure/ | title =Duo show it’s possible to overcome failure |author= CHEONG SUK-WAI |work=Singapore ST | publisher = [[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=1 August 2009| accessdate = 30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan after much hiccups in life still a respected member of society, is a born-again [[Christian]] who likes to maintain a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Sunday Interview With: Former MCA President Tan Koon Swan | date = 2 October 2005 | newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and business career==
In 1970, Tan became the General Manager of Genting Highlands Berhad, helping [[Lim Goh Tong]] to establish [[Genting Highlands Resort]] as a successful tourist destination. In 1976, he attended a senior management course at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=mca /&gt;

In 1977, he was invited by the then MCA president [[Lee San Choon]] to head the Koperatif Sebaguna Malaysia (KSM) and Multi-Purpose Holdings Berhad (MPHB), the corporate structure through which the MCA hoped to encourage Chinese participation in all areas of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Portrait of Success | date = 1 December 1985 | newspaper = Malaysian Business | pages = 8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the party and became involved in politics.

In [[Malaysian general election, 1978|1978 general election]], Tan made his political debut, winning a parliamentary seat in [[Raub]], Pahang. The following year, he was elected to the party's Central Committee and appointed Chairman of MCA [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Wilayah Persekutuan]] State Liaison Committee. In [[Malaysian general election, 1982|1982 general election]], he cinched a landslide victory for the parliamentary seat in the opposition stronghold of [[Damansara, Selangor|Damansara]], Selangor.&lt;ref name="Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan"&gt;[http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712044805/http://www.mca.org.my/English/PastPresidents/Pages/TanKoonSwan.aspx |date=12 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984 saw him appointed as vice-president of the MCA.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In March 1984, Tan was sacked as vice-president from the MCA along with [[Lee Kim Sai]] as well as other members for urging the party to investigate its member records for the presence of non-existent people, an issue that had sparked off factionalism and crisis within the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Malaysian Chinese Association has expelled 14 leading members including vice president, Tan Koon Swan | date = 29 March 1984 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he and the other 13 were all reinstated two months later with the support of 1,600 MCA members in an extraordinary general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = An EGM of 1,615 "dissident" members of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) in Kuala Lumpur yesterday (6 May) voted to reinstate the 14 expelled leaders led by Tan Koon Swan | date = 7 May 1984 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1985, he was voted to be president of the MCA winning 76.9% of the votes cast, the largest majority in the party's history, and the first challenger since 1954 to win national leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mr Tan Koon Swan was yesterday elected president of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) by a landslide | date = 25 November 1985 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = MCA: New Beginning | date = 1 December 1985 | newspaper = Malaysian Business | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a memoir published by Robert Kuok, it was revealed that the MCA leadership approached Kuok to provide a bail payment for Tan in 1986. The amount paid by Kuok was S$20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/10/robert-kuoks-memoir-stirs-debate-the-tycoons-tellall-with-its-many-political-insights-and-revelation/|title=Robert Kuok’s memoir stirs debate - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pan-El crisis===
Tan remained a highly prominent member of the corporate sector, controlling numerous companies, including Sigma International, which had a 22.6% stake in [[Pan-Electric Industries]] (Pan-El),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Prospects Improve For Pan Electric Rescue / Attempts to save debt-ridden Singaporean company | author = Chris Sherwell | date = 25 November 1985 | newspaper = [[Financial Times]] | page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Singaporean-based company. Pan-Electric entering receivership forced the closure of the Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges between December 2nd and 4th 1985, to try to contain the fallout on leveraged stockbroking firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/ec498103-8fda-4fe1-b85d-0bf4235e6253|title=The Pan-Electric crisis hits the stock market - Singapore History|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 1985, Tan signed an agreement that gave the troubled company [[SGD|S$]] 20 million of funds through an [[interest]]-free loan and allowed it to resume trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Singapore Pact to Aid Troubled Firm | date = 12 December 1985 | newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = An interim agreement has been signed by parties concerned to save Pan Electric Industries of Singapore and pave the way for a rescue and reconstruction of the debt-ridden concern | date = 12 December 1985 | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] | pages = 1, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he was charged in Singapore with abetting criminal breach of trust relating to the collapse of Pan-El. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment by Singapore High Court Justice [[Lai Kew Chai]]. In Lai's judgement, Lai said Tan's offences had "struck at the very heart, integrity, reputation and confidence of Singapore as a commercial city and financial centre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/in_memoriam/former_singapore_high_court_judge_lai_kew_chai_dies.html|title=The Malaysian Bar - Former Singapore High Court judge Lai Kew Chai dies|website=www.malaysianbar.org.my|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his sentencing, Tan resigned in 1987 as MCA President&lt;ref name="Past Presidents: Tan Koon Swan"/&gt;  and Member of Parliament for [[Gopeng (federal constituency)|Gopeng]], Perak that he won in [[Malaysian general election, 1986|1986 general election]] earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://malaysiansmustknowthetruth.blogspot.com/2012/09/koon-swan-saga-will-truth-emerge.html | title = Koon Swan saga: Will the truth emerge? | date = 12 September 2012| publisher = Malaysians Must Know the Truth. | accessdate = 7 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Tan was also sentenced and imprisoned in Malaysia, declared a bankrupt, and reportedly owed over [[Ringgit Malaysia|RM]] 400 million, at the time roughly equivalent to more than 100 million US dollars. He was ordered to pay RM1000 a month to the Official Assignee and the New Straits Times estimated it would take him 35,316 years to pay off his outstanding claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Unknown | date = 4 May 1989 |newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s, after full repayment, Tan was discharged from bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tan Koon Swan no longer a bankrupt | date = 20 September 1995 | newspaper = [[New Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venrock''', a compound of "Venture" and "Rockefeller", is a [[venture capital firm]] formed in 1969 to build upon the successful investing activities of the [[Rockefeller family]] that began in the late 1930s. It has offices in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

==History==
Venture capitalist [[Laurance Rockefeller|Laurance S. Rockefeller]] (1910–2004) was the fourth of the six children of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] In January 1946 he formed Rockefeller Brothers, Inc., one of the first postwar venture-capital operations, starting with a capitalization of $1.5 million. There were eight partners in all, the five brothers and their sister, Abby, and two non family members Harper Woodward and MIT scientist, Ted Walkowicz. In 1969, the firm became known as Venrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2013/05/09/how-venrock-is-reinventing-itself/#10a1d6831289|title=How Venrock Is Reinventing Itself|last=Dolan|first=Kerry A.|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurance S. Rockefeller became an investor in enterprises based on science and technology.  His investment interests included the fields of aviation, [[aerospace]], electronics, high temperature physics, [[composite material]]s, [[optics]], [[lasers]], [[data processing]], [[thermionics]], and [[nuclear power]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}

In January 2017, Venrock closed its eighth fund with $450 million. 15 partners were involved in this fund.

==Investments==
Venrock invested more than $2.5 billion in more than 440 companies, resulting in 125 [[initial public offering]]s.{{cn|date=May 2017}} Venrock focuses its investments on early-stage and start-up companies in information technology and emerging technologies.
