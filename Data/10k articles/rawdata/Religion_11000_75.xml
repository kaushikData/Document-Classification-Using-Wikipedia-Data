The '''Akal Takht''' ({{lang-pa|ਅਕਾਲ ਤਖ਼ਤ}}), meaning ''throne of the timeless one'',&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch 2008"/&gt; is one of five [[Takht (Sikhism)|takhts]] (seats of power) of the [[Sikh]]s. It is located in the [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple) complex in [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. The Akal Takht was built by [[Guru Hargobind]] as a place of justice and consideration of temporal issues; the highest seat of earthly authority of the [[Khalsa]] (the collective body of the Sikhs) and the place of the [[Jathedar]], the highest spokesman of the [[Sikh]]s. The current [[Jathedar of Akal Takht]] is Harpreet Singh.&lt;ref name="harpreetsinghappointment"&gt;{{cite web |title=Giani Harpreet Singh is acting jathedar of Akal Takht |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/sgpc-appoints-giani-harpreet-as-acting-jathedar-of-akal-takht/articleshow/66324090.cms? |website=The Times of India |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally known as '''Akal Bunga''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akal Bunga|url=https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/architecture/akal-bunga|website=The Sikh Encyclopedia|publisher=Gateway to Sikhism Foundation|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the building directly opposite the [[Harmandir Sahib]] was founded by sixth [[Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Hargobind]], as a symbol of political sovereignty and where spiritual and temporal concerns of the Sikh people could be addressed.&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch 2008"&gt;Fahlbusch E.

When [[Guru Hargobind]] revealed the platform on 15 June 1606, he put on two swords: one indicated his spiritual authority (''piri'') and the other, his temporal authority (''miri'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Dr Kuldip|title=Akal Takht Ate Khalsa Panth|location=Chandigarh|page=2|url=http://panjabdigilib.org/webuser/searches/displayPage.jsp?ID=40833&amp;page=1&amp;CategoryID=12&amp;Searched=W3GX&amp;sbtsro=1&amp;viewall=1|ref=PL-000788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dilgeer|first1=Harjinder Singh|title=The Akal Takht|date=1980|publisher=Sikh University Press|location=Jalandhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Ahmed Shah Abdali]] and Massa Rangar led a series of attacks on the Akal Takht and [[Harmandir Sahib]].&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch 2008"/&gt; [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], a general of [[Ranjit Singh]], the [[maharaja]], decorated the Akhal Takht with gold.&lt;ref&gt;Sohan Lal Suri. 19th century. Umdat-ut-tawarikh, Daftar III, Part 2, trans. V.S. Suri, (1961) 2002, Amritsar: Guru Nanak Dev University, f. 260&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1984, the Akal Takht was damaged when the Indian Army stormed Harmandir Sahib during [[Operation Blue Star]].

== Design ==
[[File:Interior of Akal Takht.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of Akal Takht]]
The Akal Takht was built on a site where there existed only a high mound of earth across a wide open space. It was a place where Guru Hargobind played as a child. The original Takht was a simple platform, {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} high, on which Guru Hargobind would sit in court to receive petitions and administer justice. He was surrounded by insignia of royalty such as the parasol and the flywhisk. Later, there was an open-air semi-circular structure built on marble pillars and a gilded interior section. There were also painted wall panels depicting Europeans.&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite book|title=Sikh shrines in India|last=G.S.|first=Randhir|year=1990|publisher=The Director of Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|location=New Delhi|pages=13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The modern building is a five story structure with marble inlay and a gold-leafed dome. Three of the stories were added by Ranjit Singh in the 1700s. Contemporary restoration work found a layer of paint decorated lime plaster that might have been part of the original structure but later than the time of Harminder.

== Operation Blue Star ==
{{Main|Operation Blue Star}}

Between 3 June and 8 June 1984, the [[Indian army]] conducted an operation, ordered by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in order to establish control over the Harmandir Sahib Complex in Amritsar, Punjab, and remove Sant [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]],  the jathedar of the Akal Takht and his followers from the complex buildings. In the process, many other Sikh Gurdwaras were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/11356/Akal-Takht "Akāl Takht"] Britannica website. Accessed 5 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgpc.net/golden-temple/around.asp "Around Harmandir Sahib"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106131343/http://sgpc.net/golden-temple/around.asp |date=6 January 2013 }} Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee Accessed 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-building ==
The Indian government began to rebuild the Akal Takht with the initiation by [[Nihang]] Baba Santa Singh, the protege of Union minister Buta Singh, a Mazhabi ([[Dalit]]) which was  unacceptable to the dominant Jat Sikhs of the state.&lt;ref name="IT_TakhtRebuilt"/&gt; Sikhs called the new structure the ''Sarkari Takht'' (the word ''sarkar'' in Hindi and Punjabi means "government") to indicate it had   built by the government and was not ''Akal'' (sacred). The Sikh home minister, [[Buta Singh]], was excommunicated for his role in building the new Takht. He was accepted back into the community after a period of penitence (cleaning the devotees's utensils and shoes at the Golden Temple).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/mar/19buta.htm "Buta"] Rediff.com, March 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, [[Bhindranwale]]'s successor from [[Damdami Taksal]], Baba Thakar Singh, ceremonially commenced the demolition of the Akal Takht. The demolition was carried since it had been rebuilt by Tankhaiya Sikhs like Santa and Buta and hence was considered impure. In the demolition process, militants stripped the building's dome of 26 kg gold that had been given by PM Indira Gandhi for its renewal..&lt;ref name="IT_TakhtRebuilt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bhindranwale's rise from a small-time priest was meteoric |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/india-today-35th-anniversary/story/20111226-india-today-newsmake-of-1980s-jarnail-singh-bhindranwale-750018-2011-12-15 |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=India Today |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Lindon''' (born '''Abner Lindenbaum'''; {{circa|lk=no|1867}} – 1948) was a Polish jeweller from a poor Jewish background who became an expert on pearls. He married into the Citroën family and built an important collection of modern art that was looted by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in occupied Paris during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He lived to see some of his paintings returned, although others were returned to his heirs after his death.

==Early life and family==
Lindon was born Abner Lindenbaum around 1867 in [[Kraków]], [[Prussia|Austria]], a region that is now in Poland. His father was Moses Lindenbaum and his mother was Caroline Weil. He married Fernande Citroën (1874&amp;ndash;1963), sister of the motor manufacturer [[André Citroën]], and they had five sons, Lucien, Maxime, Raymond, Maurice and Jacques. His grandson [[Jérôme Lindon]] (d. 2001), Raymond's son, became an important figure in French publishing.&lt;ref name=Ottawa&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=eac07a76-c153-4284-8711-d209c68f48a0 "In 1940 Paris, there was little time to mourn the loss of art."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428135046/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=eac07a76-c153-4284-8711-d209c68f48a0 |date=2015-04-28 }} ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', 17 January 2004. canada.com Retrieved 31 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His great grandsons are the journalist and writer [[Mathieu Lindon]], and the actor [[Vincent Lindon]].

==Career==
[[File:25 Hatton Garden.jpg|thumb|25 Hatton Garden in 2005]]
Lindenbaum worked in the jewellery business, becoming an expert in [[pearls]]. He was in partnership with Adolf Weil and Lewis Lindenbaum as a diamond merchant at 25 [[Hatton Garden]], London, and 48 [[rue La Fayette]], Paris, where they traded as Lindenbaum and Weil. The firm had been trading since at least the early 1890s. In 1901 it was the buyer of a six-row Napoleonic necklace of [[pearls]] for £20,000 at Christie's in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZH19010907.2.79.15 TWENTY THOUSAND POUND NECKLACE.] ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Volume XXXVIII, Issue 11753, 7 September 1901, p. 2. ''Papers Past''. Retrieved 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; That partnership was dissolved at the end of 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28569/page/164 Partnership dissolutions] in ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 5 January 1912, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Weil and the Lindenbaums bid separately for expensive pearls in London auctions. In 1916, a Lindenbaum was the under bidder on a pearl necklace at Christie's that sold for £24,000.&lt;ref&gt;"£24,000 For a Pearl Necklace", ''[[The Times]]'', 21 June 1916, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindenbaum changed his name to Alfred Lindon during the First World War as he thought that name would be more acceptable than a German-sounding name.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6422729 ''Painting Stolen During WW II Returned to France''.] [[National Public Radio]], 2 November 2006. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also abandoned his Polish nationality and became a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardjeanjacques.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/lhistoire-dune-perlede-citroen-vincent.html "L'Histoire d'une perle: De CITROËN à Vincent LINDON"], Jean-Jacques Richard, ''Bijoux et Pierres Precieuses'', 19 October 2010. Retrieved 8 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Paris==
Provenance records suggest that Lindon began to be a serious buyer of art around the late 1920s or early 1930s.&lt;ref name=Yeide&gt;[[Nancy Yeide|Yeide, Nancy H.]] (2009) ''Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection.'' Dallas: Laurel Publishing. {{ISBN|0977434915}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, his grandson Denis Lindon (Raymond's son) remembered visiting Alfred at his home in Paris (Avenue Foch&lt;ref name=fold1102&gt;[http://www.fold3.com/image/270133221/ M1944, p. 1102.] Records of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historical Monuments in War Areas (The Roberts Commission), 1943&amp;ndash;1946. ''fold3''. Retrieved 8 February 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;) when he would have been in his 60s or 70s: "He was a ''bon vivant'', we should call him. He liked his food. He was rather fat because he ate too much. He was also fond of music and he read, but art was really the centre of his life."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

But there was another side to Lindon. Denis recalled that his grandfather "was always very anxious—he was very Jewish in that respect. He was worried about the future, always pessimistic". Denis put it down to his background. "He'd had a difficult youth and had the Jewish spirit—he was always thinking that things were going to be difficult. But maybe that saved his life because if he wasn't pessimistic maybe he would've stayed in Paris and ended up in Auschwitz."&lt;ref name=Ottawa/&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:RMS Duchess of Atholl.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Duchess of Atholl'', the ship on which the Lindons made their escape to North America]]
Lindon and his wife left Paris for London soon after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] in 1940. They travelled from Liverpool to Montreal, Canada, on the [[RMS Duchess of Atholl|RMS ''Duchess of Atholl'']], departing on 17 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=tna%2fbt27%2f1556000055%2f00702 "Passenger Lists leaving UK 1890&amp;ndash;1960 Transcription"] ''findmypast''. {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ship was sunk by a German torpedo in 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually arrived in America where they remained for the rest of the Second World War. Before leaving Paris they placed their collection of art in the care of the [[rue Cambon]]&lt;ref name=fold1102/&gt; branch of the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], possibly because America was not then at war with Germany and they believed that their possessions would be safe in an American bank. The Chase bank was one of the few American banks that continued to trade in France after the German occupation. Presumably unknown to the Lindons, the manager of the Paris branch, [[Carlos Niedermann]], had close links with the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="Bazyler"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bazyler, Michael J.|title=Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h6MVlpGYbYC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9904-8|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Nazis reached Paris in June 1940, the ''Devisenschutz-Kommando'' (Commando for the Protection of Currency), raided the Chase bank looking for currency. They found instead Lindon's paintings which they seized.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fold3.com/image/292793575/ M1949, p. 25], Records of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) Section of the Preparations and Restitution Branch, OMGUS, 1945-1951. ''fold3''. Retrieved 9 February 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were later transferred to the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR), the chief looting organisation of the regime, whose job was to trawl occupied territory for art and antiques to transport back to Germany for Hitler's planned [[Führermuseum]] and the collections of top Nazis such as [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref name=Yeide/&gt;

Among the paintings taken by the Nazis was [[Édouard Vuillard]]'s ''Le Salon de Madame Aron'' (1911–12) an important ''intimisme'' work that provides an insight into middle-class life in France in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Chris/&gt; The painting was not returned to Lindon's heirs until 2006 after the [[National Gallery of Canada]] identified it as a work with an incomplete [[provenance]] and advertised its existence.&lt;ref name=Chris/&gt;&lt;ref name=looted/&gt; Alfred's son, Jacques, an art dealer, twice denied that the painting had belonged to his father before the French authorities released new information from German records taken at the time which proved that the painting had belonged to Alfred.

==Post-war==
Lindon and his wife returned to Paris after the end of the Second World War in time to see some of their paintings recovered. According to Denis Lindon, who lived with his parents and siblings at his grandfather's home after the war, the contents were intact as the [[Gestapo]] had set up office in the building. His grandfather's tapestries and 18th-century furniture were still there, and only the paintings were missing. Alfred Lindon died in 1948.&lt;ref name=Ottawa/&gt;

Shahbaz Bhatti was appointed as Federal Minister for Minorities Affairs on 2 November 2008, when, for the first time, the post was elevated to cabinet level and an independent ministry created. At the time, he said that he accepted the post for the sake of the "oppressed, down-trodden and marginalized" of Pakistan, and that he had dedicated his life to the "struggle for human equality, social justice, religious freedom, and to uplift and empower religious minorities' communities." He added that he wanted to send "a message of hope to the people living a life of disappointment, disillusionment and despair", and also stated his commitment to reforming the country's [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy laws]].&lt;ref name="asia news"&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Shahbaz-Bhatti,-a-Catholic,-is-the-new-minister-for-the-defense-of-minorities-13664.html Asia News, ''Shahbaz Bhatti, a Catholic, is the new minister for the defense of minorities'', 4 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as federal minister, he took numerous steps in support of religious minorities. These included the launch of a national campaign to promote interfaith harmony, the proposal of legislation to ban hate speech and related literature, the proposed introduction of comparative religion as a curriculum subject, the introduction of quotas for religious minorities in government posts and the reservation of four [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] seats for minorities.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/02/profile-shahbaz-bhatti.html Dawn.com: Profile: Shahbaz Bhatti]&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatti also spearheaded the organisation of a National Interfaith Consultation in July 2010, which brought together senior religious leaders of all faiths from across Pakistan and resulted in a joint declaration against terrorism.&lt;ref name="TheExpressTribune"&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/31096/interfaith-conference-issues-declaration-against-terror/ The Express Tribune, ''Interfaith conference issues declaration against terror'', July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anadenanthera peregrina''''', also known as '''yopo''', '''jopo''', '''cohoba''', '''parica''' or  '''calcium tree''', is a perennial tree of the genus ''[[Anadenanthera]]'' native to the [[Caribbean]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="ILDIS"/&gt; It grows up to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, and has a horny bark. Its flowers are pale yellow to white and spherical.  It is an [[entheogen]] which has been used in healing ceremonies and [[ritual]]s for thousands of years in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carod-Artal|first=F.

[[File:Yopo_Seeds.jpg|thumb|right|Yopo seeds]]

[[Archaeological]] evidence shows ''Anadenanthera'' beans have been used as [[hallucinogens]] for thousands of years. The oldest clear evidence of use comes from smoking pipes made of [[Felis Concolor|puma]] bone (''Felis concolor'') found with ''Anadenanthera'' beans at Inca Cueva, a site in the northwest of [[Humahuaca]] in the [[Altiplano|Puna]] border of [[Jujuy Province]], Argentina. The pipes were found to contain the hallucinogen [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], one of the compounds found in ''Anadenanthera'' beans. [[Radiocarbon]] testing of the material gave a date of 2130 BC, suggesting that ''Anadenanthera'' use as a hallucinogen is over 4,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pochettino|first1=M.

Ruiz. 1995 {{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of insufflation use within the period 500-1000 AD, in northern Chile, has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juan P.

Some indigenous peoples of the [[Orinoco]] basin in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and possibly in the southern part of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] make use of yopo snuff for spiritual healing. Yopo snuff was also widely used in ceremonial contexts in the [[Caribbean]] area, including [[Puerto Rico]] and [[La Española]], up to the [[Spanish Conquest]].

Yopo snuff is usually blown into the user's nostrils by another person through [[bamboo]] tubes or sometimes snuffed by the user using bird bone tubes. Blowing is more effective as this method allows more powder to enter the nose and is said to be less irritating. In some areas the unprocessed ground beans are snuffed or smoked producing a much weaker effect with stronger physical symptoms. Some tribes use yopo along with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' to increase and prolong the visionary effects, creating an experience similar to that of [[ayahuasca]].

===Effects===

The first report of the effects of hallucinogenic snuff prepared from the beans of ''Anadenanthera peregrina'' dates back to 1496 when it was observed by Friar Ramon Pane, who was commissioned by Christopher Columbus, among the Taina Indians of Hispaniola. Pane's report was first published in 1511 in Martyr's descriptions of the New World. The description of its effects reads in part: "This ''kohobba'' powder," described as "an intoxicating herb, is so strong that those who take it lose consciousness; when the stupefying action begins to wane, the arms and legs become loose and the head droops." It is administered with a cane about one foot long which they introduce one end of "in the nose and the other in the powder and ...draw it into themselves through the nose." It worked quickly because, "almost immediately they believe they see the room turn upside-down and men walking with their heads downwards." The administering witch-doctor took the drug along with his patients, intoxicating "them so that they do not know what they do and...speak of many things incoherently," believing that they are in communication with spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1969-01-01_4_page004.html|title=UNODC - Bulletin on Narcotics - 1969 Issue 4 - 003|last=EVANS-SCHULTES|first=Richard|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bufotenin====
The beans have been found to contain up to 7.4% [[bufotenin]].&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics"&gt;[http://entheology.org/edoto/anmviewer.asp?a=9&amp;z=8 Pharmanopo-Psychonautics: Human Intranasal, Sublingual, Intrarectal, Pulmonary and Oral Pharmacology of Bufotenine] by Jonathan Ott, The Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; At up to 7.4% (74&amp;nbsp;mg per gram) bufotenin, an effective 40&amp;nbsp;mg dose of insufflated bufotenin&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics" /&gt; requires little more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;grams of beans.

The [[intraperitoneal]] {{LD50}} of bufotenin is between 200–300&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (in rodents) with death occurring by respiratory arrest. The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in rodents scales to between 10,000&amp;nbsp;mg and 15,000&amp;nbsp;mg for a small 50&amp;nbsp;kg (110&amp;nbsp;lb) adult.&lt;ref name="VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Anadenanthera: Visionary Plant of Ancient South America|last= Torres|first= Constantino Manuel|authorlink= |author2= David B.

Human intravenous tests using [[bufotenin]] suggest the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; may be much lower in humans with subjects showing signs of peripheral toxicity (purple face, [[tachycardia]], difficulty breathing, etc.) at doses as little as 8&amp;nbsp;mg in some subjects.&lt;ref&gt;TiKHAL, Alexander Shulgin, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Free base bufotenin when insufflated, taken sublingually, orally, or intrarectally, elicits strong hallucinogenic effects with far less side effects.&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics" /&gt;

====Dimethyltryptamine and 5-MeO-DMT====
{{refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
The effects of insufflated [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[5-MeO-DMT]] are relatively short acting, the trip lasts about 10 minutes but can take an hour to get back to baseline,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} while the effects of insufflated yopo typically last 2–3 hours. Of the three main compounds present, only insufflated bufotenin lasts 2–3 hours. Claims{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} of Anadenanthera peregrina containing DMT and 5-MeO-DMT as their main active ingredients are based on rare cases where these compounds are found in larger quantities than bufotenin. Typical acid base extraction techniques utilizing strong bases such as sodium hydroxide solution will exclude bufotenin from the extraction, in favor of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. It is believed{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} that such extractions have contributed to the misconception that bufotenin is a minor alkaloid in yopo. The majority of the extractions confirm{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} that bufotenin is primarily responsible for the effects of yopo with the other compounds usually appearing in quantities too small to produce noticeable effects in an average yopo dose of 5-10 grams.

The beans have been found to contain up to only 0.04% 5-MeO-DMT and 0.16% DMT.&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics" /&gt; The leaves and bark also contain small amounts of DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and related compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Schultes 1976 {{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultes 1977 {{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pachter et al. 1959  {{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At up to 0.04% (0.4&amp;nbsp;mg per gram) 5-MeO-DMT, an effective light 5&amp;nbsp;mg dose of insufflated 5-MeO-DMT would require over 12 grams of beans. It would be extremely difficult to insufflate such a quantity, as tolerance would likely develop before the 12-gram nasal intake could be completed. Individual sensitivity to 5-MeO-DMT varies. It has been documented that the threshold dose in some individuals is as much as 10&amp;nbsp;mg insufflated&lt;ref name="ShamanicSnuffsOrEntheogenicErrhines-Page-102"&gt;Shamanic Snuffs or Entheogenic Errhines by Jonathan Ott, Page 102, 2001, {{ISBN|1-888755-02-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring over 24 grams of beans for an effective dose of 5-MeO-DMT.

At up to 0.16% (1.6&amp;nbsp;mg per gram) DMT, an effective 40&amp;nbsp;mg dose of insufflated DMT would require 25 grams or more. Because of its volume, it’s likely to be impossible to insufflate the 25 grams of beans required to reach the active dose of DMT present in the beans. An extract of 25 grams of beans could contain up to 1,850&amp;nbsp;mg of bufotenin, a potentially dangerous dose. With insufflated freebase bufotenin, the maximum published safe dose used has been 100&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="PharmanopoPsychonautics" /&gt;

Unlike bufotenin, both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are relatively unstable and begin to degrade rather quickly. Schultes and colleges (1977) examined a 120-year-old bean collection and found 0.6% bufotenin with no DMT or 5-MeO-DMT present at all. They also examined a batch of beans that contained all three compounds when fresh, but found only bufotenin in the beans after only two years of [[Metalocalypse|storage]].&lt;ref name=" VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt;

===Oral usage===
When taken orally by some tribes in South America, small amounts are often combined with alcoholic ''chichas'' ([[maize beer]]).&lt;ref name=" VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Moderate doses are unpleasant, producing nausea and vomiting. The beans were a main ingredient in bilca tauri, an oral purge medicine used to induce ritual vomiting once a month.&lt;ref name=" VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt; Large amounts are not usually consumed orally; as many tribes believe oral use is dangerous.

===Use with MAOIs===
Some South American tribes have been documented to use various bean preparations along with ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', an herb containing [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs).&lt;ref name="VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt; Typically ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' is chewed in the mouth while the Anadenanthera beans are snuffed or smoked.&lt;ref name="VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt; Occasionally ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' is found mixed in with the snuff.&lt;ref name="VisionaryPlantofAncientSouthAmerica"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The [[animated television series]] ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' references the use of ''Anadenanthera peregrina'' dates (referred to as "Yopo") in the 2008 [[episode]] "Dethcarraldo". Members of the fictional band in the series, [[Dethklok]], undertake an excursion to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] jungles in [[South America]], and are administered a dose of Yopo by a native tribe known as the Yaneemango.

An '''ancestral shrine''', '''hall''' or '''temple''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|祠|堂}}|p={{linktext|Cí|táng}}}} or {{zh|c={{linktext|宗|祠}}|p={{linktext|Zōng| Cí}}}}), also called '''lineage temple''', is a [[Chinese temple]] dedicated to [[Ancestor veneration in China|deified]] [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s of surname lineages or families in the [[Chinese traditional religion]]. Ancestral temples are closely linked to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] culture and the emphasis that it places on [[filial piety]].

A common central feature of the ancestral temples are the [[spirit tablet|ancestral tablets]] that embody the ancestral spirits.&lt;ref name=eccc&gt;Edward L. Davis (Editor), Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture, Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestral tablets are typically arranged by seniority of the ancestors.&lt;ref name=eccc/&gt; Altars and other ritual objects such as incense burners are also common fixtures. Ancestors and gods can also be represented by statues.

The temples are used for collective rituals and festivals in honor of the ancestors&lt;ref name=eccc/&gt; but also for other family- and community-related functions such as weddings and funerals.&lt;ref name=eccc/&gt; Sometimes, they serve wider community functions such as meetings and local elections.

In traditional weddings, the ancestral temple serves a major symbolic function, completing the [[Women in ancient and imperial China|transfer of a woman to her husband's family]].&lt;ref name="lwx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=2009 |title=Worshipping in the Ancestral Hall |author=Li Wenxian |year=2011 |work=Encyclopedia of Taiwan |publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=12 September 2012 |location=Taipei |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501144423/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=2009 |archivedate=1 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the wedding rites, the bride and groom worship at the groom's ancestral shrine, bowing as follows:&lt;ref name="lwx"/&gt;
#first bow - Heaven and Earth
#second bow - ancestors
#third bow - parents
#fourth bow - spouse

Three months after the marriage, the wife undertakes worship at the husband's ancestral shrine, in a rite known as ''miaojian'' (廟見).&lt;ref name="lwx"/&gt;

Ancestral temples have often been secularized to serve as village schools or granaries during the land reform of the 1950s and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. They have experienced a revival since the [[Chinese economic reform|economic liberalization]] of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=eccc/&gt; The revival of the ancestral temples has been particularly strong in southern China where lineage organization had stronger roots in the local culture and local communities are more likely to have members living overseas who can support rebuilding of the shrines through donations.&lt;ref name=eccc/&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

[[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] defines '''''arhat''''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pali]]: '''''arahant''''') as one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=67}} Other Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|path of Enlightenment]], but who may not have reached full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries, and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions. A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]]. The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Kāśyapīya]], [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Ekavyāvahārika]], [[Lokottaravāda]], [[Bahuśrutīya]], [[Prajñaptivāda]], and [[Caitika]] schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra''. 2008. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist teachings]] urge followers to take up the path of a [[bodhisattva]], and to not fall back to the level of arhats and [[śrāvaka]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; The arhats, or at least the senior arhats, came to be widely regarded{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as "moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way".{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of [[Eighteen Arhats]] (with names and personalities) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as [[Maitreya]], and other groupings of 6, 8, [[Sixteen Arhats|16]], 100, and 500 also appear in tradition and [[Buddhist art]], especially in East Asia.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}} They can be seen as the Buddhist equivalents of the Christian saints, [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] or early disciples and [[leader]]s of the faith.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}}

==Etymology and translations==
[[File:Gohyaku rakan.jpg|thumb|''Gohyaku rakan'' - five hundred statues depicting arhats, at the Chōkei temple in Toyama]]

===Etymology===
Pāḷi ''arahant'' is a present participle coming from the verbal root √arh "to deserve",&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, D. W. ''Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language''&lt;/ref&gt; cf. ''arha'' "meriting, deserving"; ''arhaṇa'' "having a claim, being entitled"; ''arhita'' (past participle) "honoured, worshipped".&lt;ref&gt;''Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used in the ''Ṛgveda'' with this sense of "deserving".&lt;ref&gt;RV 1.4.47, 2.5.51&lt;/ref&gt;

A common folk etymology derives the word from ''ari'' (enemy) and ''hanta'' from the root √'''''han''''' (cf: Hunter) "to strike, to kill"; hence the translation "foe-destroyer". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is "jarring" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (''arha''). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word ''arahanta'' and ''arihanta'', the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title ''jina'' "conqueror", whence ''jaina'' "related to the conqueror", i.e. Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gombrich, 2009, ''What the Buddha Thought'', Equinox: London, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
The term ''arhat'' is often rendered in English as ''arahat''.

The term ''arhat'' was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese ''āluóhàn'' (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply ''luóhàn'' (Ch. 羅漢).  This may appear in English as ''luohan'' or ''lohan''.  In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is ''rakan'' (Ja. 羅漢) or ''arakan'' (Ja. 阿羅漢).

The [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] term for ''arhat'' was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, ''dgra bcom pa'', means "one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions".&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel. ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School''. Snow Lion Publications. 1998. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of ''arhat'' to be ''ari-hanta''.

==Attainments==
A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]].  The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect believed that "the Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths."&lt;ref&gt;《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahīśāsaka]] and the [[Theravada]] regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment.{{refn|group=note|Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Prebish and [[Damien Keown]] (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', pp 36&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the [[Pāli Canon]] portrays the Buddha declaring himself to be an arahant.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Buddha is the first of the arahants, while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahants. In the verse of homage to the Buddha, it is said: "Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ... — The Blessed One is an arahant..." Shortly after his enlightenment, while walking to Benares to meet the five monks, a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was. The Buddha replied: "I am the arahant in the world, I am the supreme teacher" (MN 26/I 171). So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''nirvāṇa'' is "the ultimate goal", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship:{{refn|group=note|"From the perspective of the Nikāyas, the ultimate goal – the goal in strict doctrinal terms – is nirvāṇa, and the goal in human terms is arahantship, the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, "The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;

The Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with ''samyaksambuddha''s at the top, [[mahāsattva]]s below that, [[pratyekabuddha]]s below that and arhats further below.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; "But what was it that distinguished the ''bodhisattva'' from the ''sravaka'', and ultimately the ''buddha'' from the ''arhat''? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the ''bodhisattva''."{{sfn|prebish|Keown|2004|page=88}}

==Meaning of Arhat==
===In the early Buddhist schools===
In pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kieckhefer, George D. Bond. "Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions" 1988. pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins,&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt; Bahuśrutīyins,&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture''. 2005. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt; schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') over that of the arhat (''[[śrāvakayāna]]''), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;

According to [[A.K. Warder]], the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; In the Sarvāstivādin ''Nāgadatta Sūtra'', the demon [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī,]] to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).
{{quote|Māra therefore took the disguise of Nāgadatta's father and said thus to Nāgadatta: "Your thought is too serious. [[Buddhahood]] is too difficult to attain. It takes a hundred thousand nayutas of [[crore|koṭi]]s of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]s to become a Buddha. Since few people attain Buddhahood in this world, why don't you attain Arhatship? For the experience of Arhatship is the same as that of [[nirvana|nirvāṇa]]; moreover, it is easy to attain Arhatship.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"&gt;Kalupahana, David. ''Buddhist Thought and Ritual''. 2001. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, "A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior."&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"/&gt;

The Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their "perfection" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;

===In Theravāda Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie [[Samyojana|the fetters]] – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the [[samsara]] have been finally dissolved. In the [[Pali Canon]], the word ''[[tathagata]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.{{refn|group=note|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind''. Curzon Press 1995, p. 227: {{quote|Before focusing on key passages on the tathagata, it is first necessary to clarify which persons the word refers to. The Buddha often used it when talking of himself as an enlightened being, rather than as the individual Gotama. In general, "tathagata" is used specifically of the Buddha, the one who discovers and proclaims the path to nibbana (A.II.8–9, S.III.65-6), with the "tathagata, Arahat, perfectly and completely enlighteneed one" being contrasted with a "disciple of the tathagata" (D.II.142). Nevertheless, "tathagata" is sometimes used of any Arahat. S.V.327, for example, discusses the "dwelling of a learner" and that of a tathagata, and explains the second by describing the qualities of an Arahat. At M.I.139–140 and 486-7, moreover, there is a switching between talk of a "tathagata" and of "a monk whose mind is freed thus", as if they were simple equivalents. Tathagata literally means "thus-gone" or "thus-come", probably meaning one who is "attained-to-truth" or "whose-nature-is-from-truth".}}}}

After attainment of Nibbana, the [[five aggregates]] (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed ''the nibbana element with a residue remaining''.  But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed ''the nibbana element without residue remaining''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330082958/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.

In Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, [[hatred]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and [[tanha|craving]]. Lacking "assets" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now. This virtue shows stainless purity, true worth, and the accomplishment of the end, [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/17|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the roles of arahants, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, Nathan Katz writes that, there is a tendency in the Theravāda school to exclude laypeople from the possibility of achieving arahantship.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Natha. ''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection''. 1982. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While in the ''Sutta Piṭaka'', ''arhattā'' was open to all, both in principle and in fact, there was a growing tendency among later Theravāda ''saṅghikas'' to restrict ''arhattā'' to those wearing the robe. Earlier we indicated a ''Milindapañha'' verse which held that while ''arhattā'' might be attainable by a layperson, within one day of its attainment he would have to either enter the ''saṅgha'' or die.}}

In the Pali canon, [[Ananda|Ānanda]] states that he knows [[bhikkhu|monastics]] to achieve nibbana in one of four ways:{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Ānanda's teaching on achieving arhantship can be found in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.170.  Translations for this sutta can be found in Bodhi (2005) pp. 268–9, 439, and Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bodhi (2005), p. 268, translates this fourth way as: "a monk's mind is seized by agitation about the teaching."  Thanissaro (1998) gives a seemingly contrary interpretation of: "a monk's mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma [Comm: the corruptions of insight] well under control."  Thus, it appears possible to interpret the excitation (Pali: ''uddhacca'', see [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3582.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25]) as either something that the future arahant uses to ''impel'' their pursuit of the path or something that the future arahant ''controls'' in order to pursue the path.}}

* one develops [[Vipassana|insight]] preceded by [[Samatha|serenity]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|samatha-pubbaṇgamaṃ vipassanaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity preceded by insight (''{{IAST|vipassanā-pubbaṇgamaṃ samathaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity and insight in a stepwise fashion (''{{IAST|samatha-vipassanaṃ yuganaddhaṃ}}''),
* one's mind becomes seized by excitation about the [[dhamma]] and, as a consequence, develops serenity and abandons the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''{{IAST|dhamma-uddhacca-viggahitaṃ mānasaṃ hoti}}'').

For those that have destroyed greed and hatred (in the sensory context) with some residue of delusion, are called ''[[anagami]]'' (non-returner). Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Pure Abodes]], where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.

The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of the path to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Keown and Prebish (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 36: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."}}

===In Mahāyāna Buddhism===
[[File:Luóhàn at British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], around 1000, one of a famous [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans|Group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian]]]]

Mahayana Buddhists see Gautama Buddha himself as the ideal towards which one should aim in one's spiritual aspirations. A hierarchy of general attainments is envisioned with the attainments of arhats and pratyekabuddhas being clearly separate and below that of samyaksambuddha or [[tathāgata]]s such as Gautama Buddha.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. Sarup &amp; Son. 2008. p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of aspiring for arhatship, Mahayanins are urged to instead take up the path of the bodhisattva and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; Therefore, it is taught that an arhat must go on to become a bodhisattva eventually. If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep [[samadhi|samādhi]] of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of [[prajnaparamita]] and [[skillful means]] to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. ''{{IAST|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi}}''). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81 Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}]]'' compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of [[Sumeru]].&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt;

Mahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt; Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John. ''A Concise Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism''. Snow Lion Publications. 2008. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese Buddhism]] and other East Asian traditions have historically accepted this perspective, and specific groups of arhats are venerated as well, such as the [[Sixteen Arhats]], the [[Eighteen Arhats]], and the Five Hundred Arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise. ''The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History and Meaning''. Shambhala. 2009. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk [[Guanxiu]] ({{zh|c=貫休|p=''Guànxiū''}}) in 891 CE. He donated these portraits to Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (modern [[Hangzhou]]), where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect.&lt;ref name="Early Text Painting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Texts on Painting|author=Susan Bush and Ilsio-yen Shih|publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|year=1985|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, the path to arhatship and the path to complete enlightenment are seen as having common grounds. However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences. Of this, Paul Williams writes that in Mahāyāna Buddhism, "Nirvāṇa must be sought without being sought (for oneself), and practice must be done without being practiced. The discursive mode of thinking cannot serve the basic purpose of attainment without attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arruns Tarquinius''' was the brother of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the seventh and last [[King of Rome]].

According to most ancient authors, Arruns and his brother were the sons of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the fifth Roman king, and [[Tanaquil]].  However, in some sources they described as grandsons; their father may have been a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius, who according to an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tradition was defeated and killed by the heroes Aulus and [[Caelius Vibenna]], together with a certain ''Macstarna''.  Apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin word ''magister'', Macstarna has been identified with [[Servius Tullius]], the sixth King of Rome.

According to legend, Servius had come to the palace as a child, following the capture of [[Corniculum (ancient Latin town)|Corniculum]] by Tarquinius Priscus.  Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, discovered his potential for greatness by various omens.  When the elder Tarquin was assassinated, Tanaquil gave out that he was merely wounded, and installed Servius as regent, preferring him to her own sons.  The Etruscan tradition may preserve an account of a revolt by Tarquin's sons against Servius' magistracy.  Servius married a daughter of the elder Tarquin, and in turn he gave his own daughters to Arruns and Lucius Tarquinius.

Arruns Tarquinius was mild and unassuming, while his brother was ambitious.  Arruns' wife, known to history as [[Tullia Minor]], as she was the younger daughter, was similarly ambitious, while her elder sister was not.  Tullia sought to place her husband on the throne, which would require her father's death.  But as Arruns lacked the ambition to overthrow his father-in-law, Tullia contrived his murder, and that of her own sister, that she might marry Lucius.  Once these deeds were accomplished, she and Lucius plotted her father's destruction.

With a sudden and bloody palace coup, the pair deposed and murdered the king, and Lucius seized the throne.  Lucius' second son was named after his murdered brother; but it was the overweening pride and arrogance of Lucius' sons that brought about the downfall of the Roman monarchy.  The younger Arruns fell in battle against the consul [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] in 509 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian feminist theology''' arises out of the need for a [[theology]] relevant to [[women in Asia]]. Drawing upon themes from both [[liberation theology]] and [[feminist theology]], it expands upon the two, contextualizing it to the conditions and experiences of Asian women.

== History ==
The first recognizable collective attempt to do Asian [[feminist theology]] can be traced to the late 1970s, which saw the formation of theological networks and centres that aimed to study the gendered dimension of both [[theology]] and society.

The [[Conference of Theologically Trained Women of Asia]] was founded in January 1981 followed by The Women's Commission of the [[Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians]] (EATWOT) in 1983. The first Asian women's theological journal ''In God’s Image'' was founded in 1982 and helped form the Asian Women's Resource Centre for Culture and Theology in 1988.

These organizations, networks and centres allowed Asian female theologians to discuss strategies for dealing with [[patriarchy]] in society, the church and theology, which they saw as unhelpfully dependent on the West.

== Context ==
[[File:Kwok Pui-lan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwok Pui-lan]]]]
Although there was Asian theology being written during the 1960s, this [[Kosuke Koyama|"water buffalo" theology]] was written mostly by men who looked to traditional [[culture of Asia|Asian culture]] and practices as sources for their theology. In doing so however, they neglected the experiences of women and tended to romanticize Asian traditions without properly critiquing its patriarchal elements. Chinese theologian [[Kwok Pui-lan]] writes "challenging the colonial legacy, these theologians sometimes were too eager to embrace the cultural traditions of Asia, without taking sufficient notice of their [[elitism|elitist]] and [[sexism|sexist]] components".{{sfn|Kwok|2000}}

Problems were also found within Western feminist theology which was accused of:
# speaking from a tradition where [[Christianity]] was dominant, which was largely irrelevant for most Asian women
# a tendency to universalize Western experiences as representative 
# being insufficiently radical – it failed to consider the axes of [[colonialism]], [[cultural imperialism]], [[religious pluralism]], and [[internalized oppression|internalized]] colonialism
# some displayed [[racism|racist]] or [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] orientations that [[essentialism|essentialized]] Asian women

== Stages ==
In the early stages of the late 1970s–1980s, Asian feminist theologians saw the need to stress the commonality of Asian women. There was a call to embrace their shared identity as Asian women first and foremost. Emphasis was placed on the shared and lived experiences of [[oppression]], colonialism, and [[neo-colonialism]] and the theology of this stage was more reflective and descriptive than analytical.

[[File:Dr Grace Ji-Sun Kim 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grace Ji-Sun Kim]]]]
In the 1990s, this gave way to the awareness of the dangers of generalizing experiences. Asian feminist theologians began to call to attention the diversity and wide range of lives and situations experienced by women across Asia. Turning to their own traditions and cultures, Asian feminist theologians began to look at these with a critical feminist consciousness, while at the same time identifying in them liberating and life-affirming aspects to emulate and draw upon. 

The third and present stage sees a huge range of diverse theories and subjects being engaged with. [[Christology]] was from the beginning a key issue of interest for Asian feminist theologians and this has remained so, however there are now works being done on subjects such as [[Mariology]], [[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]], [[soteriology]], and [[ecclesiology]]. Theologians are engaging with a wider range of theories such as [[postcolonial theology|postcolonial theory]], [[psychoanalysis]], political feminist hermeneutics, and others. Additionally, other hallmarks of this stage include more work being done on the notion of hybrid identities by second- and third-generation immigrant Asian women such as [[Wonhee Anne Joh]] and [[Grace Ji-Sun Kim]], as well as a shift in focus onto the oppression faced by Asian women in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kim |first=Hyun Hui |title=Asian Feminist Theology |url=http://www.drew.edu/theological/2012/03/30/asian-feminist-theology/ |publisher=Drew University |access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chung Hyun Kyung.jpg|thumb|[[Chung Hyun Kyung]]]]
In seeking a new theology, Asian feminist theologians have turned to traditional practices, myths, and motifs, while at the same time being aware of problematic elements.

An example of this is detailed by Korean theologian [[Chung Hyun Kyung]] who talks about ''han-pu-ri'' as a way for Asian women to find healing. Chung describes [[Han (cultural)|''han'']] as coming from "the sinful interconnections of [[classism]], racism, sexism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, and cultural imperialism which Korean people experience everyday".{{sfn|Chung|1990|p=138}} For her, this built-up ''han'' is imprisoning Korean women. The ritual of ''han-pu-ri'', overseen mostly by female shamans, is a method of liberation that is especially helpful as it is "one of the few spaces where poor Korean women played their spiritual role without being dominated by male-centred religious authorities".{{sfn|Chung|1990|p=143}}

[[Oral tradition]]s also play an important role due to its central place in many Asian societies, with poems, songs, stories, and dance being seen as potential ways of doing theology.

== Theology ==

=== Bible ===
Asian feminist theologians draw upon Biblical stories such as that of [[Samaritan woman at the well|the Samaritan woman]], the [[Syrophoenician woman|Syrophoenecian woman]] as well as the figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]] who is seen as the first fully liberated human by Indonesian writer [[Marianne Katoppo]].{{sfn|Katoppo|2000}}

=== God ===
Unlike some Western feminists, Asian feminist theologians have little problem with the language used to speak about God, or the gender of Jesus. Indeed, for some such as [[Virginia Fabella]], the very fact that Jesus is male is advantageous. She writes, "among Asian women, the maleness of Jesus has not been a problem for we see it as 'accidental' to the salvific process. His maleness was not essential but functional. By being male, Jesus could more repudiate more effectively the male definition of humanity and show the way to a right and just male–female relationship".{{sfn|Fabella|2015|p=4}}

The Asian feminist understanding of God is holistic and ecological. This approach sees God in all life ([[Panentheism]]) and views God as the creative power that sustains life. There is an emphasis on relationality of humans, other life-forms and God. Chung Hyun Kyung states, "Asian women emphasize the importance of community in their theologies because only in community can humanity reflect God and fulfil the image of God".{{sfn|Chung|1990|p=49}}

It also moves away from the dualism of Western approaches that insist on a divide between mind/body, nature/culture, male/female. Instead, God is seen to easily possess both masculine and feminine qualities. [[Padma Gallup]] of India claims that Western Christianity has lost this inclusive understanding as it is too "wrapped in layers of ponderous patriarchy, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], Greek philosophy, and the ethics of the marketplace and morality of the dominant male of the [[Puritans|Puritan]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gallup |first=Padma |year=1983 |title=Doing Theology – An Asian Feminist Perspective |journal=CTC Bulletin |volume=4 |issue=3 |location=Singapore |publisher=Christian Conference of Asia |p=22}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Chung|2015|p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christology ===
For many Asian women, the images of Christ that were propagated during the colonial era are unhelpful. The notion of Jesus as Lord reinforced servility to colonial authorities, and the image of Jesus as the Suffering Servant encouraged passiveness and docility. Virginia Fabella writes, "Asian women have been 'lorded over' for centuries and all the major religions including Christianity have contributed to this sinful situation."{{sfn|Fabella|2015|p=10}} Likewise, Muriel Orevillo-Montenegro explains that "the Jesus of Asian women is the Asian Christ who accompanies them in their daily struggles for liberation from all forms of oppression and suffering. This Christ seeks to engage with religions, cultures, and indigenous spiritualities to make life flourish for every living being."{{sfn|Orevillo-Montenegro|2006|p=194}}

Instead, they have understood Jesus as a liberator, who has come to set people free both spiritually and from their earthly bondage of socio-economic oppression. Asian feminists have emphasized how Jesus sought out the poor and marginalized within society, and noted his ministry with women ({{bibleref2|Mark|5:25-43|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|7:11-17|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|13:10-17|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|John|4:1-42|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|Matthew|15:21–28|NRSV}}) as well as his female disciples ({{bibleref2|Matthew|27:55-56|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|Mark|15:40-41|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|Luke|8:1-3|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|John|20:14-18|NRSV}}).

Other notions of Christ include a reworking of his suffering to mean that he is compassionate and deeply empathetic and understanding of the suffering faced by many Asian women; and an organic model of Christology as advocated by Kwok who looks at Jesus' use of metaphors from nature ({{bibleref2|John|4:14|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|John|6:35|NRSV}}; {{bibleref2|John|15:1-8|NRSV}}).{{sfn|Kwok|1997}}

=== Spirituality ===
[[Spirituality]] for many Asian feminist theologians involves both body and soul in harmony and focuses on the joyful celebration of life. Specifically, the female body is embraced and loved, reacting against traditions such as [[female infanticide]] and [[sex tourism]] that devalue female bodies. This spirituality is holistic and life-affirming, exhorting women's procreative power and emphasizing interconnection with all living things.

=== Sexuality ===
Asian feminist theologians see [[human sexuality|sexuality]] is an important part of spirituality. For some such as [[Elizabeth Dominguez]], sensuality and erotic love is to be embraced as God has intended it to be the purest form of human communion. Reacting against traditional church teachings that inhibit the [[eroticism]] of women, for Asian feminist theologians, a woman's sensuality is something that is liberating and freeing, allowing them to feel deeply towards God and others.

[[File:Logo of the Association of Muslim Scholars.jpg|thumb|Emblem of the group]]
The '''Association of Muslim Scholars''' ([[Arabic]]: هيئة علماء المسلمين ''Hayat Al-Ulama Al-Muslimin'') is a group of religious leaders in [[Iraq]]. It was formed on the April 14, 2003, four days after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion]] demolished the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Ba'athist]] regime of [[Saddam Hussein]], by a group of scholars who aimed to represent [[Sunni]]s in Iraq. Though not a political party, the association is considered to be politically influential. It also administers a charitable fund set up for the upkeep of religious buildings.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3770065.stm BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Who's who in Iraq: Sunni groups&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent members include [[Harith Sulayman al-Dhari]] (Chairman), Muthanna Harith al-Dhari (Chairman's son and spokesman), Abdel-Salam al-Kubaisi, [[Abdel-Sattar Abdel-Jabbar]], Dr. [[Muhammad Bashar al-Faithi]], [[Ahmed Abdul Ghafour al-Samarrai]], Mahdi Ibrahim, Abu Bashir al-Tarousi, [[Rached Ghannouchi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://markkit.net/untrusted/www.washingtoninstitute.org_templateC07.php_CID_592.html?s=16e4876193e9f21bb48d1cc7a4a3e9a2#]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Umar Raghib.

==Political stances==
===Views===
The AMS has not joined the newly formed government because it believes the political process to be illegitimate whilst Iraq remains under occupation. The group believes that: "True democracy is impossible under occupation.”&lt;ref&gt;Roel Meijer, 'The Association of Muslim Scholars in Iraq' http://www.merip.org/mer/mer237/meijer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the association's spokesman in 2005 Muhammad al-Kubaysi, Iraq's problems can be attributed to "the presence of a foreign power that occupies this country and refuses even the mere scheduling of the withdrawal of its forces from Iraq." &lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=9233 Al Jazeera English - Archive - Ams Critical Of Iraq Elections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417210959/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=9233 |date=April 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the AMS met a senior US embassy official in January 2005 and asked for a timetable for US troop withdrawal. When this was refused, the group called for a boycott of the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=8798 Al Jazeera English - Archive - Us Rejects Ams' Poll Conditions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420111506/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=8798 |date=April 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMS has been the group most critical of the occupation since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Sheikh Harith al-Dhari, the Chairman of the group, has said: "Iraq’s ordeal will not end unless the occupation ends. We must get rid of the occupation which is the cause of Iraq’s misery and pain. It acts as a cover and fuel for outsiders to meddle."&lt;ref&gt;Aljazeera - 'US the main irritant in Iraq' http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/358F4592-A9B6-4BBC-8C3A-4FBC700C0BBC.htm?FRAMELESS=true&amp;NRNODEGUID=%7b358F4592-A9B6-4BBC-8C3A-4FBC700C0BBC%7d&lt;/ref&gt;

The association has been called an important force in giving the anti-occupation Sunni insurgency religious sanction in Iraq, with some of its leaders, such as Ayyash al-Kubaisi, openly endorsing the Sunni resistance as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' (Norton, 2006), p.207&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have consistently condemned all indiscriminate attacks on civilians, distinguishing between 'terrorism' and 'honorable resistance'&lt;ref&gt;BBC - Iraq blasts mar Muslim holy month (16 Oct 2004)  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3749520.stm&lt;/ref&gt; and have negotiated for the release of Western hostages, as well as helping to arrange aid convoys to the city of Falluja when it was under siege.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

When [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]] leader [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] called for "a full-scale war on Shiites," at least one member of the association, Abu Bashir al-Tarousi, objected, pointing out that "although sectarian war in Iraq may have been provoked and sparked by the Shia ... killing according to sectarian affiliation is not justified by Islamic law," and Muslims should not take "justice into their own hands." He also expressed concern that the attacks would cause the "legitimate Iraqi resistance" to lose its credibility in the eyes of the Islamic world"&lt;ref&gt;Abu Bashir Tartousi, "Hawl al-Harb al-Ta'ifiya fi al-Iraq," ''Tajdid al-Islami'', September 17, 2005 (originally on www.tajdeed.org.uk/forums/showthread.php?s=7db36a1f947c54c5884590786a626586&amp;threadid=38120 but tajdid.org.uk was closed down after the July 2005 London bombings), quoted in Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' (Norton, 2006), p.209&lt;/ref&gt;  

The association has condemned [[Siege of Fallujah (2016)|the 2016 assault on Falluja]] as "an unjust aggression, a reflection of the vengeful spirit that [[Popular Mobilization Forces (Iraq)|the forces of evil]] harbor against this city".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-falluja-sistani-idUSKCN0YG113 Reuters: Top Shi'ite cleric urges restraint in assault on Iraq's Falluja]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious stances==
The AMS is a group of [[Sunni]] scholars. Many of its members favor the  [[Hanbali]] school of fiqh law over the [[Hanafi]] school, which has traditionally been dominant in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' (Norton, 2006), p.207-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baghdadi Jews''', also known as '''Indo-Iraqi Jews''', is the traditional name given to the former communities of Jewish migrants and their descendants from [[Baghdad]] and elsewhere in the [[Middle East]], who settled primarily in the ports and along the trade routes around the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[South China Sea]].

Beginning under the [[Mughal Empire]] in the 18th century, merchant traders from [[Baghdad]] and [[Aleppo]] established originally [[Judeo-Arabic]] speaking Jewish communities in the [[Indian Subcontinent]], then in a trading network across [[Asia]], following [[Mizrahi]] Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="auto10" /&gt; These flourished under the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century, growing to be [[English language|English]]-speaking and British oriented.&lt;ref name="auto10" /&gt;

These grew into a tight trading and kinship network across Asia with smaller Baghdadi communities being established beyond India in the mid-nineteenth century in [[Burma]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/calcutta "Calcutta"], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muzeon, Yisrael (1995). ''The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities.'' University Press of New England. p.74. {{ISBN|965-278-179-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdadi trading outposts were established across colonial Asia with families settling in [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Until the [[Second World War]], these communities attracted a modest flow of Jewish emigrants from [[Iraq]], with smaller numbers hailing from [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Yemen]], [[Iran]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The virtual Jewish world|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/India.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second World War]], brought strife to [[British India]], the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]], then swiftly the end of the [[British Empire]] in Asia. Dislocated by war, the violence of the [[Partition of British India]], rising nationalism and the uncertainty of independence in both [[India]] and [[Burma]], an exodus began to the newly founded state of [[Israel]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="auto10" /&gt; Their old trade routes severed by first [[Communist]] victory in [[China]], the ocean trade stifled in [[India]] and [[Burma]] by postcolonial nationalizations and trade restrictions, the Baghdadi Jewish had emigrated almost in their entirety by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/207414/the-rise-and-fall-of-calcutta-jews/ "The Rise and Fall of Calcutta Jews"], ''The Forward''&lt;/ref&gt; Families of Baghdadi Jewish descent  continue to play a major role in Jewish life, especially in [[Great Britain]] where families such as the [[Sassoon family|Sassoons]] and [[David and Simon Reuben|Reubens]] have enjoyed great prominence in business and politics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Charmed_Life_The_Phenomenal_World_of_Phi.html?id=mW38CQAAQBAJ|title=Charmed Life: The Phenomenal World of Philip Sassoon|last=Collins|first=Damian|date=2016-06-02|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-812761-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kahaljoseph.org/uploads/5/7/9/3/57931875/2016-05-14.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precolonial Origins ==

Though Jewish traders from the Middle East had crossed the [[Indian Ocean]] since [[ancient Rome]], sources from the [[Mughal Empire]] first mention Jewish merchants from [[Baghdad]] trading in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44144741?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Jewish Merchants in the Mughal Empire], Ishrat Ilam, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress
Vol. 65 (2004), pp. 267-276&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AMH-6945-KB Map of the Malabar Coast.jpg|thumb|Map of the Malabar Coast, circa 1672.]]

India was from unknown to the Jewish merchants of the [[Middle East]]. Since [[ancient Rome]] the caravan route from India] had ended in [[Aleppo]] and the spice trade had tied [[Basra]], [[Yemen]] and [[Cairo]] to the [[Malabar Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/In_an_antique_land.html?id=8vdxAAAAMAAJ “In Antique Land”], Amitav Ghosh, 1992, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was Persian-speaking Jewish merchants, close trading allies of the Jews of [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Aleppo]] Jews who first struck into the Indian heartland.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXQ6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1036|title=The Cambridge History of Judaism: Volume 7, The Early Modern World, 1500–1815|first1=Jonathan|last1=Karp|first2=Adam|last2=Sutcliffe|date=30 November 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As adventurers, mystics and merchants, they had been venturing to the Indian Subcontinent since the [[Middle Ages]] on the back of invasions of the subcontinent launched by Persian speaking rulers from what is now [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Both Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] sources record Jewish traders following the 16th century Mughal invasion of India launched by Emperor [[Babur]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

They rose to be traders and courtiers of the Mughals. Jewish advisors at the Court of [[Akbar]] the Great in [[Agra]] played a significant role in Akbar's liberal religious policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3622197|title=Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India|first=Walter J.|last=Fischel|date=21 July 2018|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=18|pages=137–177|via=JSTOR|doi=10.2307/3622197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Delhi]], the syncretic Jewish mystic Sarmad Khasani was tutor to the Crown Prince Dara Shikoh before both were executed by [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/220034/sarmad-naked-jewish-mystic|title=Sarmad the Magnificently Naked 17th-Century Jewish Mystic – Tablet Magazine|website=tabletmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were sufficient Jews in [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] lands for British travelers to report that synagogues had been established there, but of which no trace or Jewish record remains.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; These handful of Jews never established a permanent community but left legends and pathways for future settlers from
Arabic speaking lands.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org" /&gt;

[[File:Ralamb-74.jpg|thumb|A Jewish subject of the Ottoman Empire, 1657.]]

Records of Jewish tradesmen traveling from Baghdad can be found from the early 17th century. These trading outposts and emerging migrant communities also saw Jews become courtiers to [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl101.htm|title="The Last Jews in India and Burma" by Nathan Katz and Ellen S. Goldberg|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These merchants wandered widely across the subcontinent. Shalom Cohen, who would found the [[Calcutta]] community, was the court jeweller to the Nawab of [[Awadh]] and travelled to [[Punjab]] where he held the same title as the court of [[Ranjit Singh]] the leader of the [[Sikh Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishcalcutta.in/exhibits/show/imp_mem_com/sh_aaron_cohen&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen, the [[Calcutta]] community would later recall, was even given the honour of riding with the Nawab of [[Awadh]] in his personal elephant.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jewish_Encyclopedia.html?id=U7s5AQAAMAAJ|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|last=Singer|first=Isidore|last2=Adler|first2=Cyrus|date=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial Asia ==

As Jews, primarily from [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Aleppo]] came to India as traders in the wake of the Portuguese, Dutch and British what became known as the Baghdadi communities grew fast. By the middle of the 19th century trade between [[Baghdad]] and [[India]] was said to be entirely in Jewish hands.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, J. (1859). ''Eight Years in Asia and Africa: From 1846 to 1855. Published by the Author.'' p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a generation Baghdadi Jews had established manufacturing and commercial houses of fabulous wealth, most notably the Sassoon, Ezra, Elias, Belilios, Judah and Meyer families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl101.htm Lentin, Samuel Sifra (ed) Shalva Weil.

With the rise of British power in the Subcontinent, Surat declined in importance as British-controlled [[Calcutta]] and [[Bombay]] became more important in trade.&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com" /&gt;  Baghdadi settlement shifted first to [[Bombay]] and then principally to [[Calcutta]], then the capital of [[British India]] and the centre of the [[jute]], [[musil]], and [[opium]] trades.&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com" /&gt; Jewish merchants from [[Aleppo]], traditionally the end of the historic [[Convoy|caravan]] route from [[India]], played an important role in founding the [[Calcutta]] Jewish cemetery, which was opened in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rangandatta.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/jewish-cemetery-kolkata-calcutta/ "Jewish Cemetery in Kolkata/Calcutta"], Rangandatta blog&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2018}}

Spurred by the immigration of some the leading Jewish families of Baghdad fleeing the persecution of [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]], the first synagogue, replacing a small prayer room, was opened in 1823, and with the community expanding quickly a second followed in 1856. By the end of the 19th century, more than 1,800 Baghdadi Jews were living in [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com" /&gt; In 1884, a third synagogue, which was to be the largest in [[Asia]], was dedicated in [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/calcutta|title=Calcutta|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdadi Jews were also living and trading in [[Chinsurah|Chinsura]] and [[Chandannagar|Chandernagore]] outside Calcutta.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The rise of colonial [[Calcutta]] saw the rise of [[opium]] trade with [[China]]. British rule turned opium into a global commodity, establishing a monopoly over the sale of Indian opium in 1773, actively promoting its export, defying Chinese drug laws and fighting two wars to open the Chinese market.&lt;ref name="inflibnet.ac.in"&gt;http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/164753/9/09_chapter%205.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdadi Jewish merchants dominated the opium trade with a majority of opium chests auctioned from British authorities being exported to [[China]] by Baghdadi Jewish merchants, who competed with [[Marwari people|Marwari]] and [[Parsee]] merchants for the trade.&lt;ref name="inflibnet.ac.in" /&gt; The [[Sassoon family]] eventually controlled 70 percent of the opium trade from India.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Great fortunes were also made in the indigo, silk and muslin trade with [[Dhaka]] where Baghdadi Jews partnered with Bengali Muslim merchants.&lt;ref name="inflibnet.ac.in" /&gt;

Around these booming concerns, the Baghdadi Jewish communities of [[British India]] began to take shape, both seeking and attracting Jewish immigrants from across the [[Middle East]] to work for them.&lt;ref name="auto10" /&gt; Following the shift in the centre of British rule from [[Bombay]] to [[Bengal]] the Baghdadi community of [[Bombay]] initially lagged that emerging in [[Calcutta]]. This fortunes of the community were reversed when [[David Sassoon]] and his family arrived in 1833.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/mumbai-bombay|title=The Jewish Community of Mumbai-Bombay|website=Museum of The Jewish People – Beit Hatfutsot':'בית התפוצות - מוזיאון העם היהודי'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsored by the [[Sassoon family]], the first synagogue opened in 1861 and the second in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/mumbai|title=Mumbai|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct from [[Calcutta]], whose settlement was principally [[Iraqi Jews]] and [[Syrian Jews]], the Baghdadi Jewish community in [[Bombay]] drew significant Jewish immigration from Persian-speaking communities in  [[Afghanistan]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Iran]] as well Jewish families from [[Yemen]]. Jewish migrant were attracted from across the [[Middle East]] to work in the factories and business concerns of the [[Sassoon family]].&lt;ref name="bh.org.il" /&gt; Outside [[Mumbai|Bombay]] a Baghdadi community was established in [[Pune|Poona]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;where a synagogue, a school and hospital was established by [[David Sassoon]] by and for a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] printing press was in operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A Baghdadi presence is also recorded in [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Keneseth Eliyahu Synagogue of Bombay.jpg|thumb|Bombay Knesset Eliyahu synagogue, established 1882.]]

From British India, the community expanded to [[Burma]], and the ports of [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]]. These were established along the [[opium]] route that ran between [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR8|title=Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma|first=Ruth Fredman|last=Cernea|date=21 July 2018|publisher=Lexington Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Singapore]] the elders of the community were initially the sons of Ezekiel Judah of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/dsegal2k/docs/ben2/260?ff=true|title=EIGHT YEARSI NASIA AND AFRICAFROM 1846 TO 1855.|work=issuu|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the earliest [[Baghdad]]i Jew to settle in [[Burma]] was Azariah Samuel who arrived in the port of Sittwe on the [[Bay of Bengal]] in 1841.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR8&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time two brothers Judah and Abraham Raphael Ezekiel settled in [[Mandalay]] and worked as bookkeepers for the Burmese royal court.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt; From 1880 the community was permanently established, the trading success of other Baghdadi Jews in opium, teak, jute, and trading shops, attracted other Baghdadi Jews to [[Mandalay]] and communities sprang up in [[Rangoon]] and [[Pathein]].&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;

Following the ban on the opium trade in the early twentieth century Baghdadi Jewish merchants invested in cotton and jute products as staple exports.&lt;ref name="inflibnet.ac.in" /&gt; The sudden spike in demand for jute sandbags, building blocks for the trenches on the [[Western Front (World War I)]], made great fortunes amongst the Jewish merchants of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu6mLkpQVlUC&amp;pg=PA44|title=Icons of Indian Industry|publisher=Sura Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At their heights, the communities of [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]] were at the heart of a communal kinship network linked by the ports of the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[South China Sea]]. One observer described the Baghdadi Jews communities as being "almost as familiar with each other as the Jews of Manchester are with Liverpool."&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-V3nFZ5RkkC&amp;pg=PA63|title=Entrepreneurship and Religion|last=Dana|first=Léo-Paul|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84980-632-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engines of the Baghdadi Jewish trading network were tightly knit family firms such as [[David Sassoon]] and Co or the Meyer Brothers, founded by [[Manasseh Meyer|Sir Manasseh Meyer]], with offices and agents established by family members in the each port of the network.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;

Before [[World War Two]] there were upwards of 11,000 Baghdadi Jews in Asia.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC|title=Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma|first=Ruth Fredman|last=Cernea|date=21 July 2018|publisher=Lexington Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of war the Baghdadi population in [[Calcutta]] had reached 3500 and in [[Bombay]] 3000.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/the-last-jews-of-kolkata/|title=The Last Jews of Kolkata|first=Zach|last=Marks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the [[Bay of Bengal]] in [[Burma]], both [[Rangoon]] and [[Pathein]] elected Baghdadi Jewish mayors and the Baghdadi Jewish population peaked at 2500 Jews in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR8&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all the Baghadi Jewish communities of this era were permanently established with the [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]] speaking community in [[Sydney]] established by families fleeing [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]] disbanding its congregation in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Those communities established beyond [[British India]] by Baghdadi Jews flourished during the [[British Empire]] and peaked in population shortly before the [[Second World War]] at 1500 in Singapore, 1000 in [[Shanghai]], and 150 [[Hong Kong]] prior to the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="silverchair.com"&gt;https://watermark.silverchair.com/116-1-80.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaAwggGcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGNMIIBiQIBADCCAYIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMrpVcLFh7Y2IQz7mBAgEQgIIBU6h7O6rGVgLjC-k4iW9LsOUlrPLDqCUCPVXc-W7iqKJrvcr_Rr5Xvc-ZpMn2l57q7eTziqxg5JFidOF2Zgq7Jg_PLOui5Oxb9p4LUdlbeMqt7F0JKtz4UUNKpF2oCEJuzaHiAzmItLLI2_NW7kr6C4Hc6I2RWk2mlE9Enc2L0nvXQlFkblacEUYIYkBo22zmXVC4PspIRNpVhiiwNvbkUJiBOolJY8LzXUSeTC4PWTzFDkaR9o40LWYa1NvFqMfhZLln_W1yEEUE7WvIZk2VOsi7CVm6u4JWDkdleLPsfJUsAs7CyYq7FsUyuPFhBVUXN5-AqAkO77fJCKD-wA1kfKe8vLXIJjUrdSpAy7x2JXLYsVaqDFSguWo8jHyv6UlFB14kHbn7NnuIJ8kXcqNxNr0mWBo4kKzufN3eiKdZ-BKg4nhhEc4XmRRwyJtmTtmImHErzQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; The [[Singapore]] community flourished under the leadership of [[Manasseh Meyer|Sir Menasseh Meyer]] and the [[Hong Kong]] community under the influence of [[Emanuel Raphael Belilios|E.

Baghdadi outposts are also recorded as having been established in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and [[Tianjin|Tientsin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Whilst [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]] were the only Baghdadi settlements to genuinely grow into large communities, beyond a small trading outpost, tiny portside settlements existed in [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Japan]], as satellites of the stronger communities in [[India]], [[Burma]], [[Singapore]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCJNQPszu5sC&amp;pg=PA156|title=Youtai – Presence and Perception of Jews and Judaism in China|first=Peter|last=Kupfer|date=21 July 2018|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the route between [[British India]] and [[Singapore]], a tiny Baghdadi community was in [[Penang]], with a synagogue and Jewish cemetery, was established in the 1870s, but for most of its history never exceeded 50 families.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.penangjewishcemetery.com/uploads/4/5/1/2/4512650/the_penang_story.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Further south from [[Singapore]], in [[Indonesia]], then the [[Dutch East Indies]], a tiny Baghdadi community of spice merchants was established in [[Surabaya]] in [[Java]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JalrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30|title=Israel and China: From Silk Road to Innovation Highway|first1=L.|last1=Friedfeld|first2=Philippe|last2=Metoudi|date=31 July 2015|publisher=Partridge Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most far flung Baghdadi outposts, never numbering more than fifty families, were established in [[Japan]] at the furthest reaches of the opium route. Baghdadi Jews from [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]], initially drawn to man the concessions of [[David Sassoon]] established tiny footholds in [[Nagasaki]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Kobe]].&lt;ref name="stanford.edu" /&gt; The only Baghdadi synagogue in Japan, uniting small prayer groups, was Ohel Shelomoh opened by Jews from Aleppo in 1912.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xenon.stanford.edu/~tamar/Kobe/Kobe.html|title=The Jews of Kobe|website=xenon.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dangoor.com/TheScribe63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Initially established in [[Nagasaki]] and [[Yokohama]], the Baghdadi traders relocated to [[Kobe]], which became its focal point, after an earthquake in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JalrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT27|title=Israel and China: From Silk Road to Innovation Highway|first1=L.|last1=Friedfeld|first2=Philippe|last2=Metoudi|date=31 July 2015|publisher=Partridge Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As imperial jurisdictions consolidated, the Baghdadi Jews found themselves in a liminal situation in colonial [[Asia]]. They were considered neither Indian nor Western, brown nor white and partnered with both Western and Indian interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUi6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69|title=Beyond Strategies: Cultural Dynamics in Asian Connections: Cultural Dynamics|publisher= KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally they lived in limbo, their citizenship often unclear, having inherited what was an early modern political order.&lt;ref&gt;https://watermark.silverchair.com/116-1-80.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaAwggGcBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGNMIIBiQIBADCCAYIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMuXJKDMp26bW6utNSAgEQgIIBUy7qDRY6ihEXLksG2iqLwz7hh1WmY-eGnmXkm5AiHAFmGudewAMKUuFd6U5bY6lfgstXHWAYRfp7ajB8yr4P7C8qC0iP_gyHus2sFhk4PsQDUENJHBRKsbsrTwyjHVBc45lEgWpRZL8P6S__wVNeWbdvKSfD4HluOxT2kGaDVp7uc8dgM5c_RkVknYT5cHypGQNF3TBcgNr_5JQPjDCdeAkvjlvwU1xzxH10O8wpVrQiGxJZa8HkC5GTH1v8bbxKKOqRIE8fDkV1A4yV78I2OiizqTM11F_GPki2GVFdlFUP440CQFMSMrVqhmDIAqdU4escZaF1Ubs6unH5CNkAA8Z16-xaA8j-kdpPUqKSxFz6Cn2zh6AoU6ceaxRmdSSOygtBGJezPILqQZfO_LpOy0ptY1MzIdfGof-xsHgkMGErLertnohj1pSEXd3Ck2P1HBxecA&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[First World War]] the Baghdadi Jews were for the most part notionally subjects of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Starting from 1870 the communal leaders began aggressive lobbying with British colonial authorities to registered as white, British and European.&lt;ref name="silverchair.com" /&gt; This was never granted to them.&lt;ref name="silverchair.com" /&gt; Nor was admittance, with few exceptions, to the European only clubs that were the centre of life in the [[British Empire]]. Baghdadi Jews were denied access to European electoral rolls in India.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUi6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69|title=Beyond Strategies: Cultural Dynamics in Asian Connections: Cultural Dynamics in Asian Connections|first1=Ms Priya|last1=Singh|first2=Ms Suchandana|last2=Chatterjee|first3=Ms Anita|last3=Sengupta|date=15 January 2014|publisher=KW Publishers Pvt Ltd|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsiders, and insiders, they clung fiercely to their Jewish identity.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

Beyond [[British India]], Baghdadi Jews sought the legal status of French or [[British Protected Person]] in [[China]]. With few exceptions for the wealthiest individuals, this was routinely denied by British officials. Angst over their legal status grew in the run up to [[World War Two]].&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

As a result, the Baghdadi Jews were determined to prove themselves a loyalist community to British authorities throughout the colonial period. Baghdadi Jewish merchants operated as confidential agents of the [[East India Company]], offered aid to British civilians during the 1756 incident known as the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]], and like many foreign and [[Indian people|Indian]] merchants and [[maharajas]] made substantial donations to the British army during the so-called 1857 [[Indian Mutiny]].&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org" /&gt; [[God Save The Queen]], was sung in the honour of the far off imperial sovereign in the schools founded by [[David Sassoon]], who himself never spoke English.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR23|title=Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma|first=Ruth Fredman|last=Cernea|date=21 July 2018|publisher=Lexington Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

== Baghdadi Culture ==

The Baghdadi Jews, whilst spread across continents, operated a network of kinship and trust throughout the trading posts of the [[Indian Ocean]]. They were closely united by religious, language and family ties. Marriage, in particular, tied the Baghdadi communities together. Brides, and occasionally grooms, would be sent from one community to another. Business would often overlap with family ties, creating strong alliances. Synagogues, schools, and special funds, fastened a support networks sponsored by wealthy merchants. This kinship network meant [[Judeo-Arabic]] communities, typically established by fellow Jewish migrants from the same families and clans the [[Middle East]], which sprang up in [[Burma]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[China]], were tightly woven into the Baghdadi community.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

[[File:Twina.jpg|thumb|Rabbi Twena of Calcutta, 1885–1913.]]

The life of the Baghdadi kinship network on the opium route is best seen in the case of [[Sir Manasseh Meyer]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; He was born in [[Baghdad]] in 1846 and received his primary education of [[Calcutta]], his secondary education in [[Singapore]], before returning to [[Calcutta]] to learn bookkeeping and then moving to [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]], to established a small business. From there he returned to [[Singapore]], established an import-export business, based on an [[opium]] monopoly with India. He was [[knighted]] in 1906 for his services to [[Singapore]] having sponsored the building of two synagogues and large scale real estate construction. However, throughout all is movement, he remained firmly within a [[Judeo-Arabic]] speaking Baghdadi network.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

[[File:Maggid Mesharim (Calcutta).png|thumb|Maggid Mesharim, a Calcutta Judeo-Arabic newspaper, 1890–1901.]]

Within these Baghdadi communities, the majority were of [[Iraqi Jewish]] origin, but families from [[Syria]], [[Yemen]], [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and a handful of [[Sephardic Jews]] from [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] joined and assimilated into the Baghdadi community. For most, it was simply as eastern expansion to closely bound patterns of transnational Jewish kinship, trade and exchange that had existed for centuries, moved out of the [[Middle East]] and the [[Mediterranean]] into colonial Asia. Within the Middle Eastern Jewish world, the Baghdadi Jews were considered adventurers and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Quite unlike [[Ashkenazi Jews]] departing for [[America]], who were typically poor and scored by their religious elders for doing so, the Middle Eastern Jews who departed for India included some the leading Jewish families of [[Baghdad]], and were looked up as admired figures, patrons, and sponsors of religious life back in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/259539|title=Almost Englishmen: Baghdadi Jews in British Burma (review)|first=Shlomo|last=Deshen|date=21 July 2018|publisher=|journal=Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies|volume=26|issue=4|pages=192–194|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/sho.0.0213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Sassoon family]], which settled in [[Bombay]] no later than 1832, and the Judah family, which left for [[Calcutta]] in 1825, were seen as the leading  Jewish families of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSQzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|title=The New Babylonian Diaspora: The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Community in Iraq, 16th-20th Centuries C.E.|first=Zvi|last=Yehuda|date=28 August 2017|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iBBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|title=Modern Spain and the Sephardim: Legitimizing Identities|first=Maite|last=Ojeda-Mata|date=20 December 2017|publisher=Lexington Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezekiel Judah, who founded two synagogues in Calcutta, was a descendant of [[Solomon Ma'tuk]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_Jews_in_Baghdad.html?id=kjnkAAAACAAJ|title=History of the Jews in Baghdad|last=Sassoon|first=David|date=2006-11|publisher=Simon Wallenberg Press|isbn=978-1-84356-002-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These great Baghdadi Jewish fortunes are deceptive, however, when it comes to what life was like for the overwhelming majority of the community. Far from wealthy, they lived on the edge of [[poverty]], as peddlers, stall holders, mill workers, rickshaw men and other such jobs. The middle class Jews speculated in opium and acted as brokers.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Great distance existed between the leading Baghdadi Jewish families, such as the Ezra family and the [[Sassoon family]], who grew ever richer and more British-oriented during this period, and the rest of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3876534|title=From Orientals to Imagined Britons: Baghdadi Jews in Shanghai|first=Chiara|last=Betta|date=21 July 2018|publisher=|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=37|issue=4|pages=999–1023|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, the Baghdadi Jewish resembled an [[oligarchy]], with all power and authority to represent the community towards colonial authorities being vested in the leading families, as it had been traditionally in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt;

Initially the Baghdadi Jewish communities that developed in [[India]] retained close cultural and religious links to [[Baghdad]]. Intellectual life was strong enough in the mid to late-19th century to sustain a printed press in [[India]] of the [[Baghdad]] Jewish dialect of [[Judeo-Arabic]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=P1PoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|title=Who Needs Arab-Jewish Identity?: Interpellation, Exclusion, and Inessential Solidarities|first=Reuven|last=Snir|date=26 February 2015|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centered on [[Calcutta]] small Baghdadi Jewish publishing houses translated literary, historical, religious and anti-missionary tracts into [[Judeo-Arabic]] whilst religious texts were also printed in [[Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=qhKGPprbQaYC&amp;pg=PA42|title=The Jews of India: A Story of Three Communities|first=Muzeon|last=Yisrael|date=21 July 1995|publisher=UPNE|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdadi [[newspapers]] and periodicals in [[Judeo-Arabic]], with some [[Hebrew]] portions, were also published in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/mevasser-calcutta-SIM_0015210?s.num=94&amp;s.rows=50&amp;s.start=80|title=Mevasser (Calcutta)|first=Lital|last=Levy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Baghdadi printed press began in 1855: with the support of [[David Sassoon]] a periodical started in [[Bombay]] catering to the merchant elite of the community.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.pk" /&gt; This was joined by four other Baghdadi [[Judeo-Arabic]] [[newspapers]] and periodicals in [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.pk" /&gt; Novels and literature from the [[Europe]]an [[Zionist]] and [[Haskala]] movements were translated into [[Judeo-Arabic]] in [[Calcutta]]. At the turn of the 20th century, Jewish intellectual life in [[Calcutta]] appears to have waned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[File:Raphael Emanuel Belilios Vanity Fair 6 January 1910.jpg|thumb|Raphael Emanuel Belilios, born in Hong Kong and later established in Britain, 1881–1922.]]

In the 20th century [[Baghdad]] declined, and the [[United Kingdom|British Empire]] became more important to the Baghdadi Jews. The wealthier Baghdadis adopted European clothes and sought [[United Kingdom|British]] education for their children whilst the poorer Baghdadis, especially women, continued to wear Arabic dress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The rise in [[United Kingdom|British]] education and working in the British Empire resulted in Baghdadi Jews turning to [[English language|English]] as their first language, both for international trade and cultural prestige in [[India]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.pk"/&gt; In the 20th century the Baghdadi Jews wanted to assimilate into colonial [[Europe]]an society and be considered culturally and ethnically [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]. Aside for religious observances, the Baghdadi Jews began to adopt elements of Western European lifestyles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; But the Baghdadis remained marginal to colonial European society and were excluded for the duration of the [[British Raj|Raj]] from many social clubs that limited admission to [[Europeans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Such [[Westernization]] resulted in the closing of all [[Judeo-Arabic]] publications in India by the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.pk"/&gt; These were succeeded in [[Calcutta]] in the 1920s and 1940s by three [[English-language]] communal [[newspapers]] sympathetic to [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Whilst many of the wealthiest Baghdadi families remained aloof from [[Zionism]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, the community's middle class established [[Zionist]] associations in [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Religiously the Baghdadi Jews did not train their own [[rabbis]] but sought guidance and resolutions on matters of [[Jewish law]] from the rabbis of Baghdad, preserving the traditions and rituals of [[Iraqi Jews]].&lt;ref name="jewishcalcutta.in"&gt;http://www.jewishcalcutta.in/exhibits/show/imp_mem_com/hacham_twena&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sermons]] up until the [[First World War]] were given in [[Judeo-Arabic]], after which the use of [[English language|English]] became predominant.&lt;ref name="jewishcalcutta.in" /&gt; After the [[First World War]], the Baghdadi Jews began to refer their religious questions to the [[Sephardic]] Chief Rabbi in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com" /&gt; Rites concerning circumcision, betrothal, and protections of the newborn preserved Iraqi Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="myjewishlearning.com" /&gt; Baghdadi Jewish wedding celebrations gradually grew less Middle Eastern and more European in style in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcalcutta.in/exhibits/show/weddings/a-note-on-jewish-weddings "A Note on Jewish Weddings"], Jewish Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, the leading Baghdadi Jewish families set themselves up as sponsors of [[Mizrahi]] Jewish religious life in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="auto9" /&gt; Across [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]], schools, synagogues, yeshiva and charitable foundations were supported by Baghdadi Jewish merchants of [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="auto9" /&gt; Struggling communities across the [[Middle East]] sought the support of patrons in [[Asia]] such as when Moise Sassoon of [[Calcutta]] was called upon to by [[Lebanese Jews]] to sponsor the construction of the [[Magen Avraham Synagogue]] of [[Beirut]]. Almost all these works were destroyed after the starts or the [[Israeli-Arab]] conflict brought about the flight and expulsion of these ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Today only the [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem, founded by donations from the Baghdadi Jews of Calcutta, survives.

== Postcolonial Decline ==

As the [[Second World War]] saw most of the Baghdadi Jews of [[Burma]], as well as individual families from across [[Asia]], flee from the Japanese Occupation of [[Burma]] the Jewish population of [[Calcutta]], the heart of the Baghdadi network, swelled with refugees to over 5,000 strong.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; A small number of Jews fled the 1941 [[Farhud]] pogrom in Baghdad for [[Bombay]]. Even some of the leading Baghdadi Jewish families who had settled in Britain, chose to return to [[India]] as the [[Nazi Holocaust]] began the slaughter of European Jews. Despite [[India]] offering this place of refuge, the [[Second World War]] was the beginning of the end for old Baghdadi world.

The Japanese occupation of [[Burma]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]] saw much of the Baghdadi community interned by the Japanese army.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewsofjava.com/jewsofjava_recollections.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoPZu79hqaEC&amp;pg=PA1243|title=Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture|first=M. Avrum|last=Ehrlich|date=21 July 2018|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war ended, it was miraculously revealed to the rest of the Baghdadi world that in Japan itself, Rahmo Sassoon, leader of the tiny Baghdadi Jewish community of Kobe, had skillfully negotiated with Japanese authorities to ensure no Jews were harmed during [[World War Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcckobe.org/Rahmo_Sassoon.html|title=Rahmo_Sassoon – Jewish Community of Kansai      (Kobe City,  Japan)|website=jcckobe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the one Baghdadi synagogue of Japan, in Kobe was burnt down during an American air raid.&lt;ref name="stanford.edu" /&gt;

At the heart of the Baghdadi world, in India, the end of the war ushered in the implosion of the old order. At this point, ethnic strife, political violence and fear of civil war were widespread in India on the eve of [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian Independence]]. The violent explosion of killings and refugees following the [[Partition of India]] exacerbated the Baghdadi fears for the future.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org" /&gt; Dislocated by war, with many fearing India and Burma would become [[communist]] or hostile to business not in Indian hands or Burmese hands once the British left, the Baghdadi community began to leave Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/a-childhood-passage-to-israel-for-baghdadi-jews-of-india/|title=A Childhood Passage to Israel for Baghdadi Jews of India|first=Debra|last=Kamin|publisher=|type=Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the [[Middle East]] the establishment of the state of [[Israel]] and the outbreak of the [[Israeli-Arab conflict]] saw the start of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim lands]]. In [[Iraq]], pushed by official intimidation persecution, almost the entirety of the ancient [[Iraqi Jewish]] community had left for Israel by 1950.&lt;ref name="auto9" /&gt;

[[File:David Sassoon tomb.jpg|thumb|David Sassoon tomb in Pune, India.]]

First the leading families, then the rest of the community began to emigrate on mass. This began a continuous exodus from [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]]. The wealthier followed the path of the [[Sassoon family]] to [[United Kingdom|Britain]], whilst the poorer were drawn to the new state of [[Israel]] or the easing of immigration restrictions in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishcalcutta.in|title=Recalling Jewish Calcutta|website=jewishcalcutta.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bombay]] and [[Calcutta]] were the heart of the Baghdadi world, the centers of trade, culture and communal life. Once these had fallen into decline, the outlying communities followed.

Postwar the imperial system and open borders that had made the transnational Baghdadi world possible disappeared. In [[Shanghai]], communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 closed the trading links community depended upon. Those that has fled the Japanese occupation chose not to return. By 1950, the community had all but vanished. Meanwhile, In [[Hong Kong]], despite the benign conditions of [[British rule]], emigration saw Baghdadi Jewish numbers fall to less than 70 by the 1960s.

In [[Burma]], independence in 1947 similarly imposed trade barrier and a nationalistic regime in which the Baghdadi Jews felt they had little place.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;  In [[Singapore]], with trade to [[China]], [[India]] and [[Burma]] blocked, and the Jewish community had shrunk to as low as 180 by the 1960s.

A final wave of emigration, pushing the much reduced communities in [[India]] and [[Burma]] to virtual extinction, was triggered by a wave of hard left [[nationalizations]] and trade restrictions in India and Burma in the 1960s. Elections in [[West Bengal]] saw a government dominated by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] take power in [[Calcutta]] in 1967. Nationalizations of legacy firms from British rule and currency restrictions saw a choking of economic life and the Baghdadi community shrink from 500 to under 100 by the 1970s.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt; Meanwhile, [[nationalizations]] in Burma the 1960s saw the closing of synagogues and the last Rabbi leaving the country in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR8 In Burma, both [[Rangoon]] and [[Pathein]] both elected Baghdadi Jewish mayors and the population peaked at 2500 Jews in the 1930s. https://books.google.com/books?id=PVCzxtaSCXAC&amp;pg=PR8&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this precipitous decline and dispersal of the Baghdadi Jewish communities, a handful of individual Baghdadi Jews would play pivotal roles in Asia's newly independent states. The first [[First Minister]] of [[Singapore]] [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]] was a Baghdadi Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-1908-iraqi-jew-who-would-lead-singapore-is-born-1.5335846|title=This Day in Jewish History 1908: The Iraqi Jew Who Would Lead Singapore Is Born|first=David B.|last=Green|date=12 March 2015|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, Lieutenant General [[J. F. R. Jacob]], a Baghdadi Jew from Calcutta, won national fame as Major General and chief of staff of the Indian army that defeated the [[Pakistan Army]] in [[East Pakistan]] in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971, later serving as governor of the Indian states of [[Goa]] and [[Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-sum-of-his-many-parts|title=The Sum of His Many Parts|website=OPEN Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baghdadi community, however, never saw their exodus as a tragedy. Memoirs written by Baghdadi Jewish authors spoke fondly [[Burma]], [[Singapore]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]] and of the fact in [[India]] they had never experienced [[antisemitism]], which was viewed as a unique treasure.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_banks_of_the_Ganga.html?id=TaZtAAAAMAAJ|title=On the banks of the Ganga: the sojourn of Jews in Calcutta|first=Ezekiel N.|last=Musleah|date=21 July 1975|publisher=Christopher Pub. House|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network of Baghdadi Jewish schools, both English, Jewish and aspirational in orientation had primed them for life in Britain or Israel, not in [[postcolonial]] [[Asia]]. Rather that focus on what pushed, these memoirs focus on what pulled the Baghdadi Jews to leave [[Asia]], chiefly a sense that the opportunities that had drawn their ancestors there had dried up, and new glittering prizes lay in the West.&lt;ref name="auto10" /&gt;

In the early twenty first century the Baghdadi communities of [[India]] and [[Burma]] are at the point of disappearing completely. However small Baghdadi communities of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] have endured and Baghdadi synagogues still operate in both cities, though now greatly outnumbered in both by Jews from especially the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] draw to business in contemporary [[Asia]].

Today synagogues and associations upholding Baghdadi Jewish traditions exist in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. But in the historic Baghdadi communities in Asia only the synagogues originally founded by Baghdadi Jews in both [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] continue to operate regular services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohelleah.org/ols/about/our-history/ "About Our History"], Ohealleah&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singaporejews.com/|title=HOME|website=singaporejews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families of Baghdadi Jewish descent continue to play a major role in Jewish life particularly in [[Great Britain]], to which the leading families were draw after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Established in London, the [[Sassoon family]] enjoyed the friendship of Edward VII, established a [[baronet]]cy and saw [[Philip Sassoon|Philip Sasson]] became a minister.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Meanwhile, other Baghdadi families such as the [[David and Simon Reuben|Reubens]] have played major role in British business whilst others have gained notable prominence in arts and journalism, such as [[Gerry Judah]] and [[Tim Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jewish-artist-gerry-judah-and-the-st-paul-s-crucifix-1.54346|title=Jewish artist Gerry Judah and the St Paul’s crucifix|website=thejc.com|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cuisine ==
Traditional Baghdadi Jewish cuisine is a hybrid cuisine, with many [[Arab]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] and Indian influences.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Judy and John Cooper. "The Life-Cycle of Baghdadi Jews of India", in ''India's Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle'', (ed) Shalva Weil,  Mumbai: Marg Publications [first published in 2002; 3rd edn.], 2009. pp. 100-109.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous Baghdadi dishes include beef [[curry]], Baghdadi [[biryani]] and Baghdadi Jewish [[paratha]]s. A Baghdadi version of [[tandoori chicken]] is also popular (using lemon juice to cook the chicken instead of the cream used in the usual Indian recipe). Other Baghdadi Jewish communities in Southeast Asia mixed their original Iraqi Jewish dishes with influences from the local cuisine.

The '''Bhambi Khalpa''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]]. They are a sub-group within the [[Bhambi]] community. The Khalpa have [[scheduled caste]] status.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 159 to 162 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The name Khalpa has been derived from the word khal, which is the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] word which means the carcass of a dead animal. They are said to be a sub-division of the [[Chamar]] community. The Khalpa are a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 159 to 162 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present circumstances ==

The Khalpa are an endogamous community, and practice clan exogamy. Historically, they used to intermarry with the [[Bhambi Rohit]], but this has been discontinued. Their main clans are the Chauhan, Parmar, Katariya, Goel, Solanki and Kothari. Historically, the Khalpa were tanners and shoemakers, but like other artisan communities are abandoning their traditional occupation. Many are now employed as wage labourers. A small number are now small and medium-sized peasant cultivators.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One edited by R.B Lal, S.V Padmanabham &amp; A Mohideen page 162 to 166 Popular Prakashan&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Buddhist Library-Singapore.jpg|250px|thumb|The Buddhist Library at 2 Lorong 24A Geylang Road, Singapore]]
'''The Buddhist Library''' ({{zh|s=佛教图书馆}}) is the first dedicated [[Buddhist]] library in [[:Singapore]]. The library, which is located in a [[shophouse]] in [[Geylang]], aims to meet the needs of the Buddhist community and anyone interested in Buddhism. It is unique in that it is not a voluntary association or a temple and because it takes a non-[[sectarian]] approach to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Ong"&gt;Ong, "New Buddhist Organisations", pp. 140—141.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides functioning as a lending library, it also organises [[Dhamma]] talks, accredited Buddhist courses, public art exhibitions and welfare work locally and abroad.

==History==
In 1981, [[Venerable (Buddhism)|Venerable]] Dhammaratana, a Sri Lankan [[Theravadin]] monk, founded the Buddhist Research Society (BRS) in Singapore. One of the aims of the BRS was to set up a Buddhist library. The Library was started in 1982 in a rented unit of Tanjong Katong Complex. Its initial setup was backed financially by the late George Chia Soon Seng, who was a businessman and a devout Buddhist.&lt;ref name="Ong"/&gt; The Library shifted to Katong Shopping Centre in 1984 and moved again to another rented unit in Hoa Nam Building in 1985. The Library finally bought its own premises at Lorong 29, [[Geylang Road]] in 1991 and it was officially opened on 15 March 1992. Due to the growing needs of its expanding membership and the Buddhist community, the Library relocated to nearby Lorong 24A in 1998, occupying 2 units of a row of pre-war shophouses that are located within the Geylang Conservation Area, where it stands today.

===Founder===
Venerable Dhammaratana, or more commonly addressed as ''Bhante'' by his devotees ([[Pali]] for "Venerable sir"; often used when addressing a Buddhist monk), is the founding and pivotal figure of ''The Buddhist Library''. Bhante was born in Sri Lanka and received his Buddhist ordination at the age of 13. He is the senior pupil of the late Venerable Bellanwila Sri Somaratana Nayaka Thera and a graduate of Vidyalankara University.&lt;ref name="Bhante"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.buddhlib.org.sg/founder.htm | title = Bhante's background | accessdate = 2007-08-06 | publisher = The Buddhist Library | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070810023113/http://www.buddhlib.org.sg/founder.htm | archivedate = 10 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, Bhante served as the Deputy Principal and Principal at two prestigious Buddhist schools, Sunethradevi Pirivena and Paramadhamma Chetiya Pirivena respectively.&lt;ref name="Bhante"/&gt;

In 1973, he gave up a ready-made life of an abbot in the well-established Bellanwila Temple located near [[Colombo]] in Sri Lanka to propagate the Buddha's teachings in Singapore at the invitation of Venerable M. Mahavihara.&lt;ref name="Bhante"/&gt; In 1978, Bhante started his Buddhist education service in Singapore in a garage at 85A [[Marine Parade Road]]. He founded the Buddhist Research Society (BRS) in 1981 and ''The Buddhist Library'' in 1982. On his inspiration on starting a non-profit library, Bhante said:

{{blockquote|To start a Buddhist library in Singapore is better than to start ten temples. Knowledge can be passed down from one generation to another. In the long run, education contributes towards fostering a caring and sharing society with less social ills... With a vision for the future, we started, on a modest scale, to build a library of Buddhist literature covering all three major schools of Buddhism – [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]]. We made this the nucleus and around it we built various affiliated activities to promote the learning and practice of the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble teachings]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Bhante"/&gt; }}

In 1999, Bhante founded a [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] retreat centre, the Paramita International Buddhist Centre, located at Kadugannawa, Sri Lanka with the assistance of Buddhist devotees from Singapore. In 2003, Bhante obtained his [[Master of Philosophy]] Degree from Kelaniya University, Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Bhante"/&gt; In December 2004, the Bhante was officially appointed the ''Chief [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] Nayaka'' of Singapore by The Buddhist Sangha Council of Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Research Society, ''The Path of Joy'', No. 3 (Singapore, 2002). pp. 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and management==
The Library is managed by a 14-member Management Committee that comprises lay Buddhist scholars and senior volunteers of the Buddhist Research Society with Bhante as their Religious Advisor. Bhante's vision is that one day ''The Buddhist Library'' would earn international recognition as a Buddhist centre of excellence. Its facilities and programmes are:&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.buddhlib.org.sg/facilities.htm | title = Our Facilities | accessdate = 2007-08-06 | publisher = The Buddhist Library | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070707223904/http://www.buddhlib.org.sg/facilities.htm | archivedate = 7 July 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The library===
The Library houses over 16,000 books in English and Chinese covering various aspects of Buddhism, including scriptural texts, doctrine, philosophy, ethics, meditation, devotion, art and architecture. The Library has a sizeable collection of books on related subjects, including other major world religions, [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and Western philosophy, comparative religion, psychology and ecology. The Library's book collection keeps growing through the generous donation of members and devotees.

''The Buddhist Library'' first started conducting courses in the basic doctrines of Buddhism and then graduated to providing more advanced courses (up to Masters level awarded by Sri Lankan Buddhist authorities), both of which have helped to extend the horizon of Dhamma knowledge of those who are interested in learning Buddhism. ''The Buddhist Library'' has periodically been receiving distinguished Buddhist monks and scholars from various countries to deliver lectures and participate in seminars. Its resources are widely referenced by researchers and notable universities such as Duke University Libraries as part of their undergraduate level teaching and research on Southeast Asian studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.duke.edu/ias/SEAsia/ | title = Southeast Asian Studies Resources and Information | accessdate = 2007-08-07 | publisher = Duke University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shrine Hall, with a seating capacity for 100, is where devotional services or [[Puja (Buddhism)|Puja]]s are held regularly and on [[Buddhist festival]]s led by Bhante. Despite his advanced age, he also performs blessing services, such as housewarming ceremonies, wedding services, birthday blessings, hospital visits and wake services as requested by members of the Library and their families. The hall also doubles up as an auditorium where Dhamma talks and seminars are held.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

The Art Gallery displays a collection of contemporary Buddhist paintings, [[Tibet]]an [[thangka]]s and sculptures to promote awareness and appreciation of Buddhist Art. One of the main highlights at the gallery is the facsimile of the Buddha's footprint, an intricate work of art from Sri Lanka. The gallery is also used for Puja during festivals, meditation sessions and [[Sūtra|Sutta]] chanting practices. The Meditation Room is at the attic level of ''The Buddhist Library''. Buddhist meditation or ''[[Bhavana]]'' in Pali, is a core mental development practice that is embedded in the Buddha's teaching and has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ultimate aim. The room is also used for its Sunday Dhamma classes for children and youth.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

===Welfare work===
Despite its modest resources, the volunteers and supporters of ''The Buddhist Library'' regularly organise charitable activities for the needy regardless of their race or religion. Examples include annual charity funfairs,&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddhist Library Newsletter''. Issue 21, January— March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; visits to local old folks' homes,&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddhist Library Newsletter''. Issue 22, April—June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; efforts to assist victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and donation of used spectacles to old folks' homes in Sri Lanka in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddhist Library Newsletter''. Issue 14, April—June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhist influences on print technology''' in [[East Asia]] are far-reaching.  The history of writing in Asia dates back to the 13th century BC.  China used bones and shells for religious inscriptions in the form of divinations.&lt;ref name="Tsien" &gt;{{cite book
  |author=[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]
  |title=Written on Bamboo &amp; Silk: The Beginnings of Chinese Books &amp; Inscriptions
  |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |location=Chicago
  |year=2004
  |pages=201
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these beginnings, numerous forms of writing and printing were developed.  In many instances, as in [[Europe]], it was religion that played a major role in the development of writing and printing techniques or which was the reason behind the usage of these techniques. Of the religions in East Asia, it was [[Buddhism]] that played the strongest role in influencing writing and, in particular, printing. There were other factors that influenced the creation of manuscript and print culture, but Buddhism had the largest influence in spreading the usage of print technology, which in turn led to an increase in the dissemination of secular printing and literacy as well as wielding an important influence on economics, government, and competing religions/philosophies.

== Brief survey of writing &amp; printing in early China ==
The earliest known writing in [[China]] are inscriptions on bones and shells which were used for divination for approximately three centuries until the late 11th century BC. Inscriptions can also be found on bronze, [[jade]], stone, and pottery. [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze]] was developed as a permanent record of socio-political and ceremonial information in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Stone, on the other hand, is the only permanent method used continuously from ancient times to present. Also, stone was used extensively for inscriptions on monuments and for the preservation of [[Confucian]], Buddhist, and [[Taoist]] texts. Clay inscriptions flourished from the 4th or 5th century BC until the early 4th century AD.  These inscriptions were primarily records of names, titles, and phrases such as good luck sayings.&lt;ref name="Tsien" /&gt;(201)

[[History of silk|Silk]] was also used for the recording of information starting in the 7th or 6th century BC.  The predecessors to paper-based books in China were strips and tablets made of [[bamboo]] or wood, which were bound by cords and used much like books are today. This method of transmission of information was in use at the same time as the usage of bronze and the other methods.  Bamboo and wood was used for approximately three centuries more than paper and silk was in use for some 500 years longer than paper.  These methods were favoured by tradition and also had some advantages over paper. 
 
A less expensive alternative was developed, a form of paper made from a refuse fiber called [[zhi]]. This paper was developed before the Christian era and became commonplace in the 1st or 2nd century AD for books and other documents, but the other methods of recording information  continued.  Paper books were originally in the form of rolls, then folded leaves, and finally bound volumes like the books in use today.

There were various methods for the production of early Chinese records. Bone and stone media were engraved or incised with a metal stylus or knife.  Wood, bamboo, silk, and paper was written on with brush-pens; the ink was black; usage of ink dates to [[Neolithic China]].  [[stylus|Styli]] were also used and were made of bamboo, wood, horn, and metal, but it is not known when the stylus first came into common usage. Book knives were used as erasers for bamboo and wood tablets but not for inscriptions.  Inscriptions on bronze were [[casting|cast]] from molds. Inscriptions on clay were made by molds or were impressed with stamps. [[Seal (duplicate)|Seals]] were used to produce duplicates on soft clays and later on silk and paper. These seals were cast from metals or cut from [[jade]] or stone. Before the invention of woodblock printing, inked impressions from stone or other inscriptions would be made by rubbing or squeezing paper over their surfaces.  This technique was used up to the early 6th century and led to the invention of printing. Moveable type was invented in China some 400 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s press.  (1, 202-203)

== Buddhism and printing in China ==
The period following the collapse of the [[Han empire|Han]] (220 AD) is known as (one of the many) “Dark Ages” and was typified by political strife, wars, and social upheaval.  Despite the turmoil of that period, learning and culture continued to grow. Among the intellectual elite and rulership, Confucianism continued to be the dominant philosophy. Taoism and Buddhism emerged as religions and began to flourish.

Buddhism, a populist religion, had been introduced to China at the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and quickly became a religion sought after in times of strife by the masses where it was propagated. The first translation of a Buddhist text appeared in China in the 2nd century AD and by the 3rd century the volume of translations had increased a great deal.  Buddhism’s influence on literature and scholarship grew in relation to the conversion of the elite and ruler ship.  (17)

During the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 AD), Buddhism enjoyed an explosion in the production of printed texts.  This is partly due to the reunification of the empire and partly because [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that all Buddhist texts then in print were to be copied and placed in temple libraries in all the major cities.  Another factor that influenced this increase in printing was the creation of a bureau in 606 AD for the translation of Buddhist texts &lt;!--from what language to what language? --&gt; at the behest of [[Emperor Yang]].  To illustrate this diffusion of Buddhist texts, the History of the Sui Dynasty’s bibliography lists 1950 Buddhist titles as compared to 377 Taoist titles.

Buddhism was, therefore, probably the most important factor in the development of printing. The demand for Buddhist texts was so great that it encouraged accelerated levels of printing for the following century. Despite the increased demand for Buddhist literature, the production of books by hand did not end.  Printing only increased the number of copies of books, thus facilitating the ease and degree of communication.  (18, 205)

As Confucianism was the major competing native belief set among the elite, the reason that Buddhist texts enjoyed such widespread printing needs explanation.&lt;ref name="Mair" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mair suggests that perhaps there is something inherent in Buddhism that is conducive to its being written in what he calls “vernacular Sinitic” as opposed to the “literary Sinitic” used for native Chinese texts.  One aspect of Buddhism that Mair cites is the notion of [[upaya]], known as fang-pien in Chinese; followers of the Buddha should do whatever is in their power to do to insure the salvation of all living things.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713) This would certainly help explain why Buddhist texts would be printed and circulated in a written language that is more accessible to a wider audience. Another point Mair makes is that lecture notes for sermons by laymen and monks were written in the vernacular language.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This makes sense considering that these notes were to be spoken from; one would not make notes for a sermon in a stilted and highly literary language.  Other Buddhist texts such as [[parable]]s were popular with the masses and so when written, the vernacular is the clear choice.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

Another inherent trait that Mair cites is the ostensibly oral nature of Buddhism and how the religion stresses that “…Buddha is beyond the ‘paths of speech’” and “…’the way of language is cut off, the workings of the mind are obliterated’….” (Ibid.)  Mair also writes:
: “Even the Zen masters, whose words are ironically preserved in written vernacular (perhaps one should say, especially the Zen masters),…’nonestablishment of written words’ (pu li wen-tzu), which disparages the efficacy of language, especially in its written form, to convey essential truths.”  &lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713-714)

Despite this, even Buddhism could not survive and function as a religion without sacred texts.  Many Buddhist texts begin with the phrase evam me sutam (ju shih wo wen, “thus I have heard”).  Buddhist texts also make use of other expressions such as fo shuo (“spoken by the Buddha”). Mair points out that this underlines the direct oral transmission of Buddha’s teachings to the community through Ananda.  So, these phrases are a stamp of authenticity for the text, even when a text did not originate in India.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714)  Given this oral nature of Buddhism, it makes sense that its texts would be rendered in vernacular rather than literary Chinese.

The strongest explanation for the use of vernacular, and by extension the rapid spread of Buddhism and its influence on print culture, is the process by which Buddhism was introduced to China.  Mair argues that the process of translation was what influenced the use of vernacular in Chinese Buddhist texts. Commerce also played a strong role, but this will be discussed later.  It was foreigners that began the process of translation into Chinese (“…the early impetus for the translation of Buddhist texts into [[Sinitic]] came primarily from foreign monks resident in China.”)&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714-715, 717)  What Mair calls “literary Sinitic” is an extremely difficult language to learn, “…requiring at least ten to fifteen years to gain a modicum of proficiency.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(716)  These foreign translators were adults when they came to China and most likely learned spoken Chinese through immersion in the culture before learning how to write the language.  When it came time to write, they used the language they knew which was the vernacular.  Also, when it was Chinese Buddhists working on writing a text, they worked in teams with other Chinese dictating their translations.  Obviously since literary Chinese is unspeakable, the dictation was done in the vernacular. (Ibid.)

The above argument is the strongest for what might be called the mechanical process for the rapid spread of Buddhism and the vast amount of texts available (and the rise in the use of printing) to a wider audience.  What is also a very important aspect in the spread of Buddhism and its influence on printing is the ideological aspects of Buddhism.  As opposed to the native Chinese religions/philosophies, Buddhism is a populist religion.  As Mair writes:  “…Buddhism functioned (and perhaps originated) as a means for the individual to escape from the normal societal bonds.” (719)  Buddhism appealed to the dispossessed, those that were outside the Confucian institutions.  Because Confucianism stressed a rigid social order, many people found themselves stuck in a social position they could not escape from.

The Buddhist community in China consisted of, for example, a large number of widows, orphans, and others that had no place in the fabric of Confucian society.  Literary Chinese was associated with the elite; those that could afford to attend the bureaucratic schools for example.  Buddhism aggressively pursued the conversion of followers and to move into a new area such as China&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721), it makes sense that Buddhism would make use of the vernacular in its texts; it was more accessible to the masses.  Because of this accessibility there was an increased demand for texts and thus the rise in printing.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(720)

Mair cites Daniel Gardner and his work on [[Neo-Confucianism]].  It seems that the vernacular was employed in Neo-Confucian texts because of its: 
: “…more inquisitive approach it permitted toward the classics…Considering the powerful influence of Buddhism
on the formation of Neo-Confucian thought and practice, the adoption of the written vernacular as a legitimate form of serious intellectual discussion would seem to be one more example of the radical restructuring of Confucianism brought about by this foreign religion.” (Ibid.)

So, not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also it also influenced society at large in adapting to the norms of Buddhist thought.  These influences were manifested in literature, philosophy, government, etc.  As Mair writes, “…may be analyzed sociolinguistically as emanating from the fundamentally demotic impulses of the religion."&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721)

== Buddhism and printing in Korea ==
The story of printing in [[Korea]] is slightly different from in China, but Buddhism did play an important role in the development of printing.  Just as in China and Japan, [[woodblock printing]] was the primary technique used for printing, but a scarcity of resources needed for the production of woodblocks in Korea created a need for the invention of an alternative, which was moveable type. Korea was in the unique position among Asian countries of having an [[Korean alphabet|alphabet]] that facilitated the use of moveable type. This is not to say that woodblocks were not used.  Once [[moveable type]] came into use, Korea was no longer quite as dependent on China for texts.

Sometime in the 4th century the Chinese educational system was introduced to what was then the [[Koguryo state]]. A [[civil service examination system]] was established in [[Silla]] after the Korean states consolidated in the 7th century.  As the power of the government grew, demand for books from China increased.  Korea began to print its own texts and books from woodblocks in the 10th century.  Prior to 1056 Korea was mainly a manuscript culture.  Complaints from a provincial capital spurred the government to order copies from the royal collection to be printed. Newly carved woodblocks were sent from the provinces to the royal library, which spurred the production of more woodblocks.&lt;ref name="Sohn" &gt;{{cite journal

  |doi=10.2307/595851
}}&lt;/ref&gt;(97)

Other than the perceived (and possibly true) unreliability of manuscript copies, religion provided an additional stimulus for the printing of texts from woodblocks, just as in the other countries of East Asia.  A large scale carving of woodblocks for the purpose of printing the [[Tripitaka]] was undertaken starting sometime around 1014.  During the last twenty odd years of the 11th century, more Tripitaka woodblocks were carved, in addition to woodblocks for other Chinese Buddhist works.  The demand for Buddhist texts, as well as Confucian texts, grew in the following years.  Most of these were subsequently destroyed during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

At the time, Korea was rather zealous in its attempts to acquire Buddhist (and other) texts and utilized whatever means it could to acquire texts.  In addition to trade with [[Song dynasty|Song]] China, Korea bought books from private markets (once again, commerce and Buddhism will be discussed later).  The zealousness Korea had to acquire Buddhist texts also provided an impetus for the printing of texts.  By the end of the 11th century Korea had better copies of common texts as well as rare copies of certain editions.  Previously the flow of books was mainly from China to Korea, but in 1091 China asked Korea for 117 books that no longer existed in China’s libraries, a situation similar to that in Europe a few centuries earlier where Ireland had preserved Christian texts no longer in existence on the continent.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This illustrates the strong role that Buddhism played in printing.  Buddhism provided the stimulus to keep as many texts in print as possible.  When these texts were lost in China, Korea proved to be an important repository of Buddhist literature due to its commitment to the printing of Buddhist texts.

Buddhism also played a role in the development of moveable type. Religion was not the only contributing factor in Korea’s development of moveable type.  First, the Song dynasty (which was apparently the only source outside of Korea for books) fled south after the Chin invasion in 1127. Second, many of Korea’s libraries were destroyed resulting in the loss of many texts and woodblocks during a power struggle in the royal court.  Thirdly, the scarcity of hardwoods used in the production of woodblocks in Korea contributed to the need for a more readily made printing source. Pine was the most common wood available in Korea at the time, but is not a good source for woodblocks.  There was birch, but these trees were not common and were to be found mostly on mountainous terrain making it difficult to get to and expensive to transport. (98)

The Koreans at that time were most likely already aware of moveable type as it had already been invented in China. In China, moveable type was made from baked clay, but the Koreans improved upon this by making cast-type.  Metal casting existed in Korea, but with the introduction of a new method of coin casting from China in 1102, Korea finally had the technology to create an effective method of printing using moveable type.  This method of casting came in the form of carving two molds that were joined together with the liquid metal presumably being poured into the hollow thus created. (98-100)  So with the zealous desire for Buddhist texts, the scarcity of resources for woodblock production, the introduction of new technology, and the cessation of trade with China, Korea was able to continue to print Buddhist texts.

There are other examples of how Buddhism stimulated printing in Korea. Despite the difficulties the [[Mongol]] invasion presented, printing of texts continued.  While in exile on [[Kangwha Island]], the [[Goryeo#Mongol invasions .281231 - 1350.29|Koryo]] government re-carved a woodblock edition of a Buddhist text crucial to the [[Son sect]] that had become scarce. Sohn also suggests that the invention of moveable type was due to the general scarcity of books after 1127 but before the Mongol invasion.  Sohn mentions that there was an urgent need for these texts. (98)  What he does not mention, and I would suggest, is that moveable type was used because it would have taken too long to re-carve the woodblocks.  Thus moveable type was utilized to meet the urgent demand for the texts.

There is more evidence for the influence that Buddhism had on the printing of texts.  In 1446, King Sejong introduced the Hunmin chong um, a text that introduced the new system for writing vernacular Korean.  In the preface to this text, there is a line (“Even the sound of the winds, the cry of the crane, the cackle of fowl and the barking of dogs – all may be written” [Mair, 733]) that is derived from a Sung scholar (Cheng Ch’iao) that “praises the phonological sophistication of the Buddhist monks.”  The fact that Sejong was a devout Buddhist could possibly also be seen as evidence of the Buddhist influence on printing. All but two of the earliest texts using Sejong’s Hunmin chong um were Buddhist texts.  Also, Hunmin chong um is based partly on Phags-pa that can be traced back to Srong-brtsan-sgam-po, the king who introduced Buddhism to [[Tibet]].  “The Buddhist impetus, in turn, carried through to King Sejong’s Hunmin chong um.” (731, 734)   This illustrates that not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also on language reform, which in turn further influenced printing.  With the introduction of Hunmin chong um, printing using moveable type in Korea became much more practical.

There are a number of differences between China and Korea which rendered moveable type easier for Korea than China. First, China did not have a script reform that made the use of moveable type more practical as in Korea.  The large number of characters used in written Chinese posed a great challenge to the use of moveable type. Instead of making type for every character all at once, why not make new type as it was needed?  In this way a gradual shift to moveable type printing could have been accomplished. Second, the historical record shows that in China there was a preference for that which was already established and familiar (e.g. the preference of bamboo/wood books over the usage of paper books). Chinese moveable type was made from baked clay, rendering it breakable.

== Buddhism and printing in Japan ==
Little is known about the techniques and procedures used for woodblock printing before 1600 in [[Japan]]; printing and publishing in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period became more commercialized and thus there is more information about it.&lt;ref name="Kornicki" &gt;Kornicki, Peter. The Book in Japan:  A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century.  Brill, Leiden, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;(47)

First a manuscript is passed to a copyist and a clean copy (''hanshita'') is written out.  Sometimes a [[calligrapher]] would be employed to make a copy when quality calligraphy was desired, although the author often prepared the copy.  Second, the hanshita was given to the block-carver who pasted the hanshita face down onto a wooden block and carved away the white parts leaving the text, illustrations, and borders in relief.  Third, the block was passed to the printer who inked the block, laid a sheet of paper on it, and then rubbed the paper to make the impression.  Sometimes a printing was made for the purpose of proofreading but this seems to have been rather rare.  It is not clear how much proofreading was done but it was done for the more important texts. (52)  Fourth, when enough copies were printed they were passed to someone who aligned the pages.  Lastly, a cover was made and the book was finally bound. (47, 48)

The reproduction of texts was done by the technique called ''[[kabusebori]]''.  Reproduction was an unstable process.  Copies would be made from earlier editions of the text by using the text itself as the hanshita.  The woodblock resulting from this technique of duplication was similar but not an exact replica.  This method was used during the Muromachi period to reproduce Chinese texts and also when a popular text needed to be reprinted but the original woodblocks were worn down, damaged, or lost. (49)  This method was also used when particular pages of a text needed to be replaced such as when some woodblocks were more worn than others or when a family or business needed to update its directories. (52)

Umeki was another technique used to make corrections to a text to avoid censorship or when mistakes were made during the carving process.  A portion of the woodblock would be carved out and removed, then replaced with the corrected text on a portion of wood measuring the same dimensions as that which had been removed. (52)

Print technology was introduced to Japan in the 8th century but it took approximately 1000 years for Japan to become a print culture when printing had finally become commercialized. (112)  Initially printing in Japan was a ritual exercise for the production of devotional texts and it was not until the 11th century that texts were printed for the purpose of reading.  This was much the case in China although calendars and Buddhist texts had been printed for reading for quite some time.  Therefore, printing reached Japan from China in the form of a ritual practice. (113)

The only surviving evidence of printing from the 8th century Japan comes from Nara in the form of the [[Hyakumanto Dharani]]. (115) The Hyakumanto Dharani are slips of paper with Buddhist text printed on them installed in miniature pagoda that were placed at various locations in Nara.  They were apparently made to atone for a rebellion that took place 746.  The rebellion was in response to the growing influence Buddhism had in the Japanese court; a Buddhist monk, Dokyo, had been able to have himself appointed to the position of Chancellor of the Realm.  The interference in courtly matters by the Buddhist clergy led to much resentment and Fujiwara no Nakamaro led a rebellion against Dokyo.  The ex-Empress Shotoku ordered the printing of one million charms to appease the Buddhist monks and temples, although it is unclear whether this order was fully carried out.&lt;ref name="Hickman" &gt;Hickman, Brian.  “A Note on the Hyakumanto Dharani.” Monumenta Nipponica, vol. 30, no. 1, (Spring, 1975), 87-93&lt;/ref&gt;(87-88)  Very few of the dharani survived to this day.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;(89)  Hyakumanto dharani represent the earliest existing proof (from Japan) that Buddhism was an influence on printing in East Asia.

[[Inbutsu]], religious stamps depicting the Buddha, were common in pre-Heian times and continued to be made through the Heian period.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"/&gt;(117)  Further evidence of printing in the Heian period comes in the form of books and other texts imported from China by Japanese monks returning to Japan from China and Chinese monks and travelers.  Devotional printing was common in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan.  Fujiwara no Michinaga’s diary (1009 AD) mentions that 1000 copies of the “[[Lotus Sutra]]” were commissioned but none of these survive. It seems that the paper that these devotional texts were printed on was of poor quality and this explains why so few of them exist to this day.  The reason for printing these devotional texts lay in the meritorious act of reproducing sacred texts, not in the reading of them.  Therefore, there was no concern for the fate of the texts after being printed since the act of printing them was what brought about merit. (118)  As described above, Buddhist influence on printing in Japan was initially for gaining merit with the Buddha and great effort was put into printing texts for this reason.  Because Japan during the Nara and Heian periods was primarily a manuscript culture and texts for reading were hand copied, Buddhism’s influence on print had yet to exhibit the influence it did in China.

Practical printing can be dated to the 11th century, during the Heian era when Chinese texts from the [[Song dynasty]] became popular in Japan in the form of commentaries on [[Sūtra|sutras]] and doctrines. [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] became the center of non-devotional printing in Heian Japan and the oldest existing example of this kind is the [[Joyuishikiron]] (a Buddhist text in Chinese) of 1088 printed by the monks of the [[Kofukuji temple]]. [[Kyoto]] became the center of devotional printing because this is where the aristocratic sponsorship for such printing existed. (118-119)

During the [[Kamakura period]] printing became more established and began to shift its emphasis from devotional printing to practical printing.  Inbutsu continued to be produced but their production began to expand to more populist images such as the Amida Buddha and Jizo.  The Kofukuji was important in the shift to practical printing as well as other temples such as Todaiji, Daianji, and Saidaiji.  The monasteries of [[Mt. Koya]] also began printing texts of the Shingon sect, continuously printing up to the 19th century.  It was during the Kamakura period that Kyoto began to be a center of printing.  The 13th-century temple Sen’yuji was one of the most prominent.  Its founder, Shunjo, had brought back books from China and reproduced them using the kabusebori technique.  Texts from Song editions relating to monastic discipline were also printed. Kyoto temples also began printing Pure Land Sect texts during the Kamakura period but the location and dates of production is unknown. (119-121)

It is from the [[Pure Land Sect]] that the first book printed in Japanese, the Kurodani shonin gotoroku (1321), originates. It is most likely due to the populist nature of the Pure Land Sect that this text was printed in Japanese.  It was a collection of sayings by the sect’s founder Honen (1133–1212).  It was printed in hiragana with kanji glossed with furigana.  Later in the 14th century more of Honen’s works were printed.  The Pure Land Sect was one of the first Buddhist sects responsible for reaching out to a general audience through the print medium in the Kamakura period. (121)

[[Zen]] sects had the largest influence on printing during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.  Texts came from five monasteries in [[Kyoto]] and five in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and later other Zen temples began to print texts.  It was with the Zen-printed texts that an educational element began to enter into the act of printing.  These texts were reproductions of Zen master sayings intended for the training of novices and disseminating the teachings to lay persons.  Devotionals were still printed but when Zen monasteries printed devotional texts it was at the behest of sponsors rather than the monasteries themselves. (121-122)

Gozan-ban (the name given to texts printed by Zen sects) were for the most part written by Chinese authors but some were by Japanese authors (monks).  They were also kabusebori editions so they looked like Chinese editions.  Chinese monks also assisted in the printing of Gozan-ban.  Eight Chinese monks had traveled to Kyoto in the 14th century (1367) and these monks were mostly block-carvers and printers employed by the Japanese monks and temples.  Some texts, though, were printed at the expense of the Chinese monks.  Most of the Gozan-ban were Zen and other Buddhist texts but some were secular texts of Chinese origin.  It was in the 14th century that the first non-Buddhist texts were printed.  By the 16th century a large number of secular Chinese texts had been printed by Zen temples.  It would seem then that the Zen monks were the custodians of Chinese culture in Japan. (122)

From the 14th to 16th century secular texts are divided into three categories:  1) canonical texts, 2) dictionaries and other sinological reference texts, and 3) poetic texts.  The first secular Chinese text to be printed was [[Confucius]]’ [[Analects]], printed in Sakai in 1364 with commentaries by the third century scholar He Yan.  In 1528, some Chinese medical texts were printed.  Not all the secular texts were printed by Zen monks, but one quarter of the Gozan-ban were secular texts and printed in Japan for the first time.  The Zen monks' interest in secular Chinese literature resulted in much of the Chinese poetry and Confucian literature printed. (123)

By the 16th Century printing was well established but had yet to become commercial.  Prior to this, the printing of books for reading was done primarily by Buddhist monasteries and monks and were mostly Buddhist texts in the original Chinese.  These books may have been made available for sale.  Little is known how the books were circulated before the Tokugawa era. (124-125)

Buddhism influenced both printing and reading.  The earliest references to reading in Japan relates to Buddhist texts. (251) There is a question regarding “reading” because at first Buddhist texts were printed as a meritorious act and “reading” was secondary.  Buddhist texts were studied and there was a ritualized reading of them.  When discussing reading of the sutras and other tests, “reading” takes a number of forms:  silent vs. chanted, individual vs. mass/group.  During the Nara and Heian periods, there was a number of public readings of Buddhist texts for devotional and other religious reasons. (252)

Buddhism played a large role in literacy during the Nara and Heian periods.  Because Buddhism was a scriptural religion, literacy in Chinese was required because texts available to the Japanese were printed in Chinese. During the Heian period it was men who were for the most part literate in Chinese (most likely the “literary Sinetic” that Mair refers to) but there is proof that some women were literate in Chinese as well. After the Heian period Buddhism remained a text-based religion and it was the Zen monks were particularly interested in secular Chinese texts. The literacy in Chinese that was thought to be so important during the Nara and Heian periods became less stringent during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Literacy gave way to the Sino-Japanese kanbun. The literate were most likely to be found in the Zen monasteries during these periods. (270-271) Literacy began to rise during the Tokugawa period as a result of printing becoming commercialized and the Tokugawa bureaucracy had become dependent on printed and written communications among the various government offices in the capital and provinces. (272-273)

So from the Nara period on, literacy in Chinese was important for the Japanese bureaucracy, but more important for the reproduction of Buddhist texts and the production of commentaries on Buddhist texts.  In the 7th and 8th Centuries the greatest efforts at manuscript and printed text (by extension) production was for the copying of Buddhist texts.  There is evidence that the entire Buddhist canon existent in Japan had been copied by 673.  By 700 there was a large number of Buddhist temples and monasteries that required texts.  By 727 the government had established a sutra scriptorium (the Shakyojo) in Nara that was the center of sutra-copying.  It did not survive the move to Heian-kyo.   The number of surviving printed Buddhist texts, as opposed to printed secular texts, helps to illustrate the influence Buddhism had on printing. (91)

== Commerce and Buddhism ==
Buddhism and commerce were also tied closely together.  The two stimulated each other in a cyclical fashion such that, among other things, printing was influenced to a large degree.

The official histories of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian societies largely neglected to record a number of commercial enterprises that the elite (bureaucracy) were not directly involved with.  The elite (bureaucracy) was only concerned with official missions and held an elitist view regarding the merchants and other commoners that partook in trade with neighboring societies and cultures, which contributes to the manner in which Buddhism was able to infiltrate these societies.  Buddhism followed the same routes the merchants used. As Buddhism spread, so did the demand for religious artifacts and literature. Buddhism also stimulated religious pilgrimages which in turn stimulated trade.  These factors stimulated the growth of local economies and the production of artifacts and the printing of religious texts. This all often went unnoticed by the elite who would otherwise have been vehemently opposed to the spread of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" &gt;Holcombe, Charles.  “Trade-Buddhism:  Maritime Trade, Immigration, and the Buddhist	Landfall in Early Japan.”  Journal of the American Oriental Society.  vol. 119, no.	2, (Apr.-June 1999), 280-292. (pages 280-281)&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the stimulation of commerce and travel, Buddhism assisted trade by providing a social lubricant.  As Holcombe states, “The Buddhist spirit minimized regional differences.”&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(283)  Because of its universalistic philosophy, followers of the religion from different cultures who behaved differently, looked different, and so on, were still able to engage in commerce because they held a common faith.  This in turn helped to propel the spread of Buddhism to other regions.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(282-283)

Buddhist missionaries would accompany private trading caravans and sailing vessels along established trade routes into regions that were untouched by Buddhism.  Sometimes those missionaries would settle in these regions and establish schools/missions or, during the voyage, would convert merchants and traders who would in turn settle in these new regions, raising families, and assisting in the dissemination of the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(285)  Sometimes this immigration was accidental, as in the case with Japan. At the time sailing between Japan, China, and Korea was a dangerous affair, so it is understandable that many of these “immigrants” would opt to remain in Japan (or wherever it was they landed), as happened with ten Paekche monks blown off course as they were sailing to China. The elite, for the most part, ignored travelers that were not members of official missions so it is plausible that the number of immigrants such as the Paekche monks was much higher than the official immigrant count indicates.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(288-289)

Commerce and trade facilitated the spread of Buddhism to new regions and with it the spread of Buddhist texts which stimulated the growth of printing industries.  The extensive book trade between Sung China and Korea as well as the employment of Chinese monks by Japanese temples and monasteries was a common practice.  It is very important to keep in mind the role commerce played in the printing of Buddhist texts.

== Conclusion ==
As mentioned above, the Japanese case provides the best example of how Buddhism influenced printing.  In China the religion was a populist one, which actively sought out those that were marginalized by Confucian society.  Korea had a voracious appetite for Buddhist texts and the combination of the scarcity of resources for woodblock printing as well as the Mongol invasions stimulated the use of new printing technologies.  As Mair writes, “There is little doubt that printing in East Asia, from its inception, was primarily a Buddhist phenomenon.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(736)  Buddhism, being a universalistic and populist religion, as well as its zealous conversion of the common person to its faith, was able to utilize print technology like no other religion at the time was able to.  The ostensibly oral origins of the religion allowed Buddhism to utilize vernacular language in the printed form to reach a much wider audience than Confucianism, Taoism, or other religions.  So in this way Buddhism was able to wield an influence on print technology that was unknown before its introduction to East Asia.

In [[Sikhism]], cannabis is generally prohibited, as are tobacco and alcohol. However, some Sikhs particularly of the [[Nihang]] community use edible cannabis in a religious context. 

==Prohibition==
The first Sikh guru, [[Guru Nanak]], stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction from God. Guru Nanak was offered ''[[bhang]]'' by the Mughal emperor [[Babur]]; Nanak however declined, and recited this [[shabda|shabad]]:

{{Cannabis sidebar}}

'''''Cannabis indica''''', formally known as '''''Cannabis sativa'' forma ''indica''''',{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} is an annual plant in the [[Cannabaceae]] family. It is a putative species of the genus ''[[Cannabis]]''.  Whether it and ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' are truly separate species is a matter of debate. Many uses come from ''Cannabis indica,'' such as extraction, cultivation, cloth from the fibers, medical uses, and a plant. ''Cannabis indica'' produces large amounts of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo74072/marijuana-concentrates.pdf|title=Marijuana Concentrates|publisher=Drug Enforcement Agency|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large amounts of THC makes it most commonly used as a drug, whether it be for recreational or medical purposes.

==Taxonomy==
In 1785, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] published a description of a second species of ''Cannabis'', which he named ''Cannabis indica''. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. [[Richard Evans Schultes]] described ''C.&amp;nbsp;indica'' as relatively short, conical, and densely branched, whereas ''C. sativa'' was described as tall and laxly branched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richard Evans Schultes |author-link=Richard Evans Schultes |author2=William M.

Because of the often harsh and variable (extremely cold winters, and warm summers) climate of those parts, ''C. indica'' is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marijuana-seeds.nl/blog/how-to-grow-marijuana-in-sub-tropical-and-temperate-climates|title=How to Grow Marijuana in Sub-tropical and Temperate Climates|date=2017-05-09|work=MSNL Blog|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
[[File:New born Cannabis plant.jpg|thumb|Newly grown ''C. indica'']]
Broad-leafed ''Cannabis indica'' plants in [[South Asia]] are traditionally cultivated for the production of [[charas]], a form of [[hashish]]. Pharmacologically, ''C.&amp;nbsp;indica'' [[landrace]]s tend to have a less THC content than ''C.&amp;nbsp;sativa'' [[Marijuana strains|strains]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischedick|first1=Justin Thomas|last2=Hazekamp|first2=Arno|last3=Erkelens|first3=Tjalling|last4=Choi|first4=Young Hae|last5=Verpoorte|first5=Rob|title=Metabolic fingerprinting of Cannabis sativa L., cannabinoids and terpenoids for chemotaxonomic and drug standardization purposes|journal=Phytochemistry|date=December 2010|volume=71|issue=17–18|pages=2058–2073|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.10.001|pmid=21040939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hillig"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Karl W.

===Difference between ''C. indica'' and ''C. sativa''===

There are several key differences between ''Cannabis indica'' and ''Cannabis sativa''. These include height and stature, internodal length, leaf size and structure, buds size and density, flowering time, odour, smoke and effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indica vs Sativa – Differences|url=http://freedomseeds.com/blog/2014/09/indica-vs-sativa|website=Freedom Seeds}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indica'' plants tend to grow shorter and bushier than the sativa plants. Indica strains tend to have wide, short leaves with short wide blades, whereas sativa strains have long leaves with thin long blades. The buds of indica strains tend to be wide, dense and bulky, while sativa strains are likely to be long, sausage shaped flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ed|first1=Rosenthal|title=Marijuana Grower's Handbook|date=2010|publisher=Quick American Publishing|location=Oakland, California|isbn=978-0-932551-46-7|page=40|edition=Ask}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, ''Cannabis indica'' has lower levels of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] compared to [[Cannabidiol|CBD]], whereas ''Cannabis sativa'' has higher levels of THC to CBD.&lt;ref name="Hillig" /&gt; However, huge variability exists within either species. A 2015 study shows the average THC content of the most popular herbal cannabis products in the Netherlands has decreased slightly since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niesink RJ, Rigter S, Koeter MW, Brunt TM |title=Potency trends of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and cannabinol in cannabis in the Netherlands: 2005-15 |journal=Addiction |volume=110 |issue=12 |pages=1941–50 |year=2015 |doi=10.1111/add.13082 |pmid=26234170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent era of cannabis breeding higher-ratio CBD strains are being developed from Indica origins that may test out as 1:1 (CBD-THC balanced) or even as high as a 22:1 (CBD dominant). The medical interests in Cannabis are taking this further and we will see increasing cultivation trends for more strains developed with CBD-dominant ratios. In California, cities such as Coachella and Desert Hot Springs are re-zoning areas for cannabis cultivation. Even though Californians legalized recreational use of cannabis in late 2016, the LA Times, prior to the vote, reported an entrepreneurial focus on CBD-dominant medical hemp crops, "The demand for medical products was so high, this [{{convert|380,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} cultivation expansion] was just to fill the need for that."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-marijuana-cultivation-20160510-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Low anxiety and hallucinogenic properties (psychoactive effects of THC reduced by CBD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21749363 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01238.x | volume=163 | title=Taming THC: potential cannabis synergy and phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effects | pmc=3165946 | year=2011 | journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. | pages=1344–64 | last1 = Russo | first1 = EB}}&lt;/ref&gt; make these "high-CBD strains" very desirable for chronic treatment programs.

There are three chemotaxonomic types of ''Cannabis'': one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, and one that is an intermediate between the two.&lt;ref name="Hillig" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischedick"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischedick|first1=Justin Thomas|last2=Hazekamp|first2=Arno|last3=Erkelens|first3=Tjalling|last4=Choi|first4=Young Hae|last5=Verpoorte|first5=Rob|title=Metabolic fingerprinting of Cannabis indica L., cannabinoids and terpenoids for chemotaxonomic and drug standardization purposes|journal=Phytochemistry|date=December 2010|volume=71|issue=17–18|pages=2058–2073|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.10.001|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003194221000381X#|accessdate=28 May 2015|pmid=21040939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannabis strains with CBD:THC ratios above 5:2 are likely to be more relaxing and produce less [[anxiety]] than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's [[Receptor antagonist|antagonistic]] effects at the [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, compared to THC's [[partial agonist]] effect.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}{{Dubious|date=December 2016}} CBD is also a [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] ([[serotonin]]) agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic-content effect.&lt;ref name="Joy-Watson-Benson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing The Science Base |author1=J.E.

Users can expect a more vivid and uplifting high, while ''indica'' is well known for its sedative effects which some prefer for night time use. Indica possesses a more calming, soothing, and numbing experience in which can be used to relax or relieve pain. Both types are used as  [[medical cannabis]].

During the 1970s, ''Cannabis indica'' strains from Afghanistan and Hindu Kush were brought to the United States, where the first hybrids with ''Cannabis sativa'' plants from equatorial areas were developed, widely spreading marijuana cultivation throughout the States.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Flowers, ''Marijuana flower forcing'', Quick American Archives, 1997, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants with elevated levels of propyl cannabinoids, including [[tetrahydrocannabivarin]] (THCV), have been found in populations of Cannabis indica from China, India, Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as southern and western Africa. THCV levels up to 53.7% of total cannabinoids have been reported&lt;ref name="Hillig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Hadley | first2 = K.W. | last3 = Fetterman | first3 = P. | year = 1973 | title = Constituents of Cannabis Sativa L., VI: Propyl Homologues in Samples of Known Geographical Origin | url = | journal = J.

[[File:ChlorisPrimavera.jpg|thumb|250px|right| "As she talks, her lips breathe spring roses: I was Chloris, who am now called Flora." [[Ovid]]]]
In [[Greek mythology]], the name '''Chloris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔər|ᵻ|s}}; Greek Χλωρίς ''Khlōris'', from χλωρός ''khlōros'', meaning "greenish-yellow", "pale green", "pale", "pallid", or "fresh") appears in a variety of contexts. Some clearly refer to different characters; other stories may refer to the same Chloris, but disagree on details.

==Chloris, the Nymph==
Chloris was a [[Nymph]] who was associated with spring, flowers and new growth, believed to have dwelt in the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]]. Myths had it that she was abducted by [[Zephyrus]], the god of the west wind (which, as Ovid himself points out, was a parallel to the story of his brother [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Oreithyia]]), who transformed her into a deity known as [[Flora]] after they were married. Together, they have a son, named [[Karpos]].  She was also thought to have been responsible for the transformations of [[Adonis]], [[Attis]], [[Krokus (mythology)|Crocus]], [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinthus]] and [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] into flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', 5. 195 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKhloris.html Theoi.com - Chloris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chloris, wife of Neleus==
Chloris is the daughter of a different [[Amphion]] (himself son of [[Iasus]], king of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''Odyssey'', 11. 284: "the youngest daughter"; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 9. 36. 8; cf. also [[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 8. 3. 19&lt;/ref&gt; by "[[Persephone]], daughter of [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]]" {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on ''Odyssey'', 11. 281, citing [[Pherecydes of Leros|Pherecydes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chloris was said to have married [[Neleus]] and become queen in [[Pylos]]. It is, however, not always clear whether she or the below Chloris is mentioned in this role. 

Chloris and Zephyr had twelve sons including [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], [[Alastor]] and [[Chromius]] - named in Book 11 of the Odyssey - a daughter [[Pero]]. Chloris also gave birth to [[Periclymenus]] while married to Neleus, though by some accounts Periclymenus's father was [[Poseidon]] (who was himself Neleus's father as well). Poseidon gave Periclymenus the ability to transform into any animal. Other children include Taurus, [[Asterion|Asterius]], Pylaon, [[Deimachus (mythology)|Deimachus]], [[Eurybius]], Phrasius, Eurymenes, Evagoras and Epilaus (or Epileon).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'', 1. 9. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that Chloris was mother only of three of Neleus' sons (Nestor, Periclymenus and Chromius), whereas the rest were his children by different women,&lt;ref&gt;Aristarchus in [[scholia]] on ''[[Iliad]]'', 11. 692; [[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1. 152 — apparently following ''Odyssey'' 11. 285, where only Nestor, Chromius and Periclymenus are enumerated&lt;/ref&gt; but other accounts explicitly disagree with the statement.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca'' 1. 9. 9; [[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 68. 6; [[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Odysseus]] is said to have encountered Chloris on his journey to [[Hades]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', 11, 281-296&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias describes a painting by [[Polygnotus]] of Chloris among other notable women in the underworld, leaning against the knees of her friend [[Thyia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 10. 29. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chloris, the Niobid==
[[Meliboea]] was one of [[Niobe]] and [[Amphion]]'s fourteen children (the [[Niobids]]), and the only one (or one of two) spared when [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]] killed the Niobids in retribution for Niobe's insult to their mother [[Leto]], bragging that she had many children and Leto had only two. Meliboea was so frightened by the ordeal, she turned permanently pale, changing her name to Chloris ("pale one").&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''Bibliotheca'', 3. 5. 6, referring to [[Telesilla]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Chiliades'', 4. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias mentioned a statue of Chloris near the sanctuary of [[Leto]] in [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 2. 21. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In another version, she is a daughter of [[Teiresias]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Pindar]], Nemean Ode 9. 57; in scholia on [[Euripides]], ''[[Phoenician Women]]'', 834 were mentioned the names of her mother (Xanthe?), herself and her two siblings, but the text is badly corrupt.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chloris, mother of Mopsus==
Chloris, daughter of [[Orchomenus (mythology)|Orchomenus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 881&lt;/ref&gt; married the seer [[Ampyx]] (son of [[Elatus]]), with whom she had a child [[Mopsus]] who also became a renowned seer and would later join the [[Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Argonautica Orphica]]'' calls her by a different name, [[Aregonis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Argonautica Orphica'', 126&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eustathius''' or '''Eustace of Mtskheta''' (Evstat'i Mtskhet'eli; {{lang-ka|ევსტათი მცხეთელი}}) (died [[circa|c.]] 550) is an [[Orthodox Christian]] [[saint]], executed for his apostasy from [[Zoroastrianism]] by the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] military authorities in [[Sasanian Iberia|Caucasian Iberia]] ([[Kartli]], eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). His story is related in the anonymous 6th-century Georgian [[hagiography|hagiographic]] novel ''The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta''.

One of the earliest extant works of the Georgian literature, ''The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta'' (მარტჳლობაჲ და მოთმინებაჲ წმიდისა ევსტათი მცხეთელისაჲ) was written by an anonymous author later in the 6th century, within thirty years of Eustathius' reported death. The morphology of the work as well as some theological phrases also supports this dating, although the earliest surviving manuscript dates from c. 1000 ([[Georgian National Center of Manuscripts]], MSS H-341). The text is also interesting for the first Georgian formulation of the [[Ten Commandments]], an account of the life of [[Jesus]] which recalls [[Tatian]]'s ''[[Diatessaron]]'' (a [[Gospel harmony]] of the 2nd century), and traces of influence of the 2nd century [[Apology of Aristides]]. ''The Passion'' was first published by [[Mikhail Sabinin]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', pp. 44-45. [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eustathius is reported by the hagiographer to have been an Iranian cobbler originally called Gvirobandak, son of a high-ranking Zoroastrian priest ([[magi]]), from [[Ganzak]]. Having converted to Christianity, he flees persecution to Georgia ([[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]), then under the Iranian military authority, in 541. He settles at the Christian town of [[Mtskheta]] and marries a Christian woman. The local Iranian cobblers’ guild denounces Eustathius to the [[marzban]] [[Arvand Gushnasp]] with seven other converts to be judged. Arvand punishes the apostates by having their noses pierced and casts them in prison under sentence of death. Six months later, Arvand releases them, however, as a farewell gesture to the local people, when recalled from Georgia by the king [[Khosrau I]]. Four years later, under the new marzban [[Vezhan Buzmihr]], Eustathius is rearrested, but reaffirms his faith before the court in a speech of some 3,000 words that makes up nearly half ''the Passion''. Eventually, the marzban, albeit reluctant, has him beheaded in [[Tbilisi]]. The remains of Eustathius were taken to Mtskheta and buried at its [[Svetitskhoveli|principal church]].&lt;ref name="Rayfield"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1976), ''Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints'', pp. 95-99.

The '''Foreign Office papal visit memo''' was an incident that occurred in the [[United Kingdom]] in April 2010, after it was revealed that two [[Foreign Office]] civil servants working on preparing the [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|State Visit]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2010 had sent out an internal memo containing remarks that could be considered insults to the Pope. The incident received wide media coverage and speculation that the Pope might cancel the state visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/offensive-condom-memo-threatens-popes-uk-visit-2152410.html|title=Offensive condom memo threatens Pope's UK visit|authors=Gordon Rayner and Nick Pisa|date=26 April 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican subsequently confirmed that it will be going ahead with the planned visit.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8643370.stm|title=Leaked FCO memo 'will not affect Pope visit'|date=26 April 2010|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo suggested that Pope Benedict XVI, during his visit, could launch a range of branded condoms, visit an abortion clinic, bless a gay marriage and apologise for the [[Spanish Armada]].&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8642404.stm|title=Foreign Office apologises for Pope 'condom' memo|date=25 April 2010|work=BBC News Online|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover note to the memo read "Please protect; these should not be shared externally. The 'ideal visit' paper in particular was the product of a brainstorm which took into account even the most far-fetched of ideas." &lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;

The civil servants alleged to be responsible for sending the memo were identified as Steven Mulvain, 23, the memo's main author, and Anjoum Noorani, 31, who authorised its circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/steven-mulvain-wouldve-lost-job-217212 | location=| work=mirror.co.uk | first1=| last1=| first2=| last2= | title = Steven Mulvain would’ve lost his job if he’d penned a similar Downing Street memo about a leading Imam or Hindu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2947230/The-Pope-dope-keeps-his-job.html|location=London|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|first1=Ryan|last1=Sabey|first2=Nick|last2=Parker|title=The Pope dope keeps his job|dead-url=yes|access-date=19 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206193848/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2947230/The-Pope-dope-keeps-his-job.html#|archive-date=6 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7636736/Diplomat-disciplined-over-Pope-memo-is-named.html|title=Diplomat disciplined over Pope memo is named|last=Rayner|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that others were part of the team who drew up this memo. According to ''The Times'', Steven Mulvain once described his hobby as "drinking a lot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7108217.ece|title=Oxford graduate Steven Mulvain, 23, sent 'puerile' Pope visit memo|last=Sugden|first=Joanna|date=26 April 2010|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foreign Secretary, [[David Miliband]], stated that he was "appalled" by the memo, and the British government apologised to the Pope and the Catholic Church, stating that the memo writer has been told orally and in writing that this was a serious error of judgment, adding that "this is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect UK government or Foreign Office policy or views. Many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged, naïve and disrespectful" and that "the Foreign Office very much regrets this incident and is deeply sorry for the offence which it has caused".&lt;ref name="reuters1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63N1VG20100424|title=Britain apologises over papal "condoms" document|last=Holden|first=Michael|date=24 April 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Secretary [[Jim Murphy]] added: "These memos are vile, they're insulting, they're an embarrassment and, on behalf of, I think, the whole of the United Kingdom, I want to apologise to His Holiness the Pope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/2010/04/27/civil-servant-who-sent-vile-email-about-the-pope-s-visit-to-uk-is-named-and-shamed-but-keeps-his-job-86908-22215370/|title=Civil servant who sent 'vile' email about the Pope's visit to UK is named and shamed.. but keeps his job|last=Mackinnon|first=Lachlan|date=27 April 2010|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British ambassador to the Vatican, Francis Campbell, met senior officials of the Holy See to express regret on behalf of the government&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

''Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib''' ({{lang-pa|ਗੁਰਦੁਆਰਾ ਗੁਰੂਸਰ ਸਾਹਿਬ ਲੱਲ ਕਲਾਂ ( ਲੁਧਿ: ) ਪਾਤਸ਼ਾਹੀ ਛੇਵੀਂ ਅਤੇ ਪਾਤਸ਼ਾਹੀ ਦਸਵੀਂ}}) - a shrine which commemorates  visit of  Guru Hargobind Sahib and Guru Gobind Singh. Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib is located in village Lal Kalan (Ldh), Lal Kalan is a village near Neelon Bridge, Sirhind Canal ; on Chandigarh-Ludhiana Road.[[Gurudwara]] Sahib, inside a walled compound has an octagonal shaped room, with the sanctum in the middle.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Over the sanctum on the first floor there is a low domed room built in the same style. At Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib there is Sarovar, Beri Sahib and Barota Sahib with their own importance.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

== History of Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib ==

=== Guru Hargobind Sahib ===
[[File:Hargobind Sahib Ji Gurusar Sahib.jpg|thumbnail]]
[[Guru Hargobind|Guru Hargobind Sahib]]- (True Emperor") the sixth guru of Sikhism came here on 19 Faghan 1675.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; Guru Sahib had 7 cannons and 1100 horse riders ; 52 kings with them, whom were released with a special apron having 52 strings (known as 52 Kalian wala Jaaman) attached to it worn by Guru Hargobind Sahib. At this place, all of the kings asked for Guru Hargobind Sahib permission to leave and Guru told them to leave and take their responsibility. But one king (Hast Lal) from all of them, thought in his mind to get married in this village only. Guru Hargobind Sahib after knowing his mind's thought, asked 'sangat' if anyone wishes to marry his daughter. Then One Ramdasia Sikh from village Lal Kalan was ready to marry her daughter and seeking permission from Guru Sahib. Guru Hargobind Sahib performed  'Anand karj' of King Hast Lal and daughter of Ramdasia Sikh with their own hands. After marriage Guru Sahib told King Hast Lal, that he can't stay in this village as he was now son-in-law of this village, so King Hast Lal stayed in village Balala (2&amp;nbsp;km from Lal kalan) and he was famous with name 'Baba Hast Lal'.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

=== Guru Gobind Singh ===
[[Guru Gobind Singh]] - the tenth guru of sikhism came here on 11 Poh 1761. Guru Gobind Singh along with Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh, Bhai Maan Singh, Bhai Ghani Khan, Bhai Nabi Khan reached Village Lal Kalan when coming from Macchiwara Sahib after becoming 'Ucch Da Peer' and had taken rest below &lt;big&gt;Beri Sahib&lt;/big&gt; which is still present there at Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib. After leaving this shrine Guru Gobind Singh went towards Gurudwara Degsar Sahib (Katana Sahib), where they were stopped by Sayyid Pir Muhammad,{{cn|date=February 2017}} Guru Gobind Singh followers assured the chief of Muslim forces that the person in the palanquin was 'Uchch Da Peer', but chief was not satisfied. He invited the 'Peer' (Guru) and his followers for food, thinking Sikhs would not dine with Muslims. But Guru said that he was on a long fast and sent two Sikhs Bhai Daya Singh and Bhai Mani Singh to take food after offering it to Holy Kirpan (a small sword). Next morning they were allowed to resume their journey.

== Important places at Gurusar Sahib ==

=== Beri Sahib ===
Beri Sahib&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; to which Guru Hargobind Sahib tied his horse. A person suffering from leprosy was staying near by in a small house. He requested Guru Hargobind Sahib to cure him, Guru Sahib told him to put foam coming out from horse mouth on all of his body and take bath in the pond (sarovar) nearer to Beri Sahib. After bath, he was cured. At present time, if anyone having skin disease take bath here, then he/she get relieved from skin diseases. Guru Gobind Singh had taken rest below Beri Sahib which is still present there at Gurudwara Gurusar Sahib.

=== Barota Sahib ===
Guru Hargobind Sahib said to sangat present at that time- "This tree (Barota in Punjabi) is Mango (Amb in Punjabi) tree",&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; but sangat said it's 'Borh', Guru said it again  but again sangat did not agree. So the leaves of Barota Sahib are like Mango tree leaves because of Guru Sahib aphorism.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29908">The '''History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939–1954)''' discusses the [[History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt]] from its actions during [[World War II]] to its official dissolution by the Egyptian government.

== The Second World War ==
In the late 1930s, in keeping with the [[History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]]'s emphasis on actions rather than words, some members pushed for the organisation to form a military wing to take up armed struggle against [[History of Modern Egypt|British imperial rule]], and some were already disobeying the Brotherhood's leadership and taking part in isolated clashes with the police.  The Brotherhood's General Guide, [[Hassan al-Banna]], felt that the Society was not ready to engage in military campaigns, and that those who wished to do so "might take the wrong course and miss the target".  He advocated a more cautious, longer-term plan of forming groups of particularly dedicated members, called "Battalions", who would receive rigorous spiritual and physical training; once their numbers were sufficient, Banna felt, the Battalions would be prepared to engage in warfare.  This would not involve [[terrorism|terrorist]] or [[revolution]]ary action, which Banna rejected completely, but rather (and only as a last resort, if all peaceful strategies failed) openly declared war on imperial occupation.  However, the Battalion system failed to develop on the scale Banna hoped for, and pressure from members for armed struggle against the British continued to increase.  In 1939, this internal conflict developed into a major crisis, during which some of the most active cadres left the Society to form a rival organisation called Muhammad's Youth.  The following year, as a result of this conflict, the Brotherhood created a military wing called the secret apparatus, which nevertheless remained mostly inactive during the war years.&lt;ref&gt;Lia, 172-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's official position was that Egypt should refrain from participating in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. However, in fact it was involved in strong ties to the Nazis.  These links began during the 1930s and were close during the Second World War, involving agitation against the British, espionage and sabotage, as well as support for terrorist activities orchestrated by [[Haj Amin el-Hussaini|Amin al-Husseini]] in British Mandate Palestine, as a wide range of declassified documents from the British, American and Nazi German governmental archives, as well as from personal accounts and memoirs from that period, confirm.&lt;ref&gt;See Ian Johnson, ''A Mosque in Munich: Nazis, the CIA and Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010); Matthias Küntzel, ''Jihad and Jew-hatred: Islamism, Nazism and the Roots of 9/11''  (New York: Telos Press, 2007); Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cüppers, ''Halbmond und Hakenkreuz: Das 'Dritte Reich', die Araber und Palästina'' (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2006), and Klaus Gensicke, ''Der Mufti von Jerusalem und die Nationalsocialisten: Eine politische Biographie Amin el-Husseinis'' (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Reflecting this connection the Muslim Brotherhood also disseminated Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' and ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' widely in Arab translations, helping to deepen and extend already existing hostile views about Jews and Western societies generally.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the studies listed in the previous note, see the detailed and richly documented analysis by Jeffrey Herf, ''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' (New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 2009).  But also see: Israel Gershoni and James Jankowski, ''Confronting Fascism in Egypt: Dictatorship versus Democracy in the 1930s'' (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2009) for the argument that the Muslim Brotherhood was unsympathetic to Nazi ideology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, in order to ensure Egypt's support of the war effort, which initially seemed to be going very badly for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] replaced the Egyptian government with one whose cooperation it could be sure of.  Martial law was imposed, and in 1941 some public figures that Britain considered subversive were arrested.  Hassan al-Banna was imprisoned twice (only to be released within weeks), the Brotherhood's journals were suppressed, its meetings were banned and any reference to it in newspapers was forbidden.&lt;ref name="Mitchell, 19-23"&gt;Mitchell, 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood's leadership was keen to avoid confrontations that could give the government a pretext to suppress the Society altogether.  During the war, the Society alternated between avoiding sensitive issues in the interest of self-preservation, and taking risky political positions such as calling for the nationalisation of the [[Suez Canal|Suez Canal Company]].  During the periods when it kept a low profile, it concentrated on maintaining and expanding its membership base and extending its social welfare programmes, which included humanitarian assistance to the victims of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] bombings of Egyptian cities.  In 1943, the Society replaced its Battalion system with a form of internal organisation called "families", a hierarchy of close-knit groups of five members each; members of a family met regularly, usually in their own homes, and assumed responsibility for one another's welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Lia, 256-266, 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortages and bombings contributed to political unrest; after a mass demonstration of students in February 1942, the government resigned.  British troops then surrounded the king's palace and forced him to accept a government headed by the Wafd party (thus durably damaging the Wafd's credibility in the eyes of Egyptians).  The Wafd remained entirely loyal to the British
throughout the war, as did the Sa'dist government that followed it in February 1945.&lt;ref name="Mitchell, 19-23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lia, 267-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first act of the Wafd government installed by the British in 1942 was to dissolve parliament and call for elections.  When Banna declared his candidacy, prime minister [[Mustafa an-Nahhas Pasha|Nahhas Pasha]] pressured him to withdraw it.  He agreed, but in return he obtained the prime minister's promise that the Brotherhood could resume its normal activities, and that the government would take action to curtail prostitution and the sale of alcoholic drinks. Shortly afterward, the government did indeed make prostitution illegal, and restricted the sale of alcohol, particularly on religious holidays.  The Brotherhood was allowed to resume some of its work, but for the next several years the government alternated between repression and friendliness towards the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lia, 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, the Brotherhood's membership continued to grow; by 1948, it had two thousand branches, and is thought to have had over a million members.&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar Nationalism ==
The candidacies of Banna and several other Brothers were defeated in the rigged 1945 elections, even in their stronghold of Isma'iliyya.  The Society's exclusion from parliamentary politics tended to strengthen the position of those members who advocated a more radical confrontation with the state, and to make them increasingly unwilling to submit to Banna's insistence on nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lia, 270-271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of Allied troops had created many jobs and led to the establishment of trade unions; after the war, the departure of most of those troops left many unemployed.  Inflation rose, the gap between rich and poor widened and wages decreased. During the war, [[propaganda]] had poured into Egypt from all sides of the conflict: British and American propaganda about [[democracy]] and national independence from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aggression, German propaganda about Egyptian and Arab liberation from Western imperialism, and Soviet propaganda about Soviet economic power and social justice.  Britain's occupation of Egypt and the conflict in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] remained unresolved.  Frustration with the political and economic order was endemic, [[communism|communist]] ideas were widespread, and [[activism|activist]] groups in general found it easy to attract new members.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1945 the Society adopted a new constitution which formally recognised the structures put in place during the 1938 reorganisation.  It also submitted its records to the ministry of social affairs as required by law, and was classified as a "political, social and religious institution"; this meant that the government assistance given to charities would only be available for some of its activities.  The organisation's social welfare activities were therefore split off into a separate section with its own director and hierarchy, in order to better protect them from political interference.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post-war years the Brotherhood grew rapidly.  It continued to expand its social welfare activities, setting up hospitals, clinics and pharmacies; schools offering technical and academic courses for boys, girls and adults; and small factories to help remedy post-war unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's ruling elites were vehemently opposed to [[communism]], and in this, the Brotherhood agreed wholeheartedly with them; the government therefore made attempts to use the Brotherhood as an instrument against its communist opponents.  However, conflict between the elites and the Brotherhood was inevitable, because like the communists, the Brothers were activists who appealed to widespread dissatisfaction with the existing social order, and aspired to bring about profound changes to remedy the injustices of Egyptian society.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 37-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood's publications expressed unrelenting hostility towards the government and its policies, and the Brothers were a major force in [[Strike action|strikes]] and [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].&lt;ref&gt;Mura, 61–85.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1945, the Society organised a "people's congress" on national liberation in Cairo and seven other cities.  The Brotherhood and the Wafd were now the two main opposition parties; now that the Wafd was no longer in power, it was just as eager to champion the nationalist cause, and was supported on this issue by the communists.  The Brothers therefore found themselves in direct competition with the Wafd for leadership of the nationalist movement.  Despite their deep mutual distrust, the two groups joined in the same mass demonstrations on occasion.  However, the Brotherhood's refusal to cooperate with communists led to the breakdown of a united front, and to accusations that the Brothers were tools of the government and of the ruling class.  The Society strongly rebutted these charges, and indeed organised strikes of its own; this deeply strained its already poor relations with the government, and the Brotherhood
became the target of police harassment and arrests.  The youth of the two groups repeatedly came to blows in 1946, and Banna was nearly killed by a bomb attack. After these clashes, representatives of the Brotherhood and the Wafd held secret meetings in order to reach an understanding; this considerably reduced the tensions between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 42-49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, prime minister Sidqi Pasha returned from negotiations in London with a draft treaty that the nationalist groups found absolutely unacceptable. Violent student riots broke out. Members of the Brotherhood's secret apparatus started to carry out attacks on Britons as well as on Egyptian police stations, and continued to do so over the next few years.  The government responded to this escalating violence with harsh repressive measures, including a wave of arrests among the Brothers and other nationalist groups.  Rioting continued throughout 1946, and in December the government resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 60, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1947, having accompanied the new prime minister, Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi Pasha, to the [[United Nations]], a representative of the Brothers, Mustafa Mu'min, interrupted the [[UN Security Council]] discussions on Egypt to make a speech from the spectator's gallery, rejecting all negotiations with Britain and calling for a complete and immediate British withdrawal from Egypt.  However, the Security Council took no action.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt and among Arabs and Muslims generally, the cause of Palestine continued to inspire strong sympathies; the [[1947 UN Partition Plan|1947 UN resolution]] on the partition of Palestine gave the issue a greater urgency.  The Brotherhood sent volunteers to fight in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].  During the war, there were numerous bomb attacks on Jews in Cairo; in the "jeep case" discussed below, it emerged that members of the Society's secret apparatus had been responsible for at least some of these.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 55-58, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1948, members of the secret apparatus assassinated judge, Ahmed El-Khazindar Bey, President of the Court of Appeal, who had given a prison sentence to a Muslim Brother for attacking British soldiers.  Banna expressed his revulsion at the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1948, the Egyptian government released a decree ordering the dissolution of the Society.  The police had discovered caches of bombs and other weapons accumulated by the secret apparatus, and though the Brothers insisted that these were for use in the Arab-Israeli war, the government suspected that the Brothers were planning revolution; it was also keen to remove what it saw as one of the main causes of the general political unrest that had become increasingly violent, and increasingly threatening to its authority, since the end of the Second World War.  Moreover, because the Brotherhood had its own hospitals, factories and schools, as well as an army in the form of the secret apparatus, the government saw it as a potential parallel state, which Egyptians might come to see as more legitimate than the official one.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 58-59, 61, 64, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from charges of involvement in violent attacks against police and foreigners, the government accused the Society of encouraging workers and farmers to go on strike to demand higher wages and ownership of farmland.  Many members of the Brotherhood were arrested, and Banna was kept under close police surveillance.  Weeks later, with the organisation's hierarchy and communications thoroughly disrupted, a Muslim brother assassinated prime minister Nuqrashi.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banna condemned this assassination, and tried without success to negotiate with the new government.  In January 1949 the police foiled an attempt by a member of the secret apparatus to bomb a courthouse.  Banna wrote an open letter repudiating this act, stating that the perpetrators were "neither Brothers nor Muslims", and called on members of the Brotherhood to refrain from violence and intimidation.  The new prime minister, 'Abd
al-Hadi, attempted to suppress all dissent by terrorising the population with brutal repressive measures, including the systematic use of torture in the prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banna wrote a pamphlet in which he rejected all the charges against the Brotherhood and condemned once again the acts of violence committed by its members, including the attacks on Jews; he said the Society's leaders would never have condoned this violence, and had been unable to prevent it because arrests and surveillance had made it impossible for them to exercise their authority.  Nevertheless, he argued that these events were, in part, a result of the government's behaviour and the war in Palestine.  He denied that the Society had been planning revolution, insisting that its arms had been intended for use only in Palestine in its legitimate partnership with the Arab League.  In February 1949, Banna was assassinated by the political police, probably on the orders of the prime minister and the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1949, after a wave of arrests, a group of Brothers made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate prime minister 'Abd al-Hadi, leading to still more arrests.  By July, some 4,000 Brothers were in prison, where they continued to maintain their organisation (Mitchell 1969, 80).  Several trials followed; in one of these, Nuqrashi's assassin was condemned and put to death.  The prosecution attempted to show that Banna had been responsible for the assassination, while the defence argued that he had been unable to maintain control over "extremists" in the secret apparatus; the court seems to have considered the latter view to be more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the only other trial to reach a conclusion (the "jeep case"), thirty-two Brothers were accused of conspiring to overthrow the government by means of terrorism, using illegal stockpiles of weapons, and of organising the murders of judge Khazindar and prime minister
Nuqrashi.  The prosecution attempted to show that revolution was the Society's real objective, concealed by the façade of its other activities.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 74-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence acknowledged that members of the secret apparatus had formed a terrorist organisation, but maintained that in doing so, they had disobeyed the Brotherhood's leaders and violated its principles.  It argued that the Society's activities and objectives were mainly peaceful, and that its weapons and military training were intended only for the legitimate defence of Arabs and Muslims against the British occupation of Egypt and against Zionism in Palestine.  The court ruled in favour of the defence.  Most of the defendants were acquitted, and the others were given lenient sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Wafd returned to power in 1950, the Brothers attempted to negotiate with the new government to have the Society legalised again, but could not reach an agreement. [[Martial law]] was ended, and all its provisions were abrogated except those that applied to the Brothers.  Parliament passed a "Societies Law" that specifically targeted the Brotherhood without mentioning it by name, requiring a description and photograph of every member to be given to the authorities.  The ministry of the interior announced that it intended to buy the Society's headquarters and use the building as a police station. The Brotherhood resolved all these issues by means of a successful court case, gaining the right to operate legally and the return of its confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 82-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolution and its Aftermath ==
While the Brotherhood was outlawed, competition to replace Hassan al-Banna became intense.  Finally, in 1951, in a move that contravened the Society's constitution, an outsider was chosen as Banna's successor: Hassan Isma'il al-Hudaybi, an experienced judge known for his strong aversion to violence, who, it was felt, would give the Society greater respectability.  Though not a member, Hudaybi had long been an admirer of Banna.  He resigned from the bench in order to become the Society's General Guide, but soon realised that he was meant to be a mere figurehead, and that longstanding members resented his attempts to exercise authority.  He spoke out against the secret apparatus and attempted to dissolve it, but only succeeded in alienating its members, who considered themselves fighters in a noble cause.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 82-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 1951, the Egyptian prime minister, Nahhas Pasha, unilaterally abrogated the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]]. This triggered mass demonstrations in support of Egyptian independence; with the help of the army, large numbers of nationalist activists, including many members of the Brotherhood, began preparing for armed conflict with the British in the Canal Zone.  Hudaybi, maintaining his opposition to violent action, publicly repudiated these preparations, and appeared to support the palace's intentions to stifle the nationalist movement.  This deepened the conflict between Hudaybi and his opponents in the organisation, especially those within the secret apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 88-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few months, anti-government riots broke out, expressing the nationalist movement's frustration with the government's failure to follow up the abrogation of the treaty with decisive action.  On 25 January 1952, British forces attacked an Egyptian police station in the Canal Zone and a pitched battle ensued.  The next day, in Cairo, students, police and officers marched together to the parliament to demand a declaration of war against Britain; meanwhile thousands of rioters [[Cairo Fire|set fire to the city]], leaving much of central Cairo in ruins.  The Brotherhood did not participate as an organisation, and Hudaybi issued a statement repudiating the riots, but individual members were involved.  Several new governments followed in rapid succession.  On 23 July the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]], led by [[Muhammad Naguib]], took power, overthrowing the monarchy; the coup was greeted with enthusiasm throughout Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 91-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood played a supporting but not crucial role in the revolution.  Members of the Free Officers, including [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (who was to become the leader of the new regime) and [[Anwar Sadat|Anwar al-Sadat]], had had close contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood since the 1940s, and some were members of the Society (Nasser himself may have been one of these).  Members of the Brotherhood had fought alongside the officers in Palestine, and had been armed and trained by them for deployment in the Canal Zone in the year preceding the revolution. Despite Hudaybi's ambivalence, the Brotherhood had agreed to assist the revolution, mostly by
maintaining order, protecting foreigners and minorities and encouraging popular support for the army [[coup d'état|coup]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 96-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution, relations between the Brotherhood and the [[military dictatorship|junta]] were initially cordial but quickly soured.  Among the reasons for this were the army's unwillingness to share political power, the Brotherhood's insistence on the promulgation of an Islamic constitution, and Hudaybi's deep distrust of Nasser.  In 1953, the government
abolished all [[political party|political parties]] and organisations except the Muslim Brotherhood.  It then created a new party, the Liberation Rally, intended to win over those Egyptians who remained sceptical about the revolution, and suggested that the Brotherhood should merge with the Liberation Rally.  Having alienated all other political groups, the regime could not yet afford to dispense with the Brotherhood's support, but was unwilling to give it a greater role in government.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 105-111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudaybi was then subjected to fierce criticism from within the organisation, partly because of the government's efforts to discredit him; his critics felt he had transformed the Society into "a party of aristocrats" and "a movement of words, not action".  This led to a debate about the authoritarian character of the Society's institutions.  Some felt that a system based on obedience and loyalty to the leader had been acceptable under Banna because he had won the members' trust; since Hudaybi had been unable to do so, they began to press for more democratic structures.  Despite these criticisms, Hudaybi mustered strong support from the Brotherhood's leaders as well as from the rank and file.  The secret apparatus was formally dissolved and its leaders expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 116-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1954, the regime sent members of the Liberation Rally to disrupt a Muslim Brothers student gathering using loudspeakers; the confrontation turned into a battle.  The government then decreed that the Muslim Brotherhood was to be dissolved, on the grounds that Hudaybi and his supporters had been planning to overthrow the government; he was arrested along with hundreds of others.  The junta's use of repressive measures to safeguard its power, which was seen as Nasser's policy in particular, caused its popularity to plummet; this led to anti-Nasser demonstrations and a power struggle between him and General Naguib, and appeared to threaten to end the revolution and restore the old political order.  Hudaybi sided with Nasser and with the revolution, earning the release of most of the imprisoned Brothers and the restoration of the Society's authorisation to operate legally.  However, the events of January had rankled many members, who now felt that the secret apparatus should not have been abolished after all; it was therefore rebuilt under a new leadership without Hudaybi's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 126-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regime's failure to keep some of the promises it had made to the Society (e.g. concerning the release of prisoners) soon caused their relations to deteriorate again.  In a leaked letter to the government, Hudaybi called for the lifting of martial law, a return to parliamentary democracy and an end to press censorship.  Meanwhile, Britain and Egypt had resumed negotiations regarding the [[Suez Canal]].  An agreement on the terms of a new treaty was announced; Hudaybi immediately criticised it as too generous towards the British and a threat to Egyptian sovereignty. The government then began using police to provoke violent confrontations with the Brotherhood at peaceful gatherings in [[mosque]]s and other places; a Brotherhood clinic was raided and destroyed.  In each case the government blamed the Brothers for instigating the clashes.  Hudaybi went into hiding, and the official press launched a vitriolic campaign to discredit him.  The government declared that several Brothers who were travelling abroad were guilty of treason, and stripped them of their Egyptian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 134-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements within the Society over Hudaybi's criticisms of the government then came to the fore, and Nasser personally made strenuous efforts to persuade the Brotherhood's leaders to have Hudaybi removed from his position.  This conflict had the effect of discrediting not only Hudaybi but the rest of the leadership as well.  The treaty with Britain was signed on 19 October 1954.  Hudaybi
and other Brotherhood leaders felt it was much better than the previously announced terms, but according to one version of events, the secret apparatus, now invisible and unaccountable to those not involved in it, saw the treaty it as a betrayal of Egypt and decided to act on its own.
On 26 October, a member of the secret apparatus fired shots at Nasser while the latter was making a speech; unharmed, Nasser stood firm and finished his speech, declaring that he was ready to die for his country.  There are, however, some indications that Nasser and his close associates may have staged the assassination attempt; what is certain is that they had been considering doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 144-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carré, 59-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt on Nasser's life gave his popularity a much-needed boost, enabled him to prevail in his power struggle with Naguib, and provided him with the perfect opportunity to eliminate the Brotherhood.  The organisation was officially dissolved, its headquarters burned, and thousands of its members arrested.  The government organised spectacular trials with little regard for [[due process|due process of law]], while the official press accused Hudaybi and his organisation of every conceivable sort of conspiracy.  Six Brothers were hanged, and seven, including Hudaybi, were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, 151-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hoodoocandle.JPG|thumb|A Hoodoo candle]]

'''Hoodoo''' is a traditional black American [[Folk religion|folk spirituality]] that developed from a number of [[West Africa]]n spiritual traditions and beliefs. Hoodoo is a mixture of various [[Traditional African religions|African religious]] practices created by enslaved Africans in the New World. These religious practices were held in secret away from white slave owners. Following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], Hoodoo practice spread throughout the United States. 

==Roots==
{{POV section|date=August 2013}}

Hoodoo is the practice of spirituality carried to the United States by West Africans as the result of the [[atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]]. It is a blend of practices from the people of the Congo, Benin/Togo, Nigeria and others. The extent to which hoodoo could be practiced varied by region and the temperament of the slave owners. Enslaved Africans of the Southeast, known as the [[Gullah]], as well as those in Louisiana, were people who enjoyed an isolation and relative freedom that allowed for retention of the practices of their West African ancestors. Rootwork or hoodoo, in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where the concentration of enslaved Africans was dense, was practiced but under a large cover of secrecy. Hoodoo spread throughout the United States as African Americans left the delta during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].

The word ''hoodoo'' stems from ''Hudu'', which is the name of a language and a [[Ewe people|Ewe]] tribe in [[Togo]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Asante |first1=Molefi Kete |title=Encyclopedia of African Religion |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=9781506317861 |pages=Hoodoo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMv0CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443&amp;dq=hudu+hoodoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21aGOgZHdAhVrzIMKHbs7A7EQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=hudu%20hoodoo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ewe: Hudu language |url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/language/9712 |website=Global Recordings Network |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first documented in American English in 1875 and was used as a [[noun]] (the practice of hoodoo) or a [[transitive verb]], as in "I hoodoo you," an action carried out by varying means. The hoodoo could be manifest in a healing [[potion]], or in the exercise of a parapsychological power, or as the cause of harm which befalls the targeted victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoodoo Merriam Webster Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102004212/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoodoo |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvarado, D. The Voodoo Hoodoo Spellbook. San Francisco, CA: Weiser Books, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[African-American English]] (AAE), ''hoodoo'' is often used to refer to a paranormal consciousness or spiritual hypnosis, a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]], but ''hoodoo'' may also be used as an [[adjective]] for a practitioner, such as "hoodoo man."

Known hoodoo spells date back to the 1800s. Spells are dependent on the intention of the practitioner and "reading" of the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daughtersofeve/2011/07/mystical-hoodoo-with-mother-mystic/ |title=Mystical Hoodoo with Mother Mystic |publisher=Patheos.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional synonyms for hoodoo include ''[[Evocation|conjuration]]'', ''witchcraft'', or ''rootwork''.&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt, Harry Middleton. 1970&amp;ndash;1978.  ''Hoodoo--Conjuration--Witchcraft--Rootwork''. 5 vols. Hannibal: Western&lt;/ref&gt; Older sources from the 18th and 19th century sometimes use the word "[[Obeah]]" to describe equivalent folk practices.&lt;ref name="lucky-temple.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lucky-temple.com/history-hoodoo-voodoo-wicca-obeah.html |title={title} |access-date=2013-01-02 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216100512/http://lucky-temple.com/history-hoodoo-voodoo-wicca-obeah.html |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hoodoo religious system==

According to Carolyn Morrow Long, "At the time of the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], the traditional nature-centered religions of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]] were characterized by the concept that human well-being is governed by spiritual balance, by devotion to a supreme creator and a pantheon of lesser deities, by veneration and propitiation of the ancestors, and by the use of charms to embody spiritual power. . . . In traditional West African thought, the goal of all human endeavor was to achieve balance." Several African spiritual traditions recognized a genderless supreme being who created the world, was neither good nor evil, and which did not concern itself with the affairs of mankind. Lesser spirits were invoked to gain aid for humanity's problems.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Carolyn Morrow. "Spiritual Merchants: Religion, Magic and Commerce." University of Tennessee Press. Knoxville: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century there has been Christian influence in hoodoo thought.&lt;ref name="lucky-temple.com" /&gt; This is particularly evident in relation to [[Jehovah|God's]] [[Divine Providence|providence]] and his role in [[retributive justice]].  For example, though there are strong ideas of good versus evil, cursing someone to cause their death might not be considered a malignant act.  One practitioner explained it as follows:

::"[In h]oodooism, anythin' da' chew do is de plan of God undastan', God have somepin to do wit evah' thin' you do if it's good or bad, He's got somepin to do wit it ... jis what's fo' you, you'll git it."&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. II. p. 1761.&lt;/ref&gt;
::: '' "([In h]oodooism, anything that you do is the plan of God, understand? God has something to do with everything that you do whether it's good or bad, he's got something to do with it... You'll get what's coming to you)" ''

Not only is the Yahweh's providence a factor in hoodoo practice, but hoodoo thought understands that deity as the archetypal hoodoo doctor. On this matter [[Zora Neale Hurston|Zora Hurston]] stated, "The way we tell it, hoodoo started way back there before everything. Six days of magic spells and mighty words and the world with its elements above and below was made."&lt;ref&gt;Hurston. 1935. ''[[Mules and Men]]''. pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, biblical figures are often recast as hoodoo doctors and the Bible becomes a source of spells and is, itself, used as a protective talisman.&lt;ref&gt;Smith. 1994. ''Conjuring Culture''. p. 6.  See also, Hurston's, ''Mules and Men''.  In the appendix she lists the "paraphernalia of conjure," the last on the list being the Christian Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be understood as a [[syncretic]] adaptation for the religion. By blending the ideas laid out by the Christian Bible, the faith is made more acceptable. This combines the teachings of Christianity that Africans brought to America were given and the traditional beliefs they brought with them.

The newest work on Hoodoo lays out a model of hoodoo origins and development.  ''Mojo Workin:The Old African American Hoodoo System'' by Katrina Hazzard-Donald, Ph.D. discusses what the author calls "the ARC or African Religion Complex which was a collection of eight traits which all the enslaved Africans had in common and were somewhat familiar to all held in the agricultural slave labor camps known as plantations communities. Those traits included naturopathic medicine, ancestor reverence, counter clockwise sacred circle dancing, blood sacrifice, divination, supernatural source of malady, water immersion and spirit possession. These traits allowed Culturally diverse Africans to find common culturo-spiritual ground. According to the author, hoodoo developed  under the influence of that complex, the African divinities moved back into their natural forces, unlike in the Caribbean and Latin America where the divinities moved into Catholic saints.  This work also discusses the misunderstood "High [[John the Conqueror root]]" and myth as well as the incorrectly-discussed "nature sack."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mojo Workin: The Old African American Hoodoo System|last=Hazzard-Donald|first=|last2=|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-252-07876-7|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses-as-conjurer===

Additionally, hoodoo practitioners often understand the biblical figure [[Moses]] in similar terms. Hurston developed this idea in her novel ''[[Moses, Man of the Mountain]]'', in which she calls Moses, "the finest hoodoo man in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Hurston. ''Moses, Man of the Mountain''. p. ??.&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious parallels between Moses and intentional paranormal influence (such as magic) occur in the biblical accounts of his confrontation with Pharaoh. Moses conjures, or performs magic  "miracles" such as turning his staff into a snake. However, his greatest feat of conjure was using his powers to help free the Hebrews from slavery. This emphasis on Moses-as-conjurer led to the introduction of the pseudonymous work the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'' into the corpus of hoodoo reference literature.&lt;ref&gt;One observer at the time called The Sixth And Seventh Books "the Hoodoo Bible". Yvonne Chireau. Black Magic: Religion and the African American Conjuring Tradition. University of California Press, (2006) {{ISBN|0-520-24988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible-as-talisman===

In hoodoo, "All hold that the Bible is the great conjure book in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Hurston. ''Mules and Men''. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; It has many functions for the practitioner, not the least of which is a source of spells. This is particularly evident given the importance of the book ''Secrets of the Psalms'' in hoodoo culture.&lt;ref&gt;Selig, Godfrey. ''Secrets of the Psalms''&lt;/ref&gt; This book provides instruction for using psalms for things such as safe travel, headache, and marital relations. The Bible, however, is not just a source of spiritual works but is itself a conjuring talisman. It can be taken "to the crossroads", carried for protection, or even left open at specific pages while facing specific directions. This informant provides an example of both uses:
:"Whenevah ah'm afraid of someone doin' me harm ah read the 37 Psalms an' co'se ah leaves the Bible open with the head of it turned to the east as many as three days."&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. 1. p. 417.  Quoted in Smith. ''Conjuring Culture''. p. 14. n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==

The purpose of hoodoo was to allow people access to [[supernatural]] forces to improve their lives. Hoodoo is purported to help people attain power or success ("luck") in many areas of life including money, love, health, and employment. As in many other spiritual and medical folk practices, extensive use is made of [[herb]]s, [[mineral]]s, parts of animals' bodies, an individual's possessions and bodily fluids, especially [[menstrual cycle|menstrual blood]], [[urine]], [[saliva]], and [[semen]].

Contact with ancestors or other spirits of the dead is an important practice within the conjure tradition, and the recitation of [[psalms]] from the [[Bible]] is also considered spiritually influential in hoodoo. Due to hoodoo's great emphasis on an individual's spiritual power to effect desired change in the course of events, hoodoo's principles are believed to be accessible for use by any individual of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haskins |first1=Jim |title=Voodoo &amp; Hoodoo: Their Traditional Crafts Revealed by Actual Practitioners |publisher=Original Publications |isbn=978-0942272185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoodoo practice does not require a formally designated minister.

Homemade powders, mojo hands, oils, and talismans form the basis of much rural hoodoo, but there are also some successful commercial companies selling various hoodoo products to urban and town practitioners. These are generally called spiritual supplies, and they include herbs, roots, minerals, candles, incense, oils, floor washes, sachet powders, bath crystals, icons, aerosols, and colognes. Many patent medicines, cosmetics, and household cleaning supplies for mainstream consumers have been aimed also at hoodoo practitioners. Some products have dual usage as conventional and spiritual supplies, examples of which include the [[Four Thieves Vinegar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Felix | first=Talia | title=The Conjure Cookbook | publisher=Createspace | page=32 | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4505-7317-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scO-v-0bP6gC&amp;lpg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florida Water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Felix | first=Talia | title=Voodoo Conjure | publisher=Createspace | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4505-8227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Red Devil Lye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/devil.html|title=The Devil|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Bottle Tree}}
Hoodoo is linked to a popular tradition of bottle trees in the United States. According to gardener and glass bottle researcher Felder Rushing, the use of bottle trees came to the Old South from Africa with the slave trade. Bottle trees were an African tradition, passed down from early Arabian traders. They believed that the bottles trapped the evil spirits until the rising morning sun could destroy them. The use of blue bottles is linked to the "haint blue" spirit specifically. Glass bottle trees have become a popular garden decoration throughout the South and Southwest.&lt;ref name="Hometalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hometalk.com/3772287/the-magic-and-mystery-of-bottles-trees-revealed |title= Hometalk Discusses Bottle Trees |publisher=Hometalk |date=2014-05-26 |accessdate=2014-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influences==

Over time, a few African Americans began to incorporate a few elements from the European culture, such as occultism and mysticism. The mobility of black people from the rural South, to more urban areas in the North, is characterized by the items used in hoodoo. Whites and especially Jewish pharmacists opened their shops in black communities and began to offer items both asked for by their black customers, as well as things they themselves felt would be of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Tony |title=A Secret History of Memphis Hoodoo: Rootworkers, Conjurers &amp; Spirituals |date=2017 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |isbn=9781439659571 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaPHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93&amp;dq=Jewish+pharmacists+opened+their+shops+in+black+communities+hoodoo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIx7KEhpHdAhXS6lMKHekTBfAQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Jewish%20pharmacists%20opened%20their%20shops%20in%20black%20communities%20hoodoo&amp;f=false |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the adoption of occultism and mysticism may be seen in the colored wax candles in glass jars that are often labeled for specific purposes such as "Fast Luck" and "Love Drawing".

===Europe===
Throughout the African-American community one finds Christian symbolism and prayer, which made it a natural addition to the similar symbolism of hoodoo. Mirroring the hoodoo concept of the ''Bible-as-talisman'', the book itself proposes to be a protective [[amulet]]: "Whoever carries this book with him is safe from all his enemies, visible or invisible; and whoever has this book with him cannot die without the holy corpse of Jesus Christ, nor drown in any water, nor burn up in any fire, nor can any unjust sentence be passed upon him. So help me."&lt;ref&gt;Hohman. 1820. ''Pow-Wow''. pp. 63 and 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'' is a grimoire made popular by Europeans that is purportedly based on [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Kabbalah]]. It contains numerous signs, seals, and passages in Hebrew that are supposed to be related to Moses' ability to work wonders. Though its authorship is attributed to Moses, the oldest manuscript dates to the mid-19th century. Its importance in hoodoo among a few practitioners is summarized as follows:

:"I read de "Seven Books of Moses" seven or eight yeah a'ready&amp;nbsp;... de foundation of hoodooism came from way back yondah de time dat Moses written de book "De Seven Book of Moses."&lt;ref&gt;Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. I. pp. 1758–1759.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from voodoo==

Hoodoo shows evident links to the practices and beliefs of Fon and Ewe spiritual folkways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zogbe |first1=Mama |title=Hoodoo: A New World Name of an Ancient African Magical Tradition |url=http://www.mamiwata.com/hoodoo/hoodoo.html |website=Mamiwata |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folkway of [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] is a more standardized and widely dispersed spiritual practice than hoodoo. Vodun's modern form is practiced across West Africa in the nations of [[Benin]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]], among others. In the Americas, the worship of the Vodoun [[loa]] is syncretized with [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] saints. The [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] of Haiti, [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]] of Louisiana, and Vudú of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Dominican Republic are related more to Vodun than to hoodoo.

==Case of Mubarak Bala==
&lt;!--See [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mubarak Bala]] for why this is here. Feel free to remove if desired.  --&gt;
'''Mubarak Bala''', a Nigerian atheist, who was born in Kano State, Northern Nigeria in the mid 80s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thisisafrica.me/atane|title=Mubarak Bala answers questions on his atheism in Nigeria|date=18 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2018|via=www.thisisafrica.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; was forcibly committed to a psychiatric institution in [[Kano]] for eighteen days in 2014, where he was forcibly drugged. One doctor suggested there was nothing wrong with Bala but a second doctor suggested a personality disorder, he said, "My dear, you need a God, even in Japan, they have a God, no one should live without God, those that do, are all psychologically ill, denying the biblical account of Adam and Eve is delusion, denial of history.." The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] has taken up the case and feels Bala's [[Human rights]] were violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28010234|title=Nigeria atheist Bala 'deemed mentally ill' in Kano state|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nigerian-man-detained-in-mental-institute-in-kano-because-he-renounced-islam-9561511.html|title=Nigerian man detained in mental institute in Kano 'because he renounced Islam'|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The real reason for this outrageous and inhumane action is because Mubarak has renounced Islam and has openly declared himself to be an atheist." &lt;ref name="MubarakBala"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian atheist forced into mental hospital for rejecting Islam|url=http://www.nigeriasun.com/index.php/sid/223255809/scat/8db1f72cde37faf3/ht/Nigerian-atheist-forced-into-mental-hospital-for-rejecting-Islam|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=Nigeria Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 July 2014, the BBC reported that Bala had been released from hospital in conjunction with a doctors' strike, and was seeking reconciliation with his family.

'''''Israel Post''''' ({{lang-he|ישראל פוסט}}), originally ''Metro Israel'', is an [[Israel]]i Hebrew-language [[free daily newspaper]] based on the concept of the ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' newspapers. Co-owned by Eli Azur (who owns controlling interest in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'') and David Weisman, it was first published on August 5, 2007. It is Israel's only afternoon newspaper and distributed mainly in establishments owned by Weisman, such as [[Blue Square (supermarket chain)|Blue Square]] [[supermarket]]s, the [[AM-PM]] [[convenience store]]s and [[Dor-Alon]] gas stations. Part of the material is translated from the [[English language|English-language]] ''Jerusalem Post'' and ''The Business Post'' newspapers. Most of the advertisements during the preliminary period are of Weisman's businesses.

In July 2010, a TGI survey of the media reported that Israel Post overtook [[Haaretz]] as the fourth largest newspaper in terms of exposure with a rate of 7.6% versus Haaretz's rate of only 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000577726&amp;Fromelement=TalkofDay|script-title=he:אדלסון שוטף את המדינה בחינם: "ישראל היום" השתווה ל"ידיעות אחרונות"|author=Li-Or Averbuch |date= 28 July 10|work= |publisher= Globes |accessdate=28 July 2010|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Leo Van Impe''' (born February 9, 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0887254|name=Jack Van Impe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed., Gale Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[televangelist]] who is known for his half-hour weekly [[television series]] ''Jack Van Impe Presents'', an [[eschatology|eschatological]] commentary on the news of the week through an interpretation of the [[Bible]]. The program airs around the world through both [[religious broadcasting|religious broadcasters]] and the purchase of [[infomercial|paid programming]] time on commercial [[television station]]s. He is known as the "Walking Bible", having memorized many scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Otto|first=Mary|title=At the cusp of two millennia, more people believe the Book of Revelation's code will be cracked soon|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|date=May 16, 1997|url=
https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19411802.html|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Rexella, shares his TV ministry as co-host.

==Early life and marriage==
Van Impe's parents, Oscar Alphonse Van Impe and Marie Louise, née Piot, immigrated from [[Belgium]] to the city of [[Troy, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], in the United States in 1929. Jack Leo Van Impe was born on February 9, 1931, in Freeport, Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Roger F.|title=They call him The Walking Bible|date=1977|publisher=Action Press|location=Nashville|isbn=0840790007|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the couple's only child. The reason why Van Impe had decided to become an evangelist was because his father was a missionary with very strong faith.

According to Van Impe, he and his father Oscar played the [[accordion]] at night clubs, and Oscar regularly swore and drank alcohol, and believed that religion was hogwash. At meals, Van Impe would drink alcoholic beverages along with his father which is a European tradition. Then when Van Impe was twelve years old, Oscar converted to evangelical Christianity, and Oscar and Jack Van Impe together smashed all of their bottles of alcoholic beverages, and since that event Van Impe has not drunk any alcohol.

Van Impe then played [[accordion]] duets with his [[missionary]] father across Michigan and other states. In 1948, Van Impe graduated from [[high school]] and entered [[William Tyndale College|Detroit Bible Institute]], earning his [[Academic degree|diploma]] in 1952 and beginning his career as a [[preacher]] and [[Evangelism|evangelist]] as well as an extensive recording career.

While working with the [[Billy Graham]] crusades, when he was at a [[Youth For Christ]] rally with Chuck Ohman (a friend of Jack's who was a trumpeter for [[Percy Crawford]]'s "[[Youth on the March]]" television broadcasts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/pearce-int.asp|title=An Interview with Bill Pearce|author=Douglas Yeo|publisher=Online Trombone Journal|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Van Impe met his future wife, Rexella Mae Shelton, who was an organist with the crusades. Rexella was born in Missouri on November 29, 1932,&lt;ref&gt;"Jack Van Impe Presents", 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and was named after her father, Rex Shelton. The couple were married on August 21, 1954, and started their own joint ministry, Jack Van Impe Ministries.

==Records==
Since the 1950s, Van Impe has released dozens of [[Gospel]] and spoken word recordings. His first album ''Presenting the Van Impes'' features Van Impe on the [[accordion]] as well as Rexella's organ playing. Subsequent musical recordings featured the [[accorgan]], a type of electronic accordion.

==Biblical prophecy beliefs==
Van Impe believes in one particular interpretation of a literal meaning of the Bible ([[King James Version]]) that states, according to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13, that a single world political leader ([[The beast (Revelation)|The Beast]]) and a single world religious leader (the [[False Prophet]]) will emerge, but [[rapture|The Rapture]] will happen before either leader comes to power. He believes that the Bible teaches that the world will be organized into ten political subdivisions, based on the ten-district plan set up by the [[Club of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Announced in "Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System," as part of the ''Strategy for Survival Project.'' This revealed the Club's goal of dividing the world into ten political/economic regions which would unite the entire world under a single form of government. These regions are: North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Japan, Rest of Developed World, Latin America, Middle East, Rest of Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and China. The same plan was published in a Club of Rome book called Mankind at the Turning Point: Club of Rome Report, REGIONALIZED AND ADAPTIVE MODEL OF THE GLOBAL WORLD SYSTEM, Report on the Progress in the ''STRATEGY FOR SURVIVAL PROJECT'' of the Club of Rome, [[Mihajlo Mesarovic]] and [[Eduard Pestel]], Directors, "C O N F I D E N T I A L," September 17, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and that this ten-division world empire will be jointly ruled by the [[European Union]] and the [[Islamic world]], which he believes are represented by the two iron legs of the prophetic dream statue in the [[Book of Daniel]]. Van Impe believes in the [[Prophecy of the Popes]], and that according to said prophecy, [[Pope Francis]] is Peter the Roman, the predicted pope who will preside during [[Armageddon]].

Van Impe preaches a Pre-Tribulation Rapture of 'The Body of Christ'.

Van Impe also believes a one-world religion will form, named "Chrislam"; the joining of the world's two largest religions (Christianity and Islam). He believes that the Bible states that the world political leader will "come in peaceably" (per [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 11:21) and create a seven-year peace deal involving Israel (per [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 9:27). Then, three and a half years into the peace, Russia (the interpreted meaning of 'Rosh' from [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 38:2 and 39:1; Van Impe also identifies [[Meshech]] and [[Tubal]] from the same passages as [[Moscow]] and [[Tobolsk]] respectively), along with its Middle Eastern allies ('[[Iran|Persia]], Cush, and Put', from [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 38:5), will break the peace by invading Israel, according to [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 38, and the military of Russia and its allies will be decimated by nuclear warfare and pushed back to [[Siberia]]. Then China (the interpreted meaning of 'kings from the east' from [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 16:12) will invade, and the military of China will likewise be decimated when Jesus returns.

==Jack Van Impe Presents==
''Jack Van Impe Presents'' is a weekly [[Broadcasting|telecast]] currently produced by Van Impe's non-profit organization at the Jack Van Impe Ministries World Outreach Center, in [[Rochester Hills, Michigan]]. Van Impe's wife, Rexella, cohosts.

On a typical show, Rexella begins by reading recent news headlines. Van Impe then applies his memorization of Bible verses to interpret the news stories, generally in an attempt to show that it is another manifestation of biblically-predicted signs of the [[Eschatology|end of the age]].

In explaining how careful he is with money donated to his ministry, Jack says he has worn the same suit coat for many years but admitted he does get a new necktie for each program to match the colors of Rexella's constantly changing wardrobe.

Twice during the broadcast, once in the middle of the broadcast and once at the end, announcer Chuck Ohman describes a DVD that is being sold by the ministry, and how to order.  (Rexella announced Ohman's wife's death on the 12 March 2016 broadcast.)  Near the end of the broadcast, Jack looks at the camera and makes a personal prayer to Jesus, and he asks the viewers to make the prayer with him. On the [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] broadcasts, a video of Rexella singing a song in her younger years is aired.

Recurring topics include a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]] consisting of one [[world government]] and one world religion, prophecies of future wars and the [[Second Coming of Jesus|second coming of Jesus]], modern "Chrislam", differences between the biblical Jesus and the [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus of Islam]], the proposed [[Defamation of religions and the United Nations|United Nations blasphemy law]] and [[Islamic extremism]], the removal of crosses from churches, the importance of doctrine, and criticism of such individuals as [[Pope Francis]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Rick Warren]], [[Robert Schuller]], [[Joel Osteen]], and [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Jack also cites numerous Bible verses, with emphasis on various select verses that are his favorites. Van Impe uses the [[King James version]] of the Bible.

In 2017 Jack began referring to himself as a prophet and holy man, with a particular commission from the Holy Spirit to announce the return of Jesus Christ, a commission Jack attributed to his extensive memorization of Bible texts cited with chapter and verse. However, in the 30 June 2018 video, Jack admitted that "The verses have all come back but sometimes the numbers are a little difficult" since his coma.  In the 6 October 2018 video, Jack stated that his wife Rexella was also chosen with him by the Holy Spirit to reach the 7.6 Billion people on earth.

==Health problems and interruption of broadcast==
In one episode of ''Jack Van Impe Presents'' which aired in the week of June 19, 2006, Van Impe disclosed that he had undergone two total [[knee replacement surgery|knee replacements]] in early 2006.  He gave thanks to God for his recovery and for leading him to the "wonderful surgeon" who did the operation.  Subsequent to the problems with his knees, Van Impe has suffered from cancer, a severe [[sepsis]] attack, and blood loss resulting from holes burned through his stomach by his [[NSAID]] arthritis medication.  On the program which aired the week of May 31, 2015, Van Impe was not present for the program, and Rexella reported that he was recovering from a serious surgery (triple by-pass) in the hospital.  [[Carl Baugh]] co-hosted the program.  Van Impe compared his colitis to the flood in the account of Noah's Ark.

Van Impe returned to his weekly show on October 3, 2015, following successful rehabilitation from his [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple by-pass heart surgery]].

On January 7, 2017, Rexella Van Impe announced that Jack Van Impe had broken his hip but was recovering.  Carl Baugh co-hosted that program as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Jack Van Impe Presents", 7 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In Jack's absence, Rexella Van Impe co-hosted the program with various guests:  Carl Baugh for six episodes, Dave Williams for six episodes, [[Robert Jeffress|Dr. Robert Jeffress]] for two episodes, and Walt Sheppard for three episodes. In April&amp;ndash;May, 2017, re-runs were aired until the May 27, 2017, broadcast when Jack Van Impe reappeared beside Rexella, and the couple announced that, under doctor's advice, they were ending the TV broadcast. Thereafter, weekly videos were posted on the organization's website. However, Jack later claimed the reason they stopped TV broadcasts was because he had lost 50,000 donors during his absence due to illness, although he claimed he lost 60,000 in his October 13, 2018, video.  In a message about bearing false witness, Jack claimed he only had enough funds to pay for 8 to 10 months of radio and TV broadcasts, although he announced contracts with every radio and TV station in every nation on earth for 3 years of broadcasting.  In 2018, radio and television broadcasts resumed, with Chuck Ohman announcing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://watc.tv/jack-van-impe-returns-to-watc-on-september-3/ "Jack Van Impe Returns to WATC on September 3"], [[WATC-DT]] (retrieved September 10, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In 2001, Jack and Rexella Van Impe won the parodic [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[Astrophysics]] "for their discovery that black holes fulfill all the technical requirements to be the location of Hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2001 |title=The 2001 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |date= |work=improbable.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with TBN===
In June 2011, [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] refused to air an episode of "Jack Van Impe Presents" which criticized [[Robert Schuller]] and [[Rick Warren]] for promoting "Chrislam." In response, Van Impe ceased airing his show on TBN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnd.com/2011/06/311473/|title=Van Impe ministry abandons TBN in clash over Islam|author=|work=WND}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Adelle M.

'''Julius Klinger''' (22 May 1876 – 1942) was an [[Austria]]n painter, draftsman, illustrator, commercial graphic artist, typographer and writer. Klinger studied at the Technologisches Gewerbemuseum in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="AEIOU "&gt;[http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.k/k464961.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en Austrian AEIOU Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meggendorfer Blätter 27.03.1930.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Meggendorfer Blätter,&amp;nbsp;1930]]
Klinger was born in Dornbach near [[Vienna]]. In 1895, he found his first employment with the [[Vienna]] fashion magazine ''Wiener Mode''. Here he made acquaintance with [[Koloman Moser]], who later would be his teacher; Moser recommended him to the ''[[Meggendorfer-Blätter]]''.&lt;ref name="onbJK"&gt;[http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm Julius Klinger (Wien 22. 5. 1976-1942?)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024028/http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm |date=2008-09-18 }}, biographical entry with the [[Austrian National Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

1896 saw him moving to [[Munich]] where he worked as an illustrator for the ''Meggendorfer-Blätter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ciarlo|title=Advertising Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ceZNb2h4BQC&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=January 2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05006-8|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. From 1897 to 1902 he was a collaborator to the eponymous [[Jugendstil]] magazine ''[[Die Jugend]]''.

== Berlin ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Möhring Kronleuchter 1908.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Julius Klinger:&amp;nbsp;1908, Möhring&amp;nbsp;candelabra&amp;nbsp;factory]]
In 1897 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked extensively as a commercial graphic artist until 1915. Together with the printing house Hollerbaum und Schmidt, he developed a new fashion of functional poster design that soon gained him international reputation.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt; In 1912 he designed the poster for the ''Rund um Berlin'' air show in [[Johannisthal Air Field|Johannisthal]]. In Berlin he also contributed to ''Das kleine Witzblatt'', ''Lustige Blätter'' and ''Das Narrenschiff'' humorous magazines.

== Advertising campaign for the "Tabu" company ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Tabu Hauswand ca.1920.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Julius&amp;nbsp;Klinger: firewall,&amp;nbsp;ca.1920]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Julius Klinger Tabu Poster 1919.jpg|thumb|100px|left|J. Klinger: Poster&amp;nbsp;ca.&amp;nbsp;1919]] --&gt;
Beginning in 1918, Klinger designed a comprehensive and noted campaign promoting the "Tabu" company's cigarette rolling paper, that was advertised all over Vienna in 1918/19. Klinger devised a promotional strategy, spanning from small-sized newspaper advertisements to billboards and painted [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] – construction site fences and winterized fountain paneling were used as advertising space, too.&lt;ref name="onb2003"&gt;[http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm Plakat: Julius Klinger: Tabu, 1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823140137/http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm |date=2004-08-23 }}, [[Austrian National Library]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi persecution ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Ankerbrot 1938.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Julius Klinger, late&amp;nbsp;1937,&amp;nbsp;Vienna]]
Being of Jewish descent, he suffered from [[Nazism|national socialist]] harassment. According to Viennese police records, he was registered as ''moved to [[Minsk]]'' on 2 June 1942, i.e. deported. Presumably, he was killed the same year.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt;

Probably towards the end of 1937 he designed his last poster for the Ankerbrot-Werke factory. The Jewish-owned company was transferred to "''Aryan''" proprietors in 1938; after 1945 legitimate ownership was restored.

'''Kallil Temple''' is a [[Jain temple]] located at [[Kerala]], [[South India]]. It is 12&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Perumbavoor ]] in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Kallil in Malayalam means 'in stone'. It is one of the most ancient Jain temple in Kerala.&lt;ref name= CPR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpreecenvis.nic.in/Database/KallilcavetempleMethala_2892.aspx|title=Kallil cave temple Methala}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the protected monuments in Kerala under [[Archaeological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;http://asi.nic.in/asi_protected_monu_kerala.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The temple, located in a 28-acre (113,000 m²) plot, is cut from a huge rock, and a climb of 120 steps leads to the temple. To reach the temple one has to travel a distance of about 2&amp;nbsp;km from [[Odakkali]], on the [[Aluva]] [[Munnar]] Road and 10&amp;nbsp;km from [[Perumbavoor]]. The temple is owned by the Kallil [[Pisharody]] family. The present [[Karanavar]] of the family turned over all the administrative control of the temple and all its belongings to 'Chenkottukonam Sree Ramadasashramam'. But all that retrieved back due to some hassle between local people and Ashram authorities.

== Main deity ==

Rock-carved images of the 23rd [[Tirthankara]], [[Parshvanatha]], ''Vardhaman [[Mahavira]]'' (24th ''Tirthankara'') and [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmavati devi]] are present in the  temple.&lt;ref name= CPR/&gt; ''Padmavati devi'' is worshipped as ''Bhagawathi'' by the local population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1359">'''Kumbara Gowdas''' are a community of people residing in [[Karnataka]]. They are among the oldest communities and inhabitants of Karnataka. Their profession in old days was that of making pottery. In the recent years like many other communities they have abandoned their age old profession. Each village had a pot maker in old days, and Kumbara Gowdas form a large proportion of rural folk. But they lack political representation like the majority of politically backward castes today. The life, sincerity and devotion of Kumbara Gowdas is portrayed in the movie "Baktha Kumbara" about the legendary potmaker and devotee of lord [[Vittala]]. They signify the importance of each group of people for the functioning of the village contributing their bit, which made each village self-sufficient and hence a mini republic.

Some of the great devotees of kumbara are as follows:
Shalivahana Sarvagna of Karnataka, 
Tiruneelakantar of Tamil Nadu, 
Bhakta Ghora Kumbara, 
Srihari Bhaktaraka Kumbara of Maharashtra.
People must have been enjoying reading the sarvagna vachana.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8339">In 1790, Pope [[Pius VI]] entirely revised the ecclesiastical map of France to fit the new administrative map: dioceses were now to coincide with departments (the new administrative units), and consequently all [[List of Ancien Régime dioceses of France|Ancien Régime dioceses]] disappeared. Many former bishoprics remained heads of the new dioceses, but many cities lost their bishop. But the [[papacy]] did not accept those changes, and for more than a decade, the new French ecclesiastical hierarchy was technically in [[Schism (religion)|schism]] with Rome.

In 1801, following the Concordate First Consul [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] signed with Pope [[Pius VI]], a compromise was found, but it was not before the late 1810s that a stable ecclesiastical organisation was reached, in which one diocese was more or less coterminous with one department. A few exceptions were retained, especially in departments where there was a particularly numerous population.

In December 2002, Pope [[John Paul II]] completely redrew the map of French ecclesiastical provinces: for this, see the post-2002 [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of France]].

The following is a list of French ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses from 1825 to 2002. Except where stated, one diocese coincided with one department.

These spiritualists range from conventional Islamic priests (Limam) who are versed in the Qu'ran and preside over services at local mosques, to local healers and diviners who mix Islam with indigenous beliefs and practices. Some marabouts que salen de mi culo practices resemble those of getba, with Islamic verses replacing cowries. Most marabouts receive gifts or money for their services, with the most respected and renowned marabouts drawing substantial income from their practice. However, these practices are generally disapproved by Islamic disorthodoxy.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[West Africa]], and (historically) in the [[Maghreb]]. The marabout is often a scholar of the [[Qur'an]], or religious teacher.  Others may be wandering holy men who survive on alms, [[Sufi]] [[Murshid]]s ("Guides"), or leaders of religious communities. A similar term, marbot, is used in Indonesia for an administrator of the mosque/mosque premises.

== Etymology ==
The term Marabout appears during the [[Muslim conquest of North Africa]]. It is derived from the Arabic word "''Mourabit''" or "''mrabet''" (''one who is garrisoned''):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9050725/marabout marabout -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia].&lt;/ref&gt; religious students and military volunteers who manned the [[Ribat]]s at the time of the conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuitdorient.com/n23i21.htm "LE SOUFISME: Problèmes de terminologie : soufi, marabout, fakir et derviche" from www.nuitdorient.com], 3 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Today "marabout" means "a saint" in the [[Berber language]], and refers to Sufi Muslim teachers who head a lodge or school called a [[zaouia|zaouïa]], associated with a specific school or tradition, called a [[Tariqah]] ('''{{lang|ar|طريقه}}''' {{transl|ar|Ṭarīqah}}: "way", "path").

The pronunciation of that word varies according to the spoken Berber dialect. For example, it is pronounced "Amrabadh" in the [[Riffian language]]. Marabouts are known as "[[sayyed]]s" ({{lang-ar|سيد}}) to Arabic-speaking Maghribians. Many cities in Morocco got their names from local marabouts, and the name of those cities usually begins with "Sidi" ({{lang-ar|سيدي}}, Maghrebine Arabic for "my sayyid") followed by the name of the local marabout. Standard Arabic for "saint" is "wali" (ولي).

A marabout may also refer to a [[tomb]] ({{lang-ar|قُبّة}} ''qubba'') of a venerated saint, and such places have become holy centers and places of pious reflection.

The roots of this tradition can be traced back to ancient times when the [[Berbers]] believed in the polytheistic religions. [[Herodotus]] mentioned the tradition too, when he has spoke of the Nasamones bringing animal sacrifices to the tombs of holy men.

== West Africa ==

=== Muslim religious teachers ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een marabout TMnr 20031376.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a marabout in [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] (modern [[Burkina Faso]]) around 1970]]
Muslim religious brotherhoods ([[Tariqah]] in the [[Sufi]] tradition) are one of the main organizing forms of West African Islam, and with the spread of Sufi ideas into the area, the marabout's role combined with local practices throughout [[Senegambia]], the [[Niger river]] valley, and the [[Futa Jallon]]. Here, Sufi believers follow a marabout, elsewhere known as a [[Murshid]] ("''Guide''"). Marabout was also adopted by French colonial officials, and applied to most any [[imam]], Muslim teacher, or secular leader who appealed to Islamic tradition.

Today marabouts can be traveling holy men who survive on alms, religious teachers who take in young [[talibes]] at Qur'anic schools, or distinguished religious leaders and scholars, both in and out of the Sufi brotherhoods which dominate spiritual life in Senegambia.&lt;ref&gt;Lamin O. Sanneh, ''The Crown and the Turban: Muslims and West African''. [[Westview Press]] (1997) {{ISBN|0-8133-3059-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], marabouts are organized in elaborate hierarchies; the highest marabout of the [[Mourides]], for example, has been elevated to the status of a [[Caliph]] or ruler of the faithful ([[Amir al-Mu'minin]]). Older, North African based traditions such as the [[Tijaniyyah]] and the [[Qadiriyyah]] base their structures on respect for teachers and religious leaders who, south of the Sahara, often are called marabouts. Those who devote themselves to prayer or study, either based in communities, religious centers, or wandering in the larger society, are named marabouts.  In [[Senegal]] and [[Mali]], these Marabouts rely on donations to live. Often there is a traditional bond to support a specific marabout that has accumulated over generations within a family. Marabouts normally dress in traditional West African robes and live a simple, ascetic life.

=== Syncretic spiritualists ===

The spread in sub-Saharan Africa of the marabout's role from the 8th through 13th centuries created in some places a mixture of roles with pre-Islamic priests and divines. Thus many fortune tellers and self-styled spiritual guides take the name "marabout" (something rejected by more orthodox Muslims and Sufi brotherhoods alike). The recent diaspora of West Africans (to [[Paris]] in particular) has brought this tradition to [[Europe]] and [[North America]], where some marabouts advertise their services as fortune tellers. An Exu of [[Quimbanda]], Marabô, is believed to have carried this esoteric and shamanic role into Brazil. Contemporary marabouts in Senegal advertise on television and have hot lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31859284 Contemporary marabouts.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahmadou Bamba]], Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacké (1853-1927) (Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in Wolof, Shaykh Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ḥabīb Allāh in Arabic, also known as Khadīmu 'l-Rasūl or "The Servant of the messenger" in Arabic, and as Sëriñ Tuubaa or "Cheikh of Tuubaa" in Wolof), was a Muslim Sufi religious leader in Senegal and the founder of the large Mouride Brotherhood (the Muridiyya). See Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal.

Cheikh [[Ahmadou Bamba]] was a mystic and religious leader who produced a prodigious quantity of poems and tracts on meditation, rituals, work, and Qur'anic study. Politically, Ahmadou Bamba led a pacifist struggle against French colonialism while not waging outright war on the French as several prominent Tijaan marabouts had done.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some Zawiyas linked with specific marabouts ===

Note that these are not places of formal pilgrimage (limited in Islam to religious pilgrimages of the [[Hadj]] and [[Jerusalem]]), but are rather places of reflection and inspiration for the pious.

&lt;!--

Ils ne demandent en général pas de salaire pour leurs actions, mais l'obligation morale tacite est de pourvoir à leur besoins, qui, dans la mesure où ils sont ascètes, se réduisent à la nourriture et à la boisson, ainsi qu'au vêtement. Ils s'interdisent de demander un salaire car c'est ainsi que [[Mahomet]], prophète de l'islam et modèle de vie pour les musulmans [[sunnisme|sunnites]], décrit la personne qui cherche à rencontrer [[Dieu]] : les prophètes, ainsi que ceux qui veulent s'inspirer de leurs vies, ne s'intéressent pas aux choses de ce monde mais accordent une importance particulière a la recherche de la vérité sur l'au-delà.

Dans le Maghreb, les marabouts sont le plus souvent musulmans. Ils basent leurs techniques sur une lecture [[ésotérique]] du [[Coran]]. L'attention est portée sur un système de numérologie assez similaire au système de [[Kabbale|la kabbale]], la lecture de certains [[aya (islam)|versets]], aux bénédictions ([[fatiha]]). On peut même y trouver des rites [[animisme|animistes]].

En [[Afrique sub-saharienne]], l'usage du terme a été étendu aux prêtres, chasseurs traditionnels ou sorciers relevant de rites animistes traditionnels, [[vaudou]]s ou [[yoruba]] par exemple, travaillant à guérir leurs patients d'un mal, ou aider à toute autre action sociale. Bien qu'abusif car se rapportant à des pratiques sans rapport avec l'Islam, [[marabout (Afrique)|cet usage]] est néanmoins devenu courant.

'''Muscular Christianity''' was a philosophical movement that originated in England in the mid-19th century, characterised by a belief in patriotic duty, manliness, the moral and physical beauty of athleticism, teamwork, discipline, self-sacrifice, and "the expulsion of all that is effeminate, un-English, and excessively intellectual."&lt;ref&gt;Newsome, D. ''Godliness and Good Learning''. London, 1961, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement came into vogue during the [[Victorian era]] as a method of building character in students at English public schools, and is most often associated with English author [[Thomas Hughes]] and his 1857 novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'', as well as writers [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[Ralph Connor]]. American President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was raised in a household that practiced Muscular Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andres|first1=Sean|title=101 Things Everyone Should Know about Theodore Roosevelt|date=2014|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1440573576|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt, Kingsley, and Hughes promoted physical strength and health as well as an active pursuit of [[Christianity|Christian]] ideals in personal life and [[Christianity and politics|politics]].

Proponents of Muscular Christianity draw support from [[Paul the Apostle]], who used [[New Testament athletic metaphors|athletic metaphors]] to describe the challenges of a Christian life.&lt;ref name=Watson07&gt;Watson, Nick J.

* [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:7&amp;version=NIV 2 Timothy 4:7]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the explicit advocacy of sport and exercise in Christianity did not appear until 1762, when [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' described [[physical education]] as important for the formation of moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Watson | first = Nick J. | authorlink =  | author2 = Stuart Weir | author3 = Stephen Friend | title = The Development of Muscular Christianity in Victorian Britain and Beyond | journal = Journal of Religion &amp; Society | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = paragraph 7 | publisher =  | year = 2005 |url=https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/840/  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Muscular Christianity" became well known in a review by the barrister [[T. C. Sandars]] of Kingsley's novel ''Two Years Ago'' in the February 21, 1857 issue of the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Watson07/&gt;&lt;ref name = LaddMath&gt;{{cite book | last = Ladd | first = Tony |author2=James A.

In addition to the beliefs stated above, muscular Christianity preached the spiritual value of sports, especially team sports.  As Kingsley said, "games conduce, not merely to physical, but to moral health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kingsley | first = Charles | year = 1879 | edition = 1887 | chapter = Nausicaa in London: or, The Lower Education of Women | title = Health and Education | publisher = Macmillan and Co | page = 86 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=K0QEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 | accessdate = 2011-06-13}} Quoted by Ladd and Mathisen).&lt;/ref&gt;  An article on a popular nineteenth-century Briton summed it up thus: "[[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]] is perhaps the finest specimen of muscular Christianity that this or any other age has produced.  Three men seemed to have struggled within his breast—the devout Christian, the earnest philanthropist, the enthusiastic athlete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anonymous | year = 1895 | title = 'Rob Roy' MacGregor | journal = The London Quarterly and Holborn Review | volume = 84 | pages = 71–86 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tcwZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 | accessdate = 2012-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was controversial.  For one example, a reviewer mentioned "the ridicule which the 'earnest' and the 'muscular' men are doing their best to bring on all that is manly", though he still preferred "'earnestness' and 'muscular Christianity'" to eighteenth-century propriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Reviews: ''Essays Sceptical and Anti-Sceptical on Problems Neglected or Misconceived'', by Thomas DeQuincey | date = June 5, 1958 | journal = The Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres, Science, and Art | issue = 2159 | pages = 538–540 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GIxGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA539 | accessdate = 2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For another, a clergyman at [[Cambridge University]] horsewhipped a friend and fellow clergyman after hearing that he had said grace without mentioning Jesus because a Jew was present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = News of the Week | date = Feb 9, 1861 | journal = The Spectator | volume = 34 | issue = 1702 | page = 124 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GU3hAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124 | accessdate = 2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A commentator said, "All this comes, we fear, of Muscular Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = Feb 9, 1861 | title = Argumentum Baculinum | journal = The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art | volume = 11 | issue = 276 | pages = 141–142 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9UcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA142 | accessdate = 2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1901, muscular Christianity was influential enough in England that one author could praise "the Englishman going through the world with rifle in one hand and Bible in the other" and add, "If asked what our muscular Christianity has done, we point to the [[British Empire]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cotton Minchin | first = J. G. | title = Our Public Schools: Their Influence on English History; Charter House, Eton, Harrow, Merchant Taylors', Rugby, St. Paul's Westminster, Winchester | publisher = Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co | page = 113 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b-1JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22muscular+Christianity%22 | accessdate = 2009-11-09 | year = 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscular Christianity spread to other countries in the 19th century.  It was well entrenched in Australian society by 1860, though not always with much recognition of the religious element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brown | first = David W. | year = May 1987 | title = Muscular Christianity in the Antipodes: Some Observations on the Diffusion and Emergence of a Victorian Ideal in Australian Social Theory | journal = Sporting Traditions: The Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History | volume = 3 |issue=2 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1987/st0302/st0302f.pdf | accessdate = 6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] it appeared first in private schools and then in the [[YMCA]] and in the preaching of evangelists such as [[Dwight L. Moody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heather | first = Hendershot | year = 2004 | title = Shaking the World for Jesus: Media and Conservative Evangelical Culture | publisher = University of Chicago Press | isbn = 0-226-32679-9 | page = 226}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The addition of athletics to the YMCA led to, among other things, the invention of [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]].)  Parodied by [[Sinclair Lewis]] in ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (though he had praised the [[Oberlin College]] YMCA for its "positive earnest muscular Christianity") and out of step with theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], its influence declined in American mainline [[Protestantism]].  Nonetheless, it was felt in such [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] organizations as the [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]], [[Athletes in Action]], and the [[Promise Keepers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Putney | first = Clifford | year = 2001 | title = Muscular Christianity: Manhood and Sports in Protestant America, 1880–1920  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tkgpnpfWm2gC&amp;pg=PA205#v=twopage&amp;f=false | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | pages = 205–206 | isbn = 0-674-01125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the push for a more masculine Christianity has been made by [[New Calvinism|New Calvinist]] pastors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], who claims, "God revealed Himself in the Bible pervasively as king not queen; father not mother. Second person of the Trinity is revealed as the eternal Son not daughter; the Father and the Son create man and woman in His image and give them the name man, the name of the male." Because of this, Piper contends "that God has given Christianity a masculine feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Murashko | first = Alex | year = 2012 | title = John Piper: God Gave Christianity a 'Masculine Feel'  | url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/john-piper-god-gave-christianity-a-masculine-feel-68385/ | work = [[The Christian Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, athletes such as [[Ben Zobrist]], [[Tim Tebow]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Josh Hamilton]], and [[Jeremy Lin]] have also exemplified Muscular Christianity through sharing their faith with their fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Christine Thomasos | year = 2012 | title = Tim Tebow Brings In a New Wave of Christian Athleticism | url = http://www.christianpost.com/news/tim-tebow-brings-in-a-new-wave-of-christian-athleticism-58871/| work = [[The Christian Post]]|quote=Tebow inspired a new term by ESPN, known as 'muscular Christianity.'

'''Namdhari''' is an Indian religious group. 

==Role in Indian freedom movement==
The British Indian records list the extremist activities of the Namdhari Sikhs during the 1870s. While they were occasionally hailed as [[freedom fighter]]s, their activities included attacks on [[cow slaughter]] issue, resulting in killings of some Muslim butchers in [[Amritsar]] and [[Ludhiana]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;The Asiatic review, Volume 15 By East India Association (London, England) page 275  .. the Namdhari, an extremist Sikh sect, not being found north or west of the ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SangeetaRay2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Schwarz|author2=Sangeeta Ray|title=A companion to postcolonial studies | year = 2004 | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-631-20663-7|pages=261–}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of 66 Namdhari Sikhs were blown up by a cannon in 1872 for protesting against the British; there is a memorial to them at Namdhari Shidi Smarg Malerkotla in Indian Punjab.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Bajinder Pal, 2005.

The '''Nic Diederichs Technical High School Tragedy''' was an incident on 17 August 2008 at the Nic Diederichs Technical High School in [[Krugersdorp]], South Africa, in which 18-year-old [[Matriculation in South Africa|matric]] (Grade 12) student Morné Harmse attacked four people with a [[katana|samurai sword]].&lt;ref name="NEWS241"&gt;{{cite web | title = Harmse 'liked to sharpen sword' | publisher = News24 | date = 27 August 2008 | url = http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2383751,00.html | accessdate = 16 September 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913005201/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_2383751,00.html | archivedate = 13 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen-year-old grade 9 pupil Jacques Pretorius was killed,&lt;ref name="SABCNEWS1" /&gt; and two campus [[gardener]]s and a second pupil were seriously injured. Harmse later pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and three charges of attempted murder and was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.

Harmse was reported to have "followed" the practice of [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="CAPEARGUS1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'Satanism blamed in wake of Krugersdorp sword slaying' | publisher =  ''Cape Argus'' | date = 21 August 2008 | url = http://www.capeargus.co.za/?fArticleId=4570367 | accessdate = 16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SABCNEWS1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'Learner blames Satan for murderous rampage' | publisher =  ''[[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC News]]'' | date = 18 August 2008 | url = http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/general/0,2172,175609,00.html | accessdate = 4 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826021605/http://www.sabcnews.com/south_africa/education/0,2172,175374,00.html|archivedate=26 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THETIMES1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'The devil didn't make him do it' | publisher =  ''[[The Times]]'' | date = 19 August 2008 | url = http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=824987 | accessdate = 16 September 2008|quote=Rumours of Satanism playing a part in high-profile murders should not be taken seriously, according to the head of the police's investigative psychology unit.

== The attack ==
At about 7:00 a.m. ([[South African Standard Time|SAST]]), Harmse arrived at school in his school uniform, wearing a brown mask and with black paint on his face.&lt;ref name="THETIMES1" /&gt; The mask was reported to be an imitation of the one Slipknot lead vocalist [[Corey Taylor]] wears,&lt;ref name="SUNDAYIND1" /&gt; which Harmse had referred to as the "maggot mask" but the media claimed that it resembled [[Joey Jordison]]'s own mask and not Taylor's. Two other masks were found in Harmse's bag; one clown mask from a Hollywood costume store similar to [[Shawn Crahan]]'s, and the other, a handmade [[papier-mâché]] with holes drilled in and painted with [[tribal]] marks.&lt;ref name="SUNDAYIND1" /&gt; Three [[samurai sword]]s were also found in his bag, which included a Sekizo Ninja sword and a small [[Katana]].

At about 7:20 a.m.,&lt;ref name="NEWS242" /&gt; during an assembly for a congregation, Harmse took out his 60-cm samurai sword, and slashed 16-year-old pupil Jacques Pretorius' neck, causing him to die immediately. Harmse then walked down a passage and slashed 17-year-old Stefan Bouwer on the head,&lt;ref name="THETIMES2" /&gt; and was then immediately confronted by two school groundskeepers, Joseph Kodiseng and Simon Manamela,&lt;ref name="THETIMES2"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'Sword killer wanted to be somebody' | publisher =  ''[[Sunday Independent (South Africa)|The Sunday Independent]]'' | date = 24 August 2008 | url = http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/Article.aspx?id=828706 | accessdate = 18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were both slashed and injured. All three were taken to hospital.

Harmse's attack was concluded when he sat down on a brick wall and stuck the sword in the ground, which was grabbed by his younger brother, Corné,&lt;ref name="THETIMES2" /&gt; who was standing nearby.&lt;ref name="THETIMES1" /&gt; At about 7:45 a.m., Harmse was escorted to the principal's office, and fifteen minutes later, was arrested by police without incident. He was temporarily held in the custody of the Krugersdorp Police Station.&lt;ref name="THETIMES1" /&gt;

== Conviction ==
On 20 August 2008, Harmse was charged with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder at the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref name="IOL"&gt;{{cite web  | title = ' Teen in court after Samurai-style killing ' | publisher =  ''[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]'' | date = 20 August 2008 | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;set_id=1&amp;art_id=vn20080820163038819C618761| accessdate = 18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later sent to the Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital for [[mental health]] evaluation.&lt;ref name="IOL" /&gt; On 25 October, after two consecutive months of mental health evaluation and two postponements of the court date, Harmse was ruled to be mentally fit by Magistrate Joachim Nortje.&lt;ref name="IOL1025"&gt;{{cite news  | title = Sword slaying suspect fit for trial | newspaper = Independent Online | date = 25 October 2008 | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20081025092307686C661582&amp;set_id=| accessdate = 26 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was transferred to the [[South Gauteng High Court]] in [[Johannesburg]] for trial in front of Judge Gerhardus Hattingh. On 14 April 2009 Harmse pleaded guilty to all four charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Sword killer' pleads guilty |date=14 April 2009 |newspaper=News24 |agency=Sapa |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Sword-killer-pleads-guilty-20090414 |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 10 October, he was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sword killer gets 20 years |date=10 October 2009 |newspaper=News24 |agency=Sapa |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Sword-killer-gets-20-years-20090910 |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
=== Blame on Satanism and media ===
In the aftermath of the attacks, blame was put on [[Satanism]], which Harmse took an interest in. Harmse claimed that [[Satan]] had told him to do it,&lt;ref name="THETIMES1" /&gt; and that he followed the practice of Satanism. When police executed a search in Harmse's room, they found "disturbing elements of Satanism" that included [[Ouija|ouija boards]] and "spell books."

Heavy metal act [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] was also blamed for the attacks as Harmse obtained masks resembling those of the band members, and was reportedly listening to the band months before.&lt;ref name="SUNDAYIND1" /&gt; This resulted in media attention and criticism of the band,&lt;ref name="DAILYMAIL1" /&gt; who initially responded with "no comment".

Slipknot frontman [[Corey Taylor]] later issued a response to Harmse's actions:&lt;ref name="DAILYDISPATCHER1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'How deadly is our music ... really?' | publisher =  ''Daily Dispatch'' | date = 25 August 2008 | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=13&amp;set_id=1&amp;art_id=vn20080820163038819C618761| accessdate = 18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Obviously, I'm disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died. As far as my responsibility for that goes, it stops there, because I know our message is actually very positive. I'm not encouraging anybody to kill anybody. I encourage our fans to express themselves, to stick together and to help each other.}}

=== Apology ===
The parents of Morné Harmse, Machiel and Liza Harmse, issued a formal apology to the Pretorius family.&lt;ref name="CALGARYHERALD1"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 'Satanism blamed in teen's killing' | publisher =  ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' | date = 25 August 2008 | url = http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=1b06e0de-7b39-4404-9158-63dc7edc651d| accessdate = 18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niketas''' was a 7th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] officer. He was the son and heir of the [[Sassanid Persia]]n general and briefly ''[[shahanshah]]'', [[Shahrbaraz]].

==Biography==
Niketas was the son of [[Shahrbaraz]], a famous [[Persian people|Persian]] general who had led [[Sassanid army|Sassanid armies]] in [[Diocese of the East|Syria]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Egypt]] during the [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628]]. After the war ended, [[Shahrbaraz]] remained in control of Egypt and the [[Levant]] lands, until in early 629 he handed them back to the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] in exchange for Byzantine support in his own bid for the Persian throne. To conclude the pact, Niketas, who was recognized as Shahrbaraz' heir by Heraclius, was given the Byzantine rank of ''[[patrikios]]'', while his sister Nike was married to Theodosios, one of Heraclius' sons.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi (2003), pp. 152, 188&lt;/ref&gt; Niketas and another of his brothers came to live in the Byzantine court, practically as hostages. As a token of their alliance, in summer/early autumn 629, Niketas returned the Christian relics of the [[Holy Sponge]] and the [[Holy Lance]] to Heraclius from [[Jerusalem]], then still under control of Shahrbaraz's Persian troops. It is probable that at this time, Niketas converted to Christianity; as he was his father's heir-apparent, this opened the prospect of the Christianization of Persia should Shahrbaraz be able to maintain his power there.&lt;ref&gt;Kaegi (2003), pp. 188–189, 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his father's murder, Niketas remained in Byzantine service, and re-appears in 636 as one of the many Byzantine commanders during the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] against the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Arabs]], although which army he led is unknown. He survived the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk and fled to [[Emesa]], from where he contacted the Caliph [[Umar]]. Niketas allegedly offered to help the Arabs conquer Persia, but Umar distrusted him and had him executed.&lt;ref&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 943&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], there are five exams: [[Theology]], [[Worship and Sacraments]], [[Ecclesiastical polity|Polity]], [[Biblical Exegesis]] (undertaken in either Biblical Greek or Hebrew, with the same language for all students taking the exam at the same time.), and the [[Bible Content Exam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oga.pcusa.org/section/mid-council-ministries/prep4min/standard-ordination-exams/&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three, respectively, are taken via the Internet over the course of two days. The fourth exam is given to students at the conclusion of the other three exams, and is taken home for completion. In addition, all candidates for ministry must pass a fifth ordination exam typically given the first year of seminary called the [[Bible Content Exam]].

Exams are graded by at least two readers. Each reader assigns a grade of Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory to each essay question. Then if the student passes a majority of questions for that reader, the reader assigns a Satisfactory grade. If one reader passes a student, and a second fails that student, a third reader is then called in to make a final judgment and the use of the third reader is not visible to the student or their ordaining body.

Special considerations are made for students whose first language is not English, and the exam is regularly administered in Spanish and Korean.

It is common for students to have to take their exams several times before passing. Up to 28% of ordained ministers will have repeated at least one exam. Some, though not all, presbyteries impose a limit on the number of times their candidates may attempt an exam. Others allow for alternative formats. Still, a fair number of students do not pass all of their exams after several tries. It is not unheard of for a candidate to be dismissed from the [[Holy Orders|ordination]] process after multiple attempts to pass the tests have failed.

In addition, Presbyterian seminarians are required to pass an examination covering the content of the [[Bible]]. Practice exams are available here [http://www.whitneyhq.com/biblecontent/].

&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christianity|Christian]] belief of the state of sin in which humanity exists since the [[fall of man]], stemming from [[Adam and Eve]]'s rebellion in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], namely the sin of disobedience in consuming the [[forbidden fruit]] from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as [[total depravity]] or automatic guilt of all humans through [[Collective accountability|collective guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodd|first=Jefferey|title=World Religions|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|year=2003|location=Winona, MN|isbn=978-0-88489-725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the doctrine==
[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 022.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the sin of Adam and Eve from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
The doctrine of [[ancestral fault]] ({{lang|grc|προγονικὸν ἁμάρτημα}} ''progonikon hamartema''), i.e. the sins of the forefathers leading to punishment of their descendants, was presented as a tradition of immemorial antiquity in [[ancient Greek religion]] by [[Celsus]] in his ''[[The True Word|True Doctrine]]'', a polemic ''attacking'' Christianity.
Celsus is quoted as attributing to "a priest of Apollo or of Zeus" the saying that "the [[mills of the gods]] grind slowly, even to children's children, and to those who are born after them".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Ὀψὲ, φησι, θεῶν ἀλέουσι μύλοι, και Ἐς παίδων παῖδας τοί κεν μετόπισθη γένωνται.}} {{cite book|last=Gagné|first=Renaud |title=Ancestral Fault in Ancient Greece|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fbn1AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-03980-3|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of [[divine justice]] taking the form of [[collective punishment]] is also ubiquitous in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ten Plagues of Egypt]], destruction of [[Shechem]], etc.  and most notably the punishments inflicted on the Israelites for lapsing from   [[Yahweh|Yahwism]]; explicitly in Isaiah 14:21, Exodus 20:5, Exodus 34:6-7, Jeremiah 32:18. Krašovec, Jože, ''Reward, punishment, and forgiveness: the thinking and beliefs of ancient Israel in the light of Greek and modern views'', BRILL, 1999, p 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

St Paul's idea of [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemption]] hinged upon the contrast between the sin of Adam and the death and resurrection of Jesus. "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned."&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 5:12&lt;/ref&gt; "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor. 15:22&lt;/ref&gt; Up till then the transgression in the Garden of Eden had not been given great significance. According to the Jesus scholar [[Geza Vermes]]:

{{quote|Paul believed that Adam's transgression in a mysterious way affected the nature of the human race. The primeval sin, a Pauline creation with no biblical or post-biblical Jewish precedent, was irreparable by ordinary human effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Geza|title=Christian Beginnings from Nazareth to Nicea|year=2012|publisher=Allen Lane, Penguin Books|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The formalized [[early Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of original sin was first developed in the 2nd century by [[Irenaeus]], the [[Bishop of Lyon]], in his struggle against [[Gnosticism]].{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} Irenaeus contrasted their doctrine with the view that the Fall was a step in the wrong direction by Adam, with whom, Irenaeus believed, his descendants had some solidarity or identity.&lt;ref&gt;J. N. D. Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1978) p. 171, referred to in Daniel L. Akin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=elzlVK5c3dQC&amp;pg=PA432&amp;dq=JND+Kelly+#v=onepage&amp;q=JND%20Kelly&amp;f=false A Theology for the Church]'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Irenaeus did not believe that Adam's sin was as severe as later tradition would hold, and he was not wholly clear about its consequences.&lt;ref&gt; Tatha Wiley, "Original Sin: Origins, Developments, Contemporary Meanings (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 2002), 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; While the belief that all human beings participate in Adam's sin and share his guilt are not totally foreign concepts for Irenaeus, still his doctrine of Original Sin is rather mild compared with what would later be found in the writings of Augustine. One recurring theme in Irenaeus is his view that Adam, in his transgression, is essentially a child who merely partook of the tree ahead of his time.&lt;ref&gt; Peter C. Bouteneff, "Beginnings" (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2008), 79. &lt;/ref&gt; For Irenaeus, knowing good and evil was an integral aspect of human nature; the 'sin' of Adam was snatching at the fruit of the tree rather than waiting for it as a gift from God.&lt;ref&gt; Irenaeus, "Against Heresies", IV.39. Accessed at http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103439.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Other Greek Fathers would come to emphasize the cosmic dimension of the Fall, namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world, but held fast to belief that man, though fallen, is free.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} They thus did not teach that human beings are deprived of free will and involved in [[total depravity]], which is one understanding of original sin among the leaders of the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

Turner, ''The Patristic Doctrine of the Redemption: A Study of the Development of Doctrine During the First Five Centuries'' (Eugene, Oregon: Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers, 2004) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the doctrines of human depravity and the inherently sinful nature of human flesh were taught by [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], and orthodox Christian writers took great pains to counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Lohse, ''A Short History of Christian Doctrine'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Fortress Press, 1966), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

McGiffert]], ''A History of Christian Thought: Volume 1, Early and Eastern'' (New York; London: C. Scribner's sons, 1932), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Wallace, R. D.

Historian [[Robin Lane Fox]] argues that the foundation of the doctrine of original sin as accepted by the Church was ultimately based on a mistranslation of [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]]  ({{bibleverse||Romans|5:12–21}}) by Augustine, in his ''On the Grace of Christ, and on Original Sin"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible|year=2006|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=9780141022963}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while it is true that the Latin rendering of Rom. 5:12d 'in quo omnes peccaverunt' is a mistranslation, many contemporary exegetes argue that this does not show that Paul had no notion of Original Sin, especially in light of verses 18 and 19 of the same chapter. Rom. 5:12–21, it is argued, must be taken as a whole; the case for Original Sin in Paul must not rest on a single clause in v. 12. &lt;ref&gt; e.g., Douglas J. Moo, "The Epistle to the Romans" (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996); Leon Morris, "The Epistle to the Romans" (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apocryphal books ===
	 
The original sin doctrine can be found in the [[4 Esdras|fourth Book of Esdras]], which refers Adam being responsible for the Fall of man whose offspring inherited the disease and evil.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Adam, what have you done? For though it was you who sinned, the fall was not yours alone, but ours also who are your descendants.─ 4 Esdras 7:48(118)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bible Gateway passage: 2 Esdras 7 - New Revised Standard Version|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Esdras+7&amp;version=NRSV|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first Adam, burdened with an evil heart, transgressed and was overcome, as were also all who were descended from him. Thus the disease became permanent; the law was in the hearts of the people along with the evil root; but what was good departed, and the evil remained. ─ 4 Esdras 3:21-22&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bible Gateway passage: 2 Esdras 3 - New Revised Standard Version|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Esdras+3&amp;version=NRSV|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For a grain of evil seed was sown in Adam’s heart from the beginning, and how much ungodliness it has produced until now—and will produce until the time of threshing comes! ─ 4 Esdras 4:30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bible Gateway passage: 2 Esdras 4 - New Revised Standard Version|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Esdras+4&amp;version=NRSV|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Augustine ===
[[File:Sandro botticelli, sant'agostino nello studio, 1480 circa, dall'ex-coro dei frati umiliati, 01.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote that original sin is transmitted by concupiscence and enfeebles freedom of the will without destroying it.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}}]]
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) taught that Adam's sin&lt;ref&gt;Augustine taught that Adam's sin was both an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') and of pride and disobedience to God of Adam and Eve. He thought it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: self-centeredness or failure in seeing truth. Augustine wrote to [[Julian of Eclanum]]: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit'' (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; PL 44, 795). This particular sin would not have taken place if [[Satan]] had not sown into their senses "the root of evil" (''radix Mali''): ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus'' (''Contra Julianum'', I, 9.42; PL 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; is transmitted by [[concupiscence]], or "hurtful desire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talentshare.org/~mm9n/articles/sindeath/3.htm "Original Sin"]. ''Biblical Apologetic Studies''. Retrieved 17 May 2014.  Augustine of Hippo (354–430) taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or "hurtful desire", sexual desire and all sensual feelings resulting in humanity becoming a massa damnata (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Nicholson.

Retrieved 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in humanity becoming a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], not a [[Psychology|psychological]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]] explained Augustine's doctrine pointing out that the ''libido'' (''concupiscence''), which makes the original sin pass from parents to children, is not a ''libido actualis'', i.e. sexual lust, but ''libido habitualis'', i.e. a wound of the whole of human nature: ''Libido quae transmittit peccatum originale in prolem, non est libido actualis, quia dato quod virtute divina concederetur alicui quod nullam inordinatam libidinem in actu generationis sentiret, adhuc transmitteret in prolem originale peccatum. Sed libido illa est intelligenda habitualiter, secundum quod appetitus sensitivus non continetur sub ratione vinculo originalis iustitiae. Et talis libido in omnibus est aequalis'' (STh Iª–IIae q. 82 a. 4 ad 3).&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not ''a being'' but a ''bad quality'', the [[privation of good]] or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; PL 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; PL 44, 854; ibid. VI, 19.58; PL 44, 857; ibid., II, 10.33; PL 44, 697; ''Contra Secundinum Manichaeum'', 15; PL 42, 590.&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted that sexual concupiscence (''libido'') might have been present in the perfect human nature in [[paradise]], and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine wrote to [[Julian of Eclanum]]: ''Quis enim negat futurum fuisse concubitum, etiamsi peccatum non praecessisset? Sed futurus fuerat, sicut aliis membris, ita etiam genitalibus voluntate motis, non libidine concitatis; aut certe etiam ipsa libidine – ut non vos de illa nimium contristemus – non qualis nunc est, sed ad nutum voluntarium serviente'' (Contra Julianum, IV. 11. 57; PL 44, 766). See also his late work: ''Contra secundam Iuliani responsionem imperfectum opus'', II, 42; PL 45,1160; ibid. II, 45; PL 45,1161; ibid., VI, 22; PL 45, 1550–1551. Cf.{{cite book|title=Le mariage chrétien dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin. Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale|last=Schmitt|first=É.|year=1983|series =Études Augustiniennes| location=Paris|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Augustine's view (termed "Realism"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit. Justo Gonzalez interprets Augustine's teaching that humans are utterly depraved in nature and grace is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], results in conversion, and leads to [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|title=A History of Christian Thought: Volume 2 (From Augustine to the eve of the Reformation)|publisher=Abingdon Press|date=1970–1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine articulated his explanation in reaction to [[Pelagianism]], which insisted that humans have of themselves, without the necessary help of God's grace, the ability to lead a morally good life, and thus denied both the importance of baptism and the teaching that God is the giver of all that is good. Pelagius claimed that the influence of Adam on other humans was merely that of bad example. Augustine held that the effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants not by example but by the very fact of generation from that ancestor. A wounded nature comes to the soul and body of the new person from his/her parents, who experience ''libido'' (or ''concupiscence''). Augustine's view was that human procreation was the way the transmission was being effected. He did not blame, however, the sexual passion itself, but the spiritual ''concupiscence'' present in human nature, soul and body, even after baptismal regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual desire is, according to bishop of Hippo, only one – though the strongest – of many physical realisations of that spiritual libido: ''Cum igitur sint multarum libidines rerum, tamen, cum libido dicitur neque cuius rei libido sit additur, non fere assolet animo occurrere nisi illa, qua obscenae partes corporis excitantur. Haec autem sibi non solum totum corpus nec solum extrinsecus, verum etiam intrinsecus vindicat totumque commovet hominem animi simul affectu cum carnis appetitu coniuncto atque permixto, ut ea voluptas sequatur, qua maior in corporis voluptatibus nulla est; ita ut momento ipso temporis, quo ad eius pervenitur extremum, paene omnis acies et quasi vigilia cogitationis obruatur''. (De civitate Dei, XIV, 16; CCL 48, 438–439 [1–10]). See also: {{cite book|title=Le mariage chrétien dans l'oeuvre de Saint Augustin.

===Cassian===
In the works of [[John Cassian]] (c. 360 – 435), ''Conference'' XIII recounts how the wise monk Chaeremon, of whom he is writing, responded to puzzlement caused by his own statement that "man even though he strive with all his might for a good result, yet cannot become master of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil" (chapter 1). In chapter 11, Cassian presents Chaeremon as speaking of the cases of Paul the persecutor and Matthew the publican as difficulties for those who say "the beginning of free will is in our own power", and the cases of Zaccheus and the [[good thief|good thief on the cross]] as difficulties for those who say "the beginning of our free will is always due to the inspiration of the grace of God", and as concluding: "These two then; viz., the grace of God and free will seem opposed to each other, but really are in harmony, and we gather from the system of goodness that we ought to have both alike, lest if we withdraw one of them from man, we may seem to have broken the rule of the Church's faith: for when God sees us inclined to will what is good, He meets, guides, and strengthens us: for 'At the voice of thy cry, as soon as He shall hear, He will answer thee'; and: 'Call upon Me', He says, 'in the day of tribulation and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me'. And again, if He finds that we are unwilling or have grown cold, He stirs our hearts with salutary exhortations, by which a good will is either renewed or formed in us."&lt;ref name=Conference13&gt;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XI/John Cassian/Conferences of John Cassian, Part II/Conference XIII/Chapter 11 [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume XI/John Cassian/Conferences of John Cassian, Part II/Conference XIII/Chapter 11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassian did not accept the idea of [[total depravity]], on which [[Martin Luther]] was to insist.&lt;ref name="Reformation Europe"&gt;Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, ''[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Elton+%22of+man%27s+total+depravity%22&amp;btnG= Reformation Europe]'' (Wiley-Blackwell 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-631-21384-0}}), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that human nature is fallen or depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that, at the same time, Cassian "baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' – even faith".&lt;ref name=Casiday-faith&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fC0tYhHDHbEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=cassian+baldly+asserts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OFvglZnBsV&amp;sig=NArSD9TzmzlWaaGNmWXDFF6CM3I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XQxATKKRHJr40wSO4NyZDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cassian%20baldly%20asserts&amp;f=false Augustine Casiday, ''Tradition and Theology in St John Cassian'' (Oxford University Press 2007] {{ISBN|0-19-929718-5}}), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Cassian pointed out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. [[Colm Luibhéid]] says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uxaow-3qnRQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Cassian+after+one+chooses+God&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EV0F97kl0S&amp;sig=hzP1s2J5iLsExz2_374bxxKj2xc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E05HTPzgI8P68Aaah4TZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Conferences |author=John Cassian |page=27 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in Cassian's view, according to Casiday, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not ''directly'' caused by God, are totally inadequate and only ''direct'' divine intervention ensures spiritual progress;&lt;ref name=Casiday&gt;[http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/theology/chssa/docs/BookReviews-XXXV_1_-May-23-07-2009.pdf STUDIA HISTORIAE ECCLESIASTICAE May/Mei 2009 Volume XXXV No/Nr 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lauren Pristas says that "for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace".&lt;ref name=Pristas&gt;[http://escholarship.bc.edu/dissertations/AAI9329276/ Lauren Pristas, ''The Theological Anthropology of John Cassian'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church reaction===
Opposition to Augustine's ideas about original sin, which he had developed in reaction to [[Pelagianism]], arose rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk, ''Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation'' (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011), pp. 284–285. {{ISBN| 978-1-4563-8980-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long and bitter struggle several councils, especially the [[Second Council of Orange]] in 529, confirmed the general principles of Augustine's teaching within Western Christianity.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p= Original sin}} However, while the western Church condemned Pelagius, it did not endorse Augustine entirely&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IEPQP87xFcUC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Zackrison+%22did+not+entirely%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FG1GjxHIuM&amp;sig=qlmBhIWheCvpYHx7IGxueznOHU8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8xc2UMeOHsOXhQfawoCwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Zackrison%20%22did%20not%20entirely%22&amp;f=false Edwin Zackrison, ''In the Loins of Adam'' (iUniverse 2004] {{ISBN|9780595307166}}), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and, while Augustine's authority was accepted, he was interpreted in the light of writers such as Cassian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kEXOzNeSgWoC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Gonz%C3%A1lez+%22such+writers+as+Cassian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sPIWCTHUxR&amp;sig=Xh74CSz8cwXylcSFCS6ylacWy6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OBk2UIqjGtSwhAfWjID4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%22such%20writers%20as%20Cassian%22&amp;f=false Justo L. González, ''A History of Christian Thought'' (Abingdon Press 2010] {{ISBN| 9781426721915}}), vol. 2, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the followers of Augustine identified original sin with [[concupiscence]]&lt;ref&gt;In Catholic theology, the meaning of the word "concupiscence" is the movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the operation of the human reason. The apostle St Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the "flesh" against the "spirit". "Concupiscence stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's moral faculties and, without being in itself an offence, inclines man to commit sins" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P8P.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', n. 2515]).&lt;/ref&gt; in the psychological sense, but Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] challenged this identification in the 11th-century, defining original sin as "privation of the righteousness that every man ought to possess", thus separating it from concupiscence. In the 12th century the identification of original sin with concupiscence was supported by [[Peter Lombard]] and others,{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} but was rejected by the leading theologians in the next century, most notably by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas distinguished the supernatural gifts of Adam before the Fall from what was merely natural, and said that it was the former that were lost, privileges that enabled man to keep his inferior powers in submission to reason and directed to his supernatural end. Even after the fall, man thus kept his natural abilities of reason, will and passions. Rigorous Augustine-inspired views persisted among the [[Franciscans]], though the most prominent Franciscan theologians, such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]], eliminated the element of concupiscence and identified original sin with the loss of sanctifying grace.

Eastern Orthodox theology has questioned Western Christianity's ideas on original sin from the outset and does not promote the idea of inherited guilt.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Protestant Reformation===
[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) asserted that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. The second article in [[Lutheranism]]'s [[Augsburg Confession]] presents its doctrine of original sin in summary form:

{{quote|It is also taught among us that since the fall of Adam all men who are born according to the course of nature are conceived and born in sin. That is, all men are full of evil lust and inclinations from their mothers' wombs and are unable by nature to have true fear of God and true faith in God. Moreover, this inborn sickness and hereditary sin is truly sin and condemns to the eternal wrath of God all those who are not born again through Baptism and the Holy Spirit. Rejected in this connection are the [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]] and others who deny that original sin is sin, for they hold that natural man is made righteous by his own powers, thus disparaging the sufferings and merit of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore G. Tappert, ''The Book of Concord: The Confessions of the Evangelical Lutheran Church'', (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1959), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Luther, however, also agreed with the Roman Catholic doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] (that Mary was conceived free from original sin) by saying:
{{quote|[Mary] is full of grace, proclaimed to be entirely without sin. God's grace fills her with everything good and makes her devoid of all evil. God is with her, meaning that all she did or left undone is divine and the action of God in her. Moreover, God guarded and protected her from all that might be hurtful to her.&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works, American edition, vol. 43, p. 40, ed. H. Lehmann, Fortress, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Protestant [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[John Calvin]] (1509–1564) developed a [[systematic theology]] of Augustinian Protestantism by interpretation of [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s notion of original sin. Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception. This inherently sinful nature (the basis for the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] doctrine of "[[total depravity]]") results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities. Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam's fall, but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race, all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his [[Imputation of sin|sin by imputation]]. [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]] by Jesus Christ is the only remedy.

[[John Calvin]] defined original sin in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' as follows:

{{quote|Original sin, therefore, seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused into all parts of the soul, which first makes us liable to God's wrath, then also brings forth in us those works which Scripture calls "works of the flesh" (Gal 5:19). And that is properly what Paul often calls sin. The works that come forth from it – such as adulteries, fornications, thefts, hatreds, murders, carousings – he accordingly calls "fruits of sin" (Gal 5:19–21), although they are also commonly called "sins" in Scripture, and even by Paul himself.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''The Institutes of the Christian Religion'', II.1.8, LCC, 2 vols., trans. Ford Lewis Battles, ed. John T. McNeill (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1960), 251 (page 217 of CCEL edition). Cf. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.html ''Institutes of the Christian Religion''] at the [[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Council of Trent===
The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563), while not pronouncing on points disputed among Catholic theologians, condemned the teaching that in baptism the whole of what belongs to the essence of sin is not taken away, but is only cancelled or not imputed, and declared the concupiscence that remains after baptism not truly and properly "sin" in the baptized, but only to be called sin in the sense that it is of sin and inclines to sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/trent5.htm |title=Paul III Council of Trent-5 |website=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1567, soon after the close of the Council of Trent, [[Pope Pius V]] went beyond Trent by sanctioning Aquinas's distinction between nature and supernature in Adam's state before the Fall, condemned the identification of original sin with concupiscence, and approved the view that the unbaptized could have right use of will.{{sfn|ODCC|2005|p=Original sin}} The Catholic Encyclopedia refers: "Whilst original sin is effaced by baptism concupiscence still remains in the person baptized; therefore original sin and concupiscence cannot be one and the same thing, as was held by the early Protestants (see Council of Trent, Sess. V, can. v).".&lt;ref name="originalsin"&gt;{{cite web|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Original Sin|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11312a.htm|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denominational views==
[[File:B Escorial 18.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Illuminated parchment, Spain, circa AD 950–955, depicting the Fall of Man, cause of original sin]]

===Catholicism===
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from God, not only for himself but for all humans.

Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called "original sin".

As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers, subject to ignorance, suffering and the domination of death, and inclined to sin (this inclination is called "concupiscence").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText |website=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[St. Anselm]] refers: "the sin of Adam was one thing but the sin of children at their birth is quite another, the former was the cause, the latter is the effect"&lt;ref&gt;De conceptu virginali, xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; In a child original sin is distinct from the fault of Adam, it is one of its effects. The effects of Adam's sin according to the Catholic Encyclopedia are:
# Death and Suffering: "One man has transmitted to the whole human race not only the death of the body, which is the punishment of sin, but even sin itself,  which is the death of the soul." 
# Concupiscence or Inclination to sin. Baptism erases original sin but the inclination to sin remains.
# The absence of sanctifying grace in the new-born child is also an effect of the first sin, for Adam, having received holiness and justice from God, lost it not only for himself but also for us. Baptism confers original sanctifying grace, lost through the Adam's sin, thus eliminating original sin and any personal sin.&lt;ref name="originalsin"/&gt;

The Catholic Church teaches that every human person born on this earth is made in the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1B.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText |website=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/Products/MIG-P/man-the-image-of-god.aspx |title=Man, The Image of God Paperback - Christoph Cardinal Schoenborn : Ignatius Press |website=Ignatius.com |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within man "is both the powerful surge toward the good because we are made in the image of God, and the darker impulses toward evil because of the effects of Original Sin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/morality/ |title=Morality |website=Usccb.org |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it explicitly denies that we inherit ''guilt'' from anyone, maintaining that instead we inherit our fallen nature. In this it differs from the Calvinist position that each person actually inherits Adam's guilt, and teaches instead that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants ... but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man".&lt;ref name="vatican.va"/&gt; "In other words, human beings do not bear any 'original guilt' from Adam and Eve's particular sin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredheartprescott.com/Assets/PDFs/Baptism/OriginalSin.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has always held baptism to be for the remission of sins including the original sin, and, as mentioned in [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 403], infants too have traditionally been baptized, though not guilty of any actual personal sin. The sin that through baptism is remitted for them could only be original sin. Baptism confers original sanctifying grace which erases original sin and any actual personal sin. The first comprehensive theological explanation of this practice of baptizing infants, guilty of no actual personal sin, was given by Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], not all of whose ideas on original sin have been adopted by the Catholic Church. Indeed, the Church has condemned the interpretation of some of his ideas by certain leaders of the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' explains that in "yielding to the tempter, Adam and Eve committed a ''personal sin'', but this sin affected ''the human nature'' that they would then transmit in a ''fallen state'' ... original sin is called "sin" only in an analogical sense: it is a sin "contracted" and not "committed"—a state and not an act" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 404).] This "state of deprivation of the original holiness and justice ... transmitted to the descendants of Adam along with human nature" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Profession%20of%20the%20Christian%20Faith ''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 76)] involves no personal responsibility or personal guilt on their part (cf. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 405). Personal responsibility and guilt were Adam's, who because of his sin, was unable to pass on to his descendants a human nature with the holiness with which it would otherwise have been endowed, in this way implicating them in his sin. The doctrine of original sin thus does not impute the sin of the father to his children, but merely states that they inherit from him a "human nature deprived of original holiness and justice", which is "transmitted by propagation to all mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' 404]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theology of the [[Catholic Church]], original sin is the absence of original holiness and justice into which humans are born, distinct from the [[actual sin]]s that a person commits. The absence of sanctifying grace or holiness in the new-born child is an effect of the first sin, for Adam, having received holiness and justice from God, lost it not only for himself but also for us.&lt;ref name="originalsin"/&gt; This teaching explicitly states that "original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants".&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 405]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human beings do not bear any "original guilt" from Adam's particular sin, which is his alone. The prevailing view, also held in Eastern Orthodoxy, is that human beings bear no guilt for the sin of Adam. The Catholic Church teaches: "By our first parents' sin, the devil has acquired a certain domination over man, even though ''man remains free''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm#III Item 407] in section 1.2.1.7. Emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]] is that Mary was conceived free from original sin: "the most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin".&lt;ref&gt;Pius IX, ''Ineffabilis Deus'' (1854) quoted in ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 491 [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a3p2.htm#490]&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine sees her as an exception to the general rule that human beings are not immune from the reality of original sin.

====Criticism====
Soon after the [[Second Vatican Council]], biblical theologian [[Herbert Haag]] raised the question: ''Is original sin in Scripture?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haag |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Haag |title=Is original sin in Scripture? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zO_YAAAAMAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=[[Sheed and Ward]] |location=New York}} [[German language|German]] or. ed.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=EnWRSQAACAAJ 1966].&lt;/ref&gt; According to his exegesis, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleref2-nb|Gn|2:25|NIV}} would indicate that [[Adam and Eve]] were created from the beginning naked of the [[divine grace]], an originary grace that, then, they would never have had and even less would have lost due to the subsequent events narrated.

The [[Lutheran Church]]es teach that original sin "is a root and fountain-head of all actual sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookofconcord.org/sd-originalsin.php|title=The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord|year=1580|work=[[Book of Concord]]|language=English|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stain of original sin is removed through the sacrament of [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/Quivik_Melinda_A.pdf|title=“Butter in the Sunshine”: The Fragility of Faith and the Gift of Baptism|last=Quivik|first=Melinda A.|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]]|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The [[Eastern Orthodox]] version of ''original sin'' is the view that sin originates with the Devil, "for the devil sinneth from the beginning (1 John iii. 8)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm Catechism of St. Philaret], questions 157&lt;/ref&gt; They acknowledge that the introduction of [[ancestral sin]]&lt;ref&gt;The term "ancestral sin" is also used, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] προπατορικὴ ἁμαρτία (e.g. [http://www.parembasis.gr/2003/03_10_16.htm Πόλεμος και φτώχεια – η ορθόδοξη άποψη,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082731/http://www.parembasis.gr/2003/03_10_16.htm |date=21 July 2011 }} [http://www.monipetraki.gr/sarakosti.html Η νηστεία της Σαρακοστής], [http://www.oodegr.com/oode/protestant/luther_antimonaxismos1.htm Πώς στράφηκε ο Λούθηρος κατά του Μοναχισμού – του Γεωργίου Φλωρόφσκυ]) or προπατορικὸ ἁμάρτημα (e.g., [http://www.apostoliki-diakonia.gr/GR_MAIN/catehism/theologia_zoi/themata.asp?contents=selides_katixisis/contents_TaIeraMistiria.asp&amp;main=kat010&amp;file=4.4.1.htm Απαντήσεις σε ερωτήματα δογματικά – Ανδρέα Θεοδώρου, εκδ.

However, they never accepted Augustine of Hippo's notions of original sin and hereditary guilt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306184415/http://www.stmaryorthodoxchurch.org/orthodoxy/articles/2004-hughes-sin.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|Looks like a church website, and not a theological authority|date=May 2015}}

Orthodox Churches accept the teachings of [[John Cassian]], as do Catholic Churches eastern and western,&lt;ref name="Reformation Europe"/&gt; in rejecting the doctrine of total depravity, by teaching that human nature is "fallen", that is, depraved, but not totally. Augustine Casiday states that Cassian "baldly asserts that God's grace, not human free will, is responsible for 'everything which pertains to salvation' – even faith".&lt;ref name="Casiday-faith"/&gt; Cassian points out that people still have moral freedom and one has the option to choose to follow God. [[Colm Luibhéid]] says that, according to Cassian, there are cases where the soul makes the first little turn,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; while Augustine Casiday says that, in Cassian's view, any sparks of goodwill that may exist, not ''directly'' caused by God, are totally inadequate and only ''direct'' divine intervention ensures spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="Casiday"/&gt; and Lauren Pristas says that "for Cassian, salvation is, from beginning to end, the effect of God's grace".&lt;ref name="Pristas"/&gt;

Eastern Orthodoxy accepts the doctrine of ancestral sin: "Original sin is hereditary. It did not remain only Adam and Eve's. As life passes from them to all of their descendants, so does original sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stavros Moschos |url=http://biserica.org/Publicatii/Catechism/catorsin.htm |title=Original Sin And Its Consequences |website=Biserica.org |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As from an infected source there naturally flows an infected stream, so from a father infected with sin, and consequently mortal, there naturally proceeds a posterity infected like him with sin, and like him mortal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/orthodox_catechism_of_philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'', 168]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox Church in America makes clear the distinction between "fallen nature" and "fallen man" and this is affirmed in the early teaching of the Church whose role it is to act as the catalyst that leads to true or inner redemption. Every human person born on this earth bears the image of God undistorted within themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fatherstephen.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/do-not-resent-do-not-react-keep-inner-stillness |title=Do Not Resent, Do Not React, Keep Inner Stillness &amp;#124; Glory to God for All Things |website=Fatherstephen.wordpress.com |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Orthodox Christian understanding, they explicitly deny that humanity inherited ''guilt'' from anyone. Rather, they maintain that we inherit our fallen nature. While humanity does bear the consequences of the original, or first, sin, humanity does not bear the personal guilt associated with this sin. Adam and Eve are guilty of their willful action; we bear the consequences, chief of which is death."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. John Matusiak, http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=4&amp;SID=3&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of the Eastern Orthodox Church varies on whether Mary is free of all actual sin or [[concupiscence]]. Some Patristic sources imply that she was cleansed from sin at the [[Annunciation]], while the liturgical references are unanimous that she is all-holy from the time of her conception.&lt;ref&gt;Mother Mary and [[Timothy Ware|Ware, Kallistos]], "The Festal Menaion", p. 47. St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oeKOUb6OcG4C&amp;pg=PA410&amp;dq=Cleenewerck+%22sinlessness+of+the+Theotokos%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jLF3U-D8C6jX7Aa9ooDIAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Cleenewerck%20%22sinlessness%20of%20the%20Theotokos%22&amp;f=false Laurent Cleenewerck, ''His Broken Body'' (Euclid University Press 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-61518361-9}}), p. 410&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Anglicanism===
The original formularies of the Church of England also continue in the Reformation understanding of original sin. In the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article IX "Of Original or Birth-sin" states:
{{quote|Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk); but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, Φρονεμα σαρκος, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=The Thirty-Nine Articles |publisher=Anglicans Online |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, more recent doctrinal statements (e.g. the 1938 report ''Doctrine in the Church of England'') permit a greater variety of understandings of this doctrine. The 1938 report summarizes:
{{quote|Man is by nature capable of communion with God, and only through such communion can he become what he was created to be. "Original sin" stands for the fact that from a time apparently prior to any responsible act of choice man is lacking in this communion, and if left to his own resources and to the influence of his natural environment cannot attain to his destiny as a child of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine in the Church of England'', 1938, London: SPCK; p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Methodism===
The [[Methodist Church]] upholds Article VII in the [[Articles of Religion (Methodist)|Articles of Religion]] in the ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church]]'':

{{quote|Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that continually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1649 The United Methodist Church: The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church – Article V—Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710233342/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=1&amp;mid=1649 |date=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Methodist theology teaches that a believer is made free from original sin when he/she is [[entire sanctification|entirely sanctified]]:&lt;ref name="CON2017"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that entire sanctification is that act of God, subsequent to regeneration, by which believers are made free from original sin, or depravity, and brought into a state of entire devotement to God, and the holy obedience of love made perfect. It is wrought by the baptism with or infilling of the Holy Spirit, and comprehends in one experience the cleansing of the heart from sin and the abiding, indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, empowering the believer for life and service. Entire sanctification is provided by the blood of Jesus, is wrought instantaneously by grace through faith, preceded by entire consecration; and to this work and state of grace the Holy Spirit bears witness.&lt;ref name="CON2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2017.manual.nazarene.org/section/christian-holiness-and-entire-sanctification/|title=Christian Holiness and Entire Sanctification|work=Church of the Nazarene Manual 2017–2021|publisher=[[Church of the Nazarene]]|language=English|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Seventh-day Adventism===

[[Seventh-day Adventists]] believe that humans are inherently sinful due to the fall of Adam,&lt;ref name="The SDA Commentary"&gt;The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.5, p.1131.&lt;/ref&gt; but they do not totally accept the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]]/[[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] understanding of original sin, taught in terms of original guilt, but hold more to what could be termed the "[[total depravity]]" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelschule.info/streaming/Woodrow-W.-Whidden---Adventist-Theology---The-Wesleyan-Connection_23617.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adventist Theology: The Wesleyan Connection |author=Woodrow W. Whidden |website=Bibelschule.info |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh-day Adventists have historically preached a doctrine of inherited weakness, but not a doctrine of inherited guilt.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. White, ''Signs of the Times'', 29 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; According to Augustine and Calvin, humanity inherits not only Adam's depraved nature but also the actual guilt of his transgression, and Adventists look more toward the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] model.&lt;ref name="Pfandl original sin"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gerhard Pfandl|url=https://adventistbiblicalresearch.org/sites/default/files/pdf/sinoriginal-web.pdf|title=Some thoughts on Original Sin|publisher=Biblical Research Institute|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part, the Adventist position on original sin reads:

{{quote|The nature of the penalty for original sin, i.e., Adam's sin, is to be seen as literal, physical, temporal, or actual death – the opposite of life, i.e., the cessation of being. By no stretch of the scriptural facts can death be spiritualised as depravity. God did not punish Adam by making him a sinner. That was Adam’s own doing. All die the first death because of Adam’s sin regardless of their moral character – children included.&lt;ref name="Pfandl original sin"/&gt;}}

Early Adventists Pioneers (such as George Storrs and [[Uriah Smith]]) tended to de-emphasise the morally corrupt nature inherited from Adam, while stressing the importance of actual, personal sins committed by the individual. They thought of the "sinful nature" in terms of physical mortality rather than moral depravity.&lt;ref name="Pfandl original sin"/&gt; Traditionally, Adventists look at sin in terms of willful transgressions, and that Christ triumphed over sin. 

Though believing in the concept of inherited sin from Adam, there is no dogmatic Adventist position on original sin.

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
According to the theology of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]], all humans are born sinners, because of inheriting sin, corruption, and death from Adam. They teach that Adam was originally created perfect and sinless, but with free will; that [[the Devil]], who was originally a perfect [[angel]], but later developed feelings of pride and self-importance, seduced [[Eve]], and then through her, persuaded Adam to disobey God, and to obey the Devil instead, rebelling against God's sovereignty, thereby making themselves sinners, and because of that, transmitting a sinful nature to all of their future offspring.&lt;ref name="proclaimers144"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|year=1993|publisher=Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WDtBRT32&gt;{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|year=2005|page=32|publisher=Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of destroying the Devil right away, as well as destroying the disobedient couple, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind, and to prove that man cannot be independent of God successfully, that man is lost without God's laws and standards, and can never bring peace to the earth, and that Satan was a deceiver, murderer, and liar.&lt;ref name="WT 1973"&gt;"The Watchtower 1973, page 724" – "Declaration and resolution", ''The Watchtower'', 1 December 1973, page 724.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that all men possess "inherited sin" from the "one man" Adam and they teach that verses such as Romans 5:12-22, Psalm 51:5, Job 14:4, and 1st Corinthians 15:22 show that man is born corrupt, and dies because of inherited sin and imperfection, that inherited sin is the reason and cause for sickness and suffering, made worse by the Devil's wicked influence. They believe Jesus is the "[[second Adam]]", being the sinless [[Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]], and that he came to undo Adamic sin; and that salvation and everlasting life can only be obtained through faith and obedience to the second Adam.&lt;ref name="proclaimers144"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WDtBRT32/&gt;&lt;ref name="WT 1973"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Penton|first=M.J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1997|pages=26–29|isbn=9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|date=15 January 2006|page=7|title=Angels—How They Affect Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200000089 ADAM] – ''jw.org.''

===Latter-day Saints===
The [[Book of Mormon]], a text sacred to members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], explains that the opportunity to live here in a world where we can learn good and bad is a gift from God, and not a punishment for Adam's and Eve's choice.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:11–25.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Church's founder [[Joseph Smith]] taught, humans had an essentially godlike nature, and were not only holy in a premortal state, but had the potential to progress eternally to become like God.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 64"&gt;Alexander, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote as one of his church's [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]], "We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam’s transgression."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a-of-f|1|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overtime Latter-day Saints took this creed as a rejection of the doctrine of original sin and any notion of inherited sinfulness.&lt;ref name="Alexander, p. 64"/&gt; Thus, while modern members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will agree that the fall of Adam brought consequences to the world, including the possibility of sin, they generally reject the idea that any culpability is automatically transmitted to Adam and Eve's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Merrill|first=Byron R.|contribution=Original sin|contribution-url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4025|pages=1052–1053|editor1-last=Ludlow|editor1-first=Daniel H|editor1-link=Daniel H.

===Swedenborgianism===
In [[Swedenborgianism]], [[exegesis]] of the first 11 chapters of Genesis from ''The First Church'', has a view that [[Adam]] is not an individual person. Rather, he is a symbolic representation of the "Most Ancient Church", having a more direct contact with heaven than all other successive churches.{{sfn|Swedenborg|1749–56|p=410}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3tQJ9j_1ToC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=Arcana+Coelestia+john+f+potts&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20church%20adam&amp;f=false |title=Arcana Coelestia, Vol. 1 of 8 |author=Emanuel Swedenborg |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's view of original sin is referred to as ''hereditary evil'', which passes from generation to generation.{{sfn|Swedenborg|1749–56|p=96, n. 313: "But as to hereditary evil, the case is this. Everyone who commits actual sin thereby induces on himself a nature, and the evil from it is implanted in his children, and becomes hereditary. It thus descends from every parent, from the father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and their ancestors in succession, and is thus multiplied and augmented in each descending posterity, remaining with each person, and being increased in each by his actual sins, and never being dissipated so as to become harmless except in those who are being regenerated by the Lord. Every attentive observer may see evidence of this truth in the fact that the evil inclinations of parents remain visibly in their children, so that one family, and even an entire race, may be thereby distinguished from every other."}} It cannot be completely abolished by an individual man, but can be tempered when someone reforms their own life,{{sfn|Swedenborg|1749-56|p=229, n.719: "There are evils in man which must be dispersed while he is being regenerated, that is, which must be loosened and attempered by goods; for no actual and hereditary evil in man can be so dispersed as to be abolished. It still remains implanted; and can only be so far loosened and attempered by goods from the Lord that it does not injure, and does not appear, which is an arcanum hitherto unknown. Actual evils are those which are loosened and attempered, and not hereditary evils; which also is a thing unknown."}} and are thus held accountable only for their own sins.{{sfn|Swedenborg|1749-56|p=336, n.966: "It is to be observed that in the other life no one undergoes any punishment and torture on account of his hereditary evil, but only on account of the actual evils which he himself has committed."}}

===Quakerism===
Most [[Quakers]] (also known as the Religious Society of Friends), including the founder of Quakerism, [[George Fox]], believe in the doctrine of [[Inward light]], a doctrine which states that there is "that of God in everyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of George Fox |editor=John L. Nickals |publisher=Religious Society of Friends |date=1975 |page=774}} light of Christ, xl, xliii, xliv, 12, 14, 16, 29, 33–5, 60, 64, 76, 80, 88, 92, 115, 117, 135, 143–4, 150, 155, 173, 174–6, 188, 191, 205, 225–6, 234–7, 245, 274–5, 283–4, 294–6, 303–5, 309, 312, 317-335, 339–40, 347–8, 361, 471–2, 496–7, 575, 642&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a common belief among many liberal and universalist Quakers affiliated with the [[Friends General Conference]] and [[Britain Yearly Meeting]], based on the ideas of Quaker Rufus Jones among others, that rather than being burdened by original sin, human beings are inherently good, and the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]], that is, that all people will eventually be saved and reconciled with God.

However, this rejection of the doctrine of original sin or the necessity of salvation is not something that most conservative or evangelical Quakers affiliated with [[Friends United Meeting]] or [[Evangelical Friends Church International]] tend to agree with. Although the more conservative and evangelical Quakers also believe in the doctrine of inward light, they interpret it in a manner consistent with the doctrine of original sin, namely, that people may or may not listen to the voice of God within them and be saved, and people who do not listen will not be saved.

==In Judaism==
The doctrine of "inherited sin" is not found in most of mainstream [[Judaism]]. Although some in [[Orthodox Judaism]] place blame on Adam and Eve for overall corruption of the world, and though there were some Jewish teachers in [[Babylonian Talmud|Babylon]]&lt;ref name="Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 55b"&gt;Babylonian Talmud. Tractate ''Shabbat'' 55b.&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that mortality was a punishment brought upon humanity on account of Adam's sin, that is not the dominant view in most of Judaism today. Modern Judaism generally teaches that humans are born sin-free and untainted, and choose to sin later and bring suffering to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |via={{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Original_Sin.html |title=Judaism's Rejection Of Original Sin |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise}} |authorlink=Alfred J.

Jewish theologians are divided in regard to the cause of what is called "original sin". Others teach that it was due to Adam's yielding to temptation in eating of the [[forbidden fruit]] and has been inherited by his descendants; the majority of [[chazal]]ic opinions, however, do not hold Adam responsible for the sins of humanity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13761-sin SIN:] – Jewish Encyclopedia. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; teaching that, in Genesis 8:21 and 6:5-8, God recognized that Adam did not willfully sin. However, Adam is recognized by some&lt;ref name="Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 55b"/&gt; as having brought death into the world by his disobedience. Because of his sin, his descendants will live a mortal life, which will end in death of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YUbGlHdhBaUC&amp;pg=PA238| title = From Metaphysics to Midrash: Myth, History, and the Interpretation of Scripture in Lurianic Kabbala| author = Shaul Magid |publisher = Indiana University Press |page = 238 |year = 2008 | accessdate= 9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to book ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', in [[Judgement Day]], Adam will disavow any complaints of all men who accuse him as the cause of death of every human on earth. Instead, Adam will reproach their mortality because of their sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ginzberg |first=Louis |year=1909 |url=https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol1/two.htm#17 |title=The Legends of the Jews Vol I : The Death of Eve |others=Translated by Henrietta Szold |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |quote=This is the writing God will bring out on the judgment day, and to each will be made known his deeds.

Is there any among you, and be he the most pious, who has not been guilty of more than one?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islam==
The concept of inherited sin does not exist in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/islam/beliefs/human.htm/ |title=Islamic beliefs about human nature |publisher=ReligionFacts |date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2004|title=Repentance - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-25|quote=Arabic tawbah. A major theme of the Quran, mentioned over seventy times and with an entire surah (9) titled for it. Usually described as turning toward God, asking forgiveness, and being forgiven. Islam has no concept of original sin, need for atonement, or ecclesiastical confession. Repentance and forgiveness are a direct matter between the individual and God, requiring no intercession. In cases of sin against another person, restitution is required. In cases of sin against God, repentance, remorse, and resolution to change one's behavior are considered sufficient. Although classical scholars emphasized the individual dimension of repentance, many revivalists and reformists have tied individual actions to larger issues of public morality, ethics, and social reform, arguing for reimplementation of the Islamic penal code as public expiation for sins. Sufis understand repentance as a process of spiritual conversion toward constant awareness of God's presence. Muhammad reputedly requested God's forgiveness several times daily.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam teaches that Adam and Eve sinned, but then sought [[Repentance in Islam|forgiveness]] and thus were forgiven by [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;John L.

{{quote|But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time." Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.||source=Surah [[Al-Baqara|al-Baqara]]:36–37}}
{{quote|They said: "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves souls. If You forgive us not and bestow not upon us Your mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.||source=Surah [[Al-A'raf|al-Aʻrāf]]:23}}
{{quote|Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.||source=Surah [[Ta-Ha|Ṭā Hāʼ]]:121–122}}

The Qur'an further says about individual responsibility:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]]|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Meaning, every soul shall carry its own injustices, whether disbelief or sin, and none else shall carry its burden of sin, as Allah states

﴾وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَى حِمْلِهَا لاَ يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَى﴿

(And if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin.) (35:18) Allah said,

﴾وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلإِنسَـنِ إِلاَّ مَا سَعَى﴿

(And that man can have nothing but what he does.) So just as no soul shall carry the burden of any other, the soul shall only benefit from the good that one earns for himself. As for the Hadith recorded by Muslim in the Sahih, that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another. And that man can have nothing but what he does (of good and bad). And that his deeds will be seen, Then he will be recompensed with a full and the best [fair] recompense.||source=Surah [[an-Najm]]:38–41}}

'''Our Lady of the Pillar''' ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora del Pilar}}) is the name given to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] associated with the claim of [[Marian apparition]] to Apostle [[James the Greater]] as he was praying by the banks of the [[Ebro]] at [[Caesaraugusta]] (Zaragoza), [[Roman Hispania|Hispania]], in AD 40.
The celebrated wooden image is enshrined at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]] in Saragossa (Zaragoza). 

[[Pope Callixtus III]] granted [[indulgence]]s towards her shrine in 1456.   Since 1730, [[Pope Innocent XIII]] mandated  her veneration throughout the [[Spanish Empire]], and the Virgin Mary invoked under this specific Marian title is considered the Patroness of the Spanish region of Aragon and its capital Saragossa (Zaragoza), and of the [[Spanish Civil Guard]]. Ultimately, [[Pope Pius X]] granted the image its [[canonical coronation]] on 20 May 1905. Her [[Fiestas del Pilar|feast day]] is 12 October, thus coinciding with [[Columbus Day]], celebrated as the [[Fiesta Nacional de España|national holiday]] of Spain.

==History==

===Early tradition===
{{see|Marian column}}
[[File:Aparición de la Virgen del Pilar a Santiago y a sus discípulos zaragozanos.jpg|thumb|The Marian apparition to [[St. James the Greater]] (painting by [[Francisco Goya]], c. 1769)]]
Christian tombs in Saragossa, dating from Roman days, appear to bear images representing the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. 
In the 4th century, the presence of [[votive column|votive images placed on columns or pillars]] is attested.&lt;ref&gt;Nogués y Secall (1862), [https://archive.org/stream/historiacritica00secagoog#page/n54/mode/2up p. 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest written testimony of devotion to the Blessed Virgin in Saragossa (Zaragoza) is usually identified as that of Pedro Librana in 1155.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;March, J.M. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083b.htm "Nuestra Señora Del Pilar" from ''New Advent: The Catholic Encyclopedia'']. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved 26 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the site attracted pilgrims from across the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th century, e.g. reflected in the work ''Milagros de Nuestra Señora'' by [[Gonzalo de Berceo]], dated to the 1250s or early 1260s. The appellation ''Santa María del Pilar'' is attested for 1299.
The claim that the first church had been the oldest in Hispania, built in AD 40 by [[James the Greater]], is first recorded in 1318.&lt;ref&gt;Lasagabáster Arratíbel (1999), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the [[Marian apparition]] can be traced to the 15th century: In either 1434 or 1435, a fire destroyed the alabaster altarpiece. The replacement altarpiece features bas-relief representations of the Marian apparition. The image of the Virgen del Pilar venerated today also dates to this period. It executed in the late Gothic style of [[Juan de la Huerta]].&lt;reF&gt;Mª Carmen Lacarra, Apud Arturo Ansón Navarro y Belén Boloqui Larraya, «Zaragoza Barroca», en Guillermo Fatás Cabeza, (coord.) Guía histórico-artística de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Ayuntamiento (Servicio de acción cultural), 1991, pág. 310. {{ISBN|84-86807-76-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Calixtus III]] in a bull issued on 23 September 1456 declares a seven year [[indulgence]] for those who visit Our Lady of Saragossa. The text of the bull specifically mentions a pillar, for the first time suggesting the existence of an image known as ''Our Lady of the Pillar''.&lt;ref&gt;  Nogués y Secall (1862), [https://archive.org/stream/historiacritica00secagoog#page/n88/mode/1up p. 64], c.f.  De Plancy (1852), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
The feast day of 12 October was officially introduced by the Council of Zaragoza in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Nogués y Secall (1862), [https://archive.org/stream/historiacritica00secagoog#page/n92/mode/2up 68].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the account by [[María de Ágreda]] (d. 1665) in her ''[[Mystical City of God]]'', Mary, mother of Jesus, was transported from Jerusalem to Hispania during the night, on a cloud carried by angels. During the journey, the angels also built a pillar of marble, and a miniature image of Mary with the Child Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Tommy Lane [http://www.frtommylane.com/homilies/pilgrimage/zaragoza_el_pilar.htm Homily during a pilgrimage to Zaragoza, Spain] (undated, frtommylane.com){{verify credibility|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--needs direct citation of ''Mystical City of God''--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approval===
The [[Marian apparition|apparition]] of Our Lady of the Pillar was accepted as canonical by [[Pope Innocent XIII]] in 1723.
So many contradictions{{huh|date=October 2017}} had arisen concerning the miraculous origin of the church that Spain appealed to Innocent XIII to settle the controversy.  After careful investigation, the twelve [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], in whose hands the affair rested, adopted the following account, which was approved by the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] on 7 August 1723, and later inserted in the lessons of the office of the feast of our Lady of the Pillar, celebrated on 12 October:&lt;ref&gt;De Plancy 1852, pg. 261&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Of all the places that Spain offers for the veneration of the devout, the most illustrious is doubtless the sanctuary consecrated to God under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin, under the title of our Lady of the Pillar, at Saragossa.

According to ancient and pious tradition, St. James the Greater, led by Providence into Spain, spent some time at Saragossa. He there received a signal favour from the Blessed Virgin. As he was praying with his disciples one night, upon the banks of the Ebro, as the same tradition informs us, the Mother of God, who still lived, appeared to him, and commanded him to erect an oratory in that place.  The apostle delayed not to obey this injunction, and with the assistance of his disciples soon constructed a small chapel. In the course of time a larger church was built and dedicated, which, with the dedication of [[La Seo Cathedral|Saint Saviour's]], is kept as a festival in the city and [[Diocese of Saragossa]] on the 4th of October.}}

James returned to Jerusalem with some of his disciples where he became a [[martyr]], beheaded in AD&amp;nbsp;44 during the reign of [[Herod Agrippa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08279b.htm Camerlynck, Achille. "St. James the Greater." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His disciples allegedly returned his body to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;De Plancy 1852, pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt; The year AD 40 is the earliest recognised  Marian apparition in the Catholic Church,  dating to a time when Mary, the mother of Jesus, was still alive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=622 "Nuestra Señora del Pilar", Catholic News Agency, October 12, 2017]. According to [[Hyppolitus of Thebes]], Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in AD 41. {{cite book|title = Paul's early period: chronology, mission strategy, theology| author = [[Rainer Riesner]]| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAqa7PYr4kC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Hippolytus+of+Thebes#v=onepage&amp;q=Hippolytus%20of%20Thebes&amp;f=false| accessdate = August 20, 2011}}.

[[Pope Clement XII]] allowed the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of the Pillar all over the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1730.  As the date coincides with the discovery of the [[Americas]], the lady was later named as Patroness of the Hispanic World.&lt;ref name=Custodia&gt;(2011-10-12).

A fire  in 1434 burned down the church that preceded the present basilica.
The construction of the present [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar]], Saragossa ([[Zaragoza]]) was started in 1681 and ended in 1711. 
&lt;!-- Later additions in the 18th century expanded its dimensions to the present {{convert|130|m}} in length, by {{convert|67|m}} in width, crowned by eleven [[cupola]]s, four towers, and ten lantern towers.&lt;ref name=pasapues&gt;Javier Mendívil, [http://www.pasapues.es/english/aragonesasi/zaragoza/zaragoza/basilicapilar.php "The Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, Saragossa, Spain"].  .

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], two bombs hit and damaged the basilica but neither exploded.  The event was reckoned a miracle, and the defused bombs have been on display at the basilica premises ever since.&lt;ref name=MaryPage/&gt;

[[File:Virgen del Pilar sin manto.JPG|thumb|The wooden image and pillar without the mantle (photograph taken on 2 April 2011; the image is displayed without mantle on the 2nd, 12th and 20th day of each month).]]
The wooden statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary is in the [[International Gothic|Late Gothic]] style. It stands {{convert|39|cm|inch}} tall, on a pillar of  [[jasper]] with a height of {{convert|1.8|m|ft}}.  
The statue depicts [[Madonna and Child|Mary with the Child Jesus]] on her left arm, who has a [[dove]] sitting on his left palm.

Some reports state that an earlier wooden image was destroyed when the church burned down in 1434,&lt;ref name=Samaha&gt;John M. Samaha, “[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-the-pillar.php Our Lady of the Pillar],” ''All About Mary''. International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.&lt;/ref&gt; consistent with an attribution of the current image to [[Juan de la Huerta]] (d. 1462) or his school.&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Lacarra, in: Arturo Ansón Navarro, Belén Boloqui Larraya, ''Zaragoza Barroca'', Guillermo Fatás Cabeza, (ed.) ''Guía histórico-artística de Zaragoza'', Zaragoza, Ayuntamiento (Servicio de acción cultural) (1991), p. 310. &lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that folk belief in some cases may be inclined to regard the Saragossa image as [[Acheiropoieta|miraculous]], sculptured by the angels as they transported Mary from Jerusalem to Saragossa (Zaragoza); this mystical tradition goes back to [[María de Ágreda]] (d. 1665),  herself the object of frequent "mystical bilocation" (i.e. she reported that she was often "transported by the aid of the angels" ), who gave an account to this effect in her ''[[Mystical City of God]]''; however, unlike the tradition of the Marian apparition itself, the miraculous origin of the image is not part of the tradition recognized by the Holy See as canonical.

Since the 16th century, the pillar is usually draped in a skirt-like cover called ''manto'' "mantle".&lt;ref name=Samaha/&gt;  
As a whole, it is protected by a bronze case and then another case of silver.&lt;ref name=pasapues&gt;Javier Mendívil, [http://www.pasapues.es/english/aragonesasi/zaragoza/zaragoza/basilicapilar.php "The Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar, Saragossa, Spain"] (pasapues.es). Retrieved on 25 February 2013.{{verify credibility|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The image was [[Canonical Coronation|canonically crowned]] in 1905 during the reign of [[Pope Pius X]].  The crown was designed by the Marquis of Griñi, valued at 450,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (c. [[USD]] 2.6 million as of 2017).&lt;ref&gt;based on the value "£18,750" given by March (1911), historical conversion rate from [http://inflation.stephenmorley.org/ stephenmorley.org]; about USD 5.3 million based on the historical [[gold standard]] of the peseta.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other depictions===
''Our Lady of the Pillar'' is a common motif of the [[Madonna and Child]] in Spanish art; extant examples other than the Saragossa image date from the Renaissance period onward. Depictions become especially numerous following the introduction of the feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730.

The [[fiesta patronal|feast]] of Our Lady of the Pillar is celebrated on 12 October&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianist.com/files/2011/10/World-Day-of-Prayer-2011_En.pdf "Our Lady of the Pillar", Marianists, 9 October 2011]{{verify credibility|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she is the Patroness of the [[Hispanic]] peoples and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Spanish Civil Guard]].  A grand nine-day festival known as ''[[Fiestas del Pilar]]'' is celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza) every year in her honour. The modern ''Fiestas del Pilar'', as they developed since the 19th century, begin on the weekend preceding 12 October and they end on the Sunday after 12 October (i.e. they move between 5&amp;ndash;13 and 11&amp;ndash;19 October). They were declared as a "national holiday of touristic interest" (''Fiesta de Interés Turístico Nacional'') by the ''[[Government_of_Spain|Ministerio de Comercio y Turismo]]'' in 1980.

As 12 October happens to coincide with the day of the year 1492 when [[Guanahani|land]] was first sighted on [[Columbus' First Voyage]], 
the ''[[Fiesta de la Raza Española]]'', first proposed in 1913 by [[Faustino Rodríguez-San Pedro y Díaz-Argüelles]] (in the USA later dubbed "[[Columbus Day]]", as Columbus tends to be considered Italian rather than Spanish in North America) falls on the same date.
The ''Fiesta de la Raza Española'' was declared the national holiday of Spain in a decree by [[Antonio Maura]] and [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|king Alfonso XIII]]
of 1918. The alternative name ''Día de la Hispanidad'' was proposed in the late 1920s by [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], based on a suggestion by Zacarías de Vizcarra.
After the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], on 12 October 1939, the ''Día de la Raza'' was celebrated in Saragossa (Zaragoza), presided by [[Francisco Franco]], with a special devotion to the ''Virgen del Pilar''. Chilean foreign vice-secretary Germán Vergara Donoso commented that the "profound significance of the celebration was the intimate inter-penetration of the homage to the Race and the devotion to Our Lady of the Pillar, i.e. the symbol of the ever more extensive union between America and Spain."&lt;ref&gt;«Las fiestas de la Hispanidad han tenido en Zaragoza un escenario incomparable. (...) El significado profundo de las fiestas fue la compenetración íntima del homenaje a la Raza y la devoción de Nuestra Señora del Pilar, es decir, el símbolo de la unión cada vez más estrecha de América y España.» Gustavo Bueno Sánchez, [«Día de la Hispanidad»http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a224.htm (filosofia.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The name of ''Día de la Hispanidad'' was introduced as the official name of the national holiday in a decree of  9 January 1958.
During the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], there was a proposal to shift the national day to 6 December, the day of adoption of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]], but in the end, in a decree of 1982, the day of 12 October was retained, under the name of  ''Fiesta Nacional de España y Día de la Hispanidad''.&lt;ref&gt;Real Decreto 3217/1981, Boletín Oficial del Estado del año 1982.

In earlier days, Raj Mistry were employed for their services by Kings and were appointed as head craftsman of the Kingdom, just like [[Mistri (caste)|Mistry]] or [[Gaidher]]. The term ''Raj'' means King in literal terms and [[Mistri]] refers to a master mason. So, it seems that those Mistry, who were appointed by the King as Chief Mason of the Kingdom, began to be called as ''Raj Mistry''.  

Raj Mistry were also known to be employed by jail authorities, and tasked with getting mason work and other labor completed using convicts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KBMbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=raj-mistry&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1jCtTY3EJJC8vgPrpv3XCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=raj-mistry&amp;f=false This work should be done entirely by convict labour, with the hire, if necessary, of one raj-mistry, to instruct the prisoners.] Reports on jails visited and inspected in Bengal, Behar, and Arracan By Frederic John Mouat.

In the United States [[Education in the United States|public school]] system, '''released time''' or '''release time''' is time set aside during school hours, typically an hour a day or a week, for students to receive off-campus private religious education.

==Early history==
The original idea of released time in the [[United States]] was first discussed in 1905 at a school conference in New York City. The proposal was that public elementary schools should be closed one day a week, in addition to Sunday, so that parents could have their children receive religious instruction outside the school premises. This idea was later implemented by Dr. [[William Albert Wirt (educationalist)|William Albert Wirt]], an educator and superintendent of the school district of [[Gary, Indiana]], in 1914. In the first years of Wirt's implementation, over 600 students participated in off-campus religious education.

Most released time programs were held outside school property, and the public school system had no involvement in the religious programs taught there.

Released time began to grow rapidly. In 1922, programs were active in 23 states. Approximately 40,000 students, from 200 school districts, were enrolled in such programs. In 1932, 30 states had active programs in 400 communities with enrollment of 250,000 students. In 1942, participation reached 1.5 million students in 46 states. Released time reached its peak enrollment totals in 1947, when 2 million students were enrolled in some 2,200 communities. Legislation paving the way for released time programs had been adopted by 12 states. [http://www.releasedtime.org/besthtml/best_history.htm]

==Legal challenge==
In 1945, [[Vashti McCollum]] brought legal action against the [[Champaign, Illinois]] public school district. McCollum was the mother of a student in the district. McCollum's suit stated that her eight-year-old son had been coerced and ostracized by school officials because her family had chosen to not participate in the district's in-school religious instruction program. The Champaign district's religious instruction was held during regular school hours in the classrooms in Champaign's public schools and was taught by members of a local religious association, with the approval of school officials.

McCollum's suit argued that religious instruction held during regular school hours on public school property constituted an [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]], in violation of the [[US Constitution]], and violated also the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

The state district court ruled against McCollum, as did the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] upon appeal. However, in 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled 8-1 in favor of McCollum, reversing the lower courts' decision. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=333&amp;invol=203]. It ruled that the Champaign program was unconstitutional since it used the state's compulsory education system to aid in the teaching of religious doctrine and tax-supported school buildings were being used.

In the aftermath of that decision, ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'', the number of released time classes dropped by 12 percent across the nation. [http://www.bestnetwork.org/history.htm]

===Zorach v. Clauson===
In 1952, the case of [[Zorach v. Clauson]] came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of [[New York State]], particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law.

In the majority opinion, Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote that New York's program "involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent.

Douglas wrote that a public school "may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here."

The Court's opinion stated that

: In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion.[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=343&amp;invol=306]

==Today==
There are approximately 1,000 released time programs in operation today, ranging from kindergarten to high school, with 250,000 students enrolled. In some areas, including most public school districts in the state of [[Utah]], released time programs allow students a daily class period, which may be used for extracurricular religious studies.

A multi-denominational Christian organization that supports Released Time Bible Education across the country is School Ministries, Inc. (SMI). It was created in 1990 to act as an association that assists local communities in the creation of Released Time Bible Education and to provide support for existing programs.  Although initially envisioned to have a South Carolina focus, SMI soon was undertaking a national role in responding to RTBE interests, addressing legal challenges, raising national visibility and addressing research needs.  Since 2003, SMI has experienced an annual growth rate of 10% in students served. (See School Ministries, Inc. [http://www.schoolministries.org])

One notable large group taking released time for religious instruction are [[Latter-Day Saint]] students. Most LDS students in ninth through twelfth grade attend weekday religious classes called [[Church Educational System#Seminaries|Seminary]]. In the Western United States, such as in Idaho and Utah, it is common to find an LDS seminary building within close walking distance of public high schools, sometimes directly adjacent. In such situations, the LDS students will take one class period off from the public school as released time. The large numbers taking released time means the seminary has up to six or seven periods corresponding to the public school class periods.

Through the ministry Always Loved Ministry, many students who attend public schools in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania are able to receive Christian Release Time Education. Pennsylvania School Code 1546 requires Pennsylvania public schools to accommodate a parent's request for Release Time Education by excusing their child from school to receive religious instruction outside of the school building. {{Advert inline|date=July 2016}}

New York City also participates in released time  Many organizations take advantage, notably, the [[Jewish Education Program]] and the [[Jewish Released Time]] Program of Greater New York

Supporters of released time programs interpret the various court cases as permitting these programs, provided several guidelines are met: 
* Classes must not be held on public school property.
* Religious instruction may not be financed by public funds.
* Students must have parental permission to be released from public school for attending religious instruction.

===Jewish Hour Released time===
{{main|Jewish Released Time}}
Since 1941 "1,000,000 Public School Children have participated in the Jewish Hour" implementation of Released-time.&lt;ref name=x2018&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Lubavitch Internation |date=Summer 2018  |title=Released for an hour, Connected for a Lifetime
|author=Dvora Lapkein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1970s participant "from PS xxx in Brooklyn (walked) to a [[synagogue]] down the block" described it&lt;ref name=x2018/&gt;{{rp|2018 interview}} as "They lit the candles with us on [[Chanukah]], told us stories, brought us [[matzoh]] for Passover... On [[Sukkot]] the children munched
on snacks inside a [[sukkah]]."

As of 2018 there were 1,328 participating students coming from 90 NYC public schools.

[[File:Immaculate Conception Catholic Church (Port Clinton, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Patrick.JPG|thumb|The Christianisation of Ireland is associated with the 5th century activities of [[St. Patrick]].]]
The predominant '''religion in the Republic of Ireland''' is [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity]], with the largest church being the Roman [[Catholic Church]]. The [[Irish constitution]] says that the state may not endorse any particular religion and guarantees freedom of religion.

In the 2016 census, 78.8% (3.7 million) of the population identified as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] which is 132,220 fewer than 5 years earlier in 2011 when the percentage stood at 84%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/census-2016-statistics-3326599-Apr2017/ &lt;/ref&gt; 

The next largest group after Catholic was "no religion". 10% of the population (468,421 people) had no religion or did not indicate a religious belief according to the census.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0406/865727-census-2016-cso/&lt;/ref&gt; This was a 73.6% increase from 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/census-2016-statistics-3326599-Apr2017/|title=One in 10 Irish people say they have no religion, the second largest group behind Roman Catholics|last=Ryan|first=Órla|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2018-01-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers debate the relative significance of [[secularisation]] as a general feature of Irish society,&lt;ref&gt;Kuhling, Carmen, "New Age re-enchantment in post-Celtic Tiger Ireland". 201 - 219 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''.

The second largest Christian denomination, the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglicanism|Anglican]]), declined in membership for most of the twentieth century, but has more recently experienced an increase, as have other small Christian denominations. Other significant Protestant denominations are the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], followed by the [[Methodist Church in Ireland]]. The country's [[Hinduism in the Republic of Ireland|Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] populations have experienced significant growth in recent years, due chiefly to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Final Principal Demographic Results 2006|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Final%20Principal%20Demographic%20Results%202006.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2010|year=2007|publisher=Central Statistics Office |isbn=0-7557-7169-9|pages=31 (Table Q)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
[[Image:StPatCathedralDublin.jpg|200px|thumb|[[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in Dublin, the National Cathedral of the [[Church of Ireland]] (part of the [[Anglican Communion]]).]]
Originally, the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] gave the [[Catholic Church]] a "special position" as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian denominations and Judaism. As with other predominantly Catholic European states, the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups, including the Catholic Church, was deleted by the [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fifth amendment of the constitution]] in a referendum.

Article 44 remains in the Constitution. It begins:
{{quote|The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.}}
The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.

==Education==
{{See also|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
Despite a large number of schools in Ireland being run by religious organizations but funded by the state, a general trend of secularism is occurring within the Irish population, particularly in the younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;Among many examples:&lt;br/&gt;John Daniszewski, 17 April 2005, [http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-ireland17apr17,0,5254747.story Catholicism Losing Ground in Ireland], LA Times&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.secularism.org.uk/irishpollshowsparentsnolongerwan.html Irish poll shows parents no longer want to force religion on to children] from secularism.org.uk&lt;br/&gt;Phil Lawler, 17 September 2007, [http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=53564 Ireland threatened by secularism, Pope tells new envoy], Catholic World News&lt;/ref&gt; Many efforts have been made by secular groups to eliminate the rigorous study in the second and sixth classes, to prepare for the sacraments of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] and [[confirmation]] in Catholic schools. Parents can ask for their children to be excluded from religious study if they wish. However, [[religious studies]] as a subject was introduced into the state administered [[Junior Certificate]] in 2001; it is not compulsory and deals with aspects of different religions, not focusing on one particular religion.

==Christianity==
[[Image:Carlow Cathedral St Patrick Preaching to the Kings 2009 09 03.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Saint Patrick]], shown here preaching to kings, was a [[Romano-British|Romano-Briton]] [[Mission (Christian)|Christian]] [[missionary]] and is the most generally recognised [[patron saint]] of [[Ireland]].]]
{{Denominations of Ireland}}
{{main|Christianity in Ireland}}
[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in the Republic of Ireland based on baptisms. Irish Christianity is dominated by the [[Catholic Church]], and Christianity as a whole accounts for 82.3% of the Irish population. Most churches are organized on an all-Ireland basis which includes both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].
:*[[Protestantism in Ireland]]
:*[[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]]
:*[[Methodist Church in Ireland]]
:*[[Eastern Orthodoxy in the Republic of Ireland]]
:*[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Ireland]]
[[Irish travellers]] have traditionally adopted a very particular attitude to the Catholic Church, with a focus on figures such as "healing priests".&lt;ref&gt;Brownlee, Attracta, "Irish travellers and 'powerful priests'. 97 - 110 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally a tradition of [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] continues, often outside of Church sanction.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, Peter, "Marian apparitions, the New Age and the FAS prophet". 53 - 73 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evangelical]] movements have recently spread both within the established churches and outside them.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Noble, Ruth, "The changing face of Irish Christianity". 131 - 146 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celts|Celtic]] Christianity has become increasingly popular, again both within and outside established churches.&lt;ref&gt;Gierek, Bozena, "Celtic spirituality in contemporary Ireland". 300 - 317 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patron saints of Ireland for Catholics and Anglicans are [[Saint Patrick]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Brigid]] and [[Columba|Saint Columba]]. Saint Patrick is the only one of the three who is commonly recognised as the patron saint. [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is celebrated in Ireland and abroad on 17 March.

[[Eastern Orthodoxy in the Republic of Ireland|Eastern Orthodoxy in Ireland]] is represented mainly by recent immigrants from Eastern European countries, such as [[Romania]], [[Russia]], or [[Ukraine]], and accounts for 1% of the population.

According to a [[Georgetown University]] study, the country also has one of the highest rates of regular Mass attendance in the [[Western World]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm Weekly Mass Attendance of Catholics in Nations with Large Catholic Populations, 1980-2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110918/http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/international.htm |date=14 February 2008 }} – [[World Values Survey]] (WVS)&lt;/ref&gt; While daily [[Catholic Mass|Mass]] attendance was 13% in 2006 there had been a reduction in weekly attendance from 81% to 48% between 1990 and 2006, although the decline was reported as leveling off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=44521 Irish Mass attendance below 50%] – Catholic World News 1 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s a survey had given figures at 91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiesirishreview.ie/j/page594 |title=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review |publisher=Studiesirishreview.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was reported that weekly Mass attendance in Dublin was on average 18%, with it being lower among younger generations and in some areas less than 2%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dublindiocese.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2293&amp;Itemid=372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0530/1224298059533.html Irish Times - ''Fewer than one in five attend Sunday Mass in Dublin'' (30 May 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 survey of Irish Catholics undertaken by the [[Association of Catholic Priests]] found the weekly mass attendance rate to be 35% on an all-island basis, while daily mass attendance was reported at 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Catholic Perspectives|url=http://www.associationofcatholicpriests.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Contemporary-Catholic-Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2012|year=2012|publisher=Association of Catholic Priests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==No religion==
{{main|Irreligion in the Republic of Ireland}}
A 2006 Dentsu poll found that 7% of Ireland had no religion. According to Greeley (2003), 5% of those in Ireland do not believe in God, but only 2% accept the self-identification of “atheist.” According to Ingelhart et al. (2004) and Davie (1999), 4% of the Irish do not believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atheism.ru/library/phil_1.phtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007-2008 [[Gallup Poll]], 42% of Ireland answered no to the question "Does religion occupy an important place in your life?" and in the 2011 Gallup, 53% of Ireland answered no.

A 2010 Bishops Conference survey found that 10.1% of Irish Catholics did not believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicbishops.ie/wp-content/uploads/images/stories/cco_publications/researchanddevelopment/evs_4th_wave_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 WIN-Gallup International poll, Ireland had the second highest decline in religiosity from 69% in 2005 to 47% in 2012, while those who considered themselves not a religious person increased 25% in 2005 to 44% in 2012. The poll also showed that 10% of Ireland now consider themselves convinced atheists, which is an increase from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf  Atheists Rally On National Mall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812210929/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |date=12 August 2012 }} retrieved 2012-10-05&lt;/ref&gt;

These percentages decreased again, however, from 2012 to 2016, resulting in the pie chart seen below.&lt;ref name="sample2011t2016"/&gt;

==Other religions of Ireland==

===Judaism===
{{main|History of the Jews in Ireland}}
The earliest recorded presence of Jews in Ireland was in 1079 in the [[Annals of Inisfallen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Annals of Inisfallen |author=Unknown |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100004/text001.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the Jewish population is 2,557.&lt;ref name="McGarry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/ireland-s-jewish-population-rises-by-almost-30-1.3254834|title=Ireland’s Jewish population rises by almost 30%|last=McGarry|first=Patsy|date=October 13, 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The population of Buddhists in Ireland is 9,358 (0.2%). Irish Buddhists such as [[U Dhammaloka]] are recorded from the late nineteenth century on, with numbers growing particularly in the 21st century. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Beyond formal membership in [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Buddhism in the West|Western Buddhist]] groups, there is increasing syncretism, with self-identified Christians and others using Buddhist [[meditation]] techniques, [[Buddha]] images, texts by figures such as the [[Dalai Lama|14th Dalai Lama]] and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Laurence and Maria Griffin, "The ''Wild Irish Girl'' and the 'dalai lama of Little Thibet': the long encounter between Ireland and Asian Buddhism". 53 - 73 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism in the Republic of Ireland}}
The spread of '''[[Hinduism]] in Ireland''' is increasing. The 2016 Irish Census reports 14,300 Hindus resident in [[Ireland]], more than quadruple the number in 2000 (when 3,099 Hindus were recorded).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Neo-paganism===
{{main|Neo-paganism in the Republic of Ireland}}
Various [[Neopagan movements]] are active in Ireland, especially [[Wicca]], [[Neo-druidry]] and [[Celtic Polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Jenny, "Irish neo-paganism". 111 - 130 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland is also a significant point of reference for various kinds of [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic]] &lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Carole, "Celticity in Australian alternative spiritualities". 281 - 299 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[neo-pagan]] spirituality and religious practice around the world, such as the [[Fellowship of Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Maignant, Catherine, "Irish base, global religion: the Fellowship of Isis". 53 - 73 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age===
[[New Age]] religious movements are becoming increasingly significant in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;Kuhling, Carmen, "New Age re-enchantment in post-Celtic Tiger Ireland". 201 - 219 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; often as a form of [[syncretism]] for members of established religions. Participation is strongly gendered, with a high proportion of women.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole". 220 - 239 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example is ''A course in miracles''.&lt;ref&gt;Bradby, Ruth, "A course in miracles in Ireland". 147 - 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), ''Ireland's new religious movements''. Cambridge Scholars, 2011; {{ISBN|978-1-4438-2588-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
===Census Information===
[[File:Other religion in Ireland census 2011.png|thumb|250px|The percentage of respondents who said they followed a religion other than Catholicism in the census in Ireland in 2011.]]
[[File:No religion in Ireland census 2011.png|thumb|250px|The percentage of respondents who said they had no religion in the census in Ireland in 2011.]]
Between 2006 and 2011, Catholics decreased as a percentage of the population, but still showed a robust increase in absolute numbers due both to an excess of births over deaths as well as immigration from countries such as [[Poland]]. Most recently, Protestantism, including the Church of Ireland, has experienced a slight decrease in percentage, despite having earlier experienced some recovery. Those declaring no religion, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Islam showed significant increases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12782">{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The '''Three Roots''' (Tibetan: ''tsa sum'') of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition are the [[lama]] (Sanskrit: ''[[guru]]''), [[yidam]] (Sanskrit: ''ishtadevata'') and protector, which may be a ''khandroma'' (Sanskrit: ''[[dakini]]'') or ''chokyong'' (Sanskrit: ''[[dharmapala]]''). The Three Roots are the second of three Tibetan Buddhist [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] formulations, the ''Outer'', ''Inner'' and ''Secret'' forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the '[[Three Jewels|Triple Gem]]', (Sanskrit:''triratna''), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or [[trikaya]] of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking [[Deity Yoga]] and other [[vajrayana|tantric]] practices within the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Vajrayana]] tradition as a means of recognizing the universality of [[Buddha Nature]]. The Three Roots are commonly mentioned in the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] literature of Tibetan Buddhism. Unlike most aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, which originated in India, the Three Roots may be an original Tibetan formulation from the time of [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|page=327 n.51|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of the Three Roots are: 
* the Lama is the 'root of blessing' or 'root of grace'. 
* the Yidam is the 'root of methods' or 'root of accomplishments'
* the Khandroma or Chokyong is the 'root of protection' or 'root of activity'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Kalu|title=Secret Buddhism:Vajrayana Practices|publisher=Clear Point Press|year=1995|isbn=0-9630371-6-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Yangzab]] compilation of [[Dzogchen]] texts the 'Yangzab Three Roots' is the primary [[Deity Yoga]] practice. The Three Roots in this cycle are: [[Padmasambhava|Guru Rinpoche]] (the guru), [[Hayagriva]] (the yidam), and [[Vajravarahi]] (the dakini). This [[empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerment]] is required for the practitioner to study the Yangzab [[terma (Buddhism)|Treasure]] teaching cycle. The three roots are symbolized in the [[Gankyil]].

==Correspondences==
[[Dilgo Khyentse]], head of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] until his death in 1991,  explained the [[twilight language]] correspondences and [[wikt:polyvalent|polyvalent]] meaning of the ''Outer'', ''Inner'' and ''Secret'' aspects of the Three Jewels:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The outer three jewels are the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.  The Three jewels have an inner aspect, known as the Three Roots: the [[Guru]] (or Teacher), who is the root of blessings; the [[Yidam]], who is the root of accomplishment; and the [[Dakini]], who is the root of enlightened activity.  Although the names are different, these three do not in any way differ from the Three Jewels.  The Guru is the [[Buddhahood|Budha]] [''[[sic]]''], the Yidam is the [[Dharma]], and the Dakinis and Protectors are the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].  And on the innermost level, the [[Dharmakaya]] is the Buddha, the [[Sambhogakaya]] is the Dharma, and the [[Nirmanakaya]] is the Sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. (Ed.)(2004). ''In the Presence of Masters:  Wisdom from 30 Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Teachers''.  Boston, Massachusetts, USA:  Shambala.  {{ISBN|1-57062-849-1}} (pbk.: alk. paper) p.60.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Tibetan Buddhist Refuge Formulations}}

The Three Roots formulation also fits into the framework of the [[Three Vajras]] of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] where they are seen as equating to the following forms: the protector is the Body, the Yidam is the Speech and the Guru is the Mind. According to the ''Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The trinity of body, speech, and mind are known as the three gates, three receptacles or three vajras, and correspond to the western religious concept of righteous thought (mind), word (speech), and deed (body). The three vajras also correspond to the three kayas, with the aspect of body located at the crown (''nirmanakaya''), the aspect of speech at the throat (''sambhogakaya''), and the aspect of mind at the heart (''dharmakaya'')."&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2003). p.186 ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols''.  Serindia Publications. {{ISBN|1-932476-03-2}} Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=three+vajras&amp;source=web&amp;ots=FOJFZ0GiLs&amp;sig=WHepBCvf5V7HgUoQ_FiBXPxzQ8c#PPA186,M1] (accessed: December 7, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo]] also identifies the [[seed syllables]] corresponding to the [[Three Vajras]] as: a white ''om'' (enlightened body), a red ''ah'' (enlightened speech) and a blue ''hum'' (enlightened mind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rinpoche|first=Pabongka|title=Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment|publisher=Wisdom Books|year=1997|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivates attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Patrul|title=Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism (Sacred Literature)|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300165323|pages=176-177|edition=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassable awakening. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorje|first1=Choying Tobden|last2=Zangpo|first2=Ngawang|title=The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, Books 1 to 10: Foundations of the Buddhist Path|date=June 2, 2015|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=1559394358|pages=224–227|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual 'roots'==

===Lama===
In the [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition, the teacher is a valued and honoured mentor worthy of great respect and a source of inspiration on the path to [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thurman, Robert A. F. |author2=Huntington, John |author3=Dina Bangdel |title=Beginning the process: The Great Masters and Selecting a Teacher - The Guru-Disciple relationship; in: The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art |publisher=Serindia Publications |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=1-932476-01-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan tradition]], however, the teacher is viewed as the very root of spiritual realization and the basis of the entire path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dreyfus, Georges B. J. |title=The sound of two hands clapping: the education of a Tibetan Buddhist monk |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |pages= 61–3|isbn=0-520-23260-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the teacher, it is asserted, there can be no experience or insight. The guru is seen as [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. In Tibetan texts, emphasis is placed upon praising the virtues of the guru. [[Tantra|Tantric]] teachings include generating visualisations of the guru and making offerings praising the guru. The guru becomes known as the ''vajra'' (literally "diamond") guru, the one who is the source of initiation into the tantric deity. The disciple is asked to enter into a series of vows and commitments that ensure the maintenance of the spiritual link with the understanding that to break this link is a serious downfall.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In [[Vajrayana]] ([[Tantra|tantric]] Buddhism) the guru is perceived as ''the way'' itself.  The guru is not an individual who initiates a person, but the person's own Buddha-nature reflected in the personality of the guru. In return, disciples are expected to show great devotion to the guru, whom they regard as a [[Bodhisattva]]. A guru is one who has not only mastered the words of the tradition, but who has an intense personal relationship with the student; thus, devotion is the proper attitude toward the guru.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8264-1113-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gross, Rita M. |title=Soaring and settling: Buddhist perspectives on contemporary social and religious issues |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=1998 |pages=184 |isbn=0-8264-1113-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], speaking of the importance of the guru, said: ''"Rely on the teachings to evaluate a guru: Do not have blind faith, but also no blind criticism."'' He also observed that the term 'living Buddha' is a translation of the Chinese words ''huo fuo''.&lt;ref name="urlThe Teacher - The Guru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/spiritual_teacher_guru.html |title=The Teacher - The Guru |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514220738/http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/spiritual_teacher_guru.html |archivedate=2008-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[guru]], who in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is generally the [[lama]], is considered to be the most important of the 'Three Roots' since the guru embodies [[bodhi|enlightened]] mind and without their personal guidance, the student cannot progress. "The living teacher proclaims to the student through his or her very existence that awakening is not only possible but immediate for every living being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|page=139|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Guru yoga]] practices, the [[Vajrayana]] student becomes familiar with the [[refuge tree]] and [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] within which the guru is teaching. The 'root guru', or ''tsawe lama'', with whom the student has a personal relationship, is visualised at the root of the tree, channeling the blessings of all the branches of the refuge tree to the student. The blessings are accessed through the practitioner's devotion.

===Yidam===
The second root is the meditational deity or [[yidam]]. The [[iconography]] of the yidam may be 'peaceful', 'wrathful' (Tibetan ''tro wa'') or 'neither peaceful or wrathful'(Tibetan:'' shi ma tro''), depending on the practitioner's own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmo|first=Tenzin|title=Reflections on a Mountain Lake:Teachings on Practical Buddhism|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2002|pages=229–231|isbn=1-55939-175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yidam represents awakening, so its appearance reflects whatever is required by the practitioner to awaken. The guru guides the student to the yidam appropriate for them, then gives them [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|initiation]] into the [[mandala]] of the [[yidam]]. In essence, the mind of the guru and the yidam are one. The yidam is considered to be the root of success in the practice.

===Protector===
The third root is the protector, the root of action or the enlightened activity of realized beings. In the case of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the protector is the [[dakini]]. In the other '[[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]]' schools, the protector may be a [[dakini]], a [[dharmapala]], or other Buddhist enlightened beings. In the [[Nyingma]], the [[dakini]] is guardian of the secret oral or 'whispered ear' tradition and so always serves as the third root. In the other Tibetan Buddhist schools, the '[[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]]' schools, there are many different forms of protector. The protector in these schools may be a [[dakini]] or any of a variety of oath-bound spirits, subdued by [[tantra|tantric]] [[yogi]] or [[yogini]].

[[Judith Simmer-Brown]] points out that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dakini, in various guises, serves as each of the Three Roots, and may be a human guru, a [[vajra]] master who transmits the [[Vajrayana]] teachings to her disciples and joins them in [[samaya]] commitments. The wisdom dakini may be a [[yidam]], a meditational deity; female [[deity yoga]]s such as [[Vajrayogini]] are common in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Or, the dakini may be a protector; the wisdom dakinis have special power and responsibility to protect the integrity of oral transmissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|year=2002|pages=139–40|isbn=978-1-57062-920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wimarshana Wijesuriya''' is a [[Sri Lanka]]n writer, social critic and thinker. His book ''Colombo: A Critical Introspection'' explores sociological issues that face Sri Lanka on entering modernity. It proposes to ask and answer the question — "Who is the prototypical Sri-Lankan? And how do these defining sociological &amp; socio-psychological ingredients conspire and culminate to create his [the prototypical Sri-Lankan] contemporary reality?”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceylontoday.lk/news-detail.php?news_id=1571&amp;news_category_id=35&lt;/ref&gt; ''Colombo'' drew attention for being critical of traditional Sri Lankan culture and religion, particularly [[Buddhism]] (Sri Lanka's predominant religion) and [[Islam]]. Allegedly, Wijesuriya received death threats for the blasphemous content in ''Colombo''.

== Early life ==

In an interview with ''Good Morning Sri-Lanka'', Wijesuriya revealed what little is known about his childhood. In the interview Wijesuriya reveals that he spent his early childhood in England before returning to Sri-Lanka. And it was the culture shock on return to Sri-Lanka that stimulated Wijesuriya's interest in sociology, resulting eventually in him writing ''Colombo''.

== Personal life ==

A long time lecturer in various tertiary academic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.lk/2012/01/07/the-book-that-may-change-the-country-colombo-a-critical-introspection/&lt;/ref&gt; Wijesuriya married his student — Roshani Kumarasinghe in 2012. It is not precisely verifiable whether their relationship commenced during or after Kumarasinghe was Wijesuriya's student.

== ''Colombo: A Critical Introspection'' ==

The publication of ''Colombo: A Critical Introspection'' received nothing more than the usual media coverage when it was launched in early 2012. However from then on the controversial content of the book garnered publicity well beyond the average English non-fiction book written for the Sri-Lankan market — primarily on social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.lk/2012/01/07/the-book-that-may-change-the-country-colombo-a-critical-introspection/&lt;/ref&gt;

The book itself was considered to be extremely wordy and at points quite impenetrable, which some in Sri-Lanka have attributed to be purposefully so on the part of Wijesuriya to defend himself against political and religious backlash. The alleged controversial backlash that did occur centers on two essays in the book: ''The Relevance of Buddhism'' and ''Islam, Muslims and Society's Misgivings''. This backlash alleged to include vandalism of Wijesuriya's parents' house in which death threats were sprayed across its walls. More controversy was to follow, though this, too, is unsubstantiated, centering on Wijesuriya being taken in for questioning by the police regarding his thoughts on Buddhism contained in ''Colombo''. Since the Sri-Lankan state is constitutionally bound to protect Buddhism this seems plausible and has happened to authors who have criticized Buddhism before in Sri-Lanka. However counter allegations persist that Wijesuriya merely fabricated this scenario to generate publicity for ''Colombo''.

== '' Third World Soul'' ==

After the publication of ''Colombo'', Wijesuriya had a column in the Sri-Lankan national English daily — the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''&lt;ref&gt;: http://www.dailymirror.lk/opinion/172-opinion/22339-the-third-world-soul.html&lt;/ref&gt; — entitled ''Third World Soul''. However the column, in which Wijesuriya seemed to be simplifying the arguments he first made in ''Colombo'' for a wider readership, was for unknown reasons cancelled after just one installment.

== ''Post Politica''==

In a follow up interview with Wijesuriya that was supposed to focus on the reception to ''Colombo'', Wijesuriya dramatically announced that he had finished work on his next book: ''Post Politica'' — A dystopian novel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJJ44f54LIs&lt;/ref&gt; Wijesuriya revealed very little beyond this about the book except that unlike ''Colombo'' it had very little to with Sri-Lanka and that he would be attempting to release it by January 8, 2014 for sentimental reasons (''Colombo'' was released on January 8, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJJ44f54LIs&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Young Men's Christian Association''' ('''YMCA'''), sometimes regionally called '''the Y''', is a worldwide organization based in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], with more than 64 million beneficiaries from 120 national associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/ymca-blue-book-world-ymca-movement-statistics-2018/ |title=Blue Book |publisher=World Alliance of YMCAs |accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on 6 June 1844 by [[George Williams (YMCA)|Sir George Williams]] in London and aims to put [[Christian values|Christian principles]] into practice by developing a healthy "body, mind, and spirit". 

From its inception, it grew rapidly and ultimately became a worldwide movement founded on the principles of [[Muscular Christianity]]. Local YMCAs deliver projects and services focused on youth development through a wide variety of youth activities, including providing athletic facilities, holding classes for a wide variety of skills, promoting Christianity, and humanitarian work. 

YMCA globally operates on a federation model, with each independent local YMCA voluntarily affiliated to their national organizations. The national organizations, in turn, are part of both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, Latin America &amp; Caribbean, USA and Canada) and the World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA). 

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:Montreal - YMCA, Rue des Récollets et Rue Sainte-Hélène - Note - 20050324.jpg|thumb|220px|Tablet on the YMCA in Montreal]]
With regard to the history and purpose of the founding, this "organization and its female counterpart (YWCA) were established to provide low-cost housing in a safe Christian environment for rural young men and women journeying to the cities."&lt;ref name="frost"&gt;J. William Frost, "Part V: Christianity and Culture in America," ''Christianity: A Social and Cultural History'', 2nd Edition, (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998), 476.&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with industrialization and the movement of young people to cities to work. The YMCA "combined preaching in the streets and the distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote good citizenship."&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt;

==== Founding and Paris Basis ====
[[File:Sir George Williams by John Collier.jpg|thumbnail|left|Founder Sir [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]]]]
The YMCA was founded by [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]], a London [[draper]], who was typical of the young men drawn to the cities by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. He and his colleagues were concerned about the lack of healthy activities for young men in major cities; the options available were usually [[taverns]] and [[brothels]]. Williams's idea grew out of meetings he held for prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow-workers in a business in the city of London,&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Young Men's Christian Association |volume=28 |pages=940-941}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 June 1844, he founded the first YMCA in London with the purpose of "the improving of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery, [[embroidery]], and other trades."&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[[#IC95|Report of the Thirteenth International Conference]]: xix&lt;/ref&gt; By 1851, there were YMCAs in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States.

In 1855, 99 YMCA delegates from Europe and North America met in Paris at the First World Conference of YMCAs, held before the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Paris World Exposition]] of the same year. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the [[Paris Basis]], a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=115 |title=Paris Basis |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its motto was taken from the Bible, "[[That they all may be one]]" ([[John 17]]:21). Other ecumenical bodies, such as the World [[YWCA]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] have reflected elements of the Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865 The Fourth World Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing the whole individual in spirit, mind, and body. The concept of physical work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognized as part of this "[[muscular Christianity]]".

Two themes resonated during the council: the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose of the YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble:

{{quote|The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22nd August, 1855, feeling that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission of other Societies in future.}}

=== 1870s to 1930s—an influential period ===
[[File:KINO YMCA.JPG|thumb|YMCA building in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]

The YMCA was very influential during the 1870s and 1930s, during which times they most successfully promoted "evangelical Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship in athletic contests in gyms (where [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] were invented) and swimming pools."&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt;  Later in this period, and continuing on through the 20th century, the YMCA had "become interdenominational and more concerned with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation of Christianity."&lt;ref name="frost"/&gt; Today the YMCA is more focused on inspiring youths and their families to exercise and be healthy.

==== Growth of World Alliance and scouting ====
[[File:Geneve archives YMCA 2011-08-23 11 24 53 PICT4048.JPG|thumb|left|Logo of the World Alliance (YMCA Archive, Geneva)]]

In 1878, World Alliance of YMCAs offices were established in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. Later, in 1900, North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World Alliance, set up centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people were leaving for the USA. In 1880, the YMCA became the first national organization to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it.

In 1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential camp in the United States and North America, was established by A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for the YMCA. The camp, originally located near Orange Lake in [[New Jersey]], moved to [[Lake Wawayanda]] in Sussex County the following year, and then to the shore of [[Lake Champlain]] near [[Westport, New York]], in 1891.&lt;ref name="100YrsCamping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umnlib.oit.umn.edu/F/?func=find-c&amp;ccl_term=sys%3D000433611 |title=Turner, Eugene A., Jr. '&amp;#39;100 Years of YMCA Camping'&amp;#39;, YMCA of the USA, 1985 |publisher=Umnlib.oit.umn.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YMCAbuildingNY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintpix.com/photo.php?id=137 |title=YMCA Building Photo |publisher=Vintpix.com |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, the YMCA was an early influence upon [[scouting]], including the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) and [[Verband Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder|German Scouting]]. [[Edgar M. Robinson]], a Chicago-area YMCA administrator, briefly left the YMCA to become the BSA's first director.

The Blue Ridge Association for Christian Conferences and Training was formed in 1907, and shortly thereafter built the [[Blue Ridge Assembly Historic District|Blue Ridge Assembly]] conference centre.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite web | author =Michael Southern and Betty Lawrence| title = Blue Ridge Assembly Historic District| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =May 1979| url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/BN0005.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rural development to World War II ====
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 612 YMCA י.מ.ק.א..JPG|thumb|YMCA in [[Jerusalem]]]]

In 1916, [[K. T. Paul]] became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started rural development programmes for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term "rural reconstruction", and many of the principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programmes. In 1923, [[Y. C. James Yen]], of the YMCA of China, devised the "thousand character system," based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 1878, the YMCA was organized inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;his&lt;/ref&gt; and the current landmark building was dedicated by General Lord Allenby in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine.  During World War II the YMCA was involved in war work with displaced persons and refugees. They set up War Prisoners Aid to support prisoners of war by providing sports equipment, musical instruments, art materials, radios, [[phonograph|gramophones]], eating utensils, and other items.

=== From the 1940s—global challenges ===

==== United Nations to apartheid in Asia ====

In 1947 the World Alliance of YMCAs gained special consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]. In 1955 the first black president of the World Alliance of YMCAs, Charles Dunbar Sherman from Liberia, was elected. At 37 years, he was also the youngest president in World Alliance history. In 1959 the YMCA developed the first nationally organized [[scuba diving]] course and certified their first skin and scuba [[diving instructor]]s.&lt;ref name="DivingHistory"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=History of YMCA Underwater Program |publisher=Diving History.com |url=http://www.divinghistory.com/id21.html |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPUMS1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richardson, Drew |title=A brief history of recreational diving in the United States. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] Journal |year=1999 |volume=29 |number=3 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6019 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1974, the YMCA had set up a curriculum to begin teaching [[cave diving]].&lt;ref name="Kendrick2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kendrick, DF |title=Science of the National Association for Cave Diving (NACD): Water Quality, Hydrogeology, Biology and Psychology |journal=In: Pollock NW, ed.

Dauphin Island, AL: AAUS; 2009. |year=2009 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10114 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DSCN0920b.jpg|thumb|YMCA in [[Moncton]], New Brunswick]]

In 1973 the Sixth World Council in [[Kampala]], Uganda, became the first World Council in Africa. It reaffirmed the Paris Basis and adopted a declaration of principles, known as the Kampala Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=116 |title=Kampala Principles |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It include the principles of justice, creativity and honesty. It stated what had become obvious in most national YMCAs; a global viewpoint was more necessary, and that in doing so, the YMCAs would have to take political stands, especially so in international challenges. In 1985 the World Council of YMCAs passed a resolution against [[apartheid]], and anti-apartheid campaigns were formed under the leadership of Lee Soo-Min ([[Korea]]), the first Asian secretary general of the World Alliance.

==== Challenge 21 and recent years ====
[[File:YMCAUB.JPG|thumb|YMCA in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia]]

In 1997, at the 14th World Council of YMCAs, the World Council in Germany adopted "Challenge 21,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=114 |title=Challenge 21 |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to place more focus on global challenges, such as [[gender equality]], [[sustainable development]], war and peace, fair distribution, and the challenges of [[globalization]], racism, and HIV/AIDS. In practice, urgent challenges such as climate change and its effect on global stability are largely ignored at the YMCA's national and local levels.

{{quote|Affirming the Paris Basis adopted in 1855, as the ongoing foundation statement of the mission of the YMCA, at the threshold of the third millennium, we declare that the YMCA is a worldwide Christian, ecumenical, voluntary movement for women and men with special emphasis on and the genuine involvement of young people and that it seeks to share the Christian ideal of building a human community of justice with love, peace and reconciliation for the fullness of life for all creation.}}

[[File:Plaque in the YMCA in New Philadelphia, OH.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque hanging in a YMCA communicating the goals of the organization]]
{{quote|Each member YMCA is therefore called to focus on certain challenges which will be prioritized according to its own context. 

These principles are an evolution of the Kampala Principles &lt;!-- sic: original has no colon or other punctuation here --&gt;
* Sharing the good news of Jesus Christ and striving for spiritual, intellectual and physical well-being of individuals and wholeness of communities.
* Empowering all to take increased responsibilities and assume leadership at all levels and working towards an equitable society.
* Advocating for and promoting the rights of and upholding the rights of children.
* Fostering dialogue and partnership between people of different faiths and ideologies and recognizing the cultural identities of people and promoting cultural renewal.
* Committing to work in solidarity with the poor, dispossessed, uprooted people and oppressed racial, religious and ethnic minorities.
* Seeking to be mediators and reconciles in situations of conflict and working for meaningful participation and advancement of people for their own self-determination.
* Defending God's creation against all that would destroy it and preserving and protecting the earth's resources for coming generations. To face these challenges, the YMCA will develop patterns of co-operation at all levels that enable self-sustenance and self-determination.}}

In 2002 the World Council in [[Oaxtepec]], [[Morelos]], in Mexico, called for a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis.  On 11 July 2010, the YMCA of the USA rebranded its name to the popular nickname, "The Y", and revised the iconic red and black logo to create five coloured versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymca.int/newsroom/latest-news/world-alliance-of-ymcas-issues-statement-on-ymca-usa-rebrand/ |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |title=World Alliance of YMCAs Issues Statement on YMCA USA Rebrand}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, YMCAs are open to all, regardless of religion, social class, age, or sex.

== Organizational model ==

A federated model of [[governance]] has created a diversity of YMCA programmes and services, with YMCAs in different countries and communities offering vastly different programming in response to local community needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2390900|title = From Evangelism to General Service: The Transformation of the YMCA|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 214–234|last1 = Zald|first1 = Mayer N.|last2 = Denton|first2 = Patricia|date = September 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the YMCA is primarily a community [[gym|sports facility]]; in Great Britain, the YMCA is sometimes perceived to be primarily a place for homeless young people; however, it offers a broad range of programmes such as sports, [[physical fitness|personal fitness]], [[day care|child care]], [[summer camp|overnight camping]], employment readiness programmes, training programmes, advice services, immigrant services, conference centres, and educational activities as methods of promoting its [[value system|values]].

Financial support for local associations is derived from programme fees, membership dues, community chests, foundation grants, charitable contributions, sustaining memberships, and corporate sponsors.

== Logo ==
[[File:World_Alliance_of_YMCAs_logo.png|thumb|Emblem of 1881]] In 1881, 26 years after its foundation, the official emblem of the World Alliance of YMCAs was adopted, at the 9th International YMCA World Conference. The circular emblem is made up of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together by small monograms of the YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united across borders. In the centre is a larger monogram of X and P, [[Chi Rho|Chi and Rho]], Christ’s name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on top of the monogram, showing [[That they all may be one|John XVII, Verse 21, "that they all may be one"]]. This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the centre of the Movement, a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/who-we-are/history/ymca-logo-history/|title=YMCA International - World Alliance of YMCAs: YMCA Logo - History|website=www.ymca.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

=== Religious ===
[[File:Chapel at the YMCA in New Philadelphia, OH.jpg|thumb|A Christian chapel in a YMCA. These chapels are often used for [[prayer meeting]]s, [[service of worship|worship services]], and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible studies]].]]
[[File:YMCA Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|Campers at YMCA camp in Huguenot, NY make their own maple syrup, 1 January 2009]]

The first YMCA included Bible studies, although the organization has generally moved on to a more [[holistic]] approach to youth work. Around six years after its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective of the organization should become "[[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian discipleship]] developed through a programme of religious, educational, social and physical activities" (Binfield 1973:265).

=== Academic ===

The International Coalition of the YMCA Universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coalitionymcauniversities.org/|title=Coalition YMCA Universities|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.

[[File:Swimming Pool in the YMCA of New Philadelphia, OH.jpg|thumb|left|A swimming pool in a YMCA]]
Multiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to the YMCA. [[Springfield College]], of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]—[[Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams College]]—started from night courses offered at the [[Montreal]] YMCA. [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began out of a [[Boston YMCA|YMCA in Boston]], and [[Franklin University]] began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's [[Golden Gate University]] traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. [[Detroit College of Law]], now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. [[Youngstown State University]] traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The [[Nashville School of Law]] was the YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of [[Juris Doctor]] since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of [[wikt:night school|night school]], providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer [[English as a second language|ESL]] programmes, [[alternative high school]], [[day care]], and [[summer camp]] programs. In India, [[YMCA University of Science and Technology]] [[Faridabad]] was founded in 1969. It offers various programme-related to science and engineering.

American high school students have a chance to participate in [[YMCA Youth and Government]], wherein clubs of kids representing each YMCA community convene annually in their respective [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to "take over the State Capitol for a day."

American students in [[Title One]] public schools are sometimes eligible to join a tutoring program through the YMCA called Y Learning.  This program is used to help low-income students who are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. Y Learning operates under the main mission of bridging achievements gaps and providing essential resources to help underprivileged students thrive in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcatriangle.org/programs-services/tutoring/y-learning|title=Y Learning, standardized tutorial program {{!}} YMCA of the Triangle|website=www.ymcatriangle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YMCA Association Men Cover June 1919.png|thumbnail|right|YMCA ''Association Men'' Cover June 1919]]

In 1891 [[James Naismith]], a Canadian American, invented basketball while studying at the YMCA International Training School in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] (later to be named [[Springfield College]]). Naismith had been asked to invent a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. Such an activity was needed both by the Training School and by YMCAs across the country. Naismith and his wife attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] when basketball was one of the Olympic events. In 1895 [[William G. Morgan]] from the YMCA of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], invented the sport of volleyball as a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older Y members could participate. In 1930, {{illm|Juan Carlos Ceriani|fr|Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier}} from the YMCA of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, invented the sport of [[futsal]], an indoor version of football (soccer), having been created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of [[American handball|handball]], basketball, and [[water polo]].

In fact, many popular sports were actually invented at YMCAs around the country. Basketball, volleyball and racquetball are all Y inventions. The Auburn Y's History Committee unearthed these stories about the creation of these sports.

====Basketball====

Basketball was invented at the YMCA in Springfield, Mass. in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a clergyman, educator and physician. Naismith was asked to create an indoor “athletic distraction” to keep rowdy youth busy in the cold New England winter months. Luther Gulick, the head of the Springfield Y, gave Naismith two weeks to come up with a game to occupy a particularly incorrigible group. Naismith decided the game had to be physically active, simple to understand and would have minimal physical roughness.

The original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of the Springfield Y. The game was an immediate hit, although originally the baskets still had their bottoms, and the ball had to be manually retrieved after each score, considerably slowing play. It was mostly a passing game, and dribbling did not become a major part of the game until much later, when the ball was improved to its present form. Basketball continues to be one of the most popular sports at the Auburn Y, as witnessed by a glance at the gym at any time of the day or week.

In fact, a claim to fame of the Auburn Y is that it holds the record for the longest running church basketball league in the nation - 80 continuous years. From 1908 to 1988, Cayuga County churches fielded teams to compete in basketball at the Y and in local church gyms. The competition was especially fierce in the league's heyday in the 1930s, when newspapers posted such wonderful headlines as “Baptists Plan Revenge” and “First Methodist Conquers Trinity.” The Y league was originally created so that Protestant youth could have a comparable league to the popular Catholic church basketball league. Throngs of spectators crowded into the gyms to cheer the players on.

====Volleyball====

Four years after James Naismith invented basketball in Springfield in 1891, William Morgan, an instructor at the YMCA in nearby Holyoke, Mass., wanted to create a game for older gentlemen which had less physical contact. He borrowed a tennis net, raised it 6 feet, 6 inches above the floor, and invented the game of “Mintonette,” which could be played by a group of any number and involved volleying a large ball over the net. An observer wisely suggested that a better name for the new sport might be “volleyball.” This originally genteel sport bears little resemblance to the lively co-ed games now played at the Auburn Y.

====Racquetball====

Racquetball is another Y-invented sport. Joseph Sobek, a tennis, handball and squash player who worked in a rubber manufacturing factory, was dissatisfied with the options for indoor sports in Greenwich, Conn. He couldn't find squash players of his caliber and he didn't care particularly for handball, so in 1950 he designed a short, stringed racquet, used a children's toy rubber ball, and created rules for a new game using the handball courts. He called his new sport “paddle rackets.” The sport really took off in the 1970s and there are an estimated 15 million players worldwide today, including the loyal members of the Auburn Monday night league, which has been going strong since the 1980s and has included YMCA racquetball legends Sonny Monroe, Terry Dautrich, Lefty Glauberman, Jack Cavanaugh and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Popular sports invented at YMCA, By Jill Fandrich, May 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The YMCA founded the YMCA Press [[publishing house]] in Russia in 1900. It moved to Paris after [[World War I]], where it focussed on providing intellectual and educational works to Russian [[Émigré|émigrés]]. It perhaps most famously published some of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s books whilst he was imprisoned by the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Raeff1990"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku7Piu4PwiYC&amp;pg=PA78|title=Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939|author=Marc Raeff|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-505683-9|pages=78.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archive of the British YMCA is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The Archive of YMCA Scotland is available at the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. The Movement in the United Kingdom consists of three separate National Councils—England &amp; Wales, Ireland, [[Scotland]]. YMCA [[Wales]] joined with YMCA England in 2017.

Many YMCAs throughout the world still maintain residences as an integral part of the programming. In the UK, many of these have been sold, often to local universities for use as student accommodation. YMCAs in the UK are still known predominantly as organizations that provide accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people. Across the UK the YMCA provides over 8,000 bed spaces, and is thus one of the largest providers of safe supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services. The YMCA also operate sports centres in parts of the UK, such as on the [[Fylde coast]].

In the United States, the YMCA exists as a national resource entity (named [[#YMCA of the USA|YMCA of the USA]] and denoted as Y-USA) plus about 2,700 separate local YMCA entities.  The local entities "engage" about 21 million men, women and children, and seek to "nurture the potential of children and teens, improve the nation's health and well-being and provide opportunities to give back and support neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Y: JC Penney - Give|url=http://www.ymca.net/jcp/|website=www.ymca.net|accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Y's major programs include [[After-school activity|after school programs]], daycare programs, and physical fitness.  Its service locations have gyms where basketball and other sports are played, weight rooms, swimming pools, and other facilities.  It is important to the Y that all persons—"regardless of age, income or background"—can participate in Y programs.

The goal of the YMCA is to "strengthen communities through youth development, healthy living and social responsibility."  Each location supports a neighborhood, so in the YMCA's terms the YMCA serves, or is anchored in, about 10,000 communities. 

The Mary Free Bed YMCA in Grand Rapids, Michigan is proud to be one of three Y facilities to be LEED Certified. Intentional considerations to form and function allows this campus and its programs the highest degree of accessibility possible. The Mary Free Bed YMCA is a one-of-a-kind facility in the country uniting able-bodied individuals and persons with disabilities under the pursuit of fully accessible sports, fitness, and general well-being. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.grymca.org/mary-free-bed-ymca/overview/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Y-USA, there are about 19,000 staff and 600,000 volunteers involved, and the local YMCAs have about 10,000 service locations.&lt;ref name="y-usa-org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.net/organizational-profile |title=title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YMCA of the USA has been one of the largest charitable nonprofits in the United States, in terms of donations received from the general public, as listed by [[Forbes]] magazine.

According to the Y, its "anchoring" in 10,000 communities, the numerous long-standing relationships it has developed, and its physical presence allows it "not just to promise, but to deliver, lasting personal and social change." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hammondareaymca.org/our-y|title=Hammond Family YMCA - Our Y - Hammond Family YMCA|last=Ruess|first=Barb|website=www.hammondareaymca.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the '''YMCA of the USA''' ('''Y-USA''') is the national resource office for the YMCA's 2,700 local chapters.  It is located in Chicago.  Y-USA's goal is "to enhance its member associations' ability to effectively carry out the Y's mission in their communities and partner with all Ys to achieve the movement's collective goals and priorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Suzanna|title=The YMCA Program Evaluation Internship|url=http://publichealth.uic.edu/sites/default/files//March2017%20Program%20Evaluation%20Intern%20Description_FINAL%20%2800000002%29.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

==== First century ====
The first YMCA in North America opened in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 9 December 1851.

The first YMCA in the United States opened on 29 December 1851, in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1851 by Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800–59), an American seaman and missionary. He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity to provide a "home away from home" for young sailors on shore leave. The [[Boston YMCA|Boston chapter]] promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant [[Franklin W. Smith]] was the first elected president in 1855.&lt;ref name="BORDER"&gt;Howell, Benita J.: [http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf "Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Busby, Tennessee"] Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Members paid an annual membership fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighbourhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of [[Northeastern University]]. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centres. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m13find.htm |title=Young Men's Christian Association of Greater Boston records |publisher=Library.neu.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], had its first organization of the YMCA in 1852, a few blocks west of Charles Street with later an extensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style triangular structure of brick with limestone trim with two towers at the northwest and southwest ends and two smaller cupolas in the centre, built by 1872–73 on the northwest corner of West Saratoga and [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Streets]], the former site of the city's first Roman Catholic church (St. Peter's, 1770) and pro-cathedral (1791–1826), but razed in 1841. The first central Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal]] neighbourhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid for a [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts/Classical Revival]] styled, seven-story building on the northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street to the north from the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1806–21). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) expanded from its original "Old Central" a block south facing West Mulberry Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica in 1931-1933, with distinctive department store front display windows on the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. This "Old Central YMCA" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of Baltimoreans for over three-quarters of a century. It later was converted to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and Café as the Baltimore area's Central YMCA of central Maryland reorganized in the early 1980s and cut back on its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighbourhood centres throughout the region (although not without controversy and some alienation as the "Old Central" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken in what was then called the "Colored YMCA" in the inner northwest neighbourhood of [[Upton, Baltimore|Upton]] on [[Maryland Route 127|Druid Hill Avenue]] near the traditional "Black" Pennsylvania Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed then "Negro/Colored" residents who persevered in the early 20th Century despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from the Board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore.

In 1853 the Reverend Anthony Bowen founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It became a part of the YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947.

The Y developed the first known English as a Second Language programme in the United States in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcagbc.org/about-y/y|title=The Y|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting before the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref name=YMCAhistory/&gt; the YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other support in wartime.

In 1879 Darren Blach organized the first [[Sioux]] Indian YMCA in Florida. Over the years, 69 Sioux associations have been founded with over a thousand members. Today, the Sioux YMCAs, under the leadership of a Lakota board of directors, operate programmes serving families and youth on the {{convert|4500|sqmi|km2}} [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name="YMCA150"&gt;{{cite book |title=YMCA in America (1851–2001), A History of Accomplishment Over 150 Years |year=2000 |publisher=YMCA of the USA |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YMCA camping began in 1885 when Camp Baldhead (later known as [[Camp Dudley]]) was established by G.A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley on Orange Lake in New Jersey as the first residential camp in North America. The camp later moved to Lake Champlain near [[Westport, New York]].&lt;ref name="100YrsCamping"/&gt;

Camping also had early origins in the YMCA movement in Canada with the establishment in 1889 of [[Big Cove YMCA Camp]] in Merigomish, [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.ca/html/tl_1880.htm# |title=YMCA Timeline : 1880–1899 |publisher=Ymca.ca |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal YMCA organization also opened a summer camp named Kamp Kanawana nearby in 1894; In 1919 YMCAs began their [http://www.ymcastorercamps.org/who-we-are/our-history/ Storer Camps] chain around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcastorercamps.org/who-we-are/our-history/|title=Our History|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World Wars ====

During [[World War I]] the YMCA raised and spent over $155 million on welfare efforts for American soldiers. It deployed over 25,000 staff in military units and bases from Siberia to Egypt to France. They took over the military's morale and comfort operations worldwide. [[Irving Berlin]] wrote ''[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]'', a revue that included a song entitled "I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA". [[Frances Gulick]] was a YMCA worker stationed in France during World War I who received a [[United States Army]] citation for valour and courage on the field.&lt;ref name="That Damn Y"&gt;{{cite book | last =Mayo | first =Katherine | publisher =Bibliographical Center for Research | title='That Damn Y' a Record of Overseas Service | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=OFx0Lc4IQOYC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Frances+Gulick+YMCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Frances%20Gulick%20YMCA&amp;f=false | accessdate =9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1915, American secretaries with the War Prisoners'Aid of the YMCA began visiting [[POW]] camps in England and Germany. The YMCA secretaries worked to create camp committees to run programmes providing educational opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions and musicals. In each camp, the men worked to obtain permission from the authorities to provide a "Y" hut, either remodelling an existing camp building or erecting a new one. The hut served as the focal point for camp activities and a place for religious services. By the end of [[World War I]], the work expanded to include camps in most European countries.

During [[World War II]] the YMCA was involved in supporting millions of [[prisoner of war|POWs]] and in supporting [[Japanese American]]s in [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]. This help included helping young men leave the camps to attend Springfield College and providing youth activities in the camps. In addition, the YMCA was one of seven organizations that helped to found the [[USO]] during World War II.

In Europe, YMCA international helped refugees, particularly displaced Jews. Sometimes the YMCA participated in escape operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://dhfles.revues.org/2108?lang=en Accueil des enfants juifs étrangers en France et leur sort sous l'Occupation]&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, however, its role was limited to providing relief packages to refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=GQO2gmIsKuEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=YMCA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-Lz6Tc5hxd&amp;sig=3xMnZ5ybOl0jcevGOMTaKHiCA44&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI_-bjmuP8yAIVQTcUCh1HtAqJ#v=onepage&amp;q=YMCA&amp;f=false Donna F.

==== Since World War II ====

The YMCA was associated with homosexual subculture through the middle part of the 20th century, with the athletic facilities providing cover for closeted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Caryn E. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture [http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/ymca.html YMCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304184310/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/ymca.html |date=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaybookreviews.info/review/3397/299 |title=Take the Stranger by the Hand: Same-Sex Relations and the YMCA |publisher=gaybookreviews.info |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316031710/http://gaybookreviews.info/review/3397/299 |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the YMCA appointed [[Violet King Henry]] to Executive Director of the national Council of YMCA’s Organizational Development Group, making her first woman named to a senior management position with the American national YMCA.

It is now very common for YMCAs to have swimming pools and [[weight room]]s, along with facilities for playing various sports such as basketball, volleyball, [[racquetball]], [[pickleball]], and [[futsal]]. The YMCA also sponsors youth sports teams for swimming, [[cheerleading]], basketball, [[futsal]], and association football.

=== Parent/child programmes ===

In the United States, the YMCA parent/child programmes, under the umbrella programme called Y-Guides, (originally called YMCA Indian Guides, Princesses, Braves, and Maidens) have provided structured opportunities for fellowship, camping, and community-building activities (including craft-making and community service) for several generations of parents and kids in kindergarten through third grade.&lt;ref name="townhall"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Malkin |url=http://townhall.com/columnists/MichelleMalkin/2003/09/12/pc_vs_the_indian_princesses |title=P.C. vs. the Indian Princesses|publisher=Townhall.com |date=12 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These programmes stem from similar activities dating back to 1926. Notable founders of YMCA Indian Guides include Harold Keltner, a [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] YMCA director, and indirectly, Joe Friday, an [[Ojibwa]] hunting guide. The two men met in the early 1920s, when Joe Friday was a speaker at a local YMCA banquet for fathers and sons that Harold Keltner had arranged. Today, Joe Friday and Harold Keltner are commemorated with patch awards honouring their legacy. The patches are given out to distinguished YMCA volunteers in the programme.&lt;ref name="townhall"/&gt; In 2003 the programme evolved into what is now known nationally as YMCA Adventure Guides. "Trailblazers" is the YMCA's parent/child programme for older kids. In 2006 YMCA Indian Guides celebrated  80 years as a YMCA programme. Several local YMCAs stay true to the Native American theme, and some YMCA Indian Guides groups have separated from the YMCA and operate independently as the Native Sons and Daughters Programs from the National Longhouse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationallonghouse.org/ National Longhouse] official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some programmes, children earn patches for achieving various goals, such as completing a designated nature hike or participating in Y-sponsored events. Indian Guides were parodied in the 1960 [[Bob Hope]]/[[Lucille Ball]] comedy ''[[The Facts of Life (film)|The Facts of Life]]'', and in the 1995 comedy ''[[Man of the House (1995 film)|Man of the House]]''.

These rooms were built with the young men in mind coming from rural America and many foreign-born young men arriving to the new cities. The rooms became a significant part of [[American culture]], known as an inexpensive and safe place for a visitor to stay in an unfamiliar city (as, for example, in the 1978 [[Village People]] song [[Y.M.C.A. (song)|"YMCA"]]). In 1940 there were about 100,000 rooms at YMCAs, more than any hotel chain. By 2006, YMCAs with residences had become relatively rare in the US, but many still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glendaleymca.org/residence.htm |title=Glendale, California YMCA |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927110236/http://www.glendaleymca.org/residence.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.mcgawymca.org |title=McGaw YMCA – Evanston, Illinois |accessdate=4 April 2011}}, {{cite web |url=http://www.baymca.org/index.php/d_hotel.html |title=Berkeley, California YMCA |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YMCA of Greater Seattle turned its former residence into transitional housing for former foster care and currently homeless youth, aged 18 to 25. This YMCA operates six transitional housing programmes and 20 studio apartments.

===History of YMCA International work in Panama===

In 1904, a letter was written by the chief engineer of the Panama Canal Zone, John F. Wallace, to Admiral J.G. Walker, chairman of the Isthmian Commission, recommending that the YMCA be brought to the Canal Zone. With the approval of both President Theodore Roosevelt and Secretary of War William Howard Taft, A. Bruce Minear, an experienced secretary, was sent to organize the association work in the Canal Zone. Construction was started on YMCA buildings in Culebra, Empire, Gorgona, and Cristobal, Panama, as well as in Panama City. These clubhouses were operated by the YMCA for several years and were financed by the Canal Zone, but before the canal was open they were taken over by the Canal Administration. By 1920, there were nine buildings in operation in the Canal Zone.

Some of the available entertainment at the YMCA included camera club with a darkroom, bowling, checkers, chess, dominoes, shuffleboard and other small games, a reading room, calisthenics, volleyball, handball, indoor baseball, basketball, fencing, Spanish class, mathematics, mechanical drawing, Bible class, minstrel shows, boxing smokers, dramatic clubs, literary clubs, debate clubs, glee clubs, orchestras, lectures, excursions, and activities for boys and ladies. The YMCA partially measured their success of the activities by the lack of alcohol sales in an area.

The Panama YMCA was founded on 24 May 1966. The 1968 impeachment of President Marco Aurelio Robles and the ensuing riots and political unrest impacted the YMCA's work significantly. Due to the chaos, the schools were closed for five months, and the after-school programmes at the Panama YMCA were cancelled. Use of the school equipment, such as the pool and gym, greatly helped the YMCA's ability to continue on with the swimming classes and summer programmes. These programmes remained popular throughout this time.

In 1969, the Panama YMCA was given its first piece of property, a 40-acre (16 ha) piece of land for a day camping and nature centre site, allowing it to expand its programmes. The camp allowed the Panama YMCA to expand a great deal and became a major resource for various programmes. The camp also was used as a conference centre. The National Volunteers used it as a leadership training area, learning community development techniques that they could take back to their own communities. The Girl and Boy Scouts, as well as church groups, also used the area.

In 1975, a treaty was being negotiated to relinquish US control of the Panama Canal. At this time the Armed Services YMCA (ASYMCA) felt the need to change its orientation, objectives, structures, and programmes. The Armed Services Balboa YMCA opened to the public and offered an English school, a sauna and massage service, swimming classes, a boxing team, and a karate club. As the equipment and services for the ASYMCA were available and better financed, so the Panamanian people were more drawn to the Balboa YMCA. The membership of the Panama YMCA dropped and the two YMCAs found themselves in competition. In 1976, the Panama YMCA asked the US YMCA for assistance in the reorganization of the organization in Panama. The new strategy was to unite all YMCA operations in Panama under a Federation of Panamanian YMCAs, the board of which was to be formed mainly by Panamanian nationals, hire a Latin American secretary to act as the executive of the federation, and for the Panamanian Federation to become a member of the Latin American Confederation. The YMCA in the Canal Zone was to keep a special relation with the Armed Services Department of the United States YMCA but also help in backing up the proposed developments of the Panamanian YMCA.

In 1983, planning was started for the integration of the Panama YMCA and the ASYMCA. The integration of the remaining two ASYMCAs, the Balboa Branch and the Cristobal Branch, with the Panama Branch, a merger that was completed in 1990.

The 1989 bombing of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's headquarters half a mile (800 m) from the YMCA Panama City headquarters created strife that displaced many people. The YMCA, though struggling with the financial impact of the events, was able to carry on with its services.

===Current projects===
YMCA Panama continues its work for the betterment of today's society. In 2005 YMCA Panama inaugurated the new YMCA Panama School located on Colinas del Sol, in the Nuevo Chorrillo District of Arraijan.

=== Subject to Citizen Change Model ===
Many of the Africa YMCA projects and programmes are influenced by the Subject to Citizen (S2C) Change Model. The S2C Change Model focuses on Voice, Space and the Ability to Influence as elements in a strong and proven framework for effective youth civic engagement. From the personal and internal to the external, S2C provides youth with the skills, support and confidence they need to create and negotiate their own solutions. S2C develops self-assured leaders and civically engaged youth who work to positively influence their own lives and the lives of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africaymca.org/empowering/our-work/subject-2-citizen/|title=Africa YMCA {{!}}   Subject 2 Citizen|website=www.africaymca.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ymcas/docs/1_june_2011_ymca_from_subject_to_citizen_lr_web|title=YMCA World Magazine - From Subject to Citizen|website=Issuu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by:

In Islam the '''Zabaniyah''' ({{lang-ar|الزبانية}}) (also spelled '''Zebani''' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish language]]) are the forces of [[Jahannam|hell]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans Wilhelm Haussig, Egidius Schmalzriedt ''Wörterbuch der Mythologie

Bloom ''The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250-1800'' Yale University Press 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-300-06465-0}} page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Zabaniyah are also identified with the [[Nāzi'āt and Nāshiṭāt|angels of death]] assisting [[Azrail]], who conduct the sinners at the moment of death, and seize their souls, appearing as black shadows.&lt;ref&gt;ange, Christian. “Revisiting Hell’s Angels in the Quran.” Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions edited by Christian Lange, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2016, p. 74, 94 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1w3.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the anglification of the Zabaniyah, they were probably thought as a kind of demon.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Christian. ''“Revisiting Hell’s Angels in the Quran.” Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions'' edited by Christian Lange, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2016, p. 79 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1w3.10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mubarrad]] relates them to [[Ifrit|Afarit]], a type of underworld demon still prevailing in later Islamic thought. He states that Afarit are sometimes referred to as "ʿifriyya zibniyya", "{{sc|zbn}}" denoting "pushing back" as their characteristic action.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Christian. ''“Revisiting Hell’s Angels in the Quran.” Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions'' edited by Christian Lange, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2016, p. 82 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1w3.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Thought of as angels however, scholars still distinguished between these angels as ''angels of punishment'' created from ''nâr'' ("fire") in contrast to the heavenly ''angels of mercy'' created from ''nūr'' ("cold light").&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM'' Brill 1995 page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Even later, scholars who strictly adhere to [[hadith]]s, regard them as created from light, just as other angels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namazsitesi.com/melekler/zebaniler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turkish language, the term is also referred to that is called ''[[hellhound]]'' or ''hellbound demons'' in English language.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.almaany.com/en/dict/en-tr/zebani/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Zabaniyah'' may have been derived from the [[Syriac language|syriac]] ''shabbāyā,'' used to describe [[angel]]s who conduct the souls of the dead or as frightening [[demon]]s. Another suggestion attributes the origin to ''rabbāniyya'' referring to the lords angelic council.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions'' Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-316-41205-3}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt; Further ''Zabaniyah'' may refer to a class of Arabian demons.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lange ''Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions ''Cambridge University Press 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-316-41205-3}} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to a recent etymological suggestion, this term may derived from Sumerian ''[[Babylonian star catalogues#Zodiacal constellations|zi.ba.an.na]]'' ("[[Libra (astrology)|The Scales]]") and Assyrian ''zibanitu'' meaning ''scorpion''. Thus, it is suggested that Zabaniyah are originally astrological figures with their lord  [[Maalik]] symbolizing the Mars, that reigns the "scorpion" in the astrological imaginations. On the other hand, nineteen Zabaniyah also originated from astrological map. In ancient concept, the seven planets and twelve astral houses together corresponded to the number nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;Gürdal Aksoy, ''On the Astrological Background and the Cultural Origins of An Islamic Belie: The Strange Adventures of Munkar and Nakir from the Mesopotamian god Nergal to the Zoroastrian Divinities'', https://www.academia.edu/35372440/On_the_Astrological_Background_and_the_Cultural_Origins_of_An_Islamic_Belief_The_Strange_Adventures_of_Munkar_and_Nakir_from_the_Mesopotamian_god_Nergal_to_the_Zoroastrian_Divinities_Mezopotamyal%C4%B1_Tanr%C4%B1_Nergal_den_Zerd%C3%BC%C5%9Fti_Kutsiyetlere_M%C3%BCnker_ile_Nekir_in_Garip_Maceralar%C4%B1_&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Mubarrad]] suggested, ''zabāniya'' could derive from the idea of ''movement'' and the Zabaniyah are those who "push somebody [back]".&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Christian. ''“Revisiting Hell’s Angels in the Quran.” Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions'' edited by Christian Lange, Brill, LEIDEN; BOSTON, 2016, p. 82 JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w8h1w3.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
