'''AES67''' is a [[technical standard]] for [[audio over IP]] and [[audio over ethernet]] interoperability. The standard was developed by the [[Audio Engineering Society]] and first published in September 2013. It is a [[layer 3]] protocol suite based on existing [[Technical standard|standards]] and is designed to allow interoperability between various IP-based audio networking systems such as [[Ravenna (networking)|RAVENNA]], [[Livewire (networking)|Livewire]], [[Q-LAN]] and [[Dante (networking)|Dante]]. It also provides interoperability with layer 2 technologies, like [[Audio Video Bridging|Audio Video Bridging (AVB)]].&lt;ref name=infocomm2016/&gt;

AES67 promises interoperability between previously competing networked audio systems&lt;ref name=Harvey/&gt; and long-term network interoperation between systems.&lt;ref name=Installation/&gt; Since its publication, AES67 has been implemented independently by several manufacturers and adopted by many others.

==Development==
The standard was developed by the [[Audio Engineering Society]] beginning at the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=aesinit/&gt; The standard was initially published September 2013.&lt;ref name=infocomm/&gt;&lt;ref name=svg/&gt;&lt;ref name=prosoundweb/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; A second printing including a patent statement from [[Audinate]] was published in March 2014. An update including clarifications and error corrections was issued in September 2015.&lt;ref name=aessc/&gt;

The Media Networking Alliance was formed in October 2014 to promote adoption of AES67.&lt;ref name="RadioWorld MNA"/&gt;

In October 2014 a [[plugfest]] was held to test interoperability achieved with AES67.&lt;ref name=psnplugfest/&gt;&lt;ref name=aespf2014/&gt; A second plugfest was conducted in November 2015&lt;ref name=aespf2015/&gt; and third in February 2017.&lt;ref name="aespf2017"/&gt;

In May 2016, the AES published a report describing synchronization interoperability between AES67 and [[SMPTE 2059-2]].&lt;ref name=aesr16/&gt;

In September 2017, [[SMPTE]] published ST 2110, a standard for [[professional video over IP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smpte.org/news-events/news-releases/smpte%C2%AE-approves-st-2110-standards-professional-media-over-managed-ip |title=SMPTE Approves ST 2110-30 Standards for Professional Media Over Managed IP Networks |access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|ST 2110-30}} uses AES67 as the transport for audio accompanying the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Audio for Television: How AES67 and Uncompressed 2022/2110/TR03 Video Fit Together |doi=10.5594/JMI.2017.2703479 |author=Leigh Whitcomb |date=30 June 2017 |work=SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal |publisher=SMPTE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 the Media Networking Alliance merged with the Alliance for IP Media Solutions (AIMS) combining efforts to promote standards-based network transport for audio and video.&lt;ref name="RapidTV"/&gt;

In April 2018 AES67-2018 was published. The principal change in this revision is addition of a [[protocol implementation conformance statement]] (PICS).&lt;ref name="AES67-2018"/&gt;

==Adoption==
The standard has been implemented by [[Lawo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawo.com/en/up-to-date/news/nbsp/lawo_supports_successful_aes67_interoperability_demo_during_aes_convention_in_new_york.html|title=Lawo supports successful AES67 Interoperability Demo during AES Convention in New York|last=Lawo|date=|website=www.lawo.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Telos Systems|Axia]],&lt;ref name=soundandpicture/&gt; AMX (in SVSI devices), Wheatstone,&lt;ref name=rwaes67/&gt;&lt;ref name=TVT/&gt; [https://www.extron.de/company/article.aspx?id=aes67 Extron Electronics], Riedel,&lt;ref name="Digital Production"/&gt; [http://coveloz.com/bach Coveloz Technologies],&lt;ref name="coveloz-avnu-aes67" /&gt; [[ALC NetworX]],&lt;ref name=radioworld/&gt; [[Audinate]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.audinate.com/faq-catagories/aes67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inavate/&gt;&lt;ref name=soundforums/&gt;&lt;ref name=proaudiocentral/&gt;&lt;ref name=prosoundnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=rAVe/&gt; Archwave,&lt;ref name=archwave/&gt; Digigram,&lt;ref name=iabm/&gt; Sonifex,&lt;ref name=sonifex/&gt; [[Yamaha]],&lt;ref name=YamahaPSW/&gt; [[QSC Audio Products|QSC]],&lt;ref name=qsc/&gt; Neutrik, Attero Tech,&lt;ref name=Attero/&gt; Merging Technologies,&lt;ref name=Merging/&gt;&lt;ref name=MergingAudioMedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=MergingAudioMedia2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MergingProaudio/&gt; Gallery SIENNA,&lt;ref name="sienna-tv.com"&gt;http://www.sienna-tv.com/ndi/aes67.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by RAVENNA-enabled devices under its AES67 Operational Profile.&lt;ref name=ravenna_aes67/&gt;

==Shipping Products==
Over time this table will grow to become a resource for integration and compatibility between devices. The discovery methods supported by each device are critical for integration since the AES67 specification does not stipulate how this should be done, but instead provides a variety of options or suggestions. Also, AES67 specifies Multicast or Unicast but many AES67 devices only support Multicast.

== Background ==

A major motivation for the AKLT model was the [[Majumdar–Ghosh model|Majumdar–Ghosh chain]]. Because two out of every set of three neighboring spins in a Majumdar–Ghosh ground state are paired into a singlet, or valence bond, the three spins together can never be found to be in a spin 3/2 state. In fact, the Majumdar–Ghosh Hamiltonian is nothing but the sum of all projectors of three neighboring spins onto a 3/2 state.

The main insight of the AKLT paper was that this construction could be generalized to obtain exactly solvable models for spin sizes other than 1/2. Just as one end of a valence bond is a spin 1/2, the ends of two valence bonds can be combined into a spin 1, three into a spin 3/2, etc.

== Definition ==

Affleck et al. were interested in constructing a one-dimensional state with a valence bond between every pair of sites. Because this leads to two spin 1/2s for every site, the result must be the wavefunction of a spin 1 system.

For every adjacent pair of the spin 1s, two of the four constituent spin 1/2s are stuck in a total spin zero state. Therefore, each pair of spin 1s is forbidden from being in a combined spin 2 state. By writing this condition as a sum of projectors, AKLT arrived at the following Hamiltonian

: &lt;math&gt; \hat H = \sum_j \vec{S}_j \cdot \vec{S}_{j+1} + \frac{1}{3} (\vec{S}_j \cdot \vec{S}_{j+1})^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This Hamiltonian is similar to the spin 1, one-dimensional [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg spin model]]
but has an additional "biquadratic" spin interaction term.

== Ground state ==

By construction, the ground state of the AKLT Hamiltonian is the valence bond solid with a single valence bond connecting every neighboring pair of sites. 
Pictorially, this may be represented as

[[File:AKLT GroundState.png]]

Here the solid points represent spin 1/2s which are put into singlet states. The lines connecting the spin 1/2s are the valence bonds indicating the pattern of singlets. The ovals are projection operators which "tie" together two spin 1/2s  into a single spin 1, projecting out the spin 0 or singlet subspace and keeping only the spin 1 or triplet subspace. The symbols "+", "0" and "−" label the standard spin 1 basis states (eigenstates of the &lt;math&gt;S^z&lt;/math&gt; operator).&lt;ref name="Schollwoeck:2011" /&gt;

===Spin 1/2 edge states===

For the case of spins arranged in a ring (periodic boundary conditions) the AKLT construction yields a unique ground state. But for the case of an open chain, the first and 
last spin 1 have only a single neighbor, leaving one of their constituent spin 1/2s unpaired. As a result, the ends of the chain behave like free spin 1/2 moments even though 
the system consists of spin 1s only.

The spin 1/2 edge states of the AKLT chain can be observed in a few different ways. For short chains, the edge states mix into a singlet or a triplet giving either a unique ground state or a three-fold multiplet of ground states. For longer chains, the edge states decouple exponentially quickly as a function of chain length leading to a ground state manifold that is four-fold degenerate.&lt;ref name="Kennedy:1990" /&gt; By using a numerical method such as [[DMRG]] to measure the local magnetization along the chain, it is also possible to see the edge states directly and to show that they can be removed by placing actual spin 1/2s at the ends.&lt;ref name="White:1993" /&gt; It has even proved possible to detect the spin 1/2 edge states in measurements of a quasi-1D magnetic compound containing a small amount of impurities whose role is to break the chains into finite segments.&lt;ref name="Hagiwara:1990" /&gt;

===Matrix product state representation===

The simplicity of the AKLT ground state allows it to be represented in compact form as a [[matrix product state]].
This is a wavefunction of the form

: &lt;math&gt;|\Psi\rangle = \sum_{\{s\}} \operatorname{Tr}[A^{s_1} A^{s_2} \ldots A^{s_N}] |s_1 s_2 \ldots s_N\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the As are a set of three matrices labeled by &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; and the trace comes from assuming periodic boundary conditions.

The AKLT ground state wavefunction corresponds to the choice:&lt;ref name="Schollwoeck:2011" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A^{+} = +\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}}\ \sigma^{+} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A^{0} = -\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{3}}\ \sigma^{z}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A^{-} = -\sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}}\ \sigma^{-}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Pauli matrix]].

== Generalizations and extensions ==

The AKLT model has been solved on lattices of higher dimension,&lt;ref name="Affleck:1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wei:2011"/&gt; even in [[quasicrystals]] .{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  
The model has also been constructed for higher Lie algebras including [[SU(n)|SU(''n'')]],&lt;ref name="Greiter:2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greiter:2007b"/&gt; [[SO(n)|SO(''n'')]],&lt;ref name="Tu:2008"/&gt; [[Sp(n)]] &lt;ref name="Schuricht:2008"/&gt; and extended to the [[quantum groups]] SUq(''n'').&lt;ref name="SantosParaan2012"/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities.

[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Battle of the Amazons - WGA20302.jpg|thumb|310px|''[[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|Battle of the Amazons]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes.

On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;
* Alce, who was said to have killed the young Oebalus of [[Arcadia]], son of Ida (otherwise unknown), with her spear during the Parthian War.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology"&gt;''[[Latin Anthology]]'', 392 (''Traiani Imperatoris e Bello Parthico versus decori''), ed. Riese&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;
* Andromache, an Amazon who fought Heracles and was defeated; only known from vase paintings.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Boston%2098.916&amp;object=Vase |title=Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=1990-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|title=Perseus:image:1990.24.0349|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Andromache]], wife of [[Hector]].

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty).

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==
[[File:Amazone auf Sondermarke.jpg|thumb|Amazon on a special stamp promoting German horse races in the 1930s.]]
[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">In [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], '''analytical regularization''' is a technique used to convert [[boundary value problem]]s which can be written as [[Fredholm integral equation]]s of the first kind involving [[singular integral operator|singular operators]] into equivalent Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. The latter may be easier to solve analytically and can be studied with [[discretization]] schemes like the [[finite element method]] or the [[finite difference method]] because they are [[pointwise convergence|pointwise convergent]]. In [[computational electromagnetics]], it is known as the '''method of analytical regularization'''. It was first used in mathematics during the development of [[operator theory]] before acquiring a name.&lt;ref name=nosich&gt;Nosich, Alexander I. 'The Method of Analytic Regularization in Wave-Scattering and Eigenvalue Problems: Foundations and Review of Solutions' ''IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine''. Vol 41, No. 3. June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

Analytical regularization proceeds as follows. First, the boundary value problem is formulated as an integral equation. Written as an operator equation, this will take the form
:&lt;math&gt; G X= Y &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; representing boundary conditions and [[Inhomogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneities]], &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; representing the field of interest, and &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; the integral operator describing how Y is given from X based on the physics of the problem.  
Next, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is split into  &lt;math&gt;G_1 + G_2&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; is invertible and contains all the singularities of &lt;math&gt;G &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G_2&lt;/math&gt; is regular. After splitting the operator and multiplying by the inverse of  &lt;math&gt; G_1 &lt;/math&gt;, the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; X + G_1^{-1}  G_2 X=  G_1^{-1} Y &lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt; X + A X =  B &lt;/math&gt;
which is now a Fredholm equation of the second type because by construction &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is [[compact operator|compact]] on the [[Hilbert space]] of which &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; is a member.

In general, several choices for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}_1&lt;/math&gt; will be possible for each problem.&lt;ref name=nosich /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28551">'''Automated theorem proving''' (also known as '''ATP''' or '''automated deduction''') is a subfield of [[automated reasoning]] and [[mathematical logic]] dealing with proving [[mathematical theorem]]s by [[computer program]]s.  Automated reasoning over [[mathematical proof]] was a major impetus for the development of computer science.

== Logical foundations ==
While the roots of formalised [[Logicism|logic]] go back to [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotle]], the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the development of modern logic and formalised mathematics. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879) introduced both a complete [[propositional logic|propositional calculus]] and what is essentially modern [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frege|first=Gottlob|title=Begriffsschrift|year=1879|publisher=Verlag Louis Neuert|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65658c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', published 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frege|first=Gottlob|title=Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik|year=1884|publisher=Wilhelm Kobner|location=Breslau|url=http://www.ac-nancy-metz.fr/enseign/philo/textesph/Frege.pdf|access-date=2012-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926172317/http://www.ac-nancy-metz.fr/enseign/philo/textesph/Frege.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed (parts of) mathematics in formal logic. This approach was continued by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their influential ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', first published 1910–1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principia Mathematica|year=1910–1913|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Bertrand Russell|edition=1st|author2=Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with a revised second edition in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principia Mathematica|year=1927|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Bertrand Russell|edition=2nd|author2=Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Whitehead thought they could derive all mathematical truth using axioms and inference rules of formal logic, in principle opening up the process to automatisation. In 1920, [[Thoralf Skolem]] simplified a previous result by [[Leopold Löwenheim]], leading to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] and, in 1930, to the notion of a [[Herbrand universe]] and a [[Herbrand interpretation]] that allowed (un)satisfiability of first-order formulas (and hence the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of a theorem) to be reduced to (potentially infinitely many) propositional satisfiability problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbrand|first=Jaques|title=Recherches sur la théorie de la démonstration|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, [[Mojżesz Presburger]] showed that the theory of [[natural numbers]] with addition and equality (now called [[Presburger arithmetic]] in his honor) is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] and gave an algorithm that could determine if a given sentence in the language was true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Presburger|first=Mojżesz|title=Über die Vollständigkeit eines gewissen Systems der Arithmetik ganzer Zahlen, in welchem die Addition als einzige Operation hervortritt|journal=Comptes Rendus du I congrès de Mathématiciens des Pays Slaves|year=1929|pages=92–101|location=Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis2001&gt;{{Citation

However, shortly after this positive result, [[Kurt Gödel]] published ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]]'' (1931), showing that in any sufficiently strong axiomatic system there are true statements which cannot be proved in the system. This topic was further developed in the 1930s by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], who on the one hand gave two independent but equivalent definitions of [[computability]], and on the other gave concrete examples for undecidable questions.

== First implementations ==

Shortly after [[World War II]], the first general purpose computers became available. In 1954, [[Martin Davis]] programmed Presburger's algorithm for a [[JOHNNIAC]] vacuum tube computer at the [[Princeton Institute for Advanced Study]]. According to Davis, "Its great triumph was to prove that the sum of two even numbers is even".&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bibel2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bibel|first=Wolfgang|title=Early History and Perspectives of Automated Deduction|journal=KI 2007|year=2007|series=LNAI|issue=4667|pages=2–18|url=http://www.intellektik.de/resources/OsnabrueckBuchfassung.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2012|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; More ambitious was the [[Logic Theory Machine]] in 1956, a deduction system for the [[propositional logic]] of the ''Principia Mathematica'', developed by [[Allen Newell]], [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Cliff Shaw|J. C. Shaw]]. Also running on a JOHNNIAC, the Logic Theory Machine constructed proofs from a small set of propositional axioms and three deduction rules: [[modus ponens]], (propositional) variable substitution, and the replacement of formulas by their definition. The system used heuristic guidance, and managed to prove 38 of the first 52 theorems of the ''Principia''.&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;

The "heuristic" approach of the Logic Theory Machine tried to emulate human mathematicians, and could not guarantee that a proof could be found for every valid theorem even in principle.  In contrast, other, more systematic algorithms achieved, at least theoretically, [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] for first-order logic. Initial approaches relied on the results of Herbrand and Skolem to convert a first-order formula into successively larger sets of propositional formulae by instantiating variables with terms from the [[Herbrand universe]]. The propositional formulas could then be checked for unsatisfiability using a number of methods. Gilmore's program used conversion to [[disjunctive normal form]], a form in which the satisfiability of a formula is obvious.&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Paul|title=A proof procedure for quantification theory: its justification and realisation|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|year=1960|volume=4|pages=28–35|doi=10.1147/rd.41.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decidability of the problem ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Depending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a formula varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of [[propositional logic]], the problem is decidable but [[co-NP-complete]], and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proof tasks. For a [[first-order logic|first order predicate calculus]], [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] states that the theorems (provable statements) are exactly the logically valid [[well-formed formula]]s, so identifying valid formulas is [[recursively enumerable]]: given unbounded resources, any valid formula can eventually be proven. However, ''invalid'' formulas (those that are ''not'' entailed by a given theory), cannot always be recognized.

The above applies to first order theories, such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]. However, for a specific model that may be described by a first order theory, some statements may be true but undecidable in the theory used to describe the model. For example, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], we know that any theory whose proper axioms are true for the natural numbers cannot prove all first order statements true for the natural numbers, even if the list of proper axioms is allowed to be infinite enumerable. It follows that an automated theorem prover will fail to terminate while searching for a proof precisely when the statement being investigated is undecidable in the theory being used, even if it is true in the model of interest. Despite this theoretical limit, in practice, theorem provers can solve many hard problems, even in models that are not fully described by any first order theory (such as the integers).

== Related problems ==

A simpler, but related, problem is '''[[proof verification]]''', where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a [[primitive recursive function]] or program, and hence the problem is always decidable.

Since the proofs generated by automated theorem provers are typically very large, the problem of [[proof compression]] is crucial and various techniques aiming at making the prover's output smaller, and consequently more easily understandable and checkable, have been developed.

[[Proof assistant]]s require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have proved a number of interesting and hard theorems, including at least one that has eluded human mathematicians for a long time, namely the [[Robbins conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.W. McCune|title=Solution of the Robbins Problem|journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning|year=1997|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h77246751668616h/|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Math Proof Shows Reasoning Power|author=Gina Kolata|date=December 10, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.

Another distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  Other techniques would include [[model checking]], which, in the simplest case, involves brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).

There are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule. There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true. A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called [[non-surveyable proofs]]).  Another example of a program-assisted proof is the one that shows that the game of [[Connect Four]] can always be won by first player.

== Industrial uses ==

Commercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in [[integrated circuit design]] and verification.  Since the [[Pentium FDIV bug]], the complicated [[floating point unit]]s of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny. [[AMD]], [[Intel]] and others use automated theorem proving to verify that division and other operations are correctly implemented in their processors.

==First-order theorem proving==
In the late 1960s agencies funding research in automated deduction began to emphasize the need for practical applications. One of the first fruitful areas was that of [[program verification]] whereby first-order theorem provers were applied to the problem of verifying the correctness of computer programs in languages such as Pascal, Ada, Java etc. Notable among early program verification systems was the Stanford Pascal Verifier developed by David Luckham at Stanford University. This was based on the Stanford Resolution Prover also developed at Stanford using J.A. Robinson's resolution Principle. This was the first automated deduction system to demonstrate an ability to solve mathematical problems that were announced in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society before solutions were formally published.

[[First-order logic|First-order]] theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling ''fully'' automated systems. More expressive logics, such as [[Higher-order logic|higher order logics]], allow the convenient expression of a wider range of problems than first order logic, but theorem proving for these logics is less well developed.

==Benchmarks, Competitions, and Sources ==
The quality of implemented systems has benefited from the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples — the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) Problem Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Geoff|title=The TPTP Problem Library for Automated Theorem Proving|url=http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  — as well as from the [[CADE ATP System Competition]] (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.

Some important systems (all have won at least one CASC competition division) are listed below.
* [[E theorem prover|E]] is a high-performance prover for full first-order logic, but built on a [[superposition calculus|purely equational calculus]], originally developed in the automated reasoning group of [[Technical University of Munich]], and now at [[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University]] in [[Stuttgart]].
* [[Otter (theorem prover)|Otter]], developed at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], is based on [[first-order resolution]] and [[paramodulation]]. Otter has since been replaced by [[Prover9]], which is paired with [[Mace4]].
* [[SETHEO]] is a high-performance system based on the goal-directed [[model elimination]] calculus. It is developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich. E and SETHEO have been combined (with other systems) in the composite theorem prover E-SETHEO.
* [[Vampire theorem prover|Vampire]] is developed and implemented at [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ Manchester University] by [http://www.voronkov.com/ Andrei Voronkov] and [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hoderk/ Krystof Hoder], formerly also by [http://www.freewebs.com/riazanov/ Alexandre Riazanov]. It has won the CADE ATP System Competition in the most prestigious CNF (MIX) division for eleven years (1999, 2001–2010).
* Waldmeister is a specialized system for unit-equational first-order logic developed by Arnim Buch and Thomas Hillenbrand. It won the CASC UEQ division for fourteen consecutive years (1997–2010).
* [[SPASS]] is a first order logic theorem prover with equality. This is developed by the research group Automation of Logic, [[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]].

The [https://theoremprover-museum.github.io/ Theorem Prover Museum] is an initiative to conserve the sources of theorem prover systems for future analysis, since they are important cultural/scientific artefacts. It has the sources of many of the systems mentioned above.

[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|300px|Overview of cycle between autotrophs and [[heterotroph]]s. [[Photosynthesis]] is the main means by which plants, algae and many bacteria produce organic compounds and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green arrow&lt;/span&gt;).]]

An '''autotroph'''  or '''producer''', is an organism that produces complex [[organic compound]]s (such as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s) from simple substances present in its surroundings, generally using energy from light ([[photosynthesis]]) or inorganic chemical reactions ([[chemosynthesis]]).&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last= Chang |first= Kenneth |title= Visions of Life on Mars in Earth's Depths |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date= 12 September 2016 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= 12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are the [[primary production|producers]] in a [[food chain]], such as [[plant]]s on land or [[algae]] in water (in contrast to [[heterotrophs]] as consumers of autotrophs).  They do not need a living source of energy or organic [[carbon]]. Autotrophs can [[Redox|reduce]] [[carbon dioxide]] to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and also create a store of chemical energy.  Most autotrophs use water as the [[reducing agent]], but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as [[hydrogen sulfide]].  Some autotrophs, such as green plants and algae, are [[phototrophs]], meaning that they convert electromagnetic energy from sunlight  into chemical energy in the form of [[Photochemical carbon dioxide reduction|reduced carbon]].

Autotrophs can be [[phototroph|photoautotroph]]s or [[chemotroph|chemoautotroph]]s. Phototrophs use light as an energy source, while chemotrophs use electron donors as a source of energy, whether from organic or inorganic sources; however in the case of autotrophs, these electron donors come from inorganic chemical sources. Such chemotrophs are [[lithotroph]]s. Lithotrophs use inorganic compounds, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], [[ammonium]] and [[Iron(II) oxide|ferrous iron]], as reducing agents for [[biosynthesis]] and chemical energy storage. Photoautotrophs and lithoautotrophs use a portion of the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] produced during photosynthesis or the oxidation of inorganic compounds to reduce [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to NADPH to form organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
The Greek term ''autotroph'' was coined by the German botanist [[Albert Bernhard Frank]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, A.B. ''Lehrbuch der Botanik''. W. Engelmann, Leipzig 1892-93, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/29599#/summary].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Some organisms rely on [[organic compound]]s as a source of [[carbon]], but are able to use [[light]] or [[inorganic compounds]] as a source of energy. Such organisms are not defined as autotrophic, but rather as heterotrophic. An organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from light is called a '''''[[photoheterotroph]]''''', while an organism that obtains carbon from organic compounds but obtains energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds is termed a '''''[[chemoheterotroph]]''''', '''''chemolithoheterotroph''''', or '''''[[Lithotroph#Lithoheterotrophs versus lithoautotrophs|lithoheterotroph]]'''''.

Evidence suggests that some fungi may also obtain energy from [[radiation]]. Such [[radiotrophic fungus|radiotrophic fungi]] were found growing inside a reactor of the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20070422222547data_trunc_sys.shtml | title=Chernobyl Fungus Feeds On Radiation | last=Melville | first=Kate | date=23 May 2007 | accessdate=18 February 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204184150/http://scienceagogo.com/news/20070422222547data_trunc_sys.shtml| archivedate= 4 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[Image:Colpfl27a.jpg|thumb|200px|Green fronds of a [[maidenhair fern]], a photoautotroph]]
{{see also|Primary production}}

Autotrophs are fundamental to the food chains of all [[ecosystem]]s in the world. They take energy from the environment in the form of sunlight or inorganic chemicals and use it to create energy-rich molecules such as carbohydrates. This mechanism is called [[primary production]]. Other organisms, called [[heterotroph]]s, take in autotrophs as [[food]] to carry out functions necessary for their life. Thus, heterotrophs &amp;mdash; all [[animal]]s, almost all [[fungi]], as well as most [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] &amp;mdash; depend on autotrophs, or [[primary producer]]s, for the energy and raw materials they need. [[Heterotrophs]] obtain energy by breaking down organic molecules (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) obtained in food. [[Carnivorous]] organisms rely on autotrophs indirectly, as the [[nutrient]]s obtained from their heterotroph prey come from autotrophs they have consumed.

Most ecosystems are supported by the autotrophic [[primary production]] of plants that capture [[photon]]s initially released by the [[sun]]. Plants can only use a fraction of this energy for [[photosynthesis]], approximately 1% is used by autotrophs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868970980|title=Energy, economic growth, and the environment|last=H.|first=Schurr, Sam|isbn=9781617260209|location=New York|oclc=868970980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[photosynthesis]] [[Water splitting|splits a water molecule]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), releasing oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into the atmosphere, and [[redox|reducing]] carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to release the [[hydrogen atoms]] that fuel the [[metabolism|metabolic]] process of [[primary production]]. Plants convert and store the energy of the photon into the chemical bonds of [[simple sugars]] during photosynthesis. These plant sugars are [[polymerization|polymerized]] for storage as long-chain [[carbohydrate]]s, including other sugars, starch, and cellulose; glucose is also used to make [[fat]]s and [[protein]]s. When autotrophs are eaten by [[heterotroph]]s, i.e., consumers such as animals, the [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[protein]]s contained in them become energy sources for the [[heterotrophs]].&lt;ref name="macronutrients"&gt;{{cite book | last= Beckett| first= Brian S.| title= Illustrated Human and Social Biology| year= 1981| publisher= Oxford University Press| page= 38| url= https://books.google.com/?id=-mYIPXC0gEgC&amp;pg=PA38 | isbn= 978-0-19-914065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can be made using [[nitrate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[phosphate]]s in the soil.&lt;ref name="Odum05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.

CMOS was officially created in 1967 as the Canadian Meteorological Society and adopted its present name in 1977, following an invitation by the Canadian Meteorological Society to the oceanographic community in Canada to join the Society. However, CMOS has a rich history dating back to 1939 when it was known as the Canadian Branch of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="cmos"/&gt;

In 2007, CMOS issued a position statement on [[global warming]]:

:CMOS endorses the process of periodic climate science assessment carried out by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and supports the conclusion, in its [[Third Assessment Report]], which states that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmos.ca/climatechangepole.html Position Statement on Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chalk River Laboratories''' ({{lang-fr|Laboratoires de Chalk River}}; also known as '''CRL''', '''Chalk River Labs''' and formerly '''Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories''') is a Canadian [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] research facility in [[Deep River, Ontario|Deep River]], [[Renfrew County]], [[Ontario]], near [[Chalk River]], about {{cvt|180|km}} north-west of [[Ottawa]].

CRL is a site of major research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, in particular [[CANDU reactor]] technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and unique research facilities. For example, [[Bertram Brockhouse]], a professor at [[McMaster University]], received the 1994 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his pioneering work in [[neutron spectroscopy]] while at CRL from 1950-1962.  Sir [[John Cockcroft]] was an early director of CRL and also a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. CRL produces a large share of the world's supply of [[Nuclear medicine|medical radioisotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chalk River makes 1st isotopes in 15 months|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|publisher=CBC.ca|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=August 18, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606061302/http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/08/18/isotopes-medical-chalk-river-aecl.html|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned by the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories subsidiary of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] and operated under contract by the Canadian National Energy Alliance, a private-sector consortium led by [[SNC-Lavalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marowits|first1=Ross|title=SNC-Lavalin consortium chosen to run Chalk River nuclear lab|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|accessdate=February 9, 2017|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=June 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415135343/http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/snc-lavalin-consortium-chosen-to-run-chalk-river-nuclear-lab|archivedate=April 15, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:NRX_Pile_Building_and_ZEEP_Building-_Cooling_Tanks_1945.jpg|thumb|right|NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945]] The facility arose out of a 1942 collaboration between British and Canadian nuclear researchers which saw a [[Montreal Laboratory|Montreal research laboratory]] established under the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC).  By 1944 the Chalk River Laboratories were opened and in September, 1945 the facility saw the first nuclear reactor outside of the United States become operational (see [[Lew Kowarski]]).  In 1946, NRC closed the Montreal laboratory and focused its resources on Chalk River.

In 1952, [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) was created by the government to promote peaceful use of nuclear energy.  AECL also took over operation of Chalk River from the NRC.  Throughout the 1950s-2000s various nuclear research reactors have been operated by AECL for production of nuclear material for medical and scientific applications.  The Laboratories produce about one-third of the world's [[Nuclear medicine|medical isotopes]], and about half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1976, Chalk River facilities supplied about 250&amp;nbsp;kg of [[plutonium]], in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;letter from Dept. of Energy official, March 4, 1996, published at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628205542/http://www.ccnr.org/DOE.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki]], Japan, used about 6.4&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium.)

Canada's first [[nuclear power plant]], a partnership between AECL and [[Ontario Hydro|Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, [[Nuclear Power Demonstration]] (NPD), was a demonstration of the [[CANDU reactor]] design, one of the world's safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River [[neutron monitor]] operated once in Chalk river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129081714/http://cr0.izmiran.ru/dprv/baseinfo.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1952 NRX incident===
Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred in 1952, when there was a [[Criticality accident|power excursion]] and partial loss of coolant in the [[NRX]] reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. The reactor and the reactor building were seriously damaged by hydrogen explosions. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet. In the cellar of the building, some 4,500 tons of radioactive water was found. This water was dumped in ditches around 1600 meters from the border of the [[Ottawa River]]. During this accident some 10,000 [[curies]] or 370 TBq of radioactive material was released.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Nuclear Society'' (1989) [http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/nrx.html The NRX Incident by Peter Jedicke]&lt;/ref&gt; Future [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Jimmy Carter]], then a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer, was part of the cleanup crew.&lt;ref name="paulson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|title=Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout|author=|date=|website=www.ccnr.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232909/http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html|archivedate=23 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|title=Jimmy Carter timeline|author=|date=|website=pbs.org|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329152940/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the reactor was in use again.&lt;ref name="CNF1952"&gt;{{en icon}} ''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRX reactor in 1952?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958 NRU incident===
The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the [[National Research Universal reactor]] (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic [[uranium]] was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire and the rod broke. The largest part of the rod fell down into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down at the moment they passed the smoking entrance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Nuclear FAQ'' [http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel.  Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#nru1958 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130022641/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm |date=2009-01-30 }} What are the details of the accident at Chalk River's NRU reactor in 1958?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|title=The Canadian Nuclear FAQ - Section D: Safety and Liability|author=|date=|website=www.nuclearfaq.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006022038/http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/cnf_sectionD.htm#x|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Anti-nuclear movement in Canada#Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility|Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility]], an [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.&lt;ref name="paulson"/&gt;

Chalk River Laboratories remain an AECL facility to this day and are used as both a research (in partnership with the NRC) and production facility (on behalf of AECL) in support of other Canadian electrical utilities.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which makes medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor's cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC.  This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River makes the majority of the world's supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world's [[technetium-99m]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402220916/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/highlights/2006/0605chalkriver_e.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2007, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received [[Royal Assent]] on December 12. Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] criticized the CNSC for this shutdown which "jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians", insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential [[nuclear medicine]] should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor's operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403090931/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071211.wisotope1211/BNStory/National/ |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Ljunggren |first=David |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |title=Canadian parliament orders isotope reactor restart |journal=Reuters |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603180453/http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN1154689120071213 |archivedate=2009-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:49 PM EDT Facebook Twitter RSS |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |title=Much more at stake than medical isotopes &amp;#124; Toronto Star |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002154837/http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/285210 |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |title=Chalk River plant to begin making radioisotopes in a week - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926071822/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/12/13/chalk-river-reactor.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |title=Harper government fires Linda Keen over isotope crisis |publisher=Canada.com |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110071829/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=c70b1f37-7efe-46c1-a165-8b0efd4dfcaa |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, [[heavy water]] containing tritium leaked from the NRU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |title=Current Issues - CNSC Report to Minister of Natural Resources regarding recent events at National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222055045/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/issues/memo_re_december_2008.cfm |archivedate=2013-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaked water was contained within the facility, and the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]] (CNSC) was notified immediately, as required.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|AECL]] mentioned that 47 litres of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |title=Agency says it was told of nuke leak within hours &amp;#124; CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604012750/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090127/radioactive_spill_090127/20090127?hub=Canada&amp;s_name= |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615020303/http://www.aecl.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=971 |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was informed of the shutdown at the reactor, but not the details of the leakage since it was not deemed to pose a risk to the public or environment.  The leak stopped before the source could be identified, and the reactor was restarted on December 11, 2008 with the approval of the CNSC, after a strategy for dealing with the leak (should it reappear) was put in place.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking 7,001 litres of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor's reflector system.  This water has been systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations.  Although the leakage is not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |title=News Releases |publisher=Cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229170842/http://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/mediacentre/releases/news_release.cfm?news_release_id=332 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; AECL has plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===
{{Main|National Research Universal reactor#2009 Shutdown|l1=National Research Universal reactor&amp;nbsp;— 2009 Shutdown}}
In mid-May 2009 the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown that lasted until August 2010.  The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairs&amp;nbsp;— all with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of 8 metres due to the residual radioactive fields in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage. {{citation-needed|date=December 2016}}

==NRU shutdown in March 2018==
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016, however the licence was extended to March 31 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|title=Canada's NRU reactor in Chalk River is being turned off for good  - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409162437/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/a-relic-of-canada-s-atom-age-the-nru-reactor-is-shutting-down-for-good-1.4595836|archivedate=9 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;2018.

In [[mechanics]], '''compression''' is the application of balanced inward ("pushing") forces to different points on a material or structure, that is, forces with no net sum or [[torque]] directed so as to reduce its size in one or more directions.&lt;ref name=Beer&gt;Ferdinand Pierre Beer, Elwood Russell Johnston, John T. DeWolf (1992), "Mechanics of Materials". (Book) McGraw-Hill Professional, {{ISBN|0-07-112939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with [[tension (physics)|tension]] or traction, the application of balanced outward ("pulling") forces; and with [[shear stress|shearing]] forces, directed so as to displace layers of the material parallel to each other.  The [[compressive strength]] of materials and structures is an important engineering consideration.

In '''uniaxial compression''', the forces are directed along one direction only, so that they act towards decreasing the object's length along that direction.  The compressive forces may also be applied in multiple directions; for example inwards along the edges of a plate or all over the side surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], so as to reduce its [[area]] ('''biaxial compression'''), or inwards over the entire surface of a body, so as to reduce its [[volume]].

Technically, a material is under a state of compression, at some specific point and along a specific direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, if the [[normal stress|normal component]] of the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] vector across a surface with [[surface normal|normal direction]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is directed opposite to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  If the stress vector itself is opposite to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the material is said to be under '''normal compression''' or '''pure compressive stress''' along &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  In a solid, the amount of compression generally depends on the direction &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the material may be under compression along some directions but under traction along others.  If the stress vector is purely compressive and has the same magnitude for all directions, the material is said to be under '''isotropic''' or '''hydrostatic compression''' at that point.  This is the only type of static compression that liquids and gases can bear

In a mechanical longitudinal wave, or compression wave, the medium is displaced in the wave's direction, resulting in areas of compression and [[rarefaction]].

== Effects ==
When put under compression (or any other type of stress), every material will suffer some deformation, even if imperceptible, that causes the average relative positions of its atoms and molecules to change.  The deformation may be permanent, or may be reversed when the compression forces disappear. In the latter case, the deformation gives rise to reaction forces that oppose the compression forces, and may eventually balance them.

Liquids and gases cannot bear steady uniaxial or biaxial compression, they will deform promptly and permanently and will not offer any permanent reaction force. However they can bear isotropic compression, and may be compressed in other ways momentarily, for instance in a [[sound wave]].

[[File:Corset 1900.jpg|thumb|100px|Tightening a [[corset]] applies biaxial compression to the waist.]]
Every ordinary material will contract in volume when put under isotropic compression, contract in cross-section area when put under uniform biaxial compression, and contract in length when put into uniaxial compression.  The deformation may not be uniform and may not be aligned with the compression forces. What happens in the directions where there is no compression depends on the material.  Most materials will expand in those directions, but some special materials will remain unchanged or even contract. In general, the relation between the stress applied to a material and the resulting deformation is a central topic of [[continuum mechanics]].

== Uses ==
[[File:Compression test.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Compression test on a [[universal testing machine]]]]

Compression of solids has many implications in [[materials science]], [[physics]] and [[structural engineering]], for compression yields noticeable amounts of [[Stress (physics)|stress]] and [[tension (mechanics)|tension]].

By inducing compression, mechanical properties such as [[compressive strength]] or [[modulus of elasticity]], can be measured.

Compression machines range from very small table top systems  to ones with over 53 MN capacity.

Gases are often stored and shipped in highly [[compressed gas|compressed]] form, to save space.  Slightly compressed air or other gases are also used to fill [[balloon]]s, [[rubber boat]]s, and other [[inflatable structure]]s.  Compressed liquids are used in [[hydraulic equipment]] and in [[fracking]].

== In engines ==

=== Internal combustion engines ===
In [[internal combustion engine]]s the explosive mixture gets compressed before it is ignited; the compression improves the efficiency of the engine. In the [[Otto cycle]], for instance, the second stroke of the piston effects the compression of the charge which has been drawn into the cylinder by the first forward stroke.

=== Steam engines ===
The term is applied to the arrangement by which the exhaust valve of a [[steam engine]] is made to close, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam in the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], before the stroke of the piston is quite complete. This steam being compressed as the stroke is completed, a cushion is formed against which the [[piston]] does work while its velocity is being rapidly reduced, and thus the stresses in the mechanism due to the inertia of the reciprocating parts are lessened. This compression, moreover, obviates the shock which would otherwise be caused by the admission of the fresh steam for the return stroke.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}
In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''computational resource''' is a resource used by some [[computational model]]s in the solution of [[computational problem]]s.  

The simplest computational resources are [[computation time]], the number of steps necessary to solve a problem, and '''memory space''', the amount of storage needed while solving the problem, but many more complicated resources have been defined.{{cn|date=May 2013}}

A computational problem is generally{{cn|date=May 2013}} defined in terms of its action on any valid input. Examples of problems might be "given an integer ''n'', determine whether ''n'' is prime", or "given two numbers ''x'' and ''y'', calculate the product ''x''*''y''".  As the inputs get bigger, the amount of computational resources needed to solve a problem will increase.  Thus, the resources needed to solve a problem are described in terms of [[asymptotic analysis]], by identifying the resources as a function of the length or size of the input.  Resource usage is often partially quantified using [[Big O notation]].

Computational resources are useful because we can study which problems can be computed in a certain amount of each computational resource.  In this way, we can determine whether [[algorithm]]s for solving the problem are optimal and we can make statements about an [[Algorithmic efficiency|algorithm's efficiency]].  The set of all of the computational problems that can be solved using a certain amount of a certain computational resource is a [[complexity class]], and relationships between different complexity classes are one of the most important topics in complexity theory.

== Describing generally accessible computing equipment ==

The term '''"Computational resource"''' is commonly used to describe accessible computing equipment and software.  See [[Utility computing]].

== Formal quantification of computing capability ==

There has been some effort to formally quantify computing capability. A bounded [[Turing machine]] has been used to model specific computations using the number of state transitions and alphabet size to quantify the computational effort required to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Within the conservation lab at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], specialized activities for the treatment and care of paintings, sculpture, works on paper, and time-based media are performed. As an aid in treatment and to better understand the artist’s creative methods and materials, conservators closely examine works of art using a variety of technical tools, including stereo-binocular microscopes and ultraviolet light. Conservators also use an array of analytical methods to identify under-drawings, pigments, binding media, and coating materials. All treatments involve collaboration with curators, and frequently scientists, to determine the condition of a work of art, guide treatment decisions, and examine the artist’s working methods and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conservation - Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|url = http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/conservation/#collection=conservation&amp;detail=http%253A//hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/conservation-department/&amp;title=Conservation+Department|website = Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16087">The term '''contact resistance''' refers to the contribution to the total [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of [[Electrical contact|electrical leads and connections]] as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as [[Contact_resistance#Mechanisms|resistance creep]]. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by [[William Shockley]]&lt;ref name="Shockley_1964"/&gt; to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, "Interface resistance", "transitional resistance", or just simply "correction term" are also used. The term "parasitic resistance" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution.

[[File:Contact resistance example.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the contact resistance estimation by the transmission line method.]]

==Experimental characterization==
Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).

For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the [[I-V curve]] at V=0:

:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \left\{ \frac{\partial V}{\partial J} \right\}_{V=0}&lt;/math&gt;

where J is the current density = current/area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; stands for ohms. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have [[ohmic contact]]s.

The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a [[Four-terminal sensing|four terminal measurement]] to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two-lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four-probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature.

[[Inductive coupling|Inductive]] and [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]] methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic [[electrical impedance|impedance]] without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, [[direct current]] methods are more typically used to determine resistance.

The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the [[transmission line measurement|transmission line model]] (TLM). Here, the total device resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is plotted as a function of the channel length:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot} = R_\text{c} + R_\text{ch} = R_\text{c} + \frac{L}{W C \mu \left(V_\text{gs} - V_\text{ds}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{ch}&lt;/math&gt; are contact and channel resistances, respectively, &lt;math&gt;L/W&lt;/math&gt; is the channel length/width, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is carrier mobility, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{gs}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{ds}&lt;/math&gt; are gate-source and drain-source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the ”contact resistance-free” carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance,...) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance.&lt;ref name="Weis_2010"/&gt;

Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement&lt;ref name="Pesavento_2004"/&gt; and the modified [[time-of-flight]] method (TOF).&lt;ref name="Weis_2009"/&gt; The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM)&lt;ref name="Bürgi_2002"/&gt; and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation.&lt;ref name="Nakao_2009"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
For given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to [[surface structure]] and applied load ([[Contact mechanics]]).&lt;ref name="Zhai_2016"/&gt; Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and [[adsorbtion|adsorbed]] water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting [[Asperity_(materials_science)|asperities]] and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities. Over time, the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown, in a process also known as resistance creep.&lt;ref name="Zhai_2015"/&gt; The coupling of [[surface chemistry]], contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be accounted for in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena.

==Quantum limit==
When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/k_F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi surface|Fermi wavevector]] of the conducting material, [[Ohm's law]] does not hold anymore. These small devices are called [[quantum point contact]]s. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value &lt;math&gt;2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]. Quantum point contacts behave more like [[waveguide]]s than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the [[Rolf Landauer|Landauer]] scattering formalism.&lt;ref name="Landauer_1976"/&gt; Point-contact [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] is an important technique for characterizing [[superconductor]]s.

==Other forms of contact resistance==
Measurements of [[thermal conductivity]] are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in [[hydrostatic pressure]] (analogous to electrical [[voltage]]) occurs when [[fluid flow]] transitions from one channel to another.

==Significance==
Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded [[jump start (vehicle)|jumper cable]] clamps can frustrate attempts to start a [[automobile|vehicle]] that has a low [[Lead-acid battery|battery]]. Dirty or [[corrosion|corroded]] contacts on a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial [[Joule heating|heating]] in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.

[[Image:CSLDV-WT-TestSchematic.jpg||right|250px|Experimental setup for CSLDV test]] 
'''Continuous-scan laser Doppler vibrometry''' ('''CSLDV''') is a method of using a [[laser Doppler vibrometer]] (LDV) in which the [[laser]] beam is swept across the surface of a test subject to capture the motion of a surface at many points simultaneously.  This is different from [[scanning laser vibrometry]] (SLDV) in which the laser beam is kept at a fixed point during each measurement and quickly moved to a new position before acquiring the next measurement.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
CSLDV can allow one to capture the [[normal mode|mode shapes]] of a structure with high resolution much more quickly than would be possible with SLDV.  Allen &amp; Sracic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Sracic | first2 = M. W. | year = 2010 | title = A New Method for Processing Impact Excited Continuous-Scan Laser Doppler Vibrometer Measurements | url = | journal = Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 721–735 | doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2009.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; show results where measurements were acquired with CSLDV in a hundredth of the time that would be required for LDV.  Allen &amp; Aguilar&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Allen and D. M. Aguilar, "Model Validation of a Bolted Beam Using Spatially Detailed Mode Shapes Measured by Continuous-Scan Laser Doppler Vibrometry," in 50th AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference Palm Springs, California, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; postulated that the additional detail available from CSLDV might provide important information when validating [[Structural dynamics|structural dynamic]] models.  CSLDV also makes testing with an instrumented hammer practical with LDV, and some have speculated that CSLDV might be useful in cases where it is impossible to recreate the input forces, such as explosive loadings.

The primary disadvantage of CSLDV is the additional laser [[speckle noise]] that occurs if the laser spot scans the structure too quickly.  Speckle noise is caused by micro-scale irregularities in the surface that change the intensity pattern of the laser light received by the LDV as it scans the surface.  Similar problems arise when applying LDV to rotating shafts, crankshafts for example.  Speckle noise is difficult to predict, depending on the properties of the surface, the geometry of the structure and position of the LDV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rothberg | first1 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Numerical simulation of speckle noise in laser vibrometry | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 4523–33 | doi=10.1364/ao.45.004523}}&lt;/ref&gt; so further research is needed to establish the limits of CSLDV.

==History==
Sriram et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sriram | first1 = P. | last2 = Craig | first2 = J. I. | last3 = Hanagud | first3 = S. | year = 1990 | title = Scanning laser Doppler vibrometer for modal testing | url = | journal = International Journal of Analytical and Experimental Modal Analysis | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 155–167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; seem to have been the first to publish regarding CSLDV, although they studied it for only a few years and discontinued research.  Most of the subsequent advances in this area have arisen from the group at [[Imperial College]] in London by Stanbridge, Ewins, Martarelli and Di Maio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stanbridge | first1 = A. B. | last2 = Ewins | first2 = D. J. | year = 1999 | title = Modal testing using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer | url = | journal = Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 255–70 | doi=10.1006/mssp.1998.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Ribichini, D. Di Maio, A. B. Stanbridge, and D. J. Ewins, "Impact Testing With a Continuously-Scanning LDV," in 26th International Modal Analysis Conference (IMAC XXVI) Orlando, Florida, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Martarelli, "Exploiting the Laser Scanning Facility for Vibration Measurements," in Imperial College of Science, Technology &amp; Medicine. vol. PhD London: Imperial College, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martarelli | first1 = M. | last2 = Ewins | first2 = D.

Allen's research group at the [[University of Wisconsin – Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]] began work in this area in 2006 and published the first output-only CSLDV algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = S. | last2 = Allen | first2 = M.

==Application==

Zhu's research group at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] applied CSLDV to structural damage detection and developed a damage identification methodology for beams that uses demodulation and polynomial methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Da-Ming | last2 = Xu | first2 = Y.

'''Convex optimization''' is a subfield of [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] that studies the problem of minimizing [[convex function]]s over [[convex set]]s. The convexity makes optimization easier than the general case since a [[local optimum|local minimum]] must be a [[global optimum|global minimum]], and first-order conditions are sufficient conditions for optimality.&lt;ref name="rockafellar93"&gt;{{cite journal

Convex minimization has applications in a wide range of disciplines, such as automatic [[control systems]], estimation and [[signal processing]], communications and networks, electronic [[circuit design]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyd/Vandenberghe, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; data analysis and modeling, [[finance]], [[statistics]] ([[optimal design|optimal experimental design]]),&lt;ref&gt;Chritensen/Klarbring, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[structural optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyd/Vandenberghe, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; With recent advancements in computing and in optimization theory, convex minimization is nearly as straightforward as [[linear programming]]. Many optimization problems can be reformulated as convex minimization problems. For example, the problem of ''maximizing'' a ''concave'' function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be re-formulated equivalently as a problem of minimizing the convex function &lt;math&gt;-f&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==

* Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[convex set|convex subset]] of a [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, for any two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} + t(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}) = t\mathbf{x} + (1 - t)\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[convex function|convex]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] from this convex subset to the real numbers: for any &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;f(t\mathbf{x} + (1-t)\mathbf{y}) \leq tf(\mathbf{x}) + (1 - t)f(\mathbf{y}).&lt;/math&gt;

The goal of a convex minimization problem is defined to be finding any point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; for which the number &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x^*})&lt;/math&gt; is smallest, i.e., a point/vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^\ast}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x^\ast}) \le f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In terms of the general optimization definition ===
This problem is, perhaps more conveniently, phrased in the more general, shorthand definition of optimization: finding some &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^\ast} \in \mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x^\ast}) = \min \{ f(\mathbf{x}) : \mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{X} \},&lt;/math&gt;

for some feasible set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} \subset X&lt;/math&gt; and objective function &lt;math&gt;f : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This uses the general definition of an optimization problem — the above definition does not guarantee a ''convex'' optimization problem. For an optimization problem to be convex under the above, we must also have that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3MqpEJ3jzQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lectures+on+Modern+Convex+Optimization:+Analysis,+Algorithms,&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=26c2T6G7HYrIswac0d2uDA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=convex%20programming&amp;f=false|title=Lectures on modern convex optimization: analysis, algorithms, and engineering applications|last1=Ben-Tal|first1=Aharon|last2=Nemirovskiĭ|first2=Arkadiĭ Semenovich|year=2001|pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convexity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; makes the powerful tools of [[convex analysis]] applicable. In &lt;!-- locally convex F- --&gt; finite-dimensional [[normed space]]s, the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] and the existence of [[subgradient]]s lead to a particularly satisfying theory of [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for optimality, a [[dual problem|duality theory]] generalizing that for [[linear programming]], and effective computational methods.

===Inequality-constrained optimization problems===
An optimization problem of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    &amp;\operatorname{minimize}&amp; &amp; f(\mathbf{x}) \\
    &amp;\operatorname{subject\ to}
    &amp; &amp;g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0, \quad i = 1,\dots,m
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

is convex if the functions &lt;math&gt;f, g_1 \ldots g_m : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are all convex functions.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd/Vandenberghe, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard form (inequality- and equality-constrained)===
''Standard form'' is the usual and perhaps most intuitive form of describing a convex minimization problem. It consists of the following three parts:
* A '''convex function''' &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to be minimized over the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
* '''Inequality constraints''' of the form &lt;math&gt;g_i(x) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the functions &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; are convex
* '''Equality constraints''' of the form &lt;math&gt;h_i(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where  the functions &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[affine transformation|affine]].  In practice, the terms "linear" and "affine" are often used interchangeably. Such constraints can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;h_i(x) = a_i^T x + b_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is a column-vector, (&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[Transpose]]), and &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; a real number.

A convex minimization problem in standard form is thus written as

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\underset{x}{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1,\dots,m \\
&amp;&amp;&amp;h_i(x) = 0, \quad i = 1, \dots,p.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that every equality constraint &lt;math&gt;h(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; can be equivalently replaced by a pair of inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;h(x)\leq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-h(x)\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, for theoretical purposes, equality constraints are redundant; however, it can be beneficial to treat them specially in practice.

Following from this fact, it is easy to understand why &lt;math&gt;h_i(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; has to be affine as opposed to merely being convex. If  &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is convex,  &lt;math&gt;h_i(x) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt; is convex, but  &lt;math&gt;-h_i(x) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt; is ''concave''. Therefore, the only way for  &lt;math&gt;h_i(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; to be convex is for  &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; to be affine.

==Theory==
The following statements are true about the convex minimization problem:
* if a [[local minimum]] exists, then it is a [[global minimum]].
* the set of all (global) minima is convex.
* for each ''strictly'' convex function, if the function has a minimum, then the minimum is unique.

These results are used by the theory of convex minimization along with geometric notions from [[functional analysis]] (in Hilbert spaces) such as the [[Hilbert projection theorem]], the [[separating hyperplane theorem]], and [[Farkas' lemma]].

==Examples==
The following problems are all convex minimization problems, or can be transformed into convex minimizations problems via a change of variables:

*[[Least squares]]
*[[Linear programming]]
* Convex [[quadratic programming|quadratic minimization]] with linear constraints
*[[Quadratically constrained quadratic programming|Quadratic minimization with convex quadratic constraints]]
*[[Conic optimization]]
*[[Geometric programming]]
*[[Second order cone programming]]
*[[Semidefinite programming]]
*[[Entropy maximization]] with appropriate constraints

==Lagrange multipliers==
Consider a convex minimization problem given in standard form by a cost function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;g_i(x)\leq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;. Then the domain &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X} = \left\{x\in X \vert g_1(x), \ldots, g_m(x)\leq 0\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian function for the problem is

:&lt;math&gt;L(x,\lambda_{0},\lambda_1, \ldots ,\lambda_{m})=\lambda_{0} f(x) + \lambda_{1} g_{1} (x)+\cdots + \lambda_{m} g_{m} (x).&lt;/math&gt;

For each point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there exist real numbers &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0},\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_{m},&lt;/math&gt; called [[Lagrange multipliers]], that satisfy these conditions simultaneously:

# &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; minimizes &lt;math&gt;L(y,\lambda_{0},\lambda_{1},\ldots ,\lambda_{m})&lt;/math&gt; over all &lt;math&gt;y \in X,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0},\lambda_{1},\ldots ,\lambda_{m} \geq 0,&lt;/math&gt; with at least one &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k} &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{1}g_{1}(x)=\cdots = \lambda_{m}g_{m}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (complementary slackness).

If there exists a "strictly feasible point", that is, a point &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;g_{1}(z), \ldots, g_{m}(z)&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt;

then the statement above can be strengthened to require that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, if some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfies (1)–(3) for [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0},\ldots,\lambda_{m} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{0}=1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is certain to minimize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Methods==
Convex minimization problems can be solved by the following contemporary methods:&lt;ref&gt;For methods for convex minimization, see the volumes by Hiriart-Urruty and Lemaréchal (bundle) and the textbooks by [[Andrzej Piotr Ruszczyński|Ruszczyński]], [[Dimitri Bertsekas|Bertsekas]], and 
Boyd and Vandenberghe (interior point).
&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Bundle methods" (Wolfe, Lemaréchal, Kiwiel), and
* [[Subgradient method#Subgradient-projection &amp; bundle methods|Subgradient projection]] methods (Polyak),
* [[Interior-point methods]] (Nemirovskii and Nesterov).
Other methods of interest:  
*[[Cutting-plane methods]]
*[[Ellipsoid method]]
*[[Subgradient method]]
*[[Drift plus penalty|Dual subgradients and the drift-plus-penalty method]]
Subgradient methods can be implemented simply and so are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Bertsekas&lt;/ref&gt;   Dual subgradient methods are subgradient methods applied to a [[Duality (optimization)|dual problem]].  The [[Drift plus penalty|drift-plus-penalty]] method is similar to the dual subgradient method, but takes a time average of the primal variables.

==Convex minimization with good complexity: Self-concordant barriers==
The efficiency of iterative methods is poor for the class of convex problems, because this class includes "bad guys" whose minimum cannot be approximated without a large number of function and subgradient evaluations;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemaréchal|1993|loc=Example XV.1.1.2, p. 277}} discuss a "bad guy" constructed by Arkadi Nemirovskii.&lt;/ref&gt;  thus, to have practically appealing efficiency results, it is necessary to make additional restrictions on the class of problems.  Two such classes are problems special [[barrier function]]s, first ''self-concordant'' barrier functions, according to the theory of Nesterov and Nemirovskii, and second ''self-regular'' barrier functions according to the theory of Terlaky and coauthors.

==Quasiconvex minimization==
Problems with convex level sets can be efficiently minimized, in theory.
[[Yurii Nesterov]] proved that quasi-convex minimization problems could be solved efficiently, and his results were extended by Kiwiel.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Analysis of algorithms|theory]], quasiconvex programming and convex programming problems can be solved in reasonable amount of time, where the number of iterations grows like a polynomial in the dimension of the problem (and in the reciprocal of the approximation error tolerated):&lt;p&gt;
{{Cite news|last=Kiwiel|first=Krzysztof C.|title=Convergence and efficiency of subgradient methods for quasiconvex minimization|journal=Mathematical Programming  (Series A)|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|issn=0025-5610|pages=1–25|volume=90|issue=1|doi=10.1007/PL00011414|year=2001|mr=1819784}} Kiwiel acknowledges that [[Yurii Nesterov]] first established that quasiconvex minimization problems can be solved efficiently.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such theoretically "efficient" methods use "divergent-series" [[gradient descent#Stepsize rules|stepsize rule]]s, which were first developed for classical [[subgradient method]]s. Classical subgradient methods using divergent-series rules are much slower than modern methods of convex minimization, such as subgradient projection methods, [[bundle method]]s of descent, and nonsmooth [[filter method]]s.

Solving even close-to-convex but non-convex problems can be computationally intractable. Minimizing a unimodal function is intractable, regardless of the smoothness of the function, according to results of Ivanov.&lt;ref&gt;Nemirovskii and Judin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convex maximization==
Conventionally, the definition of the convex optimization problem (we recall) requires that the objective function ''f'' to be ''minimized'' and the feasible set be convex. In the  special case of linear programming (LP), the objective function is both concave and convex, and so LP can also consider the problem of maximizing an objective function without confusion. However, for most convex minimization problems, the objective function is not concave, and therefore a problem and then such problems are formulated in the standard form of convex optimization problems, that is, minimizing the convex objective function.

For nonlinear convex minimization, the associated maximization problem obtained by substituting the [[supremum]] operator for the [[infimum]] operator  is not a problem of convex optimization, as conventionally defined. However, it is studied in the larger field of convex optimization as a problem of convex maximization.&lt;ref&gt;Convex maximization is mentioned in the subsection on convex optimization in this textbook:
[https://books.google.com/books?id=9sbsMkuFzhYC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=%22convex+maximization%22,+%22convex+minimization%22+OR+%22convex+optimization%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YswrT8-kGqfV4QTKs8CwDg&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22convex%20maximization%22%2C%20%22convex%20minimization%22%20OR%20%22convex%20optimization%22&amp;f=false  Ulrich Faigle, Walter Kern, and George Still. ''Algorithmic principles of mathematical programming''. Springer-Verlag. Texts in Mathematics. Chapter 10.2, Subsection "Convex optimization", pages 205-206.]
&lt;/ref&gt;

The convex maximization problem is especially important for studying the existence of maxima.  Consider the restriction of a convex function to a [[compact set|compact]] convex set: Then, on that set, the function attains its constrained ''maximum'' only on the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 32.1 in Rockafellar's ''Convex Analysis'' states this [[maximum principle]] for extended real-valued functions.&lt;/ref&gt; Such results, called "[[maximum principle]]s", are useful in the theory of [[harmonic functions]], [[potential theory]], and [[partial differential equation]]s.

The problem of minimizing a [[quadratic polynomial|quadratic]] [[multivariate polynomial]] on a [[cube]] is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahni, S.  "Computationally related problems," in SIAM Journal on Computing, 3, 262--279, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, in the [[quadratic programming|quadratic minimization]] problem, if the matrix has only one negative [[eigenvalue]], is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00120662 Quadratic programming with one negative eigenvalue is NP-hard], Panos M. Pardalos and Stephen A. Vavasis in ''Journal of Global Optimization'', Volume 1, Number 1, 1991, pg.15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions==
Advanced treatments consider convex functions that can attain positive infinity, also; the [[characteristic function (convex analysis)|indicator function]] of convex analysis is zero for every  &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; and positive infinity otherwise.

Extensions of convex functions include [[Biconvex optimization|biconvex]], [[pseudo-convex function|pseudo-convex]], and [[quasi-convex function]]s. Partial extensions of the theory of convex analysis and iterative methods for approximately solving non-convex minimization problems occur in the field of [[Convexity (mathematics)#Generalizations and extensions for convexity|generalized convexity]] ("abstract convex analysis").

A '''cortical modem''' is a type of brain machine interface that specifically inject images directly into the [[visual cortex]] by way of a [[direct neural interface]] (DNI) chip.  The true breakthrough goal lies in the information transfer speed.  Both computers and the human brain can transfer information at incredible speeds, and the real bottleneck in the field of brain-computer interaction is the lack of data transfer speeds between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/17/darpas_google_glass_will_plug_straight_into_your_brain DARPA's 'Cortical Modem' will plug straight into your BRAIN], The Register, 17 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203718-darpa-dreams-cortical-modems-and-neural-ramplants-for-restoring-active-memory DARPA dreams: cortical modems and neural RAMplants for restoring active memory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-01-19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptochromes''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κρυπτός χρώμα, "hidden colour") are a class of [[flavoproteins]] that are sensitive to [[Visible spectrum#Spectral colors|blue light]]. They are found in [[plants]] and [[animal]]s. Cryptochromes are involved in the [[circadian rhythm]]s of plants and animals, and possibly also in the [[magnetoception|sensing of magnetic fields]] in a number of species. The name ''cryptochrome'' was proposed as a ''[[portmanteau]]'' combining the cryptic nature of the photoreceptor, and the [[cryptogam]]ic organisms on which many blue-light studies were carried out.&lt;ref name="Gressel_1979"/&gt;

== Discovery ==

Although [[Charles Darwin]] first documented plant responses to blue light in the 1880s, it was not until the 1980s that research began to identify the pigment responsible.&lt;ref name="Darwin_1881"/&gt; In 1980, researchers discovered that the HY4 gene of the plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' was necessary for the plant's blue light sensitivity, and, when the gene was sequenced in 1993, it showed high sequence homology with [[photolyase]], a DNA repair protein activated by blue light.&lt;ref name=Ahmad_1993 /&gt; By 1995, it became clear that the products of the HY4 gene and its two human [[homology (biology)|homologs]] did not exhibit photolyase activity and were instead a new class of blue light photoreceptor hypothesized to be circadian [[photopigment]]s.&lt;ref name="Thompson_2004"/&gt; In 1996 and 1998, ''Cry'' homologs were identified in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[mouse|mice]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Todo_1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobayashi_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kobayashi K, Kanno S, Smit B, van der Horst GT, Takao M, Yasui A | title = Characterization of photolyase/blue-light receptor homologs in mouse and human cells | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 26 | issue = 22 | pages = 5086–92 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9801304 | pmc = 147960 | doi = 10.1093/nar/26.22.5086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary history and structure ==

Cryptochromes (CRY1, CRY2) are evolutionarily old and highly conserved proteins that belong to the flavoproteins superfamily that exists in all kingdoms of life.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; All members of this superfamily have the characteristics of an [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] [[DNA photolyase (protein domain)|photolyase homology]] (PHR) domain. The PHR domain can bind to the [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD) [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] and a light-harvesting [[chromophore]].&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; Cryptochromes are derived from and closely related to [[photolyase]]s, which are bacterial enzymes that are activated by light and involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. In eukaryotes, cryptochromes no longer retain this original enzymatic activity.&lt;ref name="Weber_2005"/&gt;
The structure of cryptochrome involves a fold very similar to that of photolyase, with a single molecule of FAD noncovalently bound to the protein.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt; These proteins have variable lengths and surfaces on the C-terminal end, due to the changes in genome and appearance that result from the lack of DNA repair enzymes. The [[Ramachandran plot]]&lt;ref name="urlwww.rcsb.org"/&gt; shows that the [[secondary structure]] of the CRY1 protein is primarily a right-handed [[alpha helix]] with little to no steric overlap.&lt;ref name="Lehninger_2005"/&gt;  The structure of CRY1 is almost entirely made up of alpha helices, with several loops and few [[beta sheets]]. The molecule is arranged as an orthogonal bundle.&lt;ref name="Brautigam_2004"/&gt;

== Function ==

=== Phototropism ===

In plants, cryptochromes mediate [[phototropism]], or directional growth toward a light source, in response to blue light. This response is now known to have its own set of photoreceptors, the [[phototropin]]s.

Unlike [[phytochrome]]s and phototropins, cryptochromes are not [[kinases]]. Their [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|flavin]] chromophore is reduced by light and transported into the [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it affects the [[turgor pressure]] and causes subsequent stem elongation. To be specific, ''Cry2'' is responsible for blue-light-mediated [[cotyledon]] and leaf expansion. ''Cry2'' overexpression in [[transgenic]] plants increases blue-light-stimulated cotyledon expansion, which results in many broad leaves and no flowers rather than a few primary leaves with a flower.&lt;ref name="Hsu_1996" /&gt; A double loss-of-function mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana Early Flowering 3 (elf3) and Cry2 genes delays flowering under continuous light and was shown to accelerate it during long and short days, which suggests that Arabidopsis CRY2 may play a role in accelerating flowering time during continuous light.&lt;ref name="Nefissi_2011" /&gt;

=== Photomorphogenesis ===

Cryptochromes receptors cause plants to respond to blue light via [[photomorphogenesis]]. Cryptochromes help control seed and seedling development, as well as the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage of development. In [[Arabidopsis]], it is shown that cryptochromes controls plant growth during sub-optimal blue-light conditions.&lt;ref name = "Pedmale_2016"/&gt;

=== Light capture ===

Despite much research on the topic, cryptochrome [[photoreception]] and [[phototransduction]] in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' is still poorly understood. Cryptochromes are known to possess two chromophores: [[pterin]] (in the form of [[5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid]] (MTHF)) and flavin (in the form of FAD).&lt;ref name="Song_2006"/&gt; Both may absorb a [[photon]], and in ''Arabidopsis'', pterin appears to absorb at a wavelength of 380&amp;nbsp;nm and flavin at 450&amp;nbsp;nm. Past studies have supported a model by which energy captured by pterin is transferred to flavin.&lt;ref name="Hoang_2008a"/&gt; Under this model of phototransduction, FAD would then be [[redox|reduced]] to FADH, which probably mediates the [[phosphorylation]] of a certain domain in cryptochrome. This could then trigger a [[signal transduction]] chain, possibly affecting [[gene regulation]] in the cell nucleus.

A new hypothesis&lt;ref name="Muller_2015a"/&gt; proposes that in plant cryptochromes, the transduction of the light signal into a chemical signal that might be sensed by partner molecules could be triggered by a photo-induced negative charge within the protein - on the FAD cofactor or on the neighbouring aspartic acid.&lt;ref name="Muller_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2014"/&gt; This negative charge would electrostatically repel the protein-bound [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule and thereby also the protein C-terminal domain, which covers the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] binding pocket prior to photon absorption. The resulting change in protein conformation could lead to phosphorylation of previously inaccessible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus and the given phosphorylated segment could then liberate the transcription factor HY5 by competing for the same binding site at the negative regulator of photomorphogenesis [[COP1]].

A different mechanism may function in ''Drosophila''. The true ground state of the flavin cofactor in ''Drosophila'' CRY is still debated, with some models indicating that the FAD is in an oxidized form,&lt;ref name = "Berndt_2007"/&gt; while others support a model in which the flavin cofactor exists in [[anion]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] form, {{chem|FAD|-}}•. Recently, researchers have observed that oxidized FAD is readily reduced to {{chem|FAD|-}}• by light. Furthermore, mutations that blocked photoreduction had no effect on light-induced degradation of CRY, while mutations that altered the stability of {{chem|FAD|-}}• destroyed CRY photoreceptor function.&lt;ref name="Song_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2008"/&gt; These observations provide support for a ground state of {{chem|FAD|-}}•. Researchers have also recently proposed a model in which {{chem|FAD|-}} is excited to its [[doublet state|doublet]] or quartet state by absorption of a photon, which then leads to a conformational change in the CRY protein.&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;

In [[sponge]] eyes, blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is also expressed. Most animal eyes utilize photo-sensitive [[opsin]] proteins expressed in neurons to communicate information of the light environment to the nervous system, whereas sponge larvae use pigment ring eyes to mediate phototactic swimming. However, despite possessing many other [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs), the fully sequenced genome of ''Amphimedon queenslandica'', a [[demosponge]] larva, apparently lacks a gene for a light-sensitive opsin pigment, suggesting that the sponge's unique eyes might have evolved a novel light-detection mechanism. Research using RNA probes indicated that one of the two cryptochromes, Aq-Cry2, was produced near the sponge's simple eye cells. Aq-Cry2 lacks photolyase activity and contains a flavin-based co-factor that is responsive to wavelengths of light that also mediate larval photic behavior. Defined as an opsin-clade GPCR, it possesses a conserved Shiff base lysine that is central to opsin function. Like other sponges, ''A. queenslandica'' lacks a nervous system. This indicates that opsin-less sponge eyes utilize cryptochrome, along with other proteins, to direct or act in eye-mediated phototactic behavior.&lt;ref name = "Rivera_2012"/&gt;

=== Circadian rhythm ===

Studies in animals and plants suggest that cryptochromes play a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms.&lt;ref name="Klarsfeld_2004"/&gt; Similarly, cryptochromes play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms in plants.&lt;ref name="Somers_1998"/&gt; In ''Drosophila'', cryptochrome (dCRY) acts as a blue-light photoreceptor that directly modulates light input into the circadian clock,&lt;ref name="Emery_2000"/&gt; while in mammals, cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) act as [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[repressor]]s within the circadian clockwork.&lt;ref name="Reppert_2002"/&gt; Some insects, including the [[monarch butterfly]], have both a mammal-like and a ''Drosophila''-like version of cryptochrome, providing evidence for an ancestral clock mechanism involving both light-sensing and transcriptional-repression roles for cryptochrome.&lt;ref name="Zhu_2008a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhu_2008b"/&gt;

''Cry'' [[mutant]]s have altered circadian rhythms, showing that ''Cry'' affects the circadian pacemaker. ''Drosophila'' with mutated ''Cry'' exhibit little to no mRNA cycling.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; A point mutation in ''cry&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;,'' which is required for flavin association in CRY protein, results in no PER or TIM protein cycling in either DD or LD.&lt;ref name="Stanewsky_1998"/&gt; In addition, mice lacking ''Cry1'' or ''Cry2'' genes exhibit differentially altered free running periods, but are still capable of [[photoentrainment]]. However, mice that lack both ''Cry1'' and ''Cry2'' are arrhythmic in both LD and DD and always have high [[PER1|Per1]] mRNA levels. These results suggest that cryptochromes play a photoreceptive role, as well as acting as negative regulators of Per gene expression in mice.&lt;ref name="Vitaterna_1999"/&gt;

==== In ''Drosophila'' ====

In ''Drosophila'', cryptochrome functions as a blue light photoreceptor. Exposure to blue light induces a conformation similar to that of the always-active CRY mutant with a C-terminal deletion (CRYΔ).&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt; The half-life of this conformation is 15 minutes in the dark and facilitates the binding of CRY to other clock gene products, PER and [[timeless (gene)|TIM]], in a light-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="Griffin_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Busza_2004"/&gt; Once bound by dCRY, dTIM is committed to degradation by the ubiquitin-[[proteasome]] system.&lt;ref name="Oztürk_2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Busza_2004"/&gt;

Although light pulses do not entrain, full photoperiod LD cycles can still drive cycling in the [[ventral]]-[[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] neurons in the ''Drosophila'' brain. These data along with other results suggest that CRY is the cell-autonomous photoreceptor for body clocks in ''Drosophila'' and may play a role in nonparametric entrainment (entrainment by short discrete light pulses). However, the lateral neurons receive light information through both the blue light CRY pathway and the [[rhodopsin]] pathway. Therefore, CRY is involved in light perception and is an input to the circadian clock, however it is not the only input for light information, as a sustained rhythm has been shown in the absence of the CRY pathway, in which it is believed that the rhodopsin pathway is providing some light input.&lt;ref name="Dunlap_1999"/&gt; Recently, it has also been shown that there is a CRY-mediated light response that is independent of the classical circadian CRY-TIM interaction. This mechanism is believed to require a flavin [[redox]]-based mechanism that is dependent on potassium channel conductance. This CRY-mediated light response has been shown to increase [[action potential]] firing within seconds of a light response in [[opsin]]-knockout ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref name="Fogle_2011"/&gt;

Cryptochrome, like many genes involved in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in [[mRNA]] and protein levels. In ''Drosophila'', ''Cry'' mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high levels in light and low levels in the dark.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; The transcription of the ''Cry'' gene also cycles with a similar trend.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; CRY protein levels, however, cycle in a different manner than ''Cry'' transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, CRY protein has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock at the transcriptional level and by light at the [[Translation (biology)|translational]] and posttranslational level.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt;

Overexpression of ''Cry'' also affects circadian light responses. In ''Drosophila'', ''Cry'' overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt; This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.&lt;ref name="Emery_1998"/&gt;

==== In mammals ====

Cryptochrome is one of the four groups of mammalian clock genes/proteins that generate a transcription-translation negative-feedback loop (TTFL), along with [[Period (gene)|Period (PER)]], CLOCK, and BMAL1.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt; In this loop, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins are [[transcriptional activators]], which together bind to the [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] of the ''Cry'' and ''Per'' genes and activate their transcription.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt; The CRY and PER proteins then bind to each other, enter the nucleus, and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-activated transcription.&lt;ref name="Sancar_2010"/&gt;

In mice, ''Cry1'' expression displays circadian rhythms in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]], a brain region involved in the generation of circadian rhythms, with mRNA levels peaking during the light phase and reaching a minimum in the dark.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto_1998"/&gt; These daily oscillations in expression are maintained in constant darkness.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto_1998"/&gt;

While CRY has been well established as a TIM homolog in mammals, the role of CRY as a photoreceptor in mammals has been controversial. Early papers indicated that CRY has both light-independent and -dependent functions. A study in 2000 indicated that mice without rhodopsin but with cryptochrome still respond to light; however, in mice without either rhodopsin or cryptochrome, ''[[c-Fos]]'' transcription, a mediator of light sensitivity, significantly drops.&lt;ref name="Selby_2000"/&gt; In recent years, data have supported [[melanopsin]] as the main circadian photoreceptor, in particular melanopsin cells that mediate entrainment and communication between the [[eye]] and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).&lt;ref name="Hattar_2002"/&gt; One of the main difficulties in confirming or denying CRY as a mammalian photoreceptor is that when the gene is knocked out the animal goes arrhythmic, so it is hard to measure its capacity as purely a photoreceptor. However, some recent studies indicate that human CRY may mediate light response in peripheral tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoang_2008b"/&gt;

Normal mammalian circadian rhythm relies critically on delayed expression of ''Cry1'' following activation of the ''Cry1'' promoter. Whereas rhythms in ''Per2'' promoter activation and ''Per2'' mRNA levels have almost the same phase, ''Cry1'' mRNA production is delayed by approximately four hours relative to ''Cry1'' promoter activation.&lt;ref name="Sato_2006" /&gt; This delay is independent of CRY1 or CRY2 levels and is mediated by a combination of [[E-box|E/E'-box]] and D-box elements in the promoter and [[Rev-ErbA|RevErbA]]/[[RAR-related orphan receptor|ROR]] binding elements (RREs) in the gene's first intron.&lt;ref name="Ukai-Tadenuma_2011" /&gt; [[Transfection]] of arrhythmic ''Cry1''&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; ''Cry2''&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; double-knockout cells with only the ''Cry1'' promoter (causing constitutive ''Cry1'' expression) is not sufficient to rescue rhythmicity. Transfection of these cells with both the promoter and the first intron is required for restoration of circadian rhythms in these cells.&lt;ref name="Ukai-Tadenuma_2011" /&gt;

=== Magnetoreception ===

{{Main|Magnetoreception}}

Experimental data suggests that cryptochromes in the [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor neurons]] of birds' eyes are involved in magnetic orientation during [[bird migration|migration]].&lt;ref name="Heyers_2007"/&gt; Cryptochromes are also thought to be essential for the light-dependent ability of ''[[Drosophila]]'' to sense [[magnetic fields]].&lt;ref name="Gegear_2008"/&gt; Magnetic fields were once reported to affect cryptochromes also in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' plants: growth behavior seemed to be affected by magnetic fields in the presence of blue (but not red) light.&lt;ref name="Ahmad_2007"/&gt; Nevertheless, these results have later turned out to be irreproducible under strictly controlled conditions in another laboratory,&lt;ref name="Harris_2009"/&gt; suggesting that plant cryptochromes do not respond to magnetic fields.

Cryptochrome forms a pair of [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s with correlated [[spin (physics)|spin]]s when exposed to blue light.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskup_2009"/&gt; Radical pairs can also be generated by the light-independent dark reoxidation of the flavin cofactor by molecular oxygen through the formation of a spin-correlated FADH-superoxide radical pairs.&lt;ref name="Muller_2011"/&gt; Magnetoreception is hypothesized to function through the surrounding magnetic field's effect on the correlation (parallel or anti-parallel) of these radicals, which affects the lifetime of the activated form of cryptochrome. Activation of cryptochrome may affect the light-sensitivity of [[retina]]l neurons, with the overall result that the animal can "see" the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Chandler_2011"/&gt; Animal cryptochromes and closely related animal (6-4) photolyases contain a longer chain of electron-transferring tryptophans than other proteins of the cryptochrome-photolyase superfamily (a tryptophan tetrad instead of a triad).&lt;ref name="Muller_2015b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2016"/&gt; The longer chain leads to a better separation and over 1000× longer lifetimes of the photoinduced flavin-tryptophan radical pairs than in proteins with a mere triad of tryptophans.&lt;ref name="Muller_2015b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cailliez_2016"/&gt; The absence of spin-selective recombination of these radical pairs on the nanosecond to microsecond timescales seems to be incompatible with the suggestion that magnetoreception by cryptochromes is based on the forward light reaction.

'''Delimiterless input''' is a special feature of some [[minicomputer]]s and all [[microcomputer]]s in which the computer can recognize and act upon a single character or keypress without requiring use of a "transmit" or "send" key.  Older mini and [[mainframe computer]]s generally operated on a line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time basis.  The line was sent to the computer by pressing the return, enter, send or transmit key, depending on what the key was called.

==Line-at-a-time==
Editing of the typed-in line was done on the screen via the delete or backspace key, and the entire line was transmitted to the computer when the send key was pressed.

==Screen-at-a-time==
Mainframe computers such as IBM's [[System/370|370]] and the [[System 38]] used terminals such as the [[IBM 3270]] which transmitted an entire screen of information all at once as opposed to a line at a time.

==Efficiency gain==
Mini and mainframe computers tended to serve many users at one time, and using line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time input is more efficient for the computer.  Most of the activity of a user of one of these machines is either reading output sent to them or waiting for input to be sent back to the running program, and thus other users could be served while the specific user was composing input.  Terminals connected to these machines had limited editing capability, and thus were sometimes referred to as [[dumb terminal]]s.

==Delimiterless input==
Minicomputers such as the [[PDP-11]], and microcomputers ("personal computers") such as the [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]] and [[IBM-PC]] were able to implement delimiterless input as part of their design specification.  Microcomputers, generally having only one user connected to them, could afford to support the less efficient delimiterless input capability as keyboard input could be handled by less expensive circuitry than that used on more expensive machines.  This would then lead to the development of much more powerful [[computer game|games]] for personal computers.  While games existed even on some of the largest computers, most of them were written, same as any other program, to either operate on line-at-a-time or screen-at-a-time input.

'''Documenting Hate''' is a project of [[ProPublica]], in collaboration with a number of journalistic, academic, and computing organizations, for systematic tracking of [[hate crime]]s and [[bias incident]]s. It uses an online form to facilitate reporting of incidents by the general public.{{r|Wang-2017-01-23}} Since August 2017, it has also used [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]] techniques to monitor and collect news stories about hate crimes and bias incidents.{{r|Glickhouse-2017-08-18}}{{r|Rogers-2017-08-18}}{{r|Wang-2017-08-18}}{{r|Hatmaker-2017-08-18}}{{r|Morris-2017-08-19}} {{asof|2017|10}}, over 100 news organizations had joined the project.{{r|Gockowski-2017-10-10}}

== History ==

=== Origin ===

Documenting Hate was created in response to ProPublica's dissatisfaction with the quality of reporting and tracking of evidence of hate crimes and bias incidents after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]]. The project was launched on 17 January 2017,{{r|New-2017-02-17}}{{r|Ciobanu-2017-01-20}}{{r|Anzilotti-2017-02-03}}{{r|ProPublica-2017-01-17}} after the publication on 15 November 2016 of a ProPublica news story about the difficulty of obtaining hard data on hate crimes.{{r|Thompson-and-Schwenke-2016-11-15}}

=== Introduction of the Documenting Hate News Index ===

On 18 August 2017, ProPublica and [[Google]] announced the creation of the Documenting Hate News Index, which uses the Google Cloud Natural Language API for automated monitoring and collection of news stories about hate crimes and bias incidents. The API uses [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]] techniques. The findings of the Index are integrated with reports from members of the public. The Index is a joint project of ProPublica, Google News Lab, and the [[data visualization]] studio Pitch Interactive.{{r|Glickhouse-2017-08-18}}{{r|Rogers-2017-08-18}}{{r|Wang-2017-08-18}}{{r|Hatmaker-2017-08-18}}{{r|Morris-2017-08-19}}

== Response ==

=== Participation ===

{{asof|2017|05}}, thousands of incidents had been reported via Documenting Hate.{{r|Latino-USA-2017-05-10}} {{asof|2017|10}}, over 100 news organizations had joined the project, including the [[The Boston Globe|''Boston Globe'']], the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']], [[Vox (website)|''Vox'']], and the [[Georgetown University]] [[The Hoya|''Hoya'']].{{r|Gockowski-2017-10-10}}

=== Conservative response ===

An education reporter for the conservative ''[[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]]'' has criticized the project for ambiguity in the terms it uses to describe hate crimes, and for neglect of hate-crime hoaxes.{{r|Shimshock-2017-03-23}} Another ''[[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]]'' journalist has likewise criticized the Documenting Hate News Index for underrepresentation of conservative outlets among the news sources it monitors.{{r|Cheong-2017-08-20}} 

=== Relationship to government statistical monitoring ===

A policy analyst for the Center for Data Innovation (an affiliate of the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]]), while supporting ProPublica's critique of the present state of hate-crime statistics, and praising ProPublica for drawing attention to the problem, has argued that a nongovernmental project like Documenting Hate cannot solve it unaided; instead, intervention at the federal level is needed.{{r|New-2017-02-17}}

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance.

The '''European Pulsar Timing Array''' ('''EPTA''') is a European collaboration to combine five 100-m class radio-telescopes to observe an array of [[pulsars]] with the specific goal of detecting [[gravitational waves]]. It is one of three pulsar timing array projects in operation, the others being the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] and the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]].

==Pulsars and high-precision timing==
[[Pulsars]] are rapidly rotating, highly magnetised [[neutron stars]] that emit radio waves from their magnetic poles that are, due to the star's rotation, observed on Earth as a string of pulses. Due to the extremely high density of neutron stars, their rotation periods are very stable, hence the observed arrival time of the pulses are highly regular. These arrival times are called TOAs (time of arrival) and can be used to perform high-precision timing experiments.

The stability of the TOAs from most pulsars is limited due to the presence of [[red noise]], also called "timing noise".&lt;ref&gt;Z. Arzoumanian, D.J. Nice, J.H. Taylor, and S.E. Thorsett. "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1994ApJ...422..671A&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= Timing behavior of 96 radio pulsars]." ''The Astrophysical Journal,'' volume 422, February 1994 (pages 671-680).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a special class of pulsars, called millisecond pulsars (MSP), that are shown to suffer from little or no timing noise.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Keeping track of the TOAs of different MSPs over the sky allows for a high-precision timing experiment to detect [[gravitational waves]].

==Detection of gravitational waves==
[[Gravitational waves]] (GW) are small disturbances in space-time, caused by the motion of masses, if the third time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment is non-zero. These waves are very weak, such that only the strongest waves, caused by the rapid motion of dense stars or black-holes, have a chance of being detected. A pulsar timing array (PTA) uses an array of MSPs as the endpoints of a Galaxy-scale [[Gravitational wave detector|GW detector]]. It is sensitive to GWs with a frequency in the nanohertz regime, which corresponds to the regime where the stochastic GW background, caused by the coalescence of super-massive black holes in the early Universe, is predicted to exist.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}} This makes PTAs complementary to other GW detectors such as [[LIGO]], [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]] and [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]].

==Telescopes==
The EPTA uses five European telescopes. These are the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]], the [[Effelsberg Radio Telescope]], the [[Lovell Telescope]], the [[Nançay Radio Telescope]] and the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]].

==LEAP==
[[Image:European Pulsar Timing Array (logo).jpg|thumb|right|The LEAP logo.]]

Since 2009, the EPTA has made some progress thanks to a project [[European Research Council]] funded project known as the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP). The aim of this project is to coherently combine the five EPTA telescopes to synthesise the equivalent of a fully steerable 194-m dish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leap.eu.org/ The Large European Array for Pulsars]&lt;/ref&gt; This will improve the accuracy with which the pulsar TOAs can be measured by an order of magnitude, essential for the first detection of [[gravitational waves]] within the next decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Guerrilla (Spanish for "little war"), as applied to theatrical events, describes the act of spontaneous, surprise performances in unlikely public spaces to an unsuspecting audience. Typically these performances intend to draw attention to a political/social issue through [[satire]], [[protest]], and carnivalesque techniques. Many of these performances were a direct result of the radical [[social movement]]s of the late 1960s through mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster’s College Dictionary. New York: Random House, 1992, pp.593&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla Theater, also referred to as guerrilla performance, has been sometimes related to the [[agitprop theater]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Filewod03"&gt;Filewod, Alan (2003) ''Modernism and Genocide'', in Richard Paul Knowles, William B.

Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;575{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is differentiated from agitprop by the inclusion of [[Dada]] performance tactics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Origins==
The term ''Guerrilla Theater'' was coined by Peter Berg, who in 1965 suggested it to [[R.G. Davis]] as the title of his essay on the actions of the  [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], an essay that was first published in 1966.&lt;ref name="BraunsteinDoyle02"&gt;Peter Braunstein, Michael William Doyle (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=R178zShWUtIC ''Imagine nation: the American counterculture of the 1960s and '70s''], p.93 note #9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1966) ''Guerrilla theater'' in ''[[Tulane Drama Review]]'', summer 1966. Republished in ''[[The SFMT]]'', 149-53. p.70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DavisRethinking"&gt;Davis (1971) ''Rethinking guerrilla theater, 1971, 1985'' in Donald Lazere [https://books.google.com/books?id=pT8X-YnxOHwC ''American media and mass culture: left perspectives'']  p.599&lt;/ref&gt; The term "guerrilla" was inspired by a passage in a 1961 [[Che Guevara]] essay, which read:&lt;ref name="Gordon07"&gt;Gordon, Kelly Carolyn (2007) ''Guerrilla theater'', in Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC ''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama, Volume 1''], pp.568-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle02Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernesto Guevara]] ''Guerrilla Warfare'', Thomas M. Davies, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8420-2678-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The guerrilla fighter needs full help from the people.... From the very beginning he has the intention of destroying an unjust order and therefore an intention... to replace the old with something new.}}

Davis had studied [[Mime artist|mime]] and modern dance in the 1950s and had discovered [[commedia dell'arte]]. In autumn 1966 around 20 members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe broke off and started their own collective called [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]], who took their name from [[Diggers|a group of 17th century radicals in England]].

== Guerrilla theater in practice ==

Guerrilla theater shares its origins with many forms of political protest and street theatre including [[agitprop]] (agitation-propaganda), [[carnival]], [[parades]], [[Procession|pageants]], [[political protest]], [[performance art]], [[happening]]s, and, most notably, the Dada movement and [[street art|guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;Random House ''Webster's College Dictionary''.  New York: Random House, 1992, pp.&amp;nbsp;27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this movement is widely studied in Theater History classrooms, the amount of research and documentation of guerrilla theater is surprisingly lacking.  The term, "Guerrilla Theater" seems to have emerged during the mid-1960s primarily as an upshot of activist [[Radical Theater]] groups such as [[The Living Theatre]], [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], El [[Teatro Campesino]], and the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Cruz, Jan, ed.  ''Radical Street Performance''.  New York: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has important roots in [[Allan Kaprow]]'s "happenings".

The first widely documented guerrilla performances were carried out under the leadership of [[Abbie Hoffman]] and the [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies).  One of their most publicized events occurred on August 24, 1967, at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] where Hoffman and other Yippies threw dollar bills onto the trading floor below.  Creating a media frenzy, the event was publicized internationally.  In his later publication, ''Soon to be a Major Motion Picture'' (1980), Hoffman refers to his television appearances with specially planned subversive tactics as "guerrilla theater."&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Oscar.  ''History of the Theatre''.  7th ed.  Needham Heights, Massachusetts: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995, pg. 575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla theater was used as a protest demonstration by the anti-war organization [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]. An article from the summer of 1971 published in the glossy magazine ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' detailed one such performance in [[Washington, D.C.]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A squad of soldiers moved through the part adjoining the U.S. Capitol. They were grubby looking troopers, clad in jungle fatigues and "boonie hats" with wide brims turned up. Jumping a low fence, they began shouting at a group of tourists. 'All right. Hold it. Hold it. Nobody move. Nobody move.' Their voices were full of tension and anger. A man broke out of the crowd and started running. Several soldiers fired at once, and the man fell, clutching his stomach. Blood could be seen on the clean sidewalk. The tourists turned away in horror. 'Get a body count,' a soldier yelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Another squad of soldiers emerged from under the Capitol steps. 'All right. ID. ID,' they screeched. 'You got no ID and you [[Viet Cong|VC]].' They quickly grabbed a young woman and led her away, binding her wrists behind her back and prodding her with their rifles.... They grabbed [a] young man and threw him on the ground, tying his hands behind his back. Several of the soldiers kicked him, seeming to aim for his groin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"Then someone took out a long, thick hunting knife and lifted up the man's shirt, holding the knife to his bare stomach, and pushed against it slightly. 'You VC? You VC?' The man said nothing. He was pushed to his feet and shoved down again. Then he was told to get up. This time the knife was pushed to the side of his neck, and the same question was repeated. Still no answer. The man was dragged away.... Then the soldiers left, and a smaller, less angry group of men dressed in khaki fatigues passed out leaflets to the astonished tourists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

"''"A US Infantry platoon just passed through here!"'' the pink colored piece of paper read in big bold letters. ''"If you had been Vietnamese... We might have burned your house. We might have shot your dog. We might have shot you... HELP US END THE WAR BEFORE THEY TURN YOUR SON INTO A BUTCHER OR A CORPSE."''&lt;ref&gt;Art Goldberg, "Vietnam Vets: The Anti-War Army," ''Ramparts,'' vol. 10, no. 1 (July 1971), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Post-1970s performance theater==

Another guerrilla performance group that continued the use of the term was the [[Guerrilla Girls]].  This group of feminist artist-activists was established in New York City in 1985 with the purpose of bringing attention to the lack of female artists in major [[art galleries]] and [[museum]]s.  The Guerrilla Girls began their work through guerrilla art tactics which broadened to include guerrilla theater.  Some common practices in their guerrilla theater techniques that have been replicated by other groups include appearing in costume, using assumed names, and disguising their identity.

==Guerrilla theater groups==

The origins and legacy of guerrilla theater can be seen in the work of these political/performance groups:

* [[ACT UP]]
* [[Billionaires for Bush]]
* [[Billionaires for Wealthcare]]
* [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]
* [[The Church of Euthanasia]]
* [[Circus Amok]]
* [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]]
* [[El Teatro Campesino]]
* [[Free Southern Theater]]
* [[Reclaim the Streets]]
* [[Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping]]
* [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]
* [[Situationism]]
* [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]]
* [[Youth International Party]] (Yippies)
* [[FEMEN]]

[[File:Venus de Milo Louvre Ma399 n4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Venus de Milo]] on display at the [[Louvre]].]]

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

This article outlines the '''history of [[media studies]]'''.

==Chicago School==
Though not yet named as such, media studies' roots are in the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] and thinkers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Cooley]] and [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]]. These authors saw American society on the cusp of positive social change toward pure democracy. Mead argued that for an ideal society to exist, a form of communication must be developed to allow the unique individual to appreciate the attitudes, viewpoints and positions of others unlike himself, and allow him to be understood by others as well. Mead believed that this "new media" would allow humans to empathize with others, and therefore moves toward an "ideal of human society."&lt;ref&gt;Mead, George Herbert. "Obstacles and Promises in the Development of an Ideal Society." ''Mind, Self &amp; Society'', pp. 317–28. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Mead sees an ideal society, Dewey names it the "Great Community," and further asserts the assumption that humans are intelligent enough for self-government, and that that knowledge is "a function of association and communication."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John. "Search for the Great Community." The Public and Its Problems, pp. 143–84. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1927. "Nature, Communication, and Meaning." Experience and Nature, pp. 138–70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Cooley asserts that political communication makes public opinion possible, which in turn promotes democracy. Each of these authors represent the Chicago School’s attention to [[electronic communication]] as a facilitator of democracy, its faith in the informed electorate, and its focus on the individual as opposed to the mass.

==First M.A. Media Studies program in the U.S.==
The social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-about/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, among other programs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-degrees-and-programs/&lt;/ref&gt; MA in Media Studies is still being offered by [http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies/ School of Media Studies, The New School], which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016&lt;ref&gt;http://smscommons.newschool.edu/news/2015/09/14/media-studies-40th-anniversary-celebration-fall-2015-spring-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda studies==
Between the First and Second World Wars, the [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]] briefly rose to importance. Their definition of propaganda was &lt;blockquote&gt;"expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinion or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Alfred M. (With Elizabeth Briant Lee)|year= 1937|title=The Fine Art of Propaganda: A Study of Father Coughlin’s Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Harold Lasswell]], who worked in the paradigm of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of sociology wrote [[Propaganda Technique in the World War]], which included this definition of propaganda:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold.|year= 1937|title= Propaganda Technique in the World War|pages= 214–22.|isbn=0-8240-0458-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These definitions of [[propaganda]] clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on [[media influence|media effects]], as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell]]|first= Harold|year= 1937|title= [[Propaganda]]|encyclopedia =  Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|pages= 521–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime [[propaganda]] films on soldiers were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= [[Carl Hovland|Hovland]]|first= Carl I.|author2=Arthur A. Lumsdaine |author3=Fred D. Shefield  |year= 1949|title= Experiments in Mass Communication|journal=  Studies in the Social Psychology in World War II, American Soldier Series|volume= 3|pages=3–16, 247–79.|publisher= Macmillan|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics. Herman described a propaganda model as "a model of media behavior and performance, not of media effects." (Herman, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;63)  He argued: "They are profit-seeking business, owned by very wealthy people (or other companies); and they are funded largely by advertisers who are also profit-seeking entities, and who want their advertisements to appear in a [[supportive selling environment]]."&lt;ref name="herman62"&gt;(Herman, 2000, p. 62)&lt;/ref&gt; He also presented "five factors: owner ship, advertising, sourcing, flak and anti-communist ideology-work as filters through which information must pass, and that individually and often in cumulative fashion they greatly influence media choices."&lt;ref name="herman62"/&gt; Until now, there is no conclusion of propaganda, debate still continues.

==Frankfurt School Critical Theory==
Typified by the philosophical and theoretical orientations of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt school contributed greatly to the development and application of critical theory in media studies.  Their Marxist critique of market-driven media was critical of its atomizing and leveling effects.

The Frankfurt school also lamented the effects of the "culture industry" on the production and appreciation of art.  For example, in ''A Social Critique of Radio Music'', Adorno asserts: &lt;blockquote&gt;"…music has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumers’ goods.  This produces ‘commodity listening’…The listener suspends all intellectual activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adorno |first=Theodor W. |year= 1945|title= A Social Critique of Radio Music|journal= Kenyon Review |volume= 7|pages=208–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Frankfurt school lamented on the effects of the "culture industry" they also began to identify [[mass culture]] and [[high culture]] as two distinct entities.  Scholars like Benjamin (1936) and Adorno (1945) can be credited with what would eventually become known as popular culture and high culture.  Their finite distinction of equating original production with ritualistic behavior as compared with mass culture that finds its identifying symbols in reproductions.  These reproductions are souless and lacking in definition and originality.

==Media effects==
{{main|Media effects}}
The less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Paul F. Lazarsfeld]] and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral ‘effects’ of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The "Limited-Effects" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has "limited-effects" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the ‘two-step flow’ model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with ‘opinion leaders’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitlinn |first=Todd |year=1974 |title=Media Sociology: the Dominant Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of limited- effects was so influential that the question of media "effects" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffee, Steven H., &amp; Hockheimer, J.. "The Beginnings of Political Communication Research in the United States: Origins of the ‘Limited Effects’ Model." The Media Revolution in America &amp; Western Europe, pp. 267–96. Ed. Ev Rogers &amp; F. Balle. Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratification model==

As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutchby|first=Ian |year= 2006|title=Media Talk: Conversation Analysis and the Study of Broadcasting |location=Berkshire |publisher=Open University Press|isbn= 0-335-20995-5|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[uses and gratifications]]" model, associated with [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Elihu Katz]], reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of  research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodge, R.|author2=Tripp, D.|year=1986|title=Children and Television|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press |isbn=0-8047-1352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and separately Palmer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=P |year=1986 |title=The Lively Audience: A Study of Children around the TV set|location=Sydney|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=0-86861-970-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about how school-children make sense of the Australian [[soap opera]] ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]''. They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were "shut in", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: "the hard-bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of..."&lt;ref name="fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John |year= 1987 |title=Television Culture|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 0-415-03934-7|pages=68–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] summarises:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The children inserted meanings of the program into their social experience of school in a way that informed both -- the meanings of school and the meanings of ''Prisoner'' were each influenced by the other, and the fit between them validated the other.&lt;ref name="fiske"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''International Winter University (IWU) Kassel''' is a short-term program that is held during the winter season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. The IWU inspired from the international short-term programs held in Germany, then [[International Summer University (ISU) Kassel]] began the establishment of IWU in response to growing interest of international students to study in Germany. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Uni Kassel organizes both of ISU and IWU as one of its internationalization strategies. The program of IWU Kassel is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971.

The uniqueness of IWU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and cultural heritage. While IWU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program has been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, IWU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and Development of the Programme==
Following the success of ISU, the International Winter University (IWU) was established in 2005/06 to offer international students an alternative time frame to experience [[education in Germany]]. It is a pioneer of short-term winter programs in Germany and is one of the short-term programs bearing the DAAD&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.germany.daad.org/ DAAD] page.&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Seal.

Besides, IWU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of Uni Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, IWU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to IWU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, IWU has received on average some 50 international students each year. The number of students is on the rise with its growing popularity among partnering universities. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries. 

==Program of Study==
The study program of IWU Kassel includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in '''teaching German as a foreign language'''. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for engineering module usually cover the following topics: an introduction to international climate policy, renewable energy and energy systems from a German and European perspective, environment protection measures, solar-thermal technologies and systems, [[photovoltaic]], the history and future of wind energy, [[wind farm management]], [[biomass]], [[natural gas storage]], and rational and efficient energy usage: low energy housing and sustainable building. Seminar for German culture module usually covers topics such as German history, literature, and art of the 19th and 20th centuries, which all activities will explore how contemporary German culture has been shaped by historical developments in the past 200 years, the "Age of Goethe" (Goethe-Zeit), the end of the 19th century ([[nietzsche]]), and the [[revolutionary]] [[art movement]] ([[bauhaus]] and [[expressionism]]).

Students will be awarded 6 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [https://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


Kassel is a mid-sized city located in northern Hesse in the centre of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000 which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judaism''' has teachings and guidance for its adherents through the [[Hebrew Bible]] and [[rabbinic literature]] relating to the notion and concept of [[peace]].

==Shalom==
{{Main|Shalom|S-L-M}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for peace is [[shalom]] which is derived from one of the names of God. Hebrew root word for "complete" or "whole" implying that according to Judaism and the teachings of the Torah, only when there is a true state of "wholeness" meaning that everything is "complete" does true "peace" reign. This the same for the directly related Arabic word [[S-L-M|Salaam]].

[[Shin (letter)|Shin]]-[[Lamedh]]-[[Mem]] ({{lang-ar|[[Wiktionary:س ل م|س ل م]]}} ''S-L-M''; {{lang-arc|[[Wiktionary:ܫܠܡܐ|ܫܠܡܐ]]}}; {{lang-he|[[Wiktionary:שלם|שלם]]}} ''Š-L-M''; {{lang-mt|S-L-M}}) is the [[Semitic root|triconsonantal]] root of many [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words, and many of those words are used as names. The root itself translates as "whole, safe, intact".

==Hebrew Bible==
The [[Torah]], [[Tanakh]] and its related literature write extensively concerning peace, as well as its opposite states. The word "shalom" meaning "peace" has been absorbed into the usage of the language from its Biblical roots and from there to many of the world's languages, religions and cultures as prized idioms and well-worn expressions. ''A New [[Concordance (publishing)|Concordance]] of the Bible: [[Thesaurus]] of the Language of the Bible'' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Even-Shoshan, ''A New Concordance of the Bible: Thesaurus of the Language of the Bible: Hebrew and Aramaic Roots, Words, Proper Names Phrases and Synonyms'' (Kiryat Sepher Publishing House, Jerusalem. 1986 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; lists over almost 300 words connected with the root "SH-L-M" for "peace" and the same for "Solomon"

Notable examples: 
*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''" – יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ, וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָלוֹם
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land" וְנָתַתִּי שָלוֹם בָּאָרֶץ
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''" - הִנְנִי נֹתֵן לוֹ אֶת-בְּרִיתִי, שָלוֹם
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: "'''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close" - שָלוֹם שָלוֹם לָרָחוֹק וְלַקָּרוֹב
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Seek '''peace''' and pursue it" - בַּקֵּשׁ שָלוֹם וְרָדְפֵהוּ
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|119:165|HE}}: "Great '''peace''' to those who love Your Torah" -  שָלוֹם רָב, לְאֹהֲבֵי תוֹרָתֶךָ
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|125:5|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Psalms|128:6|HE}}: "'''Peace''' upon Israel" - שָׁלוֹם, עַל-יִשְׂרָאֵל

==Jerusalem==
{{Main|Jerusalem}}
The name of the city of [[Jerusalem]], ''Yerushalayim'' in Hebrew is made up of two words with "''-shalayim''" i.e. "-salem" denoting the concept of "peace", with "''Yeru-''" i.e. "Jeru-" denoting "fear [of God]" as a combined word. This [[Midrash]]ic explanation of the name relates it to the ''yir'eh'' from the name '''Adonai-yir'eh''' ("The Lord sees", [[Vulgate]] Latin ''Dominus videt'') given to Moriah by Abraham and the name '''Salem'''. Other midrashim say that Jerusalem means "City of Peace",'''[[Shalom]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/bechuko/klein.htm |title=Bar-Ilan University Parshat Hashavua Page |publisher=Biu.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solomon==
{{Main|Solomon}}
The name of the famous Biblical king [[Solomon]] (''Shlomo'' in Hebrew) means " 'peaceful' or 'complete' or 'whole' [one]."

==Jewish prayers==
{{Main|List of Jewish prayers and blessings}}
[[List of Jewish prayers and blessings]] are replete with constant references for a longing for peace on Earth and its attendant blessings.

==Modern Israel and peace==
{{Main|Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
The modern [[Judaism|Jewish]] state of Israel with its majority of [[Jews|Jewish]] citizens, since its inception and has been involved in a peace process with its Arab neighbors, such as:
*The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]]
*The [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]]
*The [[Peace process in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]

==Messianic Age==
{{Main|Messianic Age|Jewish Messianism}}
Judaism is the source-religion for the notion of a [[Messianic Age]], a [[theological]] term referring to a future time of universal peace and brotherhood on the earth, without [[crime]], [[war]] and [[poverty]]. Many [[religion]]s have come to believe and await such an age; some refer to it as the "[[Kingdom of God]]".

According to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Era will be one of global peace and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the furtherance of the knowledge of the Creator. The theme of the [[Jewish Messiah]] ushering in an era of global peace is encapsulated in two of the most famous scriptural passages from the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the verses: {{bibleverse||Isaiah|2:4|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:

{{quote|They shall beat their [[swords to plowshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation and they will no longer study warfare. (Isaiah 2:4)}}

{{quote|The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. (Isaiah 11:6-9)}}

==Rejection of violence==
{{rquote|right|The Jews are the mildest of men, passionately hostile to violence. That obstinate sweetness which they conserve in the midst of the most atrocious persecution, that sense of justice and of reason which they put up as their sole defense against a hostile, brutal, and unjust society, is perhaps the best part of the message they bring to us and the true mark of their greatness.|[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, 1946, Reflexions sur la question juive&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Judaism's religious texts overwhelmingly endorse compassion and peace, and the Hebrew Bible contains the well-known commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself".&lt;ref name="Goldsmith Ed. 1991 181"&gt;*Reuven Firestone (2004), "Judaism on Violence and Reconciliation:  An examination of key sources" in ''Beyond violence: religious sources of social transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam'', Fordham Univ Press, 2004, pp 77, 81.

In fact, the love of peace and the pursuit of peace is one of the key principles in [[Jewish law]]. While Jewish tradition permits waging war and killing in certain cases, however, the requirement is that one always seek a just peace before waging war.&lt;ref name="Broyde"&gt;Fighting the War and the Peace: Battlefield Ethics, Peace Talks, Treaties, and Pacifism in the Jewish Tradition. Michael J. Broyde, 1998, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deut|20:10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1947 [[Columbus Platform]] of [[Reform Judaism]], "Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to mankind the ideal of universal peace, striving for spiritual and physical disarmament of all nations. Judaism rejects violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy."&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;The Columbus Platform: The Guiding Principles of Reform Judaism, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism opposes violence===

The philosophy of [[nonviolence]] has roots in Judaism, going back to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] of the middle third century. While absolute nonviolence is not a requirement of Judaism, the religion so sharply restricts the use of violence, that nonviolence often becomes the only way to fulfilling a life of truth, justice and peace, which Judaism considers to be the three tools for the preservation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bearing witness: violence and collective responsibility, Sandra L. Bloom, Michael Reichert, Routledge, 1998: page 242&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish law (past and present) does not permit any use of violence unless it is in self-defense.&lt;ref name=koltora&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-10%20The%20Halacha%20of%20Rodef%20and%20the%20Rabin%20Shooting.htm |title=Halacha File: The Halacha of Rodef and the Rabin Shooting |publisher=Koltorah.org |date=2004-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person that even raises his hand in order to hit another person is called "evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ask.com/questions-about/Rasha |title=Rasha? |publisher=Ask.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305002701/http://www.ask.com/questions-about/Rasha |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidelines from the Torah to the 'Jewish Way to Fight a War'===

When the time for war arrived, Jewish soldiers are expected to abide by specific laws and values when fighting. Jewish war ethics attempts to balance the value of maintaining human life with the necessity of fighting a war. Judaism is somewhat unusual in that it demands adherence to Jewish values even while fighting a war. The Torah provides the following rules for how to fight a war: 
#Pursue Peace Before Waging War.
#Preserve the Ecological Needs of the Environment.
#Maintain Sensitivity to Human Life.
#The Goal is Peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_intro/level2/bl_war.htm |title=The Jewish Way to Wage War |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avoidance of violence===
The ancient orders (like those) of wars for Israel to eradicate idol worshiping does not apply today. Jews are not taught to glorify violence. The rabbis of the [[Talmud]] saw war as an avoidable evil. They taught: "The sword comes to the world because of delay of justice and through perversion of justice."

Jews have always hated war and "[[Shalom]]" expresses the hope for peace, in Judaism war is evil, but at times a necessary one, yet, Judaism teaches that one has to go to great length to avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;''Judaism'' by Arye Forta, Heinemann, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30321-1}} , p. 122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NhdoWlrzcg4C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Torah===
When [[Moses]] saw a Jew striking another in Egypt ({{bibleverse||Exodus|2:13|HE}}): "...he said to the ''rasha'' ("evil one"), why do you hit your fellow!?".&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 2:13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[midrash]] comments, "Rabbi Yitzhak said: from this you learn that whoever hits his fellow, is called a ''rasha''."&lt;ref&gt;Ginzey Schechter, Vol. I, p. 114, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, "The Jewish Attitude Towards Non-Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] ruled that whoever strikes his fellow transgresses a negative commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hovel Umazik 5:1, as cited by Rabbi Professor David Golinkin, "The Jewish Attitude Towards Non-Violent Protest and Civil Disobedience"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Deuteronomy]], an offer of peace is to be made to any city which is besieged, conditional on the acceptance of terms of tribute.&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Judaism and the ethics of war, Norman Solomon. International Review of the Red Cross. Volume 87 Number 858 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Mishna===
In the [[Mishna]], Rabbi [[Shimon ben Gamliel]] taught: "The world rests on three things: justice, truth, and peace."&lt;ref&gt;Pirkei  Avot 1:18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishna]] sages further asked, who is a hero of heroes? They answered, not one who defeats his enemy but one who turns an enemy into a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Avot de Rabbi Natan 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Talmud===
[[Shalom]] ("peace"), is one of the underlying principles of the [[Torah]], {{bibleverse||Proverbs|3:17|HE}}"Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom ('peace')."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 3:17&lt;/ref&gt; " The Talmud explains, "The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom".&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Gittin 59b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] comments in his [[Mishneh Torah]]: "Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.'" &lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Chanukah 4:14&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Talmud]]ic teaching, the very fact of taking someone's life, even when justly doing so, it effects, nevertheless the person, as the Talmud regards even a justly court that did order (in ancient times) the death penalty justifiably, that particular court at that time was labeled "killer court" in shame.&lt;ref&gt;''El Talmud'' by Iser Guinzburg, Editorial MAXTOR, 2009, {{ISBN|84-9761-579-4}}, {{ISBN|978-84-9761-579-2}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and even King [[David]], regarded by Jewish tradition as the most pious righteous person, (and his wars were within God's permission or/and orders) was denied building the [[Solomon's Temple|Jewish Temple]], the Talmud explains that when King David] asked "Why can I not build the Bais Hamikdash?" [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]'s answer was: "Your hands have spilled blood (in all your many wars)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/temple/history_sub.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225034245/http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/temple/history_sub.html |date=February 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud also teaches: "Be of the persecuted rather than the persecutor".&lt;ref&gt;Bava Kama 93a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later scholars===
Medieval Jewish commentators including the Spanish theologian and commentator [[Isaac Arama]] (c. 1420–1494), and [[Isaac Abravanel]] (1437–1508), emphasized the commitment of Judaism to peace.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

According to sixteenth century Rabbi [[Judah Loew]] of Prague, Jewish law forbids the killing of innocent people, even in the course of a legitimate military engagement.&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/War_and_Peace/Combat_and_Conflict/Ethics_of_Jewish_War.shtml |title=The Ethics of Jewish War |publisher=My Jewish Learning|date=|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian rabbi [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] (1800–1865) stated categorically that the only permissible war was defensive.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Later, a similar position prohibiting offensive war was taken by Rabbi [[Yeshayahu Karelitz]] (the Hazon
Ish, 1878–1953).&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

===Modern scholars===
Rabbi [[Moshe Avigdor Amiel]] (1883–1946), who was the Chief Rabbi of [[Tel Aviv]], wrote that military restraint was an absolute demand of Torah law, for "Thou shalt not murder" applied irrespective of whether the victim was Arab or Jew, and was the basis of Jewish ethics.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

Israeli [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] [[Shlomo Goren]], who had served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] as both paratrooper and chief chaplain, was instrumental in the formulation of the IDF official doctrine of ethics, and the concept of [[Purity of arms]].&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Human life is undoubtedly a supreme value in Judaism, as expressed both in the Halacha and the prophetic ethic. This refers not only to Jews, but to all men created in the image of God."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Violent tactics forbidden by Halakhah===
Jewish law prohibits the use of outright vandalism in warfare.&lt;ref name="mjl"/&gt; It forbids destruction of fruit trees as a tactic of war. It is also forbidden to break vessels, tear clothing, wreck that which is built up, stop fountains, or waste food in a destructive manner. Killing an animal needlessly or offering poisoned water to livestock are also forbidden.&lt;ref name="mjl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Nature_and_the_Environment/Traditional_Teachings/Bal_Tashit.shtml |title=Bal Tashhit: The Torah Prohibits Wasteful Destruction |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those few cases in the Bible in which this norm was violated are special cases. One example was when King [[Hezekiah]] stopped all the fountains in [[Jerusalem]] in the war against [[Sennacherib]], which Jewish scholars regards as a violation of the Biblical commandment.&lt;ref name="mjl"/&gt;

According to [[Maimonides]], on besieging a city in order to seize it, it must not be surrounded on all four sides but only on three sides, thus leaving a path of escape for whomever wishes to flee to save his life.&lt;ref name="ethics"/&gt; [[Nachmanides]], writing a century later, strengthened the rule and added a reason: "We are to learn to deal kindly with our enemy."&lt;ref name="ethics"/&gt;

===Notable rabbis===
Despite controversial public comments, [[Ovadia Yosef]], an influential Sephardic rabbi and distinguished rabbinical authority, advocates for peace negotiations in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] since the late 1980s. His main justification is the halakhic principle of ''[[Self-sacrifice in Jewish law|Pikuach Nefesh]]'', in which all the Jewish commandments (excluding [[adultery]], [[idolatry]], and [[murder]]) are put on hold if a life is put in danger. Using an argument first articulated by the late American rabbinical leader [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], Rabbi Yosef claims that the Arab–Israeli conflict endangers human lives, thereby meeting the above criteria and overruling the priority of commandments pertaining to settling the land of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp439.htm |title=Interpretations of Jewish Tradition on Democracy, Land, and Peace |author=Gerald M. Steinberg |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Israel is permitted—even obligated if saving lives is a definitive outcome—to make serious efforts to reach a peace settlement as well as to make arrangements to properly protect its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Rav Ovadia Yossef. "Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives", ''Tehumim'' Vol. 10, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rav Ovadia Yossef. "Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives", ''Crossroads: Halacha and the Modern World'' Vol. 3, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Yosef first applied the ''Pikuach Nefesh'' principle to Israel's conflicts with its neighbors in 1979, when he ruled that this argument granted Israel authority to return the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/v005/5.2yuchtman-yaar.html |title=Project MUSE - Shas: The Haredi-Dovish Image in a Changing Reality |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/israel_studies/ |title=Project MUSE - Israel Studies |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Konsthistorisk tidskrift''''' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[academic journal]] on [[art history]] that was established in 1932 by ''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'' (the Society of Art Historians) in [[Stockholm]]. The journal was published until 1967 under the full title ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift: revy för konst och konstforskning''. Since 2002 it has carried the English alternate title ''Journal of Art History''. It was published by the [[Scandinavian University Press]] from 1992 till 1999, and has been published by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]) since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Konsthistoriska sällskapet'',  the Society of Art Historians, was founded in 1914 on the initiative of [[Osvald Sirén]], J. A. Berg Professor of Art History in Stockholm, and [[Johnny Roosval]], then docent of Art History (later professor). The society was clearly Stockholm-centric from the start: Sirén and Roosval became chairman and vice chairman, respectively. The rest of the board consisted of representatives of the major museums in Stockholm, the director of the [[Bukowskis]] auction house there, and the other universities in Lund, Uppsala and Gothenburg each having one representative ([[Ewert Wrangel]], [[August Hahr]] and [[Axel Romdahl]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Pettersson (2000), p. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;

''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'' had a predecessor in the first periodical of the society, ''Konsthistoriska sällskapets publikation'', which was published 1915-1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS entry for the ''Konsthistoriska Sällskapets Publikation'']&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926, it was absorbed into the journal ''[[Tidskrift för konstvetenskap]]'', which had been published at the [[University of Lund]] since 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/420689?vw=full LIBRIS], [http://libris.kb.se/bib/408986?vw=full LIBRIS]; Ångström-Grandien (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual meeting of Konsthistoriska sällskapet in 1931, the board of the Society proposed re-establishing a periodical of its own, as {{blockquote|despite the merits of [Tidskrift för konstvetenskap], it has become apparent that it would be more suitable for the publication of the Society to be edited from Stockholm, as most art historical authors and most members live here, and it must, additionally, be easier to satisfy the interests of art history and the art collectors in all parts of the country with Stockholm as the base.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 123-124. Sjöberg's Swedish summary of the prospect presented by the board: "Sällskapets publikation har under senare åren utgjorts av den i Lund utgivna och redigerade Tidskrift för Konstvetenskap. Trots denna tidskrifts förtjänster har det dock visat sig vara mera lämpligt, att Sällskapets publikation redigeras från Stockholm, då de flesta konsthistoriska författarna och de flesta ledamöterna äro bosatta här, och det dessutom måste falla sig lättare att med Stockholm som utgångspunkt allsidigt tillgodose konstvetenskapens och konstsamlarnas intressen i alla delar av vårt land. Styrelsen har därför planerat en Konsthistorisk Tidskrift av ungefär samma format och omfång som den förutvarande Publikationen. Den nya tidskriften kommer att gratis tillsändas ledamöterna, och årsavgiften för ledamotskap förblir oförändrad."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The journal was to be of approximately the same size as the previous publication and would be distributed to members with no change in fees. After a short debate, the meeting agreed to the proposition of the board. Professor Axel Romdahl from Gothenburg suggested a division of the field between the two journals in some way and offered to negotiate this with representatives of the other journal.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöblom (1932), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960-1984 annual volumes of the journal included "Svensk konsthistorisk bibliografi" (from 1976 known as "konstvetenskaplig bibliografi"), an annual cumulative bibliography of art history published in Sweden, covering the years 1959-1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editors==
The journal originally had an editorial group consisting of an ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher", the person responsible for the publication under ''Tryckfrihetsförordningen'', the Swedish [[Constitution of Sweden#Freedom of the press and freedom of expression|Freedom of the Press Act]]) and one or several ''redaktör[er]'' ("editor[s]").&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/bib/3417286?vw=full LIBRIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of ''ansvarig utgivare'' ("publisher") for the journal has been held by:
*[[Johnny Roosval]] (1932-1965:1/2)
*Sten Karling (1965:3/4–1973)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1974–1990)
*Hans Henrik Brummer (1991)

The position of ''redaktör'', ("editor") for the journal has been held by:
*Georg Svensson (1932–1944)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson, [[Axel Boëthius]] and Georg Svensson (1945)
*Kjell Boström, Aron Andersson and Georg Svensson (1946:1-2)
*Johnny Roosval (1947)
*Sten Karling (1948–1973)
*Lars Olof Larsson and Ingrid Sjöström (1974–1980)
*Götz Pochat and Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:1)
*Patrik Reuterswärd (1981:2–1990)

Since 1992 the person responsible for the journal has been described by the English title "Editor-in-chief" and has been:

*Hans Henrik Brummer (1992–2001)
*Margaretha Rossholm Lagerlöf (2002–2009?)
*The current [[editor in chief]] is Dan Kartholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/journal.asp?issn=0023-3609&amp;linktype=5 ''Konsthistorisk tidskrift'', Editorial Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the journal has and has had a larger advisory committee. The first issue from 1932 listed one consisting of 27 people.

==Recognition==
The journal is financially supported by the [[Swedish Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;The on-line database shows it receiving 120,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] annually for 2002–2008:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">'''Mating types''' are molecular mechanisms that regulate compatibility in sexually reproducing [[eukaryote]]s. They occur in [[isogamy|isogamous]] and [[anisogamous]] species. Depending on the group, different mating types are often referred to by numbers, letters, or simply "+" and "-" instead of "male" and "female", that refer to "sexes" or differences in size between gametes.  [[Syngamy]] can only take place between gametes carrying different mating types.

Reproduction regulated by mating types is especially prevalent in [[Fungus|fungi]]. Filamentous [[ascomycete]]s usually have two mating types referred to as "MAT1-1" and "MAT1-2", following the yeast mating type locus MAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yoder|first1=O.C.|last2=Valent|first2=Barbara|last3=Chumley|first3=Forrest|title=Genetic Nomenclature and Practice for Plant Pathogenic Fungi|journal=Phytopathology|date=1986|volume=76|issue=4|pages=383–385|url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1986Articles/Phyto76n04_383.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under standard nomenclature, MAT1-1 (which may informally be called MAT1) encodes for a regulatory protein with a high motility-group (HMG) DNA-binding motif, while MAT1-2 (informally called MAT2) encodes for a protein with an alpha box motif, as in the yeast mating type MATα1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turgeon|first1=B.G.|last2=Yoder|first2=O.C.|title=Proposed Nomenclature for Mating Type Genes of Filamentous Ascomycetes|journal=Fungal Genetics and Biology|date=2000|volume=31|pages=1–5|doi=10.1006/fgbi.2000.1227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding mating types in yeast, a non-filamentous ascomycete, are referred to as MATa and MATα.

Mating type genes in ascomycetes are called idiomorphs rather than alleles due to the uncertainty of the origin by common descent. The proteins they encode are transcription factors that regulate both the early and late stages of the sexual cycle. [[Heterothallic]] ascomycetes produce gametes that present a single Mat idiomorph and [[Fertilisation|syngamy]] will only be possible between gametes carrying complementary mating types. On the other hand, [[homothallic]] ascomycetes produce gametes that can fuse with every other gamete in the population (including its own mitotic descendants) most often because each haploid contains the two alternate forms of the Mat locus in its genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giraud|first=T. | title = Mating system of the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum: Selfing under heterothallism | journal = Eukaryotic Cell | year = 2008 | volume = 7 | pages = 765–775 | doi=10.1128/ec.00440-07|display-authors=etal|pmc=2394975}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Basidiomycete]]s on the other hand can have thousands of different mating types.&lt;ref name="Casselton"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Casselton LA | title = Mate recognition in fungi | journal = Heredity | year = 2002 | volume = 88 | pages = 142–147 | pmid = 11932772 | doi = 10.1038/sj.hdy.6800035|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptive function of mating type in the ascomycete Neurospora crassa is discussed in the article ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.  That matings in ''N. crassa'' are restricted to interaction of strains of opposite mating type may be an adaptation to promote some degree of outcrossing.  Outcrossing, through [[complementation (genetics)|complementation]], could provide the benefit of masking recessive deleterious mutations in genes that function in the dikaryon and/or diploid stage of the life cycle.

'''Media evaluation''' is a discipline of the [[social science]]s and centres on the analysis of media content rating the exposure using a number of pre-designated criteria commonly including tonal value and presence of key messages. It is said to be one of the fastest growing areas of [[mass communications]] research. 

[[The International Association for Measurement and Evaluation of Communication (AMEC)]] is the industry appointed trade body for companies and individuals involved in research, measurement and evaluation in editorial media coverage and related communications issues. To be a full member of [http://www.amecorg.com/ AMEC], companies must be able to a) offer comprehensive media evaluation, research and interpretation services, b) been in business for at least two years and c) have media evaluation turnover in excess of £150,000 when applying.  In addition all companies abide by a strict code of ethics and must implement tight quality control procedures.  These conditions ensure that the media avaluation services offered are all to the very highest standard. Further detailed information on the industry  is available from AMEC's [http://www.amecorg.com/ website]. Another organisation is the Commission on Public Relations Measurement &amp; Evaluation [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071402/http://www.instituteforpr.org/about/measurement_commission/] which was formed under the auspices of the Institute for Public Relations in 1998. The Commission exists to establish standards and methods for public relations research and measurement, and to issue authoritative best-practices white papers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">The '''Moredun Research Institute''' is a scientific research institution based at the '''Pentlands Science Park''', in the [[Bush Estate]] area of [[Midlothian]], Scotland. It conducts research into [[Veterinary pathology|diseases of farm livestock]] and the promotion of [[animal health]] and [[Animal welfare|welfare]].

Moredun employs over 200 [[Veterinarian|vets]], scientists and support staff, that are funded primarily by the [[Agriculture, Food and Rural Communities Directorate]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. The Institute received [[Pound sterling|£]]7.1 million from the government in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies/about/Bodies National Public Bodies Directory], the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Animal Diseases Research Association''', now the registered charity the '''Moredun Foundation''', was founded in 1920 by a group of Scottish farmers, with the aim of improving the health of livestock, especially [[Sheep farming|sheep]]. The association founded a research institute employing vets and scientists, and over the decades the scope of animal health work expanded to cover goats, cows, horses and wildlife.

The Institute was originally based at [[Moredun]], in Edinburgh.

The origins of Moredun go back to the years following World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.

By the 1940s over half a million doses of vaccine and treatment products were produced and distributed by Moredun. Research gained momentum and further funding was secured to find out the causes of many different diseases such as: scrapie, pine, milk fever, Johne’s disease and a range of respiratory and reproductive disorders. Vaccines, diagnostics and treatment strategies followed. Today, many of the veterinary medicines and vaccines that are routinely used on farms have been researched, developed or tested at Moredun. This research is vital – 17% of the value of the UK sheep industry is lost each year due to infectious diseases. Subclinical infections of gut parasites are estimated to cost the UK sheep industry over £84 million a year in lost production. Enzootic abortion in ewes is thought to cost the UK sheep industry £15 million a year and Johne’s disease costs the UK cattle industry £13 million a year. Ninety years on, and still governed by farmers, Moredun’s mission to improve animal health and welfare remains strong and Moredun continues to apply cutting edge science and technology to help protect both livestock and people, today and tomorrow.

==Pentlands Science Park==
The Pentlands Science Park opened in 1995. It is part of the '''Moredun Group''', under the control of the Moredun Foundation. It is a [[public-private partnership]]. The Pentlands Science Park and Moredun are participants in the [[Edinburgh Science Triangle]] project.

In addition to being the home of the Moredun Research Institute, the science park has attracted 20 companies to the site. The focus of Pentlands Science Park is [[animal bioscience]] but the tenants include research companies involved in [[pharmaceuticals]], [[software]], and [[environmental science]]. The area occupied by non-Moredun organisations is approximately 55,000 [[sq ft]], and these tenants employ over 200 people.

'''Objectivity''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of being [[wikt:true|true]] independently from [[subject (philosophy)|individual]] [[subjectivity]] caused by perception, emotions, or imagination. A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its truth conditions are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without partiality or external influence, sometimes used synonymously with ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]''.

== Objectivity of knowledge ==
&lt;!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here --&gt;
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth. His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]]. In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal_(metaphysics)#Platonic_realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis. Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer_effect_(physics)#Quantum_mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term, "ethical subjectivism", covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism. David Hume is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer. Similarly, Roderick Firth's [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of. William James, another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands. For example, on [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer's]] emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about chemistry, biology, or history, in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

'''Operation Phototrack''' was among the programs quickly organized in the United States, after the Soviet earth satellite [[Sputnik 1]] was launched on 4 October 1957, to fill the temporary tracking gap until the [[Baker-Nunn]] cameras specially designed to optically track U.S. satellites became operational. It was also referred to as the "Independent IGY ([[International Geophysical Year]]) Tracking Coordination Program".

==Use of volunteers==
Supported by the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (later the Society for Imaging Science and Technology), Phototrack enlisted volunteers who had wide-angle optical instruments with film-recording capability. Volunteers were recruited with announcements in various magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name=XVII&gt;"Sky and Telescope", Vol. XVII, No. 8, June 1958, in sidebar titled "Operation Phototrack" on p. 387 (Table of Contents page)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Rotarian", Aug 1958, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Like its contemporary volunteer visual-tracking program called [[Moonwatch]], it continued for some years as a supplement to the Baker-Nunn operation, since its results could fill in for the main system’s losses due to, for example, weather problems. Also like Moonwatch, some of its volunteers were located in countries outside the U. S,&lt;ref&gt;"List of Coordinates of Stations Engaged in the Observation of Artificial Earth Satellites", D.V. Mechau, Smithsonian Astrophysical Society, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; such as Canada,&lt;ref&gt;"Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada", 1961, p 236&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and Japan.

==Time exposure photographs==
The photographs produced were time exposures in which a satellite’s track appeared as a long, usually slightly curved, line seen against a background of stars. If the camera were stationary, the tracks of the much more slowly moving stars appeared as much shorter lines, which were portions of arcs about the pole. If the volunteer had a motor-driven polar-axis camera mount that countered the earth’s rotation, the stars were represented by dots whose sizes depended on the resolution of the camera lens and the magnitude of the star.
[[File:Echo Rising.JPG|thumb|Example of some typical contents of images submitted to Operation Phototrack by participating volunteers.]]

With knowledge of the camera’s latitude/longitude position and its elevation above sea level, both obtainable from USGS ([[U. S. Geological Survey]]) 7½-minute quadrangle maps (before the days of [[Global Positioning System]] devices), comparison of the track with the star background could define the satellite’s successive positions. To correlate those positions with times, breaks in the lines were created by interrupting the exposures at times known by their relationship with radio [[time signal]]s broadcast by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|U. S. National Bureau of Standards]].

Suitable times for making photos were when the observer’s sky was dark enough to show stars but the very high altitude satellite was directly illuminated by the sun. Most such times were during the two hours before dawn or after sunset at the observer’s location, but vehicles reaching sufficiently southerly or northerly latitudes were sometimes illuminated by sunlight coming over the polar regions.

==Film requirements==
The program required negatives submitted for measurement to be at least 4 by 5 inches (over 100 by 125&amp;nbsp;mm) in size and the lens to have a focal length of at least 5 inches. The film was to be as light-sensitive a type as could be obtained on the non-professional market and strongly developed to further increase that sensitivity. Measurement of such negatives could determine the locations of multiple points along the satellite’s path within 150 feet, or about 50 meters&lt;ref name=XVII/&gt;

==Project management==
Phototrack was directed by Norton Goodwin, who was also an author, along with [[L. N. Cormier]] and R. K. Squires, of a manual&lt;ref&gt;"Simplified Satellite Prediction from modified orbital elements", Leonard N. Cormier, Norton Goodwin, and Reginald K. Squires, National Academy of Sciences - National Research Council, Washington 25, D.C. Limited Draft Edition, 29 August 1958. Reprinted 1 January 1959 as "IGY Satellite Report Series, Number 7&lt;/ref&gt; for prediction of satellite observing times from modified orbital elements, in which "modified" meant earth-centered orbital elements using longitude and latitude as coordinates rather than astronomers’ declination and right ascension. Procedures described in that document were to be used by program participants for making calculations to determine times and aiming directions for using their instruments.
 
===Computation handbook===
Goodwin was also the listed author of another program booklet containing tables of trigonometric functions.&lt;ref&gt;"Seven Place Cosines, Sines, and Tangents For Every Tenth Microturn", Norton Goodwin, Director, Independent Tracking Coordination Program. Reprinted 1964 for the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers by H. B. Roebuck and Son, Inc., Baltimore, MD&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual feature of these tables was the specification of angles in "turns", one turn being 360 degrees, or 2pi radians. They were calculated for "every tenth microturn", which referred to the ordinal tenths, not the fractional tenths. Those values, calculated on early digital computers, were made available to be used by Phototrack participants for making decimal calculations.  Besides a  "limited draft edition" of the computation handbook, published in August 1958, a later version was published by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] – [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in January 1959 as Number 7 in its "IGY Satellite Report Series". The book of tables was also re-published by the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers in 1964.

===Observer updates===
Observers were provided with sufficiently frequent updates of the orbital parameters of known objects, based on past observations, to permit each to work out his own predictions of suitable looking times and directions for his own location. Updates were sent primarily by postal mail in the form of about weekly postcards, but some information was available by radio.&lt;ref&gt;"Annual Report of the Civil Air Patrol -- Looking Spaceward", 1958&lt;/ref&gt; The data provided on the cards were the modified orbital elements used in the handbook calculations. That being before either home computers or even electronic calculators existed, most program participants had to do their calculations, including long divisions, either manually or with mechanical calculating devices.

===Final analysis===
Exposed negatives containing good tracks and star backgrounds and clear time markers were sent to the program, which forwarded them to trained analysts for measurement.  Although little evidence of a satellite’s distance from the observing station was available from any single negative, and exposures at different stations did not occur simultaneously, combining of the results from several stations, plus accurately measurable items such as the orbital period, allowed parameters of credible smooth orbital paths to be derived.

'''Photoelasticity''' describes changes in the [[optical properties]] of a material under mechanical deformation. It is a property of all [[dielectric|dielectric media]] and is often used to experimentally [[stress analysis|determine the stress distribution]] in a material, where it gives a picture of stress distributions around [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuities]] in materials. Photoelastic experiments (also informally referred to as ''photoelasticity'') are an important tool for determining critical stress points in a material, and are used for determining stress concentration in irregular geometries.

==History==
The photoelastic phenomenon was first discovered by the Scottish [[physicist]] [[David Brewster]]&lt;ref&gt;D. Brewster, Experiments on the depolarization of light as exhibited by various mineral, animal and vegetable bodies with a reference of the phenomena to the general principle of polarization, Phil. Tras. 1815, pp. 29–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Brewster, On the communication of the structure of doubly-refracting crystals to glass, murite of soda, flour spar, and other substances by mechanical compression and dilation, Phil. Tras. 1816, pp. 156–178.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Experimental frameworks were developed at the beginning of the twentieth century with the works of [[E. G. Coker]] and [[Louis Napoleon George Filon|L. N. G. Filon]] of [[University of London]]. Their book ''Treatise on Photoelasticity'', published in 1930 by [[Cambridge Press]], became a standard text on the subject. Between 1930 and 1940, many other books appeared on the subject, including books in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. At the same time, much development occurred in the field – great improvements were achieved in technique, and the equipment was simplified. With refinements in the technology, photoelastic experiments were extended to determining three-dimensional states of stress. In parallel to developments in experimental technique, the first phenomenological description of photoelasticity was given in 1890 by [[Friedrich_Carl_Alwin_Pockels|Friedrich Pockels]]&lt;ref&gt;Pockels, F. Ueber die durch einseitigen Druck hervorgerufene Doppelbrechung regulärer Krystalle, speciell von Steinsalz und Sylvin, ''Annalen der Physik'', 275, 1890, 440.&lt;/ref&gt;, however this was proved inadequate almost a century later by Nelson &amp; [[Melvin_Lax|Lax]]&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D.F., and Lax, M. New Symmetry for Acousto-Optic Scattering, ''Physical Review Letters'', 1970, 24:8, 379-380.&lt;/ref&gt; as the description by Pockels only considered the effect of mechanical strain on the optical properties of the material.

With the advent of the digital [[polariscope]] – made possible by light-emitting diodes – continuous monitoring of structures under load became possible. This led to the development of dynamic photoelasticity, which has contributed greatly to the study of complex phenomena such as [[fracture]] of materials.

==Applications==

Photoelasticity has been used for a variety of stress analyses and even for routine use in design, particularly before the advent of numerical methods, such as for instance finite elements or boundary elements.&lt;ref&gt;Frocht, M.M., ''Photoelasticity''. J. Wiley and Sons, London, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Digitization of polariscopy enables fast image acquisition and data processing, which allows its industrial applications to control quality of manufacturing process for materials such as glass&lt;ref&gt;Ajovalasit, A., Petrucci, G., Scafidi, M., RGB photoelasticity applied to the analysis of membrane residual stress in glass, ''Measurement Science and Technology'', 2012, 23-2, no. 025601&lt;/ref&gt; and polymer.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, S., Beiermann, B., Davis, D., Sottos, N., White, S., Moore, J., Characterization of mechanochemically active polymers using combined photoelasticity and fluorescence measurements, ''SEM Annual Conference and Exposition on Experimental and Applied Mechanics'', 2010, 2, pp. 896–907.&lt;/ref&gt; Dentistry utilizes photoelasticity to analyze strain in denture materials.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandes, C. P., Glantz, P.-O. J., Svensson, S. A., Bergmark, A.

Photoelasticity can successfully be used to investigate the highly localized stress state within masonry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni D. Bigoni and G. Noselli, Localized stress percolation through dry masonry walls. Part I – Experiments. ''European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids'', 2010, 29, 291–298.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni D. Bigoni and G. Noselli, Localized stress percolation through dry masonry walls. Part II – Modelling. ''European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids'', 2010, 29, pp. 299–307.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigoni, D. Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: Bifurcation Theory and Material Instability. Cambridge University Press, 2012 . {{ISBN|9781107025417}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in proximity of a [[rigid line inclusion (stiffener, anticrack)|rigid line inclusion (stiffener)]]  embedded in an elastic medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ing.unitn.it/~bigoni G. Noselli, F. Dal Corso and D. Bigoni, The stress intensity near a stiffener disclosed by photoelasticity. ''International Journal of Fracture'', 2010, 166, 91–103.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the former case, the problem is nonlinear due to the contacts between bricks, while in the latter case the elastic solution is singular, so that numerical methods may fail to provide correct results. These can be obtained through photoelastic techniques. Dynamic photoelasticity integrated with high-speed photography is utilized to investigate fracture behavior in materials.&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, A., High-speed fracture studies on bimaterial interfaces using photoelasticity – A review, ''Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design,'' 2012, 36-2, 119–142.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another important application of the photoelasticity experiments is to study the stress field around bi-material notches.&lt;ref&gt;Ayatollahi, M. R.,  Mirsayar, M. M.,  Dehghany, M., Experimental determination of stress field parameters in bi-material notches using photoelasticity, "Materials &amp; Design," 2011, 32, 4901–4908.&lt;/ref&gt; Bi-material notches exist in many engineering application like welded or adhesively bonded structures

==Formal definition==
For a linear [[dielectric|dielectric material]] the change in the inverse permittivity tensor &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the deformation (the gradient of the displacement &lt;math&gt;\partial_l u_k&lt;/math&gt;)  is described by &lt;ref&gt;J. F. Nye, "Physical Properties of Crystals: Their Representation by Tensors and Matrices", Oxford University Press, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij} = P_{ijkl} \partial_k u_l &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is the fourth-rank photoelasticity tensor, &lt;math&gt;u_l&lt;/math&gt; is the linear displacement from equilibrium, and &lt;math&gt;\partial_l&lt;/math&gt; denotes denotes differentiation with respect to the Cartesian coordinate &lt;math&gt;x_l&lt;/math&gt;. For isotropic materials, this definition simplifies to &lt;ref&gt;R. E. Newnham, "Properties of Materials: Anisotropy, Symmetry, Structure", Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(\varepsilon^{-1})_{ij} = p_{ijkl} s_{kl} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric part of the photoelastic tensor (the photoelastic strain tensor), and &lt;math&gt;s_{kl}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Infinitesimal_strain_theory|linear strain]]. The antisymmetric part of &lt;math&gt;P_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[roto-optic tensor]]. From either definition, it is clear that deformations to the body may induce optical anisotropy, which can cause an otherwise optically isotropic material to exhibit [[birefringence]]. Although the symmetric photoelastic tensor is most commonly defined with respect to mechanical strain, it is also possible to express photoelasticity in terms of the [[Hooke's law|mechanical stress]].

==Experimental Principles==
[[Image:Plastic Protractor Polarized 05375.jpg|thumb|Tension lines in plastic protractor seen under cross-polarized light.]]
The experimental procedure relies on the property of [[birefringence]], as exhibited by certain transparent materials. Birefringence is a phenomenon in which a ray of light passing through a given material experiences two [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. The property of birefringence (or double refraction) is observed in many optical [[crystal]]s. Upon the application of stresses, photoelastic materials exhibit the property of birefringence, and the magnitude of the refractive indices at each point in the material is directly related to the state of stresses at that point. Information such as maximum shear stress and its orientation are available by analyzing the birefringence with an instrument called a [[polariscope]].

When a ray of [[Electromagnetic radiation|light]] passes through a photoelastic material, its electromagnetic wave components are resolved along the two [[Stress (mechanics)|principal stress directions]] and each component experiences a different refractive index due to the birefringence. The difference in the refractive indices leads to a relative [[phase (waves)|phase]] retardation between the two components. Assuming a thin specimen made of [[Hooke's law|isotropic]] materials, where two-dimensional photoelasticity is applicable, the magnitude of the relative retardation is given by the ''stress-optic law'':&lt;ref&gt;Dally, J.W. and Riley, W.F., ''Experimental Stress Analysis,'' 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill Inc., 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta = \frac{2\pi t } \lambda C ( \sigma_1 - \sigma_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;Delta; is the induced retardation, ''C'' is the stress-optic coefficient, ''t'' is the specimen thickness, ''λ'' is the vacuum wavelength, and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the first and second principal stresses, respectively. The retardation changes the polarization of transmitted light. The polariscope combines the different polarization states of light waves before and after passing the specimen. Due to optical [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the two waves, a fringe pattern is revealed. The number of fringe order ''N'' is denoted as

: &lt;math&gt; N = \frac \Delta {2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

which depends on relative retardation. By studying the fringe pattern one can determine the state of stress at various points in the material.

For materials that do not show photoelastic behavior,  it is still possible to study the stress distribution. The first step is to build a model, using photoelastic materials, which has geometry similar to the real structure under investigation. The loading is then applied in the same way to ensure that the stress distribution in the model is similar to the stress in the real structure.

==Isoclinics and isochromatics==

Isoclinics are the loci of the points in the specimen along which the principal stresses are in the same direction.

Isochromatics are the loci of the points along which  the difference in the first and second principal stress remains the same. Thus they are the lines which join the points with equal maximum shear stress magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh, K., ''Digital Photoelasticity,'' Springer, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-dimensional photoelasticity==
[[File:Photoelasticimetry1.JPG|thumb|Photoelastic experiment showing the internal stress distribution inside a thin piece of plastic]]
Photoelasticity can describe both three-dimensional and two-dimensional states of stress. However, examining photoelasticity in three-dimensional systems is more involved than two-dimensional or plane-stress system. So the present section deals with photoelasticity in a plane stress system. This condition is achieved when the thickness of the prototype is much smaller as compared to dimensions in the plane. 
Thus one is only concerned with stresses acting parallel to the plane of the model, as other stress components are zero. The experimental setup varies from experiment to experiment. The two basic kinds of setup used are plane polariscope and circular polariscope.

The working principle of a two-dimensional experiment allows the measurement of retardation, which can be converted to the difference between the first and second principal stress and their orientation. To further get values of each stress component, a technique called stress-separation is required.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez M.S-B., Calderon, J. M. A., Diez, P. M. B. and Segura, I. I. C., Stress-separation techniques in photoelasticity: A review. ''The Journal of Strain Analysis for Engineering Design'', 2010, 45:1 [doi:10.1243/03093247JSA583]&lt;/ref&gt; Several theoretical and experimental methods are utilized to provide additional information to solve individual stress components.

==Plane polariscope setup==
The setup consists of two linear [[polarizer]]s and a light source.  The light source can either emit monochromatic light or white light depending upon the experiment. First the light  is passed through the first polarizer which converts the light into plane polarized light. The apparatus is set up in such a way that this plane polarized light then passes through the stressed specimen. This light then follows, at each point of the specimen, the direction of principal stress at that point. The light is then made to pass through the analyzer and we finally get the fringe pattern.

The fringe pattern in a plane polariscope setup consists of both the isochromatics and the isoclinics. The isoclinics change with the orientation of the polariscope while there is no change in the isochromatics.
[[Image:Transmission Circular Polariscope.svg|right|thumb|400px|Transmission Circular Polariscope&lt;br /&gt;The same device functions as a plane polariscope when quarter wave plates are taken aside or rotated so their axes parallel to polarization axes]]

==Circular polariscope setup==
In a circular polariscope setup two quarter-[[wave plate]]s are added to the experimental setup of the plane polariscope. The first quarter-wave plate is placed in between the polarizer and the specimen and the second quarter-wave plate is placed between the specimen and the analyzer. The effect of adding the quarter-wave plate after the source-side polarizer is that we get [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] passing through the sample. The analyzer-side quarter-wave plate converts the circular polarization state back to linear before the light passes through the analyzer.

The basic advantage of a circular polariscope over a plane polariscope is that in a circular polariscope setup we only get the isochromatics and not the isoclinics. This eliminates the problem of differentiating between the isoclinics and the isochromatics.

The '''Picower Institute for Learning and Memory''' is, along with the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Science]]s, one of the three [[neuroscience]] groups at [[MIT]]. The institute is focused on studying all aspects of learning and memory; specifically, it has received over [[US$]]50 million to study [[Alzheimer's]], [[schizophrenia]] and similar diseases.

When it was established in 1994, the institute was primarily funded by the [[Sherman Fairchild Foundation]], the [[RIKEN Brain Science Institute]] and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://web.mit.edu/picower/about/index.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed after a $50 million grant by the [[Jeffry Picower#Involvement with Bernard Madoff|Picower Foundation]] in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/uwire/uwire_WFR051720027396405.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=top&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prefuse''' is a [[Java (software platform)|Java]]-based [[toolkit]] for building interactive [[information visualization]] applications. It supports a rich set of features for [[data modeling]], visualization and interaction. It provides optimized [[data structure]]s for [[table (information)|tables]], [[graph (data structure)|graphs]], and [[tree (data structure)|trees]], a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support for [[Computer animation|animation]], dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity. 

Prefuse uses the [[Java 2D]] [[graphics library]], and is easily integrated into [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] applications or [[Java applet]]s. Prefuse is licensed under the terms of a [[BSD license]], and can be used freely for commercial and non-commercial purposes.

== Overview ==
{{noref|section|date=May 2011}}
Prefuse is a [[Java (software platform)|Java]]-based extensible [[software framework]] for creating interactive [[information visualization]] applications. It can be used to build standalone applications, visual components and [[Java applet]]s. Prefuse intends to simplify the processes of visualizing, handling and mapping of data, as well as user interaction.

Some of Prefuse's features include:

* [[table (information)|Table]], [[graph (data structure)|graph]], and [[tree (data structure)|tree]] [[data structure]]s supporting arbitrary data attributes, data indexing, and selection queries, all with an efficient memory footprint.
* Components for layout, color, size, and shape encodings, distortion techniques and more.
* A library of controls for common interactive, direct-manipulation operations.
* Animation support through a general activity scheduling mechanism.
* View transformations supporting panning and zooming, including both geometric and semantic zooming.
* Dynamic [[query language|queries]] for interactive filtering of data.
* Integrated text search using a number of available [[search engines]].
* A physical force [[Computer simulation|simulation]] engine for dynamic layout and animation (s.a. [[Force-directed graph drawing]])
* Flexibility for multiple views, including "overview+detail" and "small multiples" displays.
* A built in, [[SQL]]-like expression language for writing queries to prefuse data structures and creating derived data fields.
* Support for issuing queries to [[SQL database]]s and mapping query results into prefuse data structures.
(and perhaps most importantly)
* Simple, developer-friendly [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) for creating custom processing, interaction, and rendering components.

Prefuse has been used in school course projects, academic and industrial research, and commercial [[software development]].

==Architecture==
The design of the prefuse toolkit is based upon the [[information visualization reference model]], a software architecture pattern that breaks up the visualization process into a series of discrete steps. "Prefuse: a toolkit for interactive information visualization" provides more details on implementation and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Heer, [[Stuart K. Card]] and James A. Landay (2005). [http://bid.berkeley.edu/files/papers/2005-prefuse-CHI.pdf " prefuse: a toolkit for interactive information visualization"]. In: ''Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems'': 421-430, Portland, Oregon, USA: ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

The information visualization reference model was developed in the Ph.D. thesis work of Ed Chi, under the name of the [[data state model]]. Chi showed that the framework successfully modeled a wide array of visualization applications. Later, Chi's work showed that the model was functionally equivalent to the data flow model used in existing graphics toolkits such as VTK. In their work, "Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think", Stuart K. Card, Jock D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman present their own interpretation of this pattern, dubbing it the "information visualization reference model".&lt;ref&gt; [[Jock D. Mackinlay]] Stuart K. Card, Ben Shneiderman (eds.) (1999). ''Readings in information visualization: using vision to think''. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc, p.686.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[plug flow reactor model|Plug Flow Tube Reactor]] (PFTR) is a model of an ideal reactor characterized by the input of a premixed reaction mixture of reactants and solvents on one side and a removal of the product on the other side. During the flow of the mixture the reactants react with each other. An ideal [[plug flow]] is assumed i.e. any flow velocities are constant and no back mixing of components happens.&lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;

Real [[plug flow]] reactors do not satisfy the idealized flow patterns, back mix flow or plug flow deviation form ideal behavior can be due to channeling of fluid through the vessel, recycling of fluid within the vessel or due to the presence of stagnant region or dead zone of fluid in the vessel.&lt;ref name="Levenspiel, 260-265" /&gt; Real plug flow reactors with non ideal behavior have also been modelled.&lt;ref name="Adeniyi et al, 2003" /&gt;

The [[Residence time distribution|residence-time distribution (RTD)]] of a reactor is a characteristic of the mixing that occurs in the chemical reactor. There is no axial mixing in a [[Plug flow reactor|plug-flow reactor]], and this omission is reflected in the RTD which is exhibited by this class of reactors.&lt;ref name="Fogler, 812" /&gt;

To predict the exact behavior of a vessel as a [[chemical reactor]], RTD or stimulus response technique is used.
The [[tracer technique]], the most widely used method for the study of axial dispersion, is usually used in the form of:&lt;ref name="Coulson &amp; Richardson, 87-92" /&gt;
* Pulse input
* Step input
* Cyclic input
* Random input

The RTD is determined experimentally by injecting an inert chemical, molecule, or atom, called a tracer, into the reactor at some time t = 0 and then measuring the tracer concentration, C, in the effluent stream as a function of time.&lt;ref name="Fogler, 812" /&gt;

The [[Residence time distribution|residence time distribution (RTD)]] curve of fluid leaving a vessel is called the E-Curve. This curve is normalized in such a way that the area under it is unity:
: (1) 
: &lt;math&gt;\int E \partial t = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The mean age of the exit stream or [[Residence time distribution|mean residence time]] is:
: (2)
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \int t E \partial t = \sum t E \nabla t&lt;/math&gt;

When a tracer is injected into a reactor at a location more than two or three particle diameters downstream from the entrance and measured some distance upstream from the exit, the system is analogous to an open-open system. For such a system where there is no discontinuity in type of flow at the point of tracer injection or at the point of tracer measurement, the variance for open system is:
: (3)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2 = (\sigma_t )^2 /\tau^2 = 2/P_e + 8/(P_e)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where,
: (4)
: &lt;math&gt;P_e = L U/ D_L &lt;/math&gt;

which represents the ratio of rate of transport by convection to rate of transport by [[diffusion]] or dispersion.
: &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = characteristic length (m)
: &lt;math&gt;D_L&lt;/math&gt; = effective dispersion coefficient ( m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
: &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; = superficial velocity (m/s) based on empty cross-section

Vessel dispersion number is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; 1/P_e = D_L/L U &lt;/math&gt;

The [[variance]] of a continuous distribution measured at a finite number of equidistant locations is given by:
: (5)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_t )^2 = \sum t_i ^2 C_i / \sum C_i - \sum [t_i C_i / \sum C_i ]^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where mean residence time τ is given by:
: (6)
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \sum t_i C_i / \sum C_i &lt;/math&gt;
: (7)
: &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2 = (\sigma_t)^2/\tau^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus (σ&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be evaluated from the experimental data on C vs. t and for known values of &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_\theta)^2&lt;/math&gt;, the dispersion number &lt;math&gt;(1/P_e)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from eq. (3) as:
: (8)
: &lt;math&gt; D_L/L U =  -1 + \sqrt{1 + 8 ( \sigma_\theta )^2 \over 8} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus axial dispersion coefficient D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; can be estimated (L = packed height)&lt;ref name="Levenspiel, 260-265" /&gt;

There are also other boundary conditions that can be applied to the dispersion model giving different relationships for the dispersion number.&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 56 (2011) 7312-7318. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.047&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 176 (2015) 463-471. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.019&lt;/ref&gt;

; Advantages:
From the safety technical point of view the PFTR has the advantages that &lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;
# It operates in a [[steady state]]
# It is well controllable 
# Large [[heat transfer]] areas can be installed

; Concerns:
The main problems lies in difficult and sometimes critical start-up and shut down operations.&lt;ref name="PFTR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">A '''reliability block diagram (RBD)''' is a [[diagrammatic]] method for showing how component [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] contributes to the success or failure of a [[complex system]]. RBD is also known as a dependence diagram&amp;nbsp;(DD).
[[Image:Reliability block diagram.png|240px|thumb|right|A reliability block diagram]]

An RBD or DD is drawn as a series of blocks connected in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] or [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] configuration. Each block represents a component of the system with a [[failure rate]]. Parallel paths are [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant]], meaning that all of the parallel paths must fail for the parallel network to fail. By contrast, any failure along a series path causes the entire series path to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An RBD may be drawn using switches in place of blocks, where a closed switch represents a working component and an open switch represents a failed component. If a path may be found through the network of switches from beginning to end, the system still works.

An RBD may be converted to a success tree by replacing series paths with [[And gate|AND gates]] and parallel paths with [[Or gate|OR gates]]. A success tree may then be converted to a [[Fault Tree Analysis|fault tree]] by applying [[de Morgan's laws|de Morgan's theorem]].

In order to evaluate RBD, closed form solution are available in the case of ''statistical independence'' among blocks or components.
In the case the statistical independence assumption is not satisfied, specific formalisms and solution tools, such as dynamic RBD,&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore Distefano, Antonio Puliafito: Dependability Evaluation with Dynamic Reliability Block Diagrams and Dynamic Fault Trees. IEEE Trans. Dependable Sec. Comput. 6(1): 4-17 (2009), http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4385723&lt;/ref&gt; have to be considered.

[[File:AB Keeled Scales.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Keeled scales of a [[colubrid]] snake (buff-striped keelback; ''[[Amphiesma stolatum]]'')]]
In most [[biology|biological]] nomenclature, a '''scale''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:λεπίς|λεπίς]] ''lepis'', [[Latin language|Latin]] ''squama'') is a small rigid [[Plate (animal anatomy)|plate]] that grows out of an [[animal]]'s [[skin]] to provide protection.  In [[lepidoptera]]n ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, scales are plates on the surface of the [[insect wing]], and provide coloration.  Scales are quite common and have evolved multiple times through [[convergent evolution]], with varying structure and function.

Scales are generally classified as part of an organism's [[integumentary system]].  There are various types of scales according to shape and to [[class (biology)|class]] of animal.

==Fish scales==
[[File:Scale Common Roach.JPG|thumb|Cycloid scales on a [[common roach]] (''Rutilus rutilus'')]]
{{main|Fish scale}}
Fish scales are [[skin|dermally]] derived, specifically in the [[mesoderm]]. This fact distinguishes them from reptile scales paleontologically.
Genetically, the same genes involved in tooth and hair development in mammals are also involved in scale development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. T.| title = Fish scale development: Hair today, teeth and scales yesterday?| journal = Current Biology| volume = 11| last1 = Sharpe| issue = 18| pages = R751–R752| year = 2001| pmid = 11566120| doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00438-9    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Coelacanth]] --&gt;
True cosmoid scales can only be found on the [[Sarcopterygian]]s. The inner layer of the scale is made of [[lamellar]] bone. On top of this lies a layer of spongy or [[Blood vessel|vascular]] bone and then a layer of [[dentine]]-like material called [[cosmine]]. The upper surface is [[keratin]]. The [[coelacanth]] has modified cosmoid scales that lack cosmine and are thinner than true cosmoid scales.

===Ganoid scales===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gar]] --&gt;
Ganoid scales can be found on [[gar]]s (family [[Lepisosteidae]]), [[bichir]]s, and reedfishes (family [[Polypteridae]]). Ganoid scales are similar to cosmoid scales, but a layer of [[ganoin]] lies over the cosmine layer and under the enamel{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}. Ganoin scales are diamond shaped, shiny, and hard. &lt;!-- Which is it, enamel or dentine?  Only dentine mentioned previously. --&gt; 
Within the ganoin are [[guanine]] compounds, iridescent derivatives of guanine found in a DNA molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 =Levy-Lior | first1 =A. | last2 =Pokroy | first2= B. | last3 =Levavi-Sivan | first3 =B. | last4 =Leiserowitz |first4 = L.| last5 =Weiner | first5 =S. |last6 =Addadi | first6 =L. | title =Biogenic guanine crystals from the skin of fish may be designed to enhance light reflectance | journal = Crystal growth and design | year =2008 | volume =8 | issue =2 | pages = 507–511 |doi=10.1021/cg0704753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iridescent property of these chemicals provide the ganoin its shine.

===Placoid scales===
[[Placoid scale]]s are found on [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous fish]] including [[shark]]s. These scales, also called denticles, are similar in structure to [[tooth|teeth]], and have one median spine and two lateral spines.

===Leptoid scales===
Leptoid scales are found on higher-order bony fish.  As they grow they add concentric layers. They are arranged so as to overlap in a head-to-tail direction, like roof tiles, allowing a smoother flow of water over the body and therefore reducing [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn = 978-1-118-92421-1| last1 = Ballard| first1 = Bonnie| last2 = Cheek| first2 = Ryan | title = Exotic Animal Medicine for the Veterinary Technician | date = 2 July 2016 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1_NDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT786&amp;dq=leptoid%20scale&amp;pg=PT786#v=onepage&amp;q=leptoid%20scale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They come in two forms:

*'''Cycloid scales''' have a smooth outer edge, and are most common on fish with soft fin rays, such as [[salmon]] and [[carp]].
*'''Ctenoid scales''' have a toothed outer edge, and are usually found on fish with spiny fin rays, such as [[Bass (fish)|bass]] and [[crappie]].

==Reptilian scales==
[[File:Gold Dust Day Gecko closeup hawaii edit 1.jpg|thumb|Brightly colored scales on a [[gold dust day gecko]]]]
{{main|Reptile scales}}

[[Reptile]] scale types include: cycloid, granular (which appear bumpy), and keeled (which have a center ridge). Scales usually vary in size, the stouter, larger scales cover parts that are often exposed to physical stress (usually the feet, tail and head), while scales are small around the joints for flexibility. Most snakes have extra broad scales on the belly, each scale covering the belly from side to side.

The scales of all reptiles have an epidermal component (what one sees on the surface), but many reptiles, such as [[crocodilian]]s and turtles, have [[osteoderm]]s underlying the epidermal scale. Such scales are more properly termed [[scute]]s. Snakes, [[tuatara]]s and many lizards lack osteoderms. All reptilian scales have a dermal papilla underlying the epidermal part, and it is there that the osteoderms, if present, would be formed.

==Avian scales==

Birds' scales are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. The scales and scutes of birds were thought to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to those of reptiles,&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Alfred M. |year=1972 |title=Avian Anatomy - integument |location=East Lansing, Michigan, USA |publisher=USDA Avian Anatomy Project, Michigan State University |pages=67, 344, 394–601}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now agreed to have evolved independently, being degenerate feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, X., Zhou, Z., Wang, X., Zhang, F., Zhang, X., Wang, Y., ... &amp; Xu, X.

==Mammalian scales==
An example of a scaled mammal is the [[pangolin]]. Its scales are made of keratin and are used for protection, similar to an [[armadillo]]'s armor. They have been convergently evolved, being unrelated to the animal's distant reptile ancestors, except that they use a similar gene.

On the other hand, the [[musky rat-kangaroo]], has scales on its feet and tail&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest-Australia.com&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030065952/http://rainforest-australia.com/rkangaroo.htm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The precise nature of its purported scales has not been studied in detail, but they appear to be structurally different from pangolin scales.

[[Anomalure]]s also have scales on their tail undersides.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, Theodore (1984). Macdonald, D., ed. The Encyclopedia of Mammals. New York: Facts on File. p. 632. {{ISBN|0-87196-871-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foot pad epidermal tissues in most mammal species have been compared to the scales of other vertebrates. They are likely derived from cornification processes or stunted fur much like avian reticulae are derived from stunted feathers.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ian Campbell Spearman, The Integument, CUP Archive, 28/06/1973 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthropod scales==
[[Butterflies]] and [[moth]]s - the order [[Lepidoptera]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] "scale-winged") - have membranous wings covered in delicate, powdery scales, which are modified [[setae]].  Each scale consists of a series of tiny stacked platelets of organic material, and butterflies tend to have the scales broad and flattened, while moths tend to have the scales narrower and more hair like.  Scales are usually [[pigment]]ed, but some types of scales are metallic, or iridescent, without pigments; because the thickness of the platelets is on the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] the plates lead to structural coloration and [[iridescence]] through the physical phenomenon described as [[thin-film optics]]. The most common color produced in this fashion is [[blue]], such as in the ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies. Other colors can be seen on the [[Chrysiridia rhipheus|sunset moth]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5396">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''s''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; theorem}}
In [[recursion theory|computability theory]] the '''''s''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; theorem''', (also called the '''translation lemma''', '''parameter theorem''', and the '''parameterization theorem''') is a basic result about [[programming language]]s (and, more generally, [[Gödel numbering]]s of the [[computable function]]s) (Soare 1987, Rogers 1967).  It was first proved by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] (1943). The name "s&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;" comes from the occurrence of a ''s'' with subscript ''n'' and superscript ''m'' in the original formulation of the theorem (see below).

In practical terms, the theorem says that for a given programming language and positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', there exists a particular [[algorithm]] that accepts as input the [[source code]] of a program with ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[free variables]], together with ''m'' values. This algorithm generates source code that effectively substitutes the values for the first ''m'' free variables, leaving the rest of the variables free.

==Details==

The basic form of the theorem applies to functions of two arguments (Nies 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6). Given a Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of recursive functions, there is a [[primitive recursive function]] ''s'' of two arguments with the following property: for every Gödel number ''p'' of a partial computable function ''f'' with two arguments, the expressions &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s(p,x)}(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; are defined for the same combinations of natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', and their values are equal for any such combination. In other words, the following [[extensional equality]] of functions holds for every ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s(p,x)} \simeq \lambda y.\varphi_p(x,y).\,&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any ''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists a primitive recursive function &lt;math&gt;s^m_n&lt;/math&gt; of ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 arguments that behaves as follows: for every Gödel number ''p'' of a partial computable function with ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' arguments, and all values of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{s^m_n (p,x_1,\dots,x_m)} \simeq \lambda y_1,\dots,y_n.\varphi_p(x_1,\dots,x_m,y_1,\dots,y_n).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''s'' described above can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;s^1_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal Statement==

For all arities &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;,

For every Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_x&lt;/math&gt; of arity &lt;math&gt;m + n&lt;/math&gt;, and for all possible values of inputs &lt;math&gt;y_1 \dots y_m&lt;/math&gt;,

there exists a Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_k&lt;/math&gt; of arity &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, such that

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z_1 \dots z_n  ~:~{\rm TM}_x(y_1 \dots y_m,~ z_1 \dots z_n) = {\rm TM}_k(z_1 \dots z_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, there is a Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; that allows &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be calculated from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;; it is denoted &lt;math&gt;k = s_n^m(x, y_1 \dots y_m)&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, the result generalizes to any Turing Complete computing model.

Informally, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; finds the Turing Machine &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_k&lt;/math&gt; which is the result of hardcoding the values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;{\rm TM}_x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
The following [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] code implements s&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; for Lisp.
&lt;source lang="lisp"&gt;
 (defun s11 (f x)
   (let ((y (gensym)))
     (list 'lambda (list y) (list f x y))))
&lt;/source&gt;
For example, {{code|lang=lisp|(s11 '(lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 3)}} evaluates to {{code|lang=lisp|(lambda (g42) ((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 3 g42))}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13014">'''Social physics''' or '''sociophysics''' is a field of science which uses mathematical tools inspired by [[physics]] to understand the behavior of human crowds. In a modern commercial use, it can also refer to the analysis of social phenomena with [[big data]].

Social physics is closely related to [[econophysics]] which uses physics methods to describe [[economics]].

==History==
The first elements of social physics were outlined in French social thinker [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]]’s first book, the 1803 ''Lettres d’un Habitant de Geneve'', which described the idea of describing society using laws similar to those of the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iggers|first=Georg G.|year=1959|title=Further Remarks about Early Uses of the Term "Social Science"|jstor=2708121|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=20|issue=3|pages=433–436|doi=10.2307/2708121}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student and collaborator was [[Auguste Comte]], a French philosopher widely regarded as the founder of [[sociology]], who first defined the term in an essay appearing in ''Le Producteur'', a journal project by Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Comte defined social physics as&lt;blockquote&gt;Social physics is that science which occupies itself with social phenomena, considered in the same light as astronomical, physical, chemical, and physiological phenomena, that is to say as being subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the special object of its researches. &lt;/blockquote&gt;After Saint-Simon and Comte, Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]], proposed that society be modeled using [[mathematical probability]] and [[social statistics]]. Quetelet's 1835 book, ''Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties'', outlines the project of a social physics characterized by measured variables that follow a [[normal distribution]], and collected data about many such variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sur+l%27homme+et+le+d%C3%A9veloppement+de+ses+facult%C3%A9s,+ou+Essai+de+physique+sociale&amp;ei=gAuuS_OPJZ7WMO2TvZcM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Sur l'homme et le Développement de ses Facultés, ou Essai de Physique Sociale|last=Quetelet|first=Adolphe|publisher=Imprimeur-Libraire|year=1835|isbn=|volume=1-2|location=Paris|pages=|language=French|trans-title=Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently repeated anecdote is that when Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term 'social physics', he found it necessary to invent a new term 'sociologie' (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet's collection of statistics.

There have been several “generations” of social physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=Arthur|year=1984|orig-year=Presented at Annual Conference of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC), Syracuse, May 1980|title=Contributions to a Physical Science for the Study of Civilizations|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Structures|volume=7|issue=3|pages=259–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation began with Saint-Simon, Comte, and Quetelet, and ended with the late 1800s with historian [[Henry Adams]]. In the middle of the 20th century, researchers such as the American astrophysicist [[John Q. Stewart]] and Swedish geographer [[Reino Ajo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contributions to "Social Physics": a Programme Sketch with Special Regard to National Planning|last=Ajo|first=Reino|publisher=Royal University of Lund|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the spatial distribution of social interactions could be described using gravity models. Physicists such as [[Arthur Iberall]] use a [[homeokinetics]] approach to study social systems as complex self-organizing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=A|year=1985|title=Outlining social physics for modern societies - locating culture, economics, and politics: The Enlightenment reconsidered|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=82|pages=5582–84|doi=10.1073/pnas.82.17.5582|pmc=390594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iberall|first1=A|last2=Hassler|first2=F|last3=Soodak|first3=H|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D|year=2000|title=Invitation to an Enterprise: From Physics to World History to Civilizations’ Study|journal=Comparative Civilization Review|volume=42|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a homeokinetics analysis of society shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Iberall| first=Arthur S.|title=Homeokinetics: The Basics|publisher=Strong Voices Publishing|year=2016|location=Medfield, MA|isbn=978-0-990-53614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been a large number of social science papers that use mathematics broadly similar to that of [[physics]], and described as “[[computational social science]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D., Pentland, A., et al ''Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, Adams separated “human physics” into the subsets of social physics or social mechanics (sociology of interactions using physics-like mathematical tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|year=2002|orig-year=A talk presented at ‘Horizons in Complex Systems’ Messina, Sicily, Italy, 2001|title=The physical modelling of society: a historical perspective|url=http://www.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/econofisica/intro/artigos/Physica.A.314.1.2002.pdf|journal=Physica A|volume=314|issue=1-4|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/s0378-4371(02)01042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social thermodynamics or sociophysics, (sociology described using mathematical invariances similar to those in [[thermodynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Alan|title=Notes on Some Concepts in Social Physics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x/abstract|journal=Regional Science|publisher=Regional Science Association International|volume=22|issue=1|pages=159–193|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy is roughly analogous to the difference between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].

==Recent work==
In modern use “social physics” refers to using “[[big data]]” analysis and the mathematical laws to understand the behavior of human crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GEORGE|first=Gerard|last2=HAAS|first2=Martine R.|last3=PENTLAND|first3=Alex|year=2014|title=Big Data and Management: From the Editors|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/4621/|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=57|issue=2|pages=321–326|doi=10.5465/amj.2014.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea is that data about human activity (e.g., phone call records, credit card purchases, taxi rides, web activity) contain mathematical patterns that are characteristic of how social interactions spread and converge. These mathematical invariances can then serve as a filter for analysis of behavior changes and for detecting emerging behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/predictive-analytics/|title=Predictive Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blockchain, Cryptography, and Social Physics Applications==
Over the past few years, Social Physics has been shown to be a potent analytics tool for a variety of applications where either data is anonymized or only metadata is available, as is typical of crytographic and [[blockchain]] systems. This is because Social Physics is primarily about interactions between elements, so that the form of the data is often irrelevant.  

Following are a few examples for the use of Social Physics applied to Blockchain and Crypto systems:
* Social Physics for Financial Interaction. In a recent MIT PhD [http://people.csail.mit.edu/pkrafft/papers/krafft-thesis-final.pdf Thesis], a social physics approach to [[cryptocurrency]] market buy/sell timing was shown to drive “bubbles” in [[AltCoin|AltCoins]]. In this experiment, carefully timed investments totaling just a few dollars often drove more than 5000 times increase in AltCoin market value.
* Social Physics for breaking cryptographic anonymization. A recent ruling of the US Supreme Court cited the use of Social Physics for the efficient re-identification of cryptographically anonymized metadata (similar to [[Bitcoin]] transactions), discouraging defense agencies and private companies from collecting and using this so-called "anonymized" data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre de|last2=Radaelli|first2=Laura|last3=Singh|first3=Vivek Kumar|last4=Pentland|first4=Alex “Sandy”|date=2015-01-30|title=Unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6221|pages=536–539|doi=10.1126/science.1256297|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25635097}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Social Physics for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Social Physics was used to uncover a collaborating network of bitcoin addresses, an arrangement often used to launder stolen Bitcoins. This was done using a handful of known malicious addresses, that were used as “seeds” for the Social Physics “behavioral similarity detection” algorithm, resulting in an accurate detection of dozens of additional members of the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003255394|title=New solutions for cybersecurity|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Shrobe, Howard E.,, Shrier, David L.,, Pentland, Alex, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780262535373|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|chapter=11|oclc=1003255394}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial use==


Most recently, research by [[Alex Pentland|Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland]] and [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Yaniv Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has combined social physics with [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] to improve the performance of machine learning applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/tuning-social-networks-gain-wisdom-crowd|title=Tuning Social Networks to Gain the Wisdom of the Crowd {{!}} MIT Media Lab|website=www.media.mit.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.endor.com Endor], a company co-founded by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Altshuler]], utilized social physics to introduce a predictive intelligence platform that automates the process of answering predictive business questions, using natural language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/endor-inventing-google-predictive-analytics-1220|title=Inventing the “Google” for predictive analytics|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A ICO of 50 million USD was also conducted by Endor.

In the field of [[cyber-security]], a team headed by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has shown how the concept of social physics, manifested as mathematical invariances that are embedded in large datasets, can be used in order to generate new and highly efficient types of attacks on behavioral information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altshuler|first=Yaniv|last2=Aharony|first2=Nadav|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|last5=Cebrian|first5=Manuel|year=2011|title=Stealing Reality: When Criminals Become Data Scientists (or Vice Versa)|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~yanival/IEEE_Intelligent_Systems.pdf|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociotechnology''' (short for "social technology") is the study of processes on the intersection of [[society]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Bunge1999"&gt;{{citation | last = Bunge | first = Mario | author-link = Mario Bunge | contribution = Sociotechnology | editor-last = Bunge | editor-first = Mario | editor-link = Mario Bunge | title = Social science under debate: a philosophical perspective | publisher = University of Toronto Press | location = Toronto, Ontario Buffalo, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780802083579 | page = 297 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MLjZzJLbpkC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vojinović and Abbott define it as "the study of processes in which the social and the technical are indivisibly combined".&lt;ref name="VojinovićAbbott2012-164"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Vojinović | first1 = Zoran | last2 = Abbott | first2 = Michael B. | title = Flood risk and social justice: from quantitative to qualitative flood risk assessment and mitigation | publisher = IWA Publishing | location = London | year = 2012 | page = 164 | isbn = 9781843393870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociotechnology is an important part of socio-technical design, which is defined as "designing things that participate in complex systems that have both social and technical aspects".&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radziwill|first1=Nicole|title=What is Sociotechnology?|url=https://qualityandinnovation.com/2009/01/19/what-is-sociotechnology/|website=Quality and Innovation|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been attributed to [[Mario Bunge]].&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Weingartner | first1 = Paul | last2 = Dorn | first2 = Georg J. W. | title = Studies on Mario Bunge's Treatise | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam Atlanta, Georgia | year = 1990 | page = 426 | isbn = 9789051831870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines it as a grouping of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[management science]].&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | author-link = David John Farmer | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | page = 95 | isbn = 9780817307844 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxDGwJq_FOoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees it thus as a form of technology, distinguished from other branches of it such as [[engineering]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[general technology]]. Its goal is to help engineer [[sociosystems]] and evaluate their performance, while making use of [[social science]] research.&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"/&gt; In short, sociotechnology can be seen as the creation, modification and maintenance of social systems.&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"/&gt;

Writing on sociotechnical change, [[Wiebe Bijker|Bijker]] wrote: "Society is not [[Technological determinism|determined by technology]], nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as two sides of the sociotechnical coin."&lt;ref name="Bijker1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bijker | first = Wiebe E. | author-link = Wiebe Bijker | title = Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: toward a theory of sociotechnical change | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | page = 274 | isbn = 9780262522274 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is the sum of ways in which social groups construct the material objects of their civilizations. The things made are socially constructed just as much as technically constructed. The merging of these two things, construction and insight, is sociotechnology. "For example, we typically build a bridge when there’s some expectation that people need to get from Point A to Point B, and there’s something they need to bypass along the way (e.g. a river, a canyon, another road). Failure to consider the social factors as well as the technical factors could lead to a "bridge to nowhere" – and we all know at least one person who’s had a problem with those"&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Business==

Business use "richness and reach". The richness and reach strategy has evolved with technology. Richness is the ability to understand the information being passed for example calling someone is less rich than face to face contact. Reach is the number of people who exchange the information. In the past it was easier to complete richness and reach, but now with new technologies like video chatting, it is easier for business to do fulfill both richness and reach. Positive economics is the study of existing (or historical) means of exchange- a social science such as sociology, history, and political sciences. Normative economics is the social technology because it attempts to create different kinds of economic arrangements.

==Community and technology==

Accelerating growth of technology is a major problem and cause of destabilization of a communicational world. [[Paul Virilio]] believes that the "real" is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence. [[Marshall McLuhan]] wrote about the extension of human senses and the nervous system into the world through electronic media. Essentially he believes that the mind, the self, and consciousness are made from already created technology, media, and language as opposed to create naturally like those who made technology, media, and language. The image of one’s self becomes aware of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling "attached" to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their "self" and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.

Lewis Mumford believed the world of relying on technology began with early human experiments in industrialization including coal mines because coal and iron built and powered industrialization. It has come to the point where communication is relied on technology. Conversation turned into talking through a machine (texting, phone calls, social media).

The difference between the past and present technology is the extent of social binding. The more social forces it binds together the more powerful the technology is. For example, the attack on the World Trade Center as opposed to the attack of Pearl Harbor. It took a year to see the film of the attack on the American battleships. Because of this, people were more unaware and it was less of a big deal than what 9-11 was. During the terrorist attack in 2001, everything was broadcast in the moment. People were seeing the destruction with their own eyes in the moment, causing more ridicule and passion for the situation.

==Robots replacing people==
{{Further|Technological unemployment|Social robot}}
Furbie and Tamagotchi are electronic toys made for children that make noises and demand for care. These toys caused children to form a companionship with robots instead of human beings. Paro is a robotic baby seal that was created in Japan to perform therapeutic functions. Paro had positive psychological results for those in nursing homes. A woman constantly argued with her son and turned to the Paro for comfort and confided in the Paro instead of fixing things with her son. Society has turned to demanding more intimacy from sociable robots then from each other. People that use the robots for comfort feel like they are being comforted by someone even though they are actually alone. These robotic characters cause people to have a relationship with technology while avoiding the trouble of human interaction.

==Social technology==

Science and technology are big contributions to the economic development, but can also lead to negative side effects as it evolves. For example, people care more about materialistic things than the negative influences they have created in human morals and education. For example, it is more important for people to know words to songs than to remember things for their test. There are other problems due to the development of new technologies such as the conservation of the environment because there is a demand for more products which leads to more destruction of environment to build more to sell from. Many social problems have appeared in society and cannot seem to be solved by natural science and technology alone. It requires the need for social sciences as well. Social technology is the strategy used to help solve the wrong behaviors in the world that are caused by social problems like how to solve the issue of people being invested in materialistic goods more than morals, so that they economy can still continue to grow, and society can be a better place.

[[File:Structural-steel-icons.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Various structural steel shapes]]

'''Structural steel''' is a category of [[steel]] used for making [[construction material]]s in a variety of shapes. Many structural steel [[shape]]s take the form of an elongated beam having a [[Profile (engineering)|profile]] of a specific [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. Structural steel shapes, sizes, [[Chemistry|chemical composition]], mechanical properties such as strengths, storage practices, etc., are regulated by [[Technical standard|standards]] in most industrialized countries. 

Most structural steel shapes, such as [[i-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]]s, have high [[Second moment of area|second moments of area]], which means they are very stiff in respect to their cross-sectional area and thus can support a high load without excessive sagging.

==Common structural shapes==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Meccano]] --&gt;
The shapes available are described in many published standards worldwide, and a number of specialist and proprietary cross sections are also available.

[[File:I-Beam 002.JPG|thumb|right|A steel {{ibeam}}-beam, in this case used to support timber joists in a house.]]
*[[I-beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]] ({{ibeam}}-shaped cross-section - in Britain these include Universal Beams (UB) and Universal Columns (UC); in Europe it includes the IPE, HE, HL, HD and other sections; in the US it includes Wide Flange (WF or W-Shape) and H sections)
*Z-Shape (half a flange in opposite directions)
*HSS-Shape ([[Hollow structural section]] also known as SHS (structural hollow section) and including [[square (geometry)|square]], [[rectangle|rectangular]], [[Circle|circular]] ([[pipe (material)|pipe]]) and [[ellipse|elliptical]] cross sections)
*Angle (L-shaped cross-section)
*[[Structural channel]], or C-beam, or C cross-section
*Tee (T-shaped cross-section)
*[[Rail profile]] (asymmetrical {{ibeam}}-beam)
**[[Rail tracks#Rail|Railway rail]]
**[[Vignoles rail]]
**[[Flanged T rail]]
**[[Tramway track#Grooved rail|Grooved rail]]
*Bar, a piece of [[metal]], rectangular cross sectioned (flat) and long, but not so wide so as to be called a [[Sheet metal|sheet]].
*Rod, a [[Circle|round]] or square and long piece of metal, see also [[rebar]] and [[dowel]].
*Plate, metal sheets thicker than 6&amp;nbsp;mm or {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;in.
*Open web steel [[joist]]

While many sections are made by [[Hot rolling|hot]] or [[Cold rolling|cold]] [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], others are made by [[welding]] together flat or bent plates (for example, the largest circular hollow sections are made from flat plate bent into a circle and seam-welded).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steel structure workshop|url=http://www.xgz1996.com/|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Misnomer holdouts}}
The terms ''angle iron'', ''channel iron'', and ''sheet iron'' have been in common use since before [[wrought iron]] was replaced by steel for commercial purposes. They have lived on after the era of commercial wrought iron and are still sometimes heard today, informally, in reference to steel angle stock, channel stock, and sheet, despite that they are [[misnomer]]s (compare "tin foil" still sometimes used informally for aluminum foil). In formal writing for metalworking contexts, accurate terms like ''angle stock'', ''channel stock'', and ''sheet'' are used.

==Standards==

===Standard structural steels (Europe)===
Most steels used throughout Europe are specified to comply with the [[European Committee for Standardization|European standard]] [[EN 10025]]. However, many national standards also remain in force.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Typical grades are described as 'S275J2' or 'S355K2W'. In these examples, 'S' denotes structural rather than engineering steel; 275 or 355 denotes the [[yield strength]] in newtons per square millimetre or the equivalent [[megapascal]]s; J2 or K2 denotes the materials [[toughness]] by reference to [[Charpy impact test]] values; and the 'W' denotes [[Cor-ten|weathering steel]]. Further letters can be used to designate fine grain steel ('N' or 'NL'); [[quench|quenched and tempered]] steel ('Q' or 'QL'); and thermomechanically rolled steel ('M' or 'ML').

&lt;br&gt;1. S275JOH Specification
S275JOH is steel grade in EN 10219 specification, EN 10210 standard. And the most widely used specification is EN10219 standard, which is Cold formed welded structural hollow sections of non-alloy and fine grain steels. 
&lt;br&gt;EN10219-1 specifies the technical delivery conditions for cold formed welded structural hollow sections of circular, square or rectangular forms and applies to structural hollow sections formed cold without subsequent heat treatment.
&lt;br&gt;Requirements for S275JOH pipe tolerances, dimensions and sectional s275 pipe properties are contained in EN 10219-2.
&lt;br&gt;2. S275JOH Steel Pipes manufacture Process
&lt;br&gt;The steel manufacturing process shall be at the discretion of the steel producer. S275JOH carbon steel pipes can be made in ERW, SAW or seamless process. All S275JOH steel material and S275JOH pipes should conform to EN10219 standards.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN10219 S275JOH Carbon Steel Pipe|url=http://www.hysteelpipe.com/en10219-structural-pipe/s275joh-carbon-steel-pipe/|website=CHINA HYSP PIPE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The normal yield strength grades available are 195, 235, 275, 355, 420, and 460, although some grades are more commonly used than others e.g. in the UK, almost all structural steel is grades S275 and S355. Higher grades are available in quenched and tempered material (500, 550, 620, 690, 890 and 960 - although grades above 690 receive little if any use in construction at present).

A set of [[Euronorm]]s define the shape of a set of standard structural profiles:
* European I-beam: IPE - [[Euronorm 19-57]]
* European I-beam: IPN - [[DIN 1025-1]]
* European flange beams: HE - [[Euronorm 53-62]]
* European channels: UPN - DIN 1026-1
* European cold formed IS [[IS 800-1]]

===Standard structural steels (USA)===
Steels used for building construction in the US use standard alloys identified and specified by [[ASTM International]].  These steels have an alloy identification beginning with '''A''' and then two, three, or four numbers.  The four-number [[AISI steel grades]] commonly used for mechanical engineering, machines, and vehicles are a completely different specification series.

The standard commonly used structural steels are:&lt;ref&gt;Manual of Steel Construction, 8th Edition, 2nd revised printing, American Institute of Steel Construction, 1987, ch 1 page 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===CE marking===

The concept of [[CE marking]] for all construction products and steel products is introduced by the [[Construction Products Directive|Construction Products Directive (CPD)]]. The CPD is a [[EU Directive|European Directive]] that ensures the free movement of all construction products within the European Union.

Because steel components are "safety critical", CE Marking is not allowed unless the [[Factory Production Control|Factory Production Control (FPC)]] system under which they are produced has been assessed by a suitable certification body that has been approved to the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;The website of the British Constructional Steelwork Association Ltd. - SteelConstruction.org:CE-Marking.08/02/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[steel]] products such as sections, bolts and fabricated steelwork the CE Marking demonstrates that the product complies with the relevant harmonized standard.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the CE Marking of Structural Steelwork, BCSA Publication No. 46/08. p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

For steel structures the main harmonized standards are:
* Steel sections and plate - EN 10025-1
* Hollow sections - EN 10219-1 and EN 10210-1
* Pre-loadable bolts - EN 14399-1
* Non-preloadable bolts - EN 15048-1
* Fabricated steel - [[EN 1090]] -1

The standard that covers CE Marking of structural steelwork is [[EN 1090]]-1. The standard has come into force in late 2010. After a transition period of two years, CE Marking will become mandatory in most European Countries sometime early in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/construction_real_estate/building_materials/manufacturer_certification_en1090/manufacturer_certification_en1090.jsp?null Manufacturer Certification in Compliance with EN 1090], 09.08.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The official end date of the transition period is July 1, 2014.

==Steel vs. concrete==

===Choosing the ideal structural material===
{{textbook|section=y|date=June 2018}}

Most construction projects require the use of hundreds of different materials. These range from concrete of all different specifications, structural steel of different specifications, clay, mortar, ceramics, wood, etc. In terms of a load bearing structural frame, they will generally consist of structural steel, [[concrete]], [[masonry]], and/or wood, using a suitable combination of each to produce an efficient structure. Most commercial and industrial structures are primarily constructed using either structural steel or [[reinforced concrete]]. When designing a structure, an engineer must decide which, if not both, material is most suitable for the design. There are many factors considered when choosing a construction material. Cost is commonly the controlling element; however, other considerations such as weight, strength, constructability, availability, sustainability, and fire resistance will be taken into account before a final decision is made.

*Cost - The cost of these construction materials will depend entirely on the geographical location of the project and the availability of the materials. Just as the price of gasoline fluctuates, so do the prices of cement, aggregate, steel, etc. Reinforced concrete derives about half of its construction costs from the required form-work. This refers to the lumber necessary to build the "box" or container in which the concrete is poured and held until it cures. The expense of the forms makes [[precast concrete]] a popular option for designers due to the reduced costs and time.&lt;ref name="Levitt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=M.|title=Precast Concrete|isbn=978-0-85334-994-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that steel is sold by weight it is the responsibility of the structural designer to specify the lightest members possible while still maintaining a safe structural design. An additional method of reducing expenditures in design is to use many of the same size steel members as opposed to many unique members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popescu|first=Calin|title=Estimating Building Costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Strength/weight ratio - Construction materials are commonly categorized by their strength to weight ratio, or [[specific strength]]. This is defined as the strength of a material over its density. This gives an engineer an indication as to how useful the material is in comparison to its weight, with the weight being a direct indication of its cost (typically) and ease of construction. Concrete is typically ten times stronger in compression than in tension, giving it a higher strength to weight ratio in compression, only.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Structural Engineering|year=1997|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2674-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sustainability - Many construction companies and material vendors are making changes to be a more environmentally friendly company. [[Sustainability]] has become an entirely new consideration for materials that are to be placed into the environment for generations of time. A sustainable material will be one that has minimal effect on the environment, both at the time of installation as well as throughout the life cycle of the material. Reinforced concrete and structural steel both have the ability to be a sustainable construction option, if used properly. Over 80% of structural steel members fabricated today come from recycled metals, called A992 steel. This member material is cheaper, as well as having a higher strength to weight ratio, than previously used steel members (A36 grade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaharia|first=Raul|title=Designing Steel Structures for Fire Safety|isbn=978-0-415-54828-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforced concrete can also be a very sustainable option. Concrete's material components are naturally occurring materials that are not harmful to the environment. Also, concrete can now be poured to be permeable, allowing the flow of water through a paved surface and therefore reducing the necessary infrastructural construction that causes further potential disturbance to the environment. Concrete can also be crushed and used as aggregate in future concrete applications, meaning it doesn't necessarily have to be used as a land fill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russ|first=Tom|title=Sustainability and Design Ethics|isbn=978-1-4398-0854-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fire resistance - One of the most dangerous hazards to a building is a fire hazard. This is especially true in dry, windy climates and for structures constructed using wood. Special considerations must be taken into account with structural steel to ensure it is not under a dangerous fire hazard condition. Reinforced concrete characteristically does not pose a threat in the event of fire and even resists the spreading of fire, as well as temperature changes. This makes concrete an excellent insulation, improving the sustainability of the building it surrounds by reducing the required energy to maintain climate.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt;
*Corrosion - When choosing a structural material, it is important to consider the life cycle of the building. Some materials are susceptible to corrosion from their surrounding elements, such as water, heat, humidity, or salt. Special considerations must be taken into account during the installation of a structural material to prevent any potential corrosion hazards. This must also be made clear to the occupants of the building because there may or may not be a necessary maintenance requirement to prevent corrosion. For example, structural steel cannot be exposed to the environment because any moisture, or other contact with water, will cause it to rust. When the steel rusts it compromises the structural integrity of the building and poses a potential danger to the residual or surrounding occupants.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt;

===Reinforced concrete===
*Characteristics - Generally consisting of [[portland cement]], water, [[construction aggregate]] (coarse and fine), and steel reinforcing bars ([[rebar]]), concrete is cheaper in comparison to structural steel. 
*Strength - Concrete is a composite material with relatively high compressive strength properties, but lacking in [[tensile]] strength/ductility. This inherently makes concrete a useful material for carrying the weight of a structure. Concrete reinforced with steel rebar give the structure a stronger tensile capacity, as well as an increase in [[ductility]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].
*Constructability - Reinforced concrete must be poured and left to set, or harden. After setting (typically 1–2 days), a concrete must cure, the process in which concrete experiences a chemical reaction between the cementitious particles and the water. The curing process is complete after 28 days; however, construction may continue after 1–2 weeks, depending on the nature of the structure. Concrete can be constructed into nearly any shape and size. Approximately half of the cost of using reinforced concrete in a structural project is attributed to the construction of the form-work. In order to save time, and therefore costs, structural concrete members may be pre-cast. This refers to a reinforced concrete beam, girder, or column being poured off site and left to cure. After the curing process, the concrete member may be delivered to the construction site and installed as soon as it is needed. Since the concrete member was cured off location beforehand, construction may continue immediately after erection.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; 
*Fire resistance - Concrete has excellent fire resistance properties, requiring no additional construction costs to adhere to the [[International Building Code]] (IBC) [[fire protection]] standards. However, concrete buildings will still likely use other materials that are not fire resistant. Therefore, a designer must still take into account the use of the concrete and where it will require fire hazardous materials in order to prevent future complications in the overall design.
*Corrosion - Reinforced concrete, when constructed properly, has excellent corrosion resistance properties. Concrete is not only resistant to water, but needs it to cure and develop its strength over time. However, the steel reinforcement in the concrete must not be exposed in order to prevent its corrosion as this could significantly reduce the ultimate strength of the structure. The [[American Concrete Institute]] provides the necessary design specifications for an engineer to ensure there is enough concrete covering any steel reinforcement to prevent exposure to water. This cover distance must be specified because concrete will inevitable crack at locations carrying tension, or locations containing reinforcing bars for the purpose of carrying said tension. If the concrete cracks, it provides a path for water to travel directly to the reinforcing bars.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; Some reinforcing bars are coated in epoxy as a second order measure of preventing corrosion due to water contact. This method induces higher costs on the overall project, however, due to the higher cost of the epoxy coated bars. Also, when using epoxy coated bars, reinforced concrete members must be designed larger, as well as stronger, in order to balance the loss of friction between the reinforcing bars and concrete. This friction is referred to as bond strength, and it is vital to the structural integrity of a concrete member.&lt;ref name="Levitt"/&gt;

===Structural steel===
*Characteristics - Structural steel differs from concrete in its attributed compressive strength as well as tensile strength.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; 
*Strength - Having high strength, stiffness, toughness, and ductile properties, structural steel is one of the most commonly used materials in commercial and industrial building construction.&lt;ref name="Chen 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chen|first=Wai-Fah|title=Principles of Structural Design|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8493-7235-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Constructability - Structural steel can be developed into nearly any shape, which are either bolted or welded together in construction. Structural steel can be erected as soon as the materials are delivered on site, whereas concrete must be cured at least 1–2 weeks after pouring before construction can continue, making steel a schedule-friendly construction material.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; 
*Fire resistance - Steel is inherently a noncombustible material. However,when heated to temperatures seen in a fire scenario, the strength and stiffness of the material is significantly reduced. The International Building Code requires steel be enveloped in sufficient fire-resistant materials, increasing overall cost of steel structure buildings.&lt;ref name="Chen 2005"/&gt;
*Corrosion - Steel, when in contact with water, can corrode, creating a potentially dangerous structure. Measures must be taken in structural steel construction to prevent any lifetime corrosion. The steel can be painted, providing water resistance. Also, the fire resistance material used to envelope steel is commonly water resistant.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; 
*Mold - Steel provides a less suitable surface environment for mold to grow than wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.absoluterv.com/help-and-resources/steel_building_benefits/properties-prevention-household-mold/ | title=Properties and Prevention of Household Mold | publisher=Absolute Steel | date=7 March 2014 | accessdate=2 November 2014 | author=Armstrong, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest structures today (commonly called "[[skyscrapers]]" or [[high-rise]]) are constructed using structural steel due to its constructability, as well as its high strength-to-weight ratio.  In comparison, concrete, while being less dense than steel, has a much lower strength-to-weight ratio.  This is due to the much larger volume required for a structural concrete member to support the same load; steel, though denser, does not require as much material to carry a load.  However, this advantage becomes insignificant for [[low-rise]] buildings, or those with several stories or less. Low-rise buildings distribute much smaller loads than [[high-rise]] structures, making concrete the economical choice.  This is especially true for simple structures, such as parking garages, or any building that is a simple, rectilinear shape.&lt;ref name="Taranath"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taranath|first=Bungale|title=Reinforced Concrete Design of Tall Buildings|isbn=978-1-4398-0480-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural steel and reinforced concrete are not always chosen solely because they are the most ideal material for the structure. Companies rely on the ability to turn a profit for any construction project, as do the designers. The price of raw materials (steel, cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, lumber for form-work, etc.) is constantly changing. If a structure could be constructed using either material, the cheapest of the two will likely control. Another significant variable is the location of the project. The closest steel fabrication facility may be much further from the construction site than the nearest concrete supplier. The high cost of energy and transportation will control the selection of the material as well. All of these costs will be taken into consideration before the conceptual design of a construction project is begun.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt;

===Combining steel and reinforced concrete===
Structures consisting of both materials utilize the benefits of structural steel and reinforced concrete. This is already common practice in reinforced concrete in that the steel reinforcement is used to provide steel's tensile strength capacity to a structural concrete member. A commonly seen example would be parking garages. Some parking garages are constructed using structural steel columns and reinforced concrete slabs. The concrete will be poured for the foundational footings, giving the parking garage a surface to be built on. The steel columns will be connected to the slab by bolting and/or welding them to steel studs extruding from the surface of the poured concrete slab. Pre-cast concrete beams may be delivered on site to be installed for the second floor, after which a concrete slab may be poured for the pavement area. This can be done for multiple stories.&lt;ref name="Taranath"/&gt; A parking garage of this type is just one possible example of many structures that may use both reinforced concrete and structural steel.

A structural engineer understands that there are an infinite number of designs that will produce an efficient, safe, and affordable building. It is the engineer's job to work alongside the owner(s), contractor(s), and all other parties involved to produce an ideal product that suits everyone's needs.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Structural Engineering"/&gt; When choosing the structural materials for their structure, the engineer has many variables to consider, such as the cost, strength/weight ratio, sustainability of the material, constructability, etc.

==Thermal properties==
The properties of steel vary widely, depending on its alloying elements.

The austenizing temperature, the temperature where a steel transforms to an [[austenite]] crystal structure, for steel starts at {{convert|900|°C|°F}} for pure iron, then, as more carbon is added, the temperature falls to a minimum {{convert|724|°C|°F}} for [[eutectic]] steel (steel with only .83% by weight of carbon in it). As 2.1% carbon (by [[mass]]) is approached, the austenizing temperature climbs back up, to {{convert|1130|°C|°F}}.  Similarly, the melting point of steel changes based on the alloy.

The lowest temperature at which a plain carbon steel can begin to melt, its [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], is {{convert|1130|°C|°F}}. Steel never turns into a liquid below this temperature. Pure Iron ('Steel' with 0% Carbon) starts to melt at {{convert|1492|°C|°F}}, and is completely liquid upon reaching {{convert|1539|°C|°F}}. Steel with 2.1% Carbon by weight begins melting at {{convert|1130|°C|°F}}, and is completely molten upon reaching {{convert|1315|°C|°F}}.  'Steel' with more than 2.1% Carbon is no longer Steel, but is known as [[Cast iron]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/images/FeC.gif&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire resistance==
[[File:Owsj deck fireproofing.jpg|thumb|Metal deck and open web steel joist receiving spray fireproofing plaster, made of [[polystyrene]]-leavened [[gypsum]].]]

Steel loses strength when heated sufficiently. The ''critical temperature'' of a steel member is the temperature at which it cannot safely support its load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://steelfabservices.com.au/what-is-structural-steel/|title=What Is Structural Steel? - Steel Fabrication Services|date=2016-04-21|newspaper=Steel Fabrication Services|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building codes and structural engineering standard practice defines different critical temperatures depending on the structural element type, configuration, orientation, and loading characteristics. The critical temperature is often considered the temperature at which its [[yield stress]] has been reduced to 60% of the room temperature yield stress.&lt;ref name="Industrial fire protection engineering"&gt;Industrial fire protection engineering, Robert G. Zalosh, copyright 2003 pg.58&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine the fire resistance rating of a steel member, accepted calculations practice can be used,&lt;ref&gt;Zalosh, Pg. 70&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[fire test]] can be performed, the critical temperature of which is set by the standard accepted to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, such as a building code. In Japan, this is below 400&amp;nbsp;°C{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. In China, Europe and North America (e.g., ASTM E-119), this is approximately 1000–1300&amp;nbsp;°F&lt;ref&gt;Zalosh, Table 3.3&lt;/ref&gt; (530-810&amp;nbsp;°C). The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the test standard determines the duration of the [[fire-resistance rating]].
Heat transfer to the steel can be slowed by the use of [[fireproofing materials]], thus limiting steel temperature. Common fireproofing methods for structural steel include [[intumescent]], endothermic, and plaster coatings as well as drywall, calcium silicate cladding, and mineral wool insulating blankets.&lt;ref name="NIST TN1681"&gt;Best Practice Guidelines for Structural Fire Resistance Design of Concrete and Steel Buildings, NIST Technical Note 1681, L. T. Phan, J. L. Gross, and T. P. McAllister, 2010. [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.1681 (View report)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete building structures often meet code required fire-resistance ratings, as the concrete thickness over the steel rebar provides sufficient fire resistance. However, concrete can be subject to [[spalling]], particularly if it has an elevated moisture content. Although additional fireproofing is not often applied to concrete building structures, it is sometimes used in traffic tunnels and locations where a [[hydrocarbon]] fuel fire is more likely, as flammable liquid fires provides more heat to the structural element as compared to a fire involving ordinary combustibles during the same fire period. Structural steel fireproofing materials include intumescent, [[endothermic]] and plaster coatings as well as [[drywall]], [[calcium silicate]] cladding, and mineral or high temperature insulation wool blankets. Attention is given to connections, as the [[thermal expansion]] of structural elements can compromise fire-resistance rated assemblies.

==Manufacturing==

Cutting workpieces to length is usually done with a [[bandsaw]].

A beam drill line (drill line) has long been considered an indispensable way to drill holes and mill slots into beams, channels and HSS elements. CNC beam drill lines are typically equipped with feed conveyors and position sensors to move the element into position for drilling, plus probing capability to determine the precise location where the hole or slot is to be cut.

For cutting irregular openings or non-uniform ends on dimensional (non-plate) elements, a cutting torch is typically used. [[Oxy-fuel]] torches are the most common technology and range from simple hand-held torches to automated CNC coping machines that move the torch head around the structural element in accordance with cutting instructions programmed into the machine.

Fabricating flat plate is performed on a plate processing center where the plate is laid flat on a stationary 'table' and different cutting heads traverse the plate from a gantry-style arm or "bridge". The cutting heads can include a punch, drill or torch.

'''''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils''''' ({{lang-de|The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice}}) is a standard work of Germanophone research into [[homophobia]], written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]], and first published in 1978.

== Background ==

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete ''Tabu Homosexualität: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils'' (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word ''Tabu'' from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], and [[Michel Foucault]], she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.

== Content ==

=== Introducing chapters ===

In the prefacing ''Einführung'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.

In order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, ''Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen'' ("Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong [[numinous]] taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative ''in themselves''.

Only three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] in the third volume of his ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' mentioned a tribe of ''Karmans'' among whom "lewdness between men ''[...]'', as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by [[Posidonius]], quoted in [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', on [[Celts|Celtic]] sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.

The third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ''ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames'' ("cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted") by proto-historic [[Germanic peoples|Germanics]] as mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.

=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.

Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:

*The Stone Age ''Subarctic Shamanic Culture'' of the [[last glacial period]] (called ''Würm'' regarding the Alps region, ''Weichsel'' regarding Scandinavia, and ''Devensian'' regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,
*the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' of European and Middle East [[Bronze Age]], introducing farming and practicing [[fertility rite|fertility cults]] including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's ''"[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]"''),
*and the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see [[Bronze Age collapse]], [[Kurgan hypothesis]], and [[Æsir-Vanir War#Theories]]), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European [[Iron Age]] in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Not all subsequent Indo-European or Indo-European-influenced cultures adopted or retained Indo-European languages. For instance, Semitic cultures never adopted an Indo-European language in spite of the obvious belligerent, sensually repressive Indo-European influence found in Abrahamitic and Semitic cultures. See Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1990 work ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'' based in this respect mainly on [[:de:Reinhard Schmoeckel|Reinhard Schmoeckel]]'s ''Indogermanistik'' research.&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Three-age system]]. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the [[trifunctional hypothesis]] by [[Georges Dumézil]], of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] and what Gimbutas saw as "[[Old European culture|Old Europe]]", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See [[Proto-Indo-European society]] for details.

The immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting [[religious stratification]] emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility [[Vanir]] and belligerent, patriarchal [[Æsir]] religion, with the mythological [[Æsir-Vanir War]] as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of [[The Rape of the Sabine Women]] in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.

=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:

*'''Chapter IV, ''Interdependenzen zwischen religiösen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen'' ("Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture"):''' Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic ''[[Níð|nithing]]'' creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the ''nithing'' are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.
*'''Chapter V, ''Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen'' ("Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics"), section 1, ''Die römische Gesetzgebung'' ("Roman laws"):''' Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt'', only emphasizing in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' and later works that [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]] does not meet her primary focus for ''Tabu Homosexualität'' of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, [[Kenneth Dover]]).
*'''Chapter V, section 2, ''Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen'' ("Ecclesiastical regulations"):''' Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture ([[Leviticus 18]]) and in Early Christianity ([[Saint Paul]], early [[Church Fathers]], and [[penitential]]s) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common ''Sodom myth'' created by Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that [[Genesis 19]] would in any way relate to same-sex activities.
*'''Chapter V, section 3, ''Die gefälschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita'' ("The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita"):''' The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of ''[[sodomy]]'' brought forth by the forged ''[[Benedictus Levita|Capitularia Benedicti Levitae]]'' within ''[[Pseudo-Isidore]]'' (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by [[Franks|Frankish]] monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized ''Maternal Megalith Culture'' stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd ''seid'' magic of a ''nithing'' in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's ''Sodom myth'', Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the ''Capitularia Benedicti Levitae'' obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of ''sodomy'' with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning ''nithings'' into ecclesiastical law as burning ''sodomites'' and ''witches'' alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.
*'''Chapter VI, ''Die Pönalisierung der Homosexualität im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters'' ("The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials"):''' How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on ''sodomites'' and ''witches''.
*'''Chapter VII, ''Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualität bis 1870'' ("Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870"):''' Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of ''[[moral insanity]]''), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.
*'''Chapter VIII, ''Beeinträchtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegenüber der männlichen Homosexualität durch das Vorurteil selbst'' ("Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself"):''' Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general ''Vorurteilsforschung'' (''prejudice studies'') in her later work ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===

In ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''[[Angst und Vorurteil]]'' (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western [[colonialism]] when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|Age of Conquests]] on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of [[syphilis]] through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.

These processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over "uncivilized", sensual, and "filthy" "savages" (see for instance the saying of the ''[[White man's burden]]'' of being morally obliged to "civilize" non-Westerners), social and ethnic "aliens", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (''Tabu Homosexualität'', ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and ''Angst und Vorurteil'') Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' by [[Hannah Arendt]], Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'', Critical Theory's ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' and ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'', or ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' by [[Norbert Elias]].

Finally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in ''Angst und Vorurteil'', just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|scientific Enlightenment]] approach to sexuality, the impact of [[HIV]] corrupted [[Counterculture of the 1960s|post-WWII progressive counterculture]]'s influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.

'''Technological unemployment''' is the loss of jobs caused by [[technological change]]. Such change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving "mechanical-muscle" machines or more efficient "mechanical-mind" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].

That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase "technological unemployment" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a "only a temporary phase of maladjustment".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.

Prior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term "[[Luddite]] fallacy" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.

The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.

In the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide. Oxford Professors [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=114|pages=254–280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625|last1=Frey|first1=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brink-jobless-future|title=Are we on the brink of a jobless future?|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acting-man.com/?p=32134|title=In the Future, Will Everyone Be Unemployed?|date=4 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/15/news/economy/zero-unemployment/|title=What 0% unemployment looks like|first=Annalyn|last=Censky|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/|title=A World Without Work|first=Derek|last=Thompson|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist [[Gene Sperling]] and management professor [[Andrew McAfee]] on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a "significant issue".&lt;ref name="Dreyfuss_2017-03-24"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dreyfuss |first=Emily |date=2017-03-24 |title=Hate to break it to Steve Mnuchin, but AI’s already taking jobs |journal=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hate-break-steve-mnuchin-ais-already-taking-jobs/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary [[Steve Mnuchin]] that automation is not "going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years", says McAfee, "I don't talk to anyone in the field who believes that."&lt;ref name="Dreyfuss_2017-03-24"/&gt; Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other "mental jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/business/economy/a-future-without-jobs-two-views-of-the-changing-work-force.html|title=A Future Without Jobs?

The [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Report]] 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues within the debates==

===Long term effects on employment===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=There are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.|source=Lawrence Summers&lt;ref name="summers" /&gt;|quoted=1}}

All participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation.  Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sympathy"/&gt; For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment "appears to be a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|url=|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies, but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment  has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effective Demand"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt; In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.&lt;ref name = "sympathy"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "replicants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation effects===
[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]
Compensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which "compensate" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled "compensation theory" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation effects include: 
# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)
# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)
#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)
# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.
# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)

The "by new machines" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt; Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the "by new products" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant [[spillover effect]] than we have anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moretti|first=Enrico|date=May 2010|title=Local Multipliers|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goos|first=Maarten|last2=Konings|first2=Jozef|last3=Vandeweyer|first3=Marieke|date=September 2015|title=Employment Growth in Europe: The Roles of Innovation, Local Job Multipliers and Institutions.|url=|journal=Tjalling C. Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Advance"/&gt; However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.

===The Luddite fallacy===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]&lt;ref name="Tabarrok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;|quoted=1}}
The term "Luddite fallacy" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.&lt;ref name = "sympathy"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the "easy" work, (2) the definition of what is "easy" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond "easy" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.

===Skill levels and technological unemployment===
A common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F. Katz]], this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled.  While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs.&lt;ref name = "relative"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Technical Change and the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor: The United States in Historical Perspective |first=Lawrence F. |last=Katz |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |title=Human Capital in History: The American Record |editor-last=Boustan |editor2-last=Frydman |editor3-last=Margo |year=2014 |doi=10.3386/w18752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "polarization"&gt;

Some recent studies however, such as a 2015 paper by Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels, found that at least in the area they studied – the impact of industrial robots – innovation is boosting pay for highly skilled workers while having a more negative impact on those with low to medium skills.&lt;ref name="GGG" /&gt; A 2015 report by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], Michael Osborne and [[Citi Investment Research &amp; Analysis|Citi Research]], agreed that innovation had been disruptive mostly to middle-skilled jobs, yet predicted that in the next ten years the impact of automation would fall most heavily on those with low skills.&lt;ref name = "OM2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoff Colvin]] at [[Forbes]] argued that predictions on the kind of work a computer will never be able to do have proven inaccurate. A better approach to anticipate the skills on which humans will provide value would be to find out activities where we will insist that humans remain accountable for important decisions, such as with judges, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], bus drivers and government leaders, or where human nature can only be satisfied by deep interpersonal connections, even if those tasks could be automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Humans are underrated|url = http://fortune.com/2015/07/23/humans-are-underrated/|website = Fortune|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, others see even skilled human laborers being obsolete. Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerization could make nearly half of jobs redundant; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/15/robot-doctors-online-lawyers-automated-architects-future-professions-jobs-technology|author=Tom Meltzer|publisher=Wired|date=June 15, 2014|title=Robot doctors online lawyers automated architects: the future of the professions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 702 professions assessed, they found a strong correlation between education and income with ability to be automated, with office jobs and service work being some of the more at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization?|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Vinod Khosla]] predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/doctors-or-algorithms/|author=Vonod Khosla|publisher=Tech Crunch|title=Do We Need Doctors or Algorithms?|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical findings ===
There has been a lot of empirical research that attempts to quantify the impact of technological unemployment, mostly done at the microeconomic level. Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210–220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255–283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors.There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978 1 85898 166 6|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures of technological innovation ===
There have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A. Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249–271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead? Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations Revisited|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1379–1399|doi=10.1016/j.jmoneco.2004.08.009|citeseerx=10.1.1.198.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second approach is from Susanto Basu, John Fernald and Miles Kimball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basu|first=Susanto|last2=Fernald|first2=John|last3=Kimball|first3=Miles|date=2006|title=Are Technology Improvements Contractionary?|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=96|issue=5|pages=1418–48|doi=10.1257/aer.96.5.1418|citeseerx=10.1.1.202.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create a measure of aggregate technology change with augmented [[Solow residual]]s, controlling for aggregate, non-technological effects such as non-constant returns and imperfect competition.

The third method, initially developed by John Shea in 1999, takes a more direct approach and employs observable indicators such as Research and Development (R&amp;D) spending, and number of patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shea|first=John|date=1998|title=What Do Technology Shocks Do?|url=|journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual|volume=13|pages=275–322|doi=10.1086/ma.13.4623748}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure of technological innovation is very widely used in empirical research, since it does not rely on the assumption that only technology affects long-run productivity, and fairly accurately captures the output variation based on input variation. However, there are limitations with direct measures such as R&amp;D. For example, since R&amp;D only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, R&amp;D fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service, and bringing it to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|last2=Cohen|first2=Jon|date=2011|title=Volumes of evidence: examining technical change in the last century through a new lens.|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|volume=44|issue=2|pages=413–450|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5982.2011.01639.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth approach, constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos, looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress, which turns out to be consistent with R&amp;D expenditure data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|date=2011|title=Read All about It!!

===Pre-16th century===
[[File:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]], who refused a low-cost method of transport of heavy goods that would put laborers out of work.]]
According to author Gregory Woirol, the phenomenon of technological unemployment is likely to have existed since at least the invention of the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour. [[Ancient China]] and [[ancient Egypt]] may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to technological unemployment dating back to at least the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name="reflief"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Hebrews]] and adherents of the [[Hindus|ancient Vedic religion]] had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths.&lt;ref name="reflief"/&gt; In [[ancient Greece]], large numbers of free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of [[Ancient Greek technology|ancient labour saving technology]] and to competition from slaves ("machines of flesh and blood"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= p2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Sometimes, these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts. [[Pericles]] responded to perceived technological unemployment by launching [[public works]] programmes to provide paid work to the jobless. Conservatives criticized Pericle's programmes for wasting public money but were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= pp24 -30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest example of a scholar discussing the phenomenon of technological unemployment occurs with Aristotle, who speculated in Book One of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' that if machines could become sufficiently advanced, there would be no more need for human labour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Greeks, [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], responded to the problem of technological unemployment by relieving poverty with handouts. Several hundred thousand families were sometimes supported like this at once.&lt;ref name="reflief"/&gt; Less often, jobs were directly created with [[public works]] programmes, such as those launched by the [[Gracchi]]. Various emperors even went as far as to refuse or ban labour saving innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1993|loc= chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc=  ''passim'', see esp. pp. 49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, the introduction of a labor-saving invention was blocked, when Emperor [[Vespasian]] refused to allow a new method of low-cost transportation of heavy goods, saying  "You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread."&lt;ref&gt;See book eight, chapt XVIII of Suetonius's [[The Twelve Caesars]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Labour shortages began to develop in the Roman empire towards the end of the second century AD, and from this point mass unemployment in Europe appears to have largely receded for over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= pp147 -150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and early [[The Renaissance|renaissance period]] saw the widespread adoption of newly invented technologies as well as older ones which had been conceived yet barely used in the Classical era.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mass unemployment began to reappear in Europe in the 15th century, partly as a result of population growth, and partly due to changes in the availability of land for subsistence farming caused by [[Tudor Enclosures|early enclosures]].&lt;ref name="Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the threat of unemployment, there was less tolerance for disruptive new technologies. European authorities would often side with groups representing subsections of the working population, such as [[Guilds]], banning new technologies and sometimes even executing those who tried to promote or trade in them.&lt;ref&gt;On occasion these executions were carried out with methods normally reserved for only the worst criminals, for example on a single occasion in the south of France, 58 people were broken on the [[Breaking wheel|Catherine wheel]] for selling forbidden goods.

In Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] – Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

Especially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long term problem.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6"/&gt;

===19th century===
It was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.&lt;/ref&gt; While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],&lt;ref name="Sowell_2006"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.&lt;ref&gt;While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  "on Machinery",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]&lt;/ref&gt; As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.&lt;/ref&gt; and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]
For the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war – World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the 1930s, this study was 
''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. It should be noted that some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities – e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) – say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12"/&gt;

As the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In this potential society, 20% of the working age population will be enough to keep the world economy going. The authors describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents from September 27 – October 1, 1995 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, the term "one-fifth-society" arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one-fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the closing decades of the 20th century saw much more concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, compared with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For the most part, other than during the periods of intense debate in the 1930s and 60s,  the consensus in the 20th century among both professional economists and the general public remained that technology does not cause long-term joblessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of their 2011 book [[Race Against The Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy|Race Against The Machine]], [[MIT]] professors [[Andrew McAfee]] and [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] have been prominent among those raising concern about technological unemployment.

Concern about technological unemployment grew in 2013 due in part to a number of studies predicting substantially increased technological unemployment in forthcoming decades and empirical evidence that, in certain sectors, employment is falling worldwide despite rising output, thus discounting globalization and offshoring as the only causes of increasing unemployment.&lt;ref name = "replicants"&gt;{{Cite news

Concerns have included evidence showing worldwide falls in employment across sectors such as manufacturing; falls in pay for low and medium skilled workers stretching back several decades even as productivity continues to rise; the increase in often precarious [[Uberisation|platform mediated]] employment; and the occurrence of "jobless recoveries" after recent recessions. The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research and even low level journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.&lt;ref name = "replicants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard economics professor [[Lawrence Summers]] stated in 2014 that he no longer believed automation would always create new jobs and that "This isn't some hypothetical future possibility. This is something that's emerging before us right now." Summers noted that already, more labor sectors were losing jobs than creating new ones.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other recent statements by Summers include warnings on the  "devastating consequences" for those who perform routine tasks arising from robots, 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies. In his view, "already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead."  Summers has also said that  "[T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. [...] [T]here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever. [...] If current trends continue, it could well be that a generation from now a quarter of middle-aged men will be out of work at any given moment."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summers"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lawrence H.

Other economists, however, have argued that long-term technological unemployment is unlikely. In 2014, Pew Research canvassed 1,896 technology professionals and economists and found a split of opinion: 48% of respondents believed that new technologies would displace more jobs than they would create by the year 2025, while 52% maintained that they would not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Aaron|last2=Anderson|first2=Janna|title=AI, Robotics, and the Future of Jobs|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 August 2014|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economics professor Bruce Chapman from [[Australian National University]] has advised that studies such as Frey and Osborne's tend to overstate the probability of future job losses, as they don't account for new employment likely to be created, due to technology, in what are currently unknown areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

General public surveys have often found an expectation that automation would impact jobs widely, but not the jobs held by those particular people surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17089904/ai-job-loss-automation-survey-gallup|title=Most Americans think artificial intelligence will destroy other people’s jobs, not theirs|website=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Studies====
A number of studies have predicted that automation will take a large proportion of jobs in the future, but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary. Research by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne of the [[Oxford Martin School]] showed that employees engaged in "tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms" are at risk of displacement. The study, published in 2013, shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low-paying occupations; however, low-paid physical occupations are most at risk. It estimated that 47% of US jobs were at high risk of automation.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; In 2014, the economic think tank [[Bruegel (institution)|Bruegel]] released a study, based on the Frey and Osborne approach, claiming that across the [[European Union]]'s 28 member states, 54% of jobs were at risk of automation. The countries where jobs were least vulnerable to automation were [[Sweden]], with 46.69% of jobs vulnerable, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at 47.17%, the [[Netherlands]] at 49.50%, and [[France]] and [[Denmark]], both at 49.54%. The countries where jobs were found to be most vulnerable were [[Romania]] at 61.93%, [[Portugal]] at 58.94%, [[Croatia]] at 57.9%, and [[Bulgaria]] at 56.56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/social-europe-jobs/news/more-than-50-of-eu-jobs-at-risk-of-computerisation/|title=More than 50% of EU jobs at risk of computerisation|date=22 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/over-half-of-jobs-in-the-eu-at-risk-2014-7|title=Over Half Of EU Jobs Could Be Replaced By Computers|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report by the Taub Center found that 41% of jobs in [[Israel]] were at risk of being automated within the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taubcenter.org.il/wp-content/files_mf/occupationsatriskenglish.pdf |title=Info |website=taubcenter.org.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, a joint study by the [[Oxford Martin School]] and [[Citibank]], based on previous studies on automation and data from the [[World Bank]], found that the risk of automation in developing countries was much higher than in developed countries. It found that 77% of jobs in [[China]], 69% of jobs in [[India]], 85% of jobs in [[Ethiopia]], and 55% of jobs in [[Uzbekistan]] were at risk of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/201601_Technology_at_Work_2|title=Impact of automation on developing countries puts up to 85% of jobs at risk|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank similarly employed the methodology of [[Carl Benedikt Frey|Frey]] and Osborne. A 2016 study by the [[International Labour Organization]] found 74% of salaried jobs in [[Thailand]], 75% of salaried jobs in [[Vietnam]], 63% of salaried jobs in [[Indonesia]], and 81% of salaried jobs in the [[Philippines]] were at high risk of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/dialogue/actemp/downloads/publications/2016/asean_in_transf_2016_r1_techn.pdf|title=Bureau for Employers' Activities (ACTEMP)|first1=Bureau for Employers' Activities|last1=4|first2=route des Morillons Genève 22|last2=Switzerl|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 [[United Nations]] report stated that 75% of jobs in the developing world were at risk of automation, and predicted that more jobs might be lost when corporations stop [[outsourcing]] to developing countries after automation in industrialized countries makes it less lucrative to outsource to countries with lower labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://futurism.com/un-report-robots-will-replace-two-thirds-of-all-workers-in-the-developing-world/|title=UN Report: Robots Will Replace Two-Thirds of All Workers in the Developing World|date=11 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Economic Advisers]], a US government agency tasked with providing economic research for the White House, in the 2016 [[Economic Report of the President]], used the data from the Frey and Osborne study to estimate that 83% of jobs with an hourly wage below $20, 31% of jobs with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and 4% of jobs with an hourly wage above $40 were at risk of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-robots-are-coming-for-jobs-that-pay-20-an-hour-or-less-white-house-finds-2016-02-22|title=The robots are coming for jobs that pay $20 an hour or less, White House finds|first=Steve|last=Goldstein|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study by [[Ryerson University]] found that 42% of jobs in [[Canada]] were at risk of automation, dividing them into two categories - "high risk" jobs and "low risk" jobs. High risk jobs were mainly lower-income jobs that required lower education levels than average. Low risk jobs were on average more skilled positions. The report found a 70% chance that high risk jobs and a 30% chance that low risk jobs would be affected by automation in the next 10–20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/automation-job-brookfield-1.3636253|title=Automation could put 4 in 10 Canadian jobs at high risk in future, study says|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] found that up to 38% of jobs in the US, 35% of jobs in [[Germany]], 30% of jobs in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and 21% of jobs in [[Japan]] were at high risk of being automated by the early 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/941163/pwc-study-automation-risk-is-higher-for-american-jobs-than-for-workers-in-germany-the-uk-and-japan/|title=Why American jobs are more at risk of automation than jobs in Germany or the UK|first=Eshe|last=Nelson|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study by [[Ball State University]] found about half of American jobs were at risk of automation, many of them low-income jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/half-of-american-jobs-are-at-risk-from-automation-new-study-suggests.html|title=Half of American jobs are at risk from automation, new study suggests|first=Nick|last=Wells|date=19 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2017 report by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] found that as of 2015, 478 billion out of 749 billion working hours per year dedicated to manufacturing, or $2.7 trillion out of $5.1 trillion in labor, were already automatable. In low-skill areas, 82% of labor in apparel goods, 80% of agriculture processing, 76% of food manufacturing, and 60% of beverage manufacturing were subject to automation. In mid-skill areas, 72% of basic materials production and 70% of furniture manufacturing was automatable.

However, not all recent empirical studies have found evidence to support the idea that automation will cause widespread unemployment. A study released in 2015, examining the impact of industrial robots in 17 countries between 1993 and 2007, found no overall reduction in employment was caused by the robots, and that there was a slight increase in overall wages.&lt;ref name = "GGG"&gt;{{cite web

It is not clear however why a job should be more or less automatise just because it is performed by a woman. In 2017, [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] estimated that automation would result in a net loss of about 7% of jobs in the US by 2027, replacing 17% of jobs while creating new jobs equivalent to 10% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/Forrester+Predicts+Automation+Will+Displace+247+Million+Jobs+And+Add+149+Million+Jobs+By+2027/-/E-PRE9745|title=Forrester : Marketing : Forrester Predicts Automation Will Displace 24.7 Million Jobs And Add 14.9 Million Jobs By 2027|website=www.forrester.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study argued that the risk of US jobs to automation had been overestimated due to factors such as the heterogeneity of tasks within occupations and the adaptability of jobs being neglected. The study found that once this was taken into account, the number of occupations at risk to automation in the US drops, ceteris paribus, from 38% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;Arntz, Melanie; Gregory, Terry; Zierahn, Ulrich [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318108672_Revisiting_the_Risk_of_Automation "Revisiting the Risk of Automation"], accessed 06/11/2017&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study on the effect of automation on Germany found no evidence that automation caused total job losses but that they do effect the jobs people are employed in; losses in the industrial sector due to automation were offset by gains in the service sector. Manufacturing workers were also not at risk from automation and were in fact more likely to remain employed, though not necessarily doing the same tasks. However, automation did result in a decrease in labour's income share as it raised productivity but not wages.&lt;ref&gt;Dauth, Wolfgang; Findeisen, Sebastian; Suedekum, Jens; Woessner, Nicole [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3039031 "German Robots - The Impact of Industrial Robots on Workers"], accessed 06/11/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[Brookings Institution]] study that analyzed 28 industries in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2018 found that automation was responsible for holding down wages. Although it concluded that automation did not reduce the overall number of jobs available and even increased them, it found that from the 1970s to the 2010s, it had reduced the share of human labor in the value added to the work, and thus had helped to slow wage growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/is-automation-labor-displacing-productivity-growth-employment-and-the-labor-share/|title=Is automation labor-displacing?

====Policy====
In 2017, [[South Korea]] became the most automated country on earth with one robot for every 19 employed humans.

===Preventing net job losses===

====Banning/refusing innovation====
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|right|thumb|"What I object to, is the craze for machinery, not machinery as such. The craze is for what they call labour-saving machinery. Men go on 'saving labour', till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation." — [[Gandhi]], 1924.&lt;ref&gt;For a small collection of quotes by Gandhi relating to his view that innovation should be slowed while unemployment exists see [http://www.mkgandhi.org/voiceoftruth/machinery.htm The place of machines]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, innovations were sometimes banned due to concerns about their impact on employment. Since the development of modern economics, however, this option has generally not even been considered as a solution, at least not for the advanced economies. Even commentators who are pessimistic about long-term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society, with JS Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment.&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"/&gt;

[[Gandhian economics]] called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated, however this advice was largely rejected by [[Nehru]] who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence. The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was however implemented in the 20th century within China under  [[Mao]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;

====Shorter working hours====
In 1870, the average American worker clocked up about 75 hours per week. Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week, and the fall was similar in other advanced economies. According to [[Wassily Leontief]], this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment. The reduction in working hours helped share out available work, and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure, as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay.&lt;ref name = "Advance"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including [[John R. Commons]], Lord Keynes and [[Luigi Pasinetti]]. Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value [[workmanship|engaging in work for its own sake]].  Generally, 20th-century economists had argued against further reductions as a solution to unemployment, saying it reflects a [[Lump of labour fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Public works====
Programmes of [[public works]] have traditionally been used as way for governments to directly boost employment, though this has often been opposed by some, but not all, conservatives. [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], although generally associated with free market economics, advised that public works could be a solution to technological unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baumol|2000|loc= p465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as professor Mathew Forstater, have advised that public works and guaranteed jobs in the public sector may be the ideal solution to technological unemployment, as unlike welfare or guaranteed income schemes they provide people with the social recognition and meaningful engagement that comes with work.&lt;ref name = "unemployment history"&gt;

For [[Less developed country|less developed economies]], public works may be an easier to administrate solution compared to universal welfare programmes.&lt;ref name = "Advance"/&gt; As of 2015, calls for public works in the advanced economies have been less frequent even from progressives, due to concerns about [[sovereign debt]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. A partial exception is for spending on infrastructure, which has been recommended as a solution to technological unemployment even by economists previously associated with a neoliberal agenda, such as [[Larry Summers]].&lt;ref name = "Inclusive"&gt;

====Education====
Improved availability to quality education, including skills training for adults and other [[active labour market policies]], is a solution that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum, and welcomed even by those who are optimistic about long-term technological employment. Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry.

Proponents of this brand of policy assert higher level, more specialized learning is a way to capitalize from the growing technology industry. Leading technology research university MIT published an [http://digital.mit.edu/openletter/pprecommendations.html open letter] to policymakers advocating for the "reinvention of education", namely a shift "away from rote learning" and towards [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.mit.edu/openletter/pprecommendations.html|title=Policy Recommendations|website=digital.mit.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar statements released by the U.S President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ([[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|PACST]]) have also been used to support this STEM emphasis on enrollment choice in higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aip.org/fyi/2012/presidents-council-advisors-science-and-technology-release-report-outlining-undergraduate|title=President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Release Report Outlining Undergraduate Education Initiative|date=2014-06-02|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education reform is also a part of the U.K government's "Industrial Strategy", a plan announcing the nation's intent to invest millions into a "technical education system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-foundations/industrial-strategy-the-5-foundations#people|title=Industrial Strategy: the 5 foundations - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal includes the establishment of a retraining program for workers who wish to adapt their skill-sets. These suggestions combat the concerns over [[automation]] through policy choices aiming to meet the emerging needs of society via updated information. Of the professionals within the academic community who applaud such moves, often noted is a gap between economic security and formal education &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/33193.htm|title=Fall 2007|work=NEA|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a disparity exacerbated by the rising demand for specialized skills—and education's potential to reduce it.

However, several academics have also argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment, pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills, and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills.&lt;ref name="relative" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polarization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reversal" /&gt;  [[K. A. Taipale|Kim Taipale]] has said that "''The era of bell curve distributions that supported a bulging social middle class is over... Education per se is not going to make up the difference.''"&lt;ref name="Power-curve"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; while an op-ed piece from 2011, [[Paul Krugman]], an economics professor and columnist for the New York Times, argued that better education would be an insufficient solution to technological unemployment, as it "''actually reduces the demand for highly educated workers''".&lt;ref name="Degrees"&gt;{{cite news

===Living with technological unemployment===

====Welfare payments====
The use of various forms of subsidies has often been accepted as a solution to technological unemployment even by conservatives and by those who are optimistic about the long term effect on jobs.  Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established, compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works.  Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"/&gt;

=====Basic income=====
{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}
Several commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative. People advocating some form of basic income as a solution to technological unemployment include Martin Ford, 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc = ''passim'', see esp. pp. 158–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Brynjolfsson]],&lt;ref name="control"/&gt;  [[Robert Reich]] and   [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]].  Reich has gone as far as to say the introduction of a basic income, perhaps implemented as a [[negative income tax]] is "almost inevitable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Standing has said he considers that a basic income is becoming "politically essential".&lt;ref name="paypressure"&gt;{{cite web

Since late 2015, new basic income pilots have been announced in Finland, the Netherlands, and Canada. Further recent advocacy for basic income has arisen from a number of technology entrepreneurs, the most prominent being [[Sam Altman]], president of [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Skepticism about basic income includes both [[left–right politics|right and left]] elements, and proposals for different forms of it have come from all segments of the spectrum. For example, while the best-known proposed forms (with taxation and distribution) are usually thought of as left-leaning ideas that right-leaning people try to defend against, other forms have been proposed even by [[libertarianism|libertarians]], such as [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]. Republican president [[Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of 1969, which had much in common with basic income, passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but was defeated in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name="Nixon1978"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nixon | first = Richard | year = 1978 | title = RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon | publisher = Grosset &amp; Dunlap | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-448-14374-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One objection to basic income is that it could be a [[incentivisation|disincentive to work]], but evidence from older [[Basic income pilots|pilots]] in India, Africa, and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low-level [[entrepreneurship]] and more productive, collaborative work. Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.&lt;ref name="paypressure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MITRotman"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

To better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who "cannot be fired", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ)]] as part of "a Just Third Way" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,&lt;ref name="Capital_Homestead_Act"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Center for Economic  |author2=Social Justice  |lastauthoramp=yes |authorlink=Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ) |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is reminiscent of [[James S. Albus]]'s Peoples' Capitalism&lt;ref name="peoplescapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peoplescap"/&gt; in that [[money creation]] and [[security (finance)|securities ownership]] are widely and directly distributed to individuals rather than flowing through, or being concentrated in, centralized or elite mechanisms.

====Broadening the ownership of technological assets====
Several solutions have been proposed which do not fall easily into the traditional [[left–right politics|left-right political spectrum]]. This includes broadening the ownership of  robots and other productive capital assets. Enlarging the ownership of technologies has been advocated by people including [[James S. Albus]]&lt;ref name="peoplescapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.james-albus.org |title=Dr. James Albus |publisher=James-albus.org |date = | accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lanchester|Lanchester, John]] (March 2015).

[[Jaron Lanier]] has proposed a somewhat similar solution: a mechanism where ordinary people receive "[[micropayment|nano payments]]" for the [[big data]] they generate by their regular surfing and other aspects of their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;

====Structural changes towards a post-scarcity economy====
{{main|Post-scarcity economy}}
[[The Zeitgeist Movement]] (TZM), [[The Venus Project]] (TVP) as well as various individuals and organizations&lt;!--name them here! If you're unsure add them here: Peter Diamandis, Cory Doctorow, ...--&gt; propose [[structural change]]s towards a form of a [[post-scarcity economy]] in which people are 'freed' from their automatable, monotonous jobs, instead of 'losing' their jobs. In the system proposed by TZM all jobs are either automated, abolished for bringing no true value for society (such as ordinary [[advertising]]), rationalized by more [[Efficiency|efficient]], [[sustainable]] and [[openness|open]] processes and collaboration or carried out based on [[altruism]] and social relevance (see also: [[Whuffie]]), opposed to compulsion or monetary gain.&lt;ref name=tzm1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Zeitgeist Movement FAQ #5 - 2) Automation of Labor|url=http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/FAQ#faq5|accessdate=4 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq#faq5|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feuer|first1=Alan|title=Peter Joseph and Jacque Fresco Critique the Monetary Economy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/nyregion/17zeitgeist.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zeitgeist Movement Defined: Realizing a New Train of Thought|url=http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/uploads/upload/file/19/The_Zeitgeist_Movement_Defined_PDF_Final.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Alex|title=Awaiting Interreflections: Peter Joseph's Highly Anticipated New Film Series Inches Towards its 2016 Release|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-simon/awaiting-interreflections_b_7628680.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Travis|title=The Zeitgeist Movement: Envisioning A Sustainable Future|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-walter-donovan/the-zeitgeist-movement-en_b_501517.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also speculates that the free time made available to people will permit a renaissance of creativity, invention, community and social capital as well as reducing stress.&lt;ref name=tzm1/&gt;

===Other approaches===
The threat of technological unemployment has occasionally been used by free market economists as a justification for supply side reforms, to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers. Conversely, it has also been used as a reason to justify an increase in employee protection.&lt;ref name="Effective Demand"&gt;

Economists including [[Larry Summers]] have advised a package of measures may be needed. He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the "myriad devices" – such as tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage – which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring "great social contributions" in return. Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in "excessive" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.&lt;ref name="summers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="inequalityPuzzle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|author=Victoria Turk|date=2014-06-19|publisher=Vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them "will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Spence also wrote that "Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors – think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling." Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is "easy to imagine" that production may become "extremely" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. "Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world." Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor’s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46229">A '''two-child policy''' is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in [[Vietnam]]. In [[British Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been implemented in China, replacing the country's previous [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url=

During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The colloquial term "births per woman" is usually formalized as the ''[[Total Fertility Rate]]'' (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)

As China's youngest generation (born under the [[one-child policy]], which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-07-10/154513416121.shtml | language=Chinese | accessdate=7 November 2008 | date=10 July 2007 | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=计生委新闻发言人:11%以上人口可生两个孩子 (English: "Spokesperson of the one-child policy committee: 11% or more of the population may have two children)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news |title=China's 'one-child' rethink marks symbolic shift |author=Patti Waldmeir |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7bed3f70-4dfa-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0.html |newspaper=FT |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Y. | title = China relaxes its one-child policy | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62544-1 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9907 | pages = e28–e30 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-07/10/content_17706811.htm|title=Most Chinese provincial areas relax one-child policy - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|first=|last=杨洁|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Xinhua]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the overall [[fertility rate]] of mainland China is, in fact, closer to two children per family than to one child per family (1.8). In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern [[Xinjiang]] were allowed to have two children. This, along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] fertility, was seen as attempt to counter the threat of [[Xinjiang conflict|Uyghur separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The government in Xinjiang is trying to limit Muslim births|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21678007-government-xinjiang-trying-limit-muslim-births-remote-control|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2015, [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] reported the change in the existing law to a two-child policy citing a statement from the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= China to end one-child policy and allow two |work= BBC |date= 29 October 2015 |url=

In 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180223131904.htm|title=China's two-child policy may exacerbate gender inequality|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations from females to bear more children and to abandon their careers.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21736574-two-child-rule-still-applies-officials-know-more-babies-are-needed-not-fewer-china|title=China is in a muddle over population policy|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016. Chinese women gave birth to 17.2 million babies in 2016, but declined by 3.5% in 2017.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Husbands still have greater marital power, thus increasing fertility pressure on their female counterpart.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The dynamic of relationships (amount of "power" held by each parent), and the amount of resources each parent has contributes to the struggle for dominance.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qian|first=Yue|last2=Jin|first2=Yongai|date=2018-02-21|title=Women's Fertility Autonomy in Urban China: The Role of Couple Dynamics Under the Universal Two-Child Policy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323327889|journal=Chinese Sociological Review|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1–35|doi=10.1080/21620555.2018.1428895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources would be items such as income, and health insurance. Dominance would be described as who has the final say in pregnancy, who has to resign in their career for maternal/parental leave. However, females have shown interest in a second child if the first child did not possess the desired gender.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Chinese couples have also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2018-03-12/no-easing-of-two-child-policy-official-says-101220222.html|title=No Easing of Two-Child Policy, Official Says - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In [[British Hong Kong]], the Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became [[The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"&gt;[http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about/history.asp History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327235233/http://www.famplan.org.hk/fpahk/en/template1.asp?style=template1.asp&amp;content=about%2Fhistory.asp |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization provides family planning advice, [[sex education]], and [[birth control]] services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the "Two is Enough" campaign,&lt;ref name="famplan.org.hk"/&gt; which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organization&lt;ref name="ippf.org"&gt;[http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm History of International Planned Parenthood Federation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813091603/http://www.ippf.org/en/About/History.htm |date=2009-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]], with its counterparts in seven other countries.&lt;ref name="ippf.org"/&gt;
The [[total fertility rate]] in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.
Although the "Two is Enough" campaign found widespread approval, it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families. Tax allowances of 100,000 HK$ per child can be claimed for up to 9 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amount of Allowance for the Latest 7 years|url=https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/taxes/salaries/allowances/allowances/7years.htm|website=GovHK|publisher=The Government of Hong Kong|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, parents who have fallen into hardship can apply for special assistance from the state.

==Iran==
Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting [[family planning in Iran]] from early 1990s to late 2006. Iran's government "declared that Islam favored families with only two children", as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184&lt;/ref&gt; When the family planning program was initiated, Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.&lt;ref name="sciolino"&gt;Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors : the Elusive Face of Iran'', Free Press, 2000, 2005 (p.282)&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting in 2006, the government's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran's existing policy of "two children is enough"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stimson.org/swa/pdf/Iran_DemBrief1.pdf Prospects for Ahmadinejad’s Call for More Rapid Population Growth in Iran] {{cite news

In [[Singapore]], the two-child policy until the 1980s was called "Stop at Two".

==United Kingdom==
In July 2007, the [[think tank]] Optimum Population Trust (now [[Population Matters]]) advocated what the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' described as a "'two-child' policy" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom.  The article stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Firth|first=Niall|title=Families should have no more than two children - thinktank|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-467728/Families-children--thinktank.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2012, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramesh|first=Randeep|title=Two-child benefits policy targets the strivers in low-paid jobs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/25/iain-duncan-smith-two-child-policy|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been fronted by the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] and former leader of the Conservative Party [[Iain Duncan Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=What is Iain Duncan Smith's two-child policy?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/what-is-iain-duncan-smiths-twochild-policy-8227368.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, [[David Cameron]] denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, [[George Osborne]], the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Asa|title=Tax credits: what are they, who claims them, and why is everyone so angry about the cuts?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11951056/Tax-credits-what-are-they-who-claims-them-and-why-is-everyone-so-angry-about-the-cuts.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families  making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born.

The two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the "rape clause", has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the [[rape]] of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex – and giving the child’s name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Peter||last2=Butler|first2=Patrick|title=Government under fire over new child tax credit form for rape victims |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/06/government-under-fire-over-new-child-tax-credit-form-for-victims|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 April 2017|location=London|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rustin|first1=Susanna|title=The ‘rape rule’ for tax credits tramples the rights of children it’s meant to protect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/17/rape-rule-tax-credits-rights-children-sex-crime|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A coalition of the U.K.’s largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on children’s rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=Ruth|title=This Cruel New U.K. Policy Punishes Women for Having More Than Two Children 378 69 618|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/04/10/the_u_k_two_child_tax_credit_policy_is_nonsensical_and_cruel.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=Slate|date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===

From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into [[North and South Vietnam]] along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. [[North Vietnam]] became the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and had a communist government, whereas [[South Vietnam]] became the [[Republic of Vietnam]] and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langguth|first1=A.J.|title=Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975|date=March 12, 2002|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1231-1|page=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population.&lt;ref name="Population Council Daniel Goodkind" /&gt; Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and [[India]], the government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knudsen|first1=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|date=June 30, 2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5|pages=139–168|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade.&lt;ref name="Fertility Family Planning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allman|first1=James|last2=Vu|first2=Qui Nhan|last3=Nguyen|first3=Minh Thang|last4=Pham|first4=Bich San|title=Fertility and Family Planning in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=September 1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=308–317|doi=10.2307/1966685|jstor=1966685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viet Nam|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/vietnam.doc|website=United Nations|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning.&lt;ref name="UN Viet Nam" /&gt;

In 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (''[[Đổi Mới]]'') Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards.&lt;ref name="History Doi Moi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=Donald|title=Doi Moi Policy and the Small-Enterprise Boom in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam|journal=Geographical Review|date=April 1996|volume=86|issue=2|pages=178–197|doi=10.2307/215955|jstor=215955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruun|first1=Ole|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Michael|title=Human Rights and Asian Values: Contesting National Identities and Cultural Representations in Asia|date=2 September 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1212-0|pages=161–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, [[Government of Vietnam|Council of Ministers]] issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=Mar 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=Ministers&amp;#93;|first1=&amp;#91;Council of}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's [[one-child policy]] was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later,&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men),&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; and spacing out birth of children (3–5 years apart).&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as [[intrauterine device|intrauterine loops]], [[condoms]], and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt; Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers.&lt;ref name="Policy 1989" /&gt;

In 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family "so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life."&lt;ref name="Harvard 1993 Resolution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution of 1993 on Policy Concerning the Population and Family Planning Work|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/VIETNAM2.htm|website=Hanoi Voice of Vietnam Network|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with "historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives," encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Asian Values" /&gt; The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1&lt;ref name="World Resources Institute"/&gt; by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth.&lt;ref name="World Policy Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=May|first1=John F.|title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact|date=March 30, 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2836-3|pages=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; According to the ordinance, couples "shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births."&lt;ref name="Population 2003"&gt;{{citation|title=Population Ordinance (6/2003)|website=The Standing Committee of National Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that "to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country." However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

In 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births.&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinance No. 08/2008|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/policies/poppolicy.htm|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015. However, there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law.&lt;ref name="New Population Law 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pham|first1=Bang Nguyen|title=The Demographic Transition and Implications for the New Law on Population in Vietnam|journal=Asian Population Studies|date=2014|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1080/17441730.2014.955162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
The organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from "Initiation in the 1960s–1970s; Maturity in the 1980s–1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s–2010s",&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt; the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984–2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003–2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

Although the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview"/&gt; Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for "good realization of the population – family planning program".&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt; The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Rights Overview" /&gt;

===Current status===

Currently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that "each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government."&lt;ref name="Population Ordinance 2008 Amend" /&gt; Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Trương Tấn San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.&lt;ref name="Princeton Population" /&gt;

===Effects of this policy===

====Reduction of the birthrate====
The total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|title=Falling Fertility in Vietnam|journal=Population Studies: A Journal of Demography|date=1997|volume=51|issue=2|pages=203–211|doi=10.1080/0032472031000149916}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one demographic model, the [[fertility#Bongaarts' model of components of fertility|Bongaarts' model of components of fertility]], high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8.&lt;ref name="Falling Fertility" /&gt;

However, the reported findings differ depending on the [[fertility]] model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific]] found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy" /&gt; In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization [[Population Reference Bureau]], the number found was lower at 2.3.&lt;ref name=PRB&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of Population and Development in Vietnam|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2003/AnOverviewofPopulationandDevelopmentinVietnam.aspx|website=Population Reference Bureau|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi,&lt;ref name="Vietnam Families"&gt;{{citation|last1=Nhi|first1=Tran Xuan|title=Vietnam's families|publisher=Worldwide State of the Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; found a contrasting finding that the [[total fertility rate]] only dropped slightly and the size of [[nuclear families]] experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994.&lt;ref name="Changing Policy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisensale|first1=Steven|title=Family Policy in a Changing Vietnam|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|date=2000|volume=31|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex-based differences====

There is evidence that [[son preference]] exists in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Son Preference"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haughton|first1=Jonathan|last2=Haughton|first2=Dominique|title=Son Preference in Vietnam|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=1995|volume=26|issue=6|pages=325–337|doi=10.2307/2138098|jstor=2138098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guilmoto|first1=Christophe Z.|title=Son Preference, Sex Selection, and Kinship in Vietnam|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 2012|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–54|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00471.x|pmid=22833863}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt; There were also increased rates of "contraceptive failure" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line.&lt;ref name="Son Preference" /&gt;

Despite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity" /&gt; On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent.&lt;ref name="Son Pref Sex Selection" /&gt; However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm.&lt;ref name="No Sex Disparity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belanger|first1=Daniele|last2=Khuat|first2=Thi Hai Oanh|last3=Liu|first3=Jianye|last4=Le|first4=Thanh Thuy|last5=Pham|first5=Viet Thanh|title=Are Sex Ratios at Birth Increasing in Vietnam?|journal=Population|date=2003|volume=58|issue=2|pages=231–250|doi=10.2307/3246604|jstor=3246604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism===

====Inadequate contraceptives====
Although the policy states that "the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,"&lt;ref name=JPRS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|doi=10.2307/1973424 |journal=Population and Development Review|date=February 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169–172|jstor=1973424 |last1=Ministers&amp;#93; |first1=&amp;#91;Council of }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD.&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=S.|title=In Vietnam, Contraceptive Awareness High, Use Low Despite Two-Child Policy|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1992|volume=18|issue=3|pages=117–119|doi=10.2307/2133412|jstor=2133412}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness.&lt;ref name="Abortion IUD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Annika|last2=Le|first2=Thi Nham Tuyet|last3=Nguyen|first3=Lap|last4=Kajsa|first4=Sundstrom|title=Abortion in Context: Women's Experience in Two Villages in Thai Binh Province, Vietnam|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives|date=September 1996|volume=22|issue=3|pages=103–107|doi=10.2307/2950750|jstor=2950750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that "contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program."&lt;ref name="Contraceptive Need Modern" /&gt;

====Increased abortion====
Abortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodkind|first1=Daniel|title=Abortion in Vietnam: Measurements, Puzzles, and Concerns|journal=Studies in Family Planning|date=December 1994|volume=25|issue=6|pages=342–352|doi=10.2307/2137878|jstor=2137878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates.&lt;ref name="Abortion Overview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Thanh Binh|title=Abortion in Present Day Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences|date=January 2012|volume=2|issue=1|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrea|title=Abortion in Asia: Local Dilemmas, Global Politics|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-795-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006,&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ngo|first1=Thoai D.|last2=Keogh|first2=Sarah|last3=Nguyen|first3=Thang H.|last4=Le|first4=Hoan T.|last5=Pham|first5=Kiet H. T.|last6=Nguyen|first6=Yen B.T.|title=Risk factors for repeat abortion and implications for addressing unintended pregnancy in Vietnam|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=125|issue=3|pages=241–246|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2013.11.014|pmid=24726618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt; Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services.&lt;ref name="Abortion Goodkind" /&gt; Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families.&lt;ref name="Abortion Book" /&gt; Thus, experts have suggested providing more diverse, long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Repeat Abortion Factors" /&gt;

The '''University of Panama''' ({{lang-es|Universidad de Panamá}}) was founded on October 7, 1935, with a student body of 175 in the fields of Education, Commerce, Natural Sciences, Pharmacy, Pre-Engineering and Law. {{As of|2008}}, it maintains a student body of 74,059 distributed in 228 buildings around the country.

The University of Panama was founded  under the administration of the President of the Republic, Dr. [[Harmodio Arias Madrid]]. Its founder and first President was the distinguished citizen Dr. [[Octavio Méndez Pereira]].
The University of Panama is a state institution of superior, independent education, inspired by the highest civic, moral, and ethical values.

==History==

The University of Panama was created by presidential decree on May 29, 1935. However, it began operations on October 7 of the same year in one of the wings of the Instituto Nacional (National Institute). Later on, under the administration of [[Enrique Adolfo Jiménez|Enrique A. Jiménez]], the government purchased around 60 hectares of land in the neighborhood of El Cangrejo, destined to be the future University's main campus.

The construction work began in January, 1948, under the supervision of the Engineer Alberto De Saint Malo, who was the Dean of the Engineering and Architecture Faculty at the time. The first four buildings to be constructed were those that would be home to Humanities, Engineering and Architecture, Science Laboratories, and Administration and Library. Classes in the new buildings began on May 29, 1950. However, the campus was officially inaugurated on November 1, 1953, the same year of the Republic's 50th Anniversary of Independence. In the 1950s, the construction work continued and 11 additional buildings were raised, some of which would hold the Biochemistry Center, and the Faculties of Pharmacy, and Public Administration and Commerce. In the following decade, 15 more buildings were constructed, among of which figure the Odontology and Law Faculties, and the Experimental Center for Agricultural Research in Tocumen.

Between 1970 and 1980, the buildings that were destined for Biology, Architecture, Engineering, Humanities (other), and those destined for the Simón Bolivar Library and for the Laboratory of Specialized Analysis, among others, were finished. At the end of 1979, the University of Panama received the facilities of the Rainbow City High School in [[Colón, Panama|Colón]], where the first of the University's Regional Centers would begin operations. In the following decade, the Regional Centers for the provinces of [[Veraguas]], [[Chiriquí Province|Chiriquí]] and [[Coclé]], and for the region of [[Azuero Peninsula|Azuero]] were built, including an Agricultural Sciences Faculty in Chiriquí.

In the 1990s, the Regional Center for Panamá Oeste (Western Panama) and four buildings destined for research were constructed. At the end of the decade, in 1999 to be more specific, the ARI (Interoceanic Regional Authority) transferred the buildings of the former Curundu Junior High School to the University of Panama. This complex would later hold the Harmodio Arias Madrid Campus. Other facilities transferred were the ones later used for the Veterinary Hospital, in [[Corozal, Panama|Corozal]]. Also during this time, the University expanded its number of buildings by adding 19 more, thanks to the acquisition of adjacent buildings and to the construction of the Regional Center in [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]], the extensions of [[Chepo, Panamá Province|Chepo]] and [[Darién Province|Darién]], and the Popular Universities of Azuero and Coclé, today known as Universidades del Trabajo y La Tercera Edad (Universities of Labor and Elders).

==Achievements==
Several international research agreements and personnel exchanges have been made by government agencies with the institution. Professors in areas of science and technology, medical health, economics and law have been invited to give keynotes and also teach in other campuses around the world.  The University of Panama has also sent representatives to several international congresses and meetings such as Women and Gender, [[World Economic Forum]], environmental congresses, biological research meetings, statistics congresses and many other disciplines.
