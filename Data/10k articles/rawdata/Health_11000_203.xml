== History ==
Before the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] gained sovereignty in 1986, its laws followed the codes set in place by the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], meaning the territory legally observed [[Abortion in the United States|abortion laws in the United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With independence, the nation was authorized to set its own laws regarding abortion, and government officials priotized local customs in court cases that charged abortion as a criminal act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Local abortion practice ===
In the Federated States of Micronesia, women have traditionally induced abortion with local herbs, by inserting foreign bodies into the womb, or through ritual bathing and massages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rate of local remedies for abortion is difficult to determine because cases are only reported when the abortion leads to severe injury, hospitalization, and death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Anil Potti''' is a physician and former [[Duke University]] associate professor and cancer researcher, focusing on [[oncogenomics]]. He, along with Joseph Nevins, are at the center of a research fabrication scandal at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/02/60-minutes-to-delve-into-potti-case.html |title=60 Minutes to delve into Potti case (Triangle Business Journal, February 10, 2012 |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=10 February 2012 |first=Jason |last=Debruyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deception at Duke"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57376073/deception-at-duke "Deception at Duke"], ''60 Minutes'', [[CBS]], 12 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misconduct in science An array of errors|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528593|accessdate=30 June 2013|newspaper=Economist|date=Sep 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 2015, the [[Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI) found that Potti had engaged in research misconduct.&lt;ref name=fedreg&gt;https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/11/09/2015-28437/findings-of-research-misconduct Findings of Research Misconduct&lt;/ref&gt; According to Potti's voluntary settlement agreement with ORI, Potti can continue to perform research with the requirement of supervision until year 2020, while he "neither admits nor denies ORI's findings of research misconduct."&lt;ref name=fedreg /&gt; As of 2018 Potti, who is employed at the Cancer Center of North Dakota,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Cancer Center of North Dakota|url=http://cancercenternd.com/doctors-staff/4343839|publisher=Cancer Center of North Dakota|accessdate=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; has had 11 of his publications retracted and seven more corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Anil Potti retraction record so far|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2012/02/14/the-anil-potti-retraction-record-so-far/|accessdate=2018-10-25|publisher=Retraction Watch|date=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Anil Potti graduated from Christian Medical College, Vellore, India in 1995.&lt;ref name="North Carolina Medical Board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwapps.ncmedboard.org/Clients/NCBOM/Public/LicenseeInformationSearch.aspx |title=North Carolina Medical Board |publisher=Pps.ncmedboard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished an internship in Internal Medicine at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine in 1999.&lt;ref name="North Carolina Medical Board" /&gt; In 2006 Potti completed training in hematology and oncology at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name="North Carolina Medical Board" /&gt;

Potti resigned from Duke in 2010, following the discovery of flaws in the genomics research conducted at Duke and allegations of embellishments in his resume, assuming responsibility for the anomalies in the scientific research.&lt;ref name="Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns"/&gt;

Following his resignation from Duke, Potti worked as an oncologist in South Carolina, but was let go in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/03/panel-calls-closer-oversight-biomarker-tests&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific misconduct==

According to the [[Office of Research Integrity]] (ORI), Potti engaged in [[scientific misconduct]]&lt;ref name=fedreg /&gt; while a cancer researcher at both Duke University's Medical Center and [[Duke University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. He resigned in November 2010 after Duke put him on administrative leave, terminated the clinical trials based on his research and retracted his published data.&lt;ref name="Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns"&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2010/11/updated-anil-potti-duke-cancer-researcher-accused-misconduct-resigns "Anil Potti, Duke Cancer Researcher Accused of Misconduct, Resigns"], ''Duke Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/health/research/21cancer.html|title=Duke Scientist Suspended Over Rhodes Scholarship Claim|work=New York Times|date=20 July 2010|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2010/11/suspended-cancer-trials-terminated "Suspended cancer trials terminated"], ''Duke Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;

Potti and his team were accused of falsifying data regarding the use of [[DNA microarray|microarray]] genetic analysis for personalised cancer treatment, which was published in various prestigious [[scientific journals]]. While there were questions concerning Potti's work beginning in 2007, notably two Bioinformatic Statisticians Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes at [[MD Anderson Cancer Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/health/research/08genes.html|title=How Bright Promise in Cancer Testing Fell Apart|work=New York Times|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilday |first=Patricia |url=http://www.chron.com/news/kilday-hart/article/Hart-Houston-docs-found-leak-in-Holy-Grail-of-3341794.php |title=Houston docs found leak in Holy Grail of cancer treatment. Houston Chronicle, 2/18/12) |work=Houston Chronicle  |date=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010 brought further and more widespread scrutiny when it was discovered by Paul Goldberg and reported in [[The Cancer Letter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancerletter.com/articles/20131204_3 |title=Prominent Duke Scientist Claimed Prizes He Didn't Win, Including Rhodes Scholarship. |publisher=cancerletter.com |date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancerletter.com/documents |title=Duke scientist Anil Potti’s different CVs: version 1, version 2, and version 3. |publisher=cancerletter.com |date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Potti had claimed on his [[curriculum vitae]] that he had been a "Rhodes Scholar (Australian Board)".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DukeChron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2010/08/resume-reveals-inconsistencies|title=Resume reveals inconsistencies|publisher=Duke Chronicle|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was referring to the Association of Rhodes Scholars in Australia Scholarships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2012/01/potti-letter-addresses-scandal-former-researcher-calls-rhodes-controversy-misunderstanding |title=Potti letter addresses scandal: Former researcher calls Rhodes controversy a misunderstanding &amp;#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Dukechronicle.com |date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an award granted by an organisation of former [[Rhodes Scholar]]s to bring Commonwealth citizens who attend overseas institutions in to Australia.&lt;ref name="DukeChron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.unimelb.edu.au/rgc/grants/find/schemes/uom/rhodes_scholars|title=Rhodes scholars – Research Grants and Contracts|publisher=Research.unimelb.edu.au|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2012/02/ninth-potti-paper-date-gets-retracted |title=Ninth Potti paper to date gets retracted – Duke Chronicle, Feb 7, 2012 |publisher=Dukechronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potti's fraudulent research was funded by the US government through the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]], and [[National Cancer Institute]], in the form of six multi-year grants,&lt;ref&gt;https://ori.hhs.gov/content/case-summary-potti-anil&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].&lt;ref name=stat&gt;https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/05/universities-research-misconduct/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[60 minutes]] described the case as "one of the biggest medical research frauds ever".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/durham-county/article20103387.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== University response ==
Duke University became aware of the suspicions of research misconduct by 2008, when a medical student working with Potti and Nevins withdrew his name from the research and submitted a memorandum entitled "Research Concerns" to the administration. The administration denied any misconduct and convinced the student not to report his experiences to the funding agency, [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]. Duke later claimed that there had not been a whistleblower in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/01/duke-university-officials-rebuffed-medical-student-s-allegations-research-problems&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==

The Potti scandal prompted the [[Institute of Medicine]] to conduct a study of the proper use of genomics in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528593 | work=The Economist | title=An array of errors | date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Medicine]]'s report, entitled "Evolution of Translational Omics: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward", was published on 23 March 2012 and made detailed specific recommendations for clinical trials that incorporate "omics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2012/evolution-of-translational-omics.aspx |title=Evolution of Translational Omics: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward – Institute of Medicine |publisher=Iom.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaiser |first=Jocelyn |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/03/panel-calls-closer-oversight-biomarker-tests |title=Panel Calls for Closer Oversight of Biomarker Tests |publisher=News.sciencemag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lapses-in-oversight-compromise-omics-results-1.10298 |title=Lapses in oversight compromise omics results : Nature News &amp; Comment |publisher=Nature.com |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Joseph Nevins stated that it was "abundantly clear" that there was "manipulated data" that could not have occurred by chance.&lt;ref name="Deception at Duke"/&gt; This was confirmed by the 2015 ORI report.&lt;ref name=fedreg /&gt;

== Aftermath == &lt;!-- perhaps a better title here --&gt;

Healthcare companies cut ties with Potti after evidence surfaced that Potti had fabricated awards on his resume. The [[American Cancer Society]] stopped payments of a five-year grant which totaled $729,000 as Potti had received the grant based on his credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=N|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/health/research/21cancer.html|title=Duke Scientist Suspended Over Rhodes Scholar Claims.%7C2010|accessdate=9 January 2012|work=The New York Times|date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke University later reimbursed the American Cancer Society for the full amount of the grant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2010/09/health-care-companies-cut-ties-potti "Health care companies cut ties with Potti"], ''Duke Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;

Three clinical trials at [[Duke University Medical Center]] based on Potti's research came under scrutiny in 2009 and were temporarily suspended, then were permanently stopped in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110111/full/469139a.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2010/09/cancer-research-questioned "Cancer research questioned"], ''Duke Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) reviewed one of the studies in 2009, several years after its initiation, and concluded that the study would require an Investigational New Drug application, which had not been submitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancerletter.com/downloads/20120127_1/download&lt;/ref&gt; An FDA audit in 2011 further showed that an Investigational Device Exemption application had not been filed, but otherwise found "no significant deficiencies" in Duke's IRB conduct.&lt;ref name="Deception at Duke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.nbc17.com/news/2012/feb/10/nbc-17-investigates-fda-findings-duke-audit-ar-1917827/ |title=NBC-17 Investigates FDA findings in Duke audit |publisher=NBC17.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214112834/http://www2.nbc17.com/news/2012/feb/10/nbc-17-investigates-fda-findings-duke-audit-ar-1917827/ |archivedate=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potti's medical license record with the North Carolina Medical Board shows eleven settlements, each of at least $75,000, for incidents that appear to be related to these trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/print-edition/2011/12/30/payouts-mount-for-ex-duke-doc-for.html|title=Payouts mount for ex-Duke doc for malpractice – Triangle Business Journal|publisher=Bizjournals.com|date=13 March 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011|first=Jason|last=Debruyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/news_briefs/story/10553809|title=Disgraced Duke researcher settles malpractice claims|publisher=WRAL.com|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, the North Carolina Medical Board reprimanded Potti&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/anil-potti-reprimanded-by-north-carolina-state-medical-board-as-lawsuit-settlements-surface|title=Anil Potti reprimanded by North Carolina state medical board, as lawsuit settlements surface "Retraction Watch|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/tainted-doctor-working-in-s-c/article_cc4d6508-4451-59bd-ba94-f468fe7f6cad.html |title=Tainted doctor working in S.C. (Charleston Post and Courier) |publisher=Postandcourier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he retains his [[medical license]]. The board issued its disciplinary action against Potti but imposed no sanctions. In its consent order, the North Carolina Medical Board stated that the board has no evidence from which it could conclude that Potti received funding for medical research as a result of the inaccuracies that he would not have otherwise received, but concluded that "...Potti's conduct as described herein constitutes unprofessional conduct..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwapps.ncmedboard.org/Clients/NCBOM/Public/LicenseeInformationDetails.aspx?&amp;EntityID=16218&amp;PublicFile=1 | title= NCMB Action Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; In separate action on Potti's medical license, the North Carolina Medical Board reviewed 11 payments made to settle malpractice claims and posted on its website that "no public action was warranted". Potti was issued a medical license in Missouri on 1 February 2011; on 6 March 2012, the Missouri medical board (known as the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts) issued a reprimand on the basis of actions taken by the North Carolina Medical Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pr.mo.gov/healingarts.asp |title=Board of Registration for the Healing Arts |publisher=Pr.mo.gov |date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2012/03/potti-reprimanded-missouri-medical-board |title=Potti reprimanded by Missouri medical board (The Chronicle, March 12, 2012) |publisher=Dukechronicle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 Potti applied for a medical license in [[South Carolina]], which was approved in April 2011.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/news/troubles-continue-for-former-duke-oncologist/article_ebaad7b9-ae8e-5892-8375-8b747a827439.html |title=Troubles continue for former Duke oncologist (Charleston Post and Courier, February 23, 20120) |publisher=Postandcourier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potti was employed as a practicing physician at the Coastal Cancer Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coastalcancercenter.com/your-team/anil-potti-md/ |title=Coastal Cancer Center |publisher=Coastal Cancer Center |archivedate=16 February 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216234002/http://coastalcancercenter.com/your-team/anil-potti-md/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Loris, South Carolina|Loris]] from March 2011 until 21 February 2012, when he was let go.&lt;ref name="SC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/anil-potti-resurfaces-at-south-carolina-cancer-center|title=Anil Potti resurfaces at South Carolina cancer center "Retraction Watch|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/2012/02/cancer-researcher-potti-loses-his-sc.html | first=Jason | last=Debruyn | title=Cancer researcher Potti loses his S.C. job | date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/developing-anil-pottis-future-at-coastal-cancer-center-seems-unclear/|title=Updated: Anil Potti out at Coastal Cancer Center; practice blames Duke for glowing recommendations|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the settlements, two lawsuits also have been filed against Potti, as well as against Duke and other medical personnel there, charging medical negligence among other claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/abc11_investigates&amp;id=8346506|title=Duke sued over clinical trials|publisher=ABC News|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/15553581/article-Second-lawsuit-filed-against-Duke-for-Potti%E2%80%99s-research?instance=homethirdleft|title=Second lawsuit filed against Duke for Potti's research|publisher=The Herald Sun|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his response to the lawsuits, Potti stated that he was "not aware that false or improper data was included in the research."

[[Robert Califf]] of Duke testified that they had looked at 40 of Potti's publications and that two-thirds of them would be retracted in whole or in part. ''Science'' reported this as "The fallout from the Duke case includes 27 papers that Duke expects to be partially or completely retracted". As of February 2012, ten [[scientific papers]] authored by Potti and others have been [[retraction|retracted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/new-in-pnas-potti-retraction-number-seven-and-a-potti-correction|title=New in PNAS: Potti retraction number seven, and a Potti correction|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|date=5 October 2011|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/potti-and-colleagues-retract-2008-jama-paper/#more-5808|title=Potti and colleagues retract 2008 JAMA paper "Retraction Watch|publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/anil-potti-and-colleagues-retract-ninth-paper-this-one-in-jco |title=Anil Potti and colleagues retract ninth paper, this one in JCO " Retraction Watch |publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/tenth-potti-retraction-appears-in-clinical-cancer-research/ |title=Tenth Potti retraction appears, in Clinical Cancer Research " Retraction Watch |publisher=Retractionwatch.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Duke, Potti hired Online Reputation Manager, a [[reputation management]] company, to improve search results for his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/potti-hires-online-reputation-manager | title=Potti hires online reputation manager | work=The Chronicle | date=14 April 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228203706/http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/potti-hires-online-reputation-manager| archive-date=28 February 2013| accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[WordPress]] received [[DMCA takedown notice]]s for [[Retraction Watch]] blog posts critical of Potti and the posts were removed. Retraction Watch alleges that these DMCA take-down notices were based on false claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/02/site-plagiarizes-blog-posts-then-files-dmca-takedown-on-originals/|title=Site plagiarizes blog posts, then files DMCA takedown on originals |accessdate=11 June 2013|publisher=[[ArsTechnica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2013, [[Automattic]], provider of the WordPress webhost service that hosts Retraction Watch, filed suit against the filer of the takedown notice, saying that he had made those false claims in violation of the DMCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131121/01431725317/wordpress-goes-legal-sues-over-two-egregiously-bogus-dmca-notices-that-were-designed-to-censor.shtml |title=Wordpress Goes Legal: Sues Over Two Egregiously Bogus DMCA Notices That Were Designed To Censor |publisher=Techdirt |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research questions and Institute of Medicine report on 'Omics'==
Following questions raised about genomics research that was led by Potti and Nevins at Duke between 2004 and 2010,&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx |title=Evolution of Translational Omics: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward |publisher=Iom.edu |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071650/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Cancer Institute requested that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) establish a committee to recommend ways to strengthen omics-based test development and evaluation. The IOM's recommendations released in March 2012 spoke to the many parties responsible for discovery and development of omics-based tests, including investigators, their institutions, sponsors of research, the FDA, and journals.&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /&gt; The report identified best practices to enhance development, evaluation, and translation of omics-based tests while simultaneously reinforcing steps to ensure that these tests are appropriately assessed for scientific validity before they are used to guide patient treatment in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /&gt; The IOM's recommendations aimed to ensure that progress in omics test development is grounded in sound scientific practice and is reproducible, resulting not only in improved health care but also in continued public trust.&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /&gt;

The IOM report further added that "failure by many parties [at Duke] to detect or act on problems with key data and computational methods … led to the inappropriate enrollment of patients in clinical trials, premature launch of companies and retraction of dozens of research papers.&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /&gt; The report specifically called for scientific investigators to make the data, computer codes and computational procedures used to develop their clinical tests "publicly accessible for independent review" and to ensure that their data and research steps are presented comprehensibly.&lt;ref name="Panel Calls for Closer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx" /&gt; The report also found that so-called "omics" tests – such as genomics and proteomics, which are diagnostic tools based on molecular patterns – are in general highly prone to errors. IOM committee chair Gilbert Omenn, a computational biologist at the University of Michigan, said the problems could have been avoided. But he noted, as well, that those kind of problems were not unique to Duke."There are a lot of lessons here that surely apply to other places," Omenn said.

==Continuing controversy==
One question that neither Duke nor people involved in the research have been able to explicitly answer thus far is how data corruption or manipulation that would require thorough knowledge of [[DNA microarray|microarray data warehouse]] (large specialised databases) as well as bioinformatics occurred. Dr. Robert Califf's comments about TMQF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medschool.duke.edu/research/translational-medicine-quality-framework |title=TMQ Framework |publisher=Duke Medical School |date=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112114310/http://medschool.duke.edu/research/translational-medicine-quality-framework |archivedate=12 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only addresses data provenance, adequate quantitative collaboration, accountability and open dialogue about issues beyond the individual lab and systems to deal with conflict of interest.

In a curt exchange with committee member Thomas Fleming, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington, Dr. Joseph Nevins refused to say how he believed the data problems occurred. When Fleming pointed out that because the problems in the data improved the experimental results, it seemed that they were introduced intentionally. "I can't address it," Nevins responded. "I just can't get into a position of speculating on how it happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2011/03/nevins-defends-duke-response-flawed-data  |title=Nevins exchange with Committee |publisher=Duke Chronicle |accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407074148/http://dukechronicle.com/article/nevins-defends-duke-response-flawed-data | archivedate=7 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retracted papers==

In [[ancient Egyptian religion]], '''Apis''' or '''Hapis''' ({{lang-egy|ḥjpw}}, reconstructed as [[Old Egyptian language|Old Egyptian]] {{IPA|*/ˈħujp?w/}} with unknown final vowel &gt; [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]] {{IPA|ˈħeʔp(?w)}}, {{lang-cop|ϩⲁⲡⲉ}}), alternatively spelled '''Hapi-ankh''', was a [[sacred bull]] [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Animal cults|worshiped]] in the [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis region]], identified as the son of [[Hathor]], a primary deity in the [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Initially, he was assigned a significant role in her worship, being sacrificed and reborn. Later, Apis also served as an intermediary between humans and other powerful deities (originally [[Ptah]], later [[Osiris]], then [[Atum]]).&lt;ref&gt;quote: Virtual Egyptian Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}

The Apis bull was an important sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians.  As with the other sacred beasts Apis' importance increased over the centuries. During colonization of the conquered Egypt, Greek and Roman authors had much to say about Apis, the markings by which the black calf was recognized, the manner of his conception by a [[sunlight|ray from heaven]], his house at Memphis (with a court for his deportment), the mode of prognostication from his actions, his death, the mourning at his death, his costly burial, and the rejoicings throughout the country when a new Apis was found. [[Auguste Mariette]]'s excavation of the [[Serapeum of Saqqara]] revealed the tombs of more than sixty animals, ranging from the time of [[Amenhotep III]] to that of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. Originally, each animal was buried in a separate tomb with a chapel built above it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apis|volume=2|page=168|first=Francis Llewellyn|last=Griffith|authorlink=Francis Llewellyn Griffith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of worship==
Worship of an Apis bull, experienced by ancient Egyptians as holy, has been known since the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], while worship of the Apis as a proper god, at least according to [[Manetho]]'s ''Aegyptiaca'', seems to be a later adoption, purportedly started during the reign of king ''Kaiechos'' (possibly [[Nebra (Pharaoh)|Nebra]]) of the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahl|first=Jochem|title="Ra is My Lord": Searching for the Rise of the Sun God at the Dawn of Egyptian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTzrbPfbGugC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2007|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05540-6|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apis is named on very early monuments, but little is known of the divine animal before the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Ceremonial burials of bulls indicate that ritual sacrifice was part of the worship of the early cow deities, Hathor and [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]], and a bull might represent her offspring, a king who became a deity after death.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} He was entitled "the renewal of the life" of the Memphite deity [[Ptah]]: but after death he became Osorapis, i.e. the Osiris Apis, just as dead humans were assimilated to Osiris, the ruler of the underworld. This Osorapis was identified with [[Serapis]] of the late [[Hellenistic period]] and may well be identical with him. Creating parallels to their own religious beliefs, [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] writers identified Apis as an incarnation of Osiris, ignoring the connection with Ptah.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Apis was the most popular of three great bull cults of ancient Egypt, the others being the cults of [[Mnevis]] and [[Buchis]]. All are related to the worship of Hathor or Bat, similar primary goddesses separated by region until unification that eventually merged as Hathor. The worship of Apis was continued by the Greeks and after them by the Romans, and lasted until almost 400 CE.

== Herald of Ptah ==
[[File:The sacred procession of Apis Osiris by F.A. Bridgman.jpg|left|thumb|The sacred procession of Apis Osiris by F.A. Bridgman]]
This animal was chosen because it symbolized the courageous heart, great strength, and fighting spirit of the king. Apis came to being considered a manifestation of the king, as bulls were symbols of strength and fertility, qualities that are closely linked with kingship. "strong bull of his mother [[Hathor]]" was a common title for Egyptian gods and male kings, being unused for women serving as king, such as [[Hatshepsut]].

As early as the time of the [[Narmer Palette]], the king is depicted with a bovine tail on one side, and a bull is seen knocking down the walls of a city on the other.

Occasionally, Apis was pictured with the sun-disk symbol of his mother, Hathor, between his horns, being one of few deities ever associated with her symbol. When the disk was depicted on his head with his horns below and the triangular marking on his forehead, an [[ankh]] was suggested. That symbol always was closely associated with Hathor.

Early on, Apis was the herald ([[Wikt:wḥm|''wḥm'']]) of [[Ptah]], the chief deity in the area around [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. As a manifestation of Ptah, Apis also was considered to be a symbol of the king, embodying the qualities of kingship. In the region where Ptah was worshiped, [[cattle]] exhibited white patterning on their mainly black bodies, and so a belief grew up that the Apis calf had to have a certain set of markings suitable to its role. It was required to have a white [[triangle|triangular]] marking upon its forehead, a white [[Egyptian vulture]] wing outline on its back, a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]] mark under its tongue, a white [[moon|crescent moon]] shape on its right flank, and double hairs on his tail.

The calf that matched these markings was selected from the herds, brought to a [[Egyptian temple|temple]], given a [[harem]] of cows, and worshiped as an aspect of Ptah. The cow who was his mother was believed to have conceived him by a flash of [[lightning]] from the heavens, or from [[moonlight|moonbeam]]s. She also was treated specially, and given a special burial. At the temple, Apis was used as an [[oracle]], his movements being interpreted as prophecies. His breath was believed to cure disease and his presence to bless those around with strength. A window was created in the temple through which he could be viewed and, on certain holidays, he was led through the streets of the city, bedecked with jewelry and flowers.

==Burial==
Details of the [[mummification]] ritual of the sacred bull are written within the [[Apis papyrus]].&lt;ref name="Vos R.L."&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=2797|author=Vos R.L.|title=The Apis Embalming Ritual - P. Vindob. 3873|publisher=Peeters publishers 1992, |ISBN=978-90-6831-438-0|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the body of the bull was [[mummy|mummified]] and fixed in a standing position on a foundation made of wooden planks. 

By the New Kingdom period, the remains of the sacred bulls were interred at the cemetery of [[Saqqara]]. The earliest known burial in Saqqara was performed in the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] by his son [[Thutmose (prince)|Thutmose]]; afterward, seven more bulls were buried nearby. [[Ramesses II]] initiated Apis burials in what now is known as the [[Serapeum]], an underground complex of burial chambers at Saqqara for the sacred bulls, a site used throughout the rest of Ancient Egyptian history into the reign of [[Cleopatra]].

[[File:Stele dedicated to Apis-Louvre N 5417-mp3h8842.jpg|thumb|220px|Stele dedicated to an Apis, dating to Year 21 of [[Psamtik I]] (c.644 BCE)]]

[[Khaemweset]], the priestly son of [[Ramesses II]] (c. 1300 BCE), excavated a great gallery to be lined with the tomb chambers; another similar gallery was added by [[Psamtik I]]. The careful documentation of the ages of the animals in the later instances, with the regnal dates for their birth, enthronement, and death have thrown much light on the chronology from the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] onward. The name of the mother cow and the place of the calf's birth often are recorded. The [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] are of immense size and the burial must have entailed enormous expense. It is remarkable, therefore, that the ancient religious leaders contrived to bury one of the animals in the fourth year of [[Cambyses II]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The Apis was a protector of the deceased and linked to the pharaoh. Horns embellish some of the tombs of ancient pharaohs and Apis often was depicted on private coffins as a powerful protector. As a form of Osiris, ruler of the underworld, it was believed that to be under the protection of Apis would give the person control over the four winds in the afterlife.

According to [[Arrian]], Apis was one of the Egyptian deities [[Alexander the Great]] propitiated by offering a sacrifice during his seizure of Ancient Egypt from the Persians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arrian |author-link=Arrian |title=Anabasis|title-link=Anabasis Alexandri }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Alexander's death, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter]] made efforts to integrate Egyptian religion with that of the new Hellenic rulers. Ptolemy's policy was to find a deity that might win the reverence of both groups, despite the curses of the Egyptian religious leaders against the deities of the previous foreign rulers (i.e. [[Set (deity)|Set]], lauded by the [[Hyksos]]). Without success, Alexander had attempted to use [[Amun]] for this purpose, but that deity was more prominent in [[Upper Egypt]] and not for those in [[Lower Egypt]], where the Greeks had stronger influence. Since the Greeks had little respect for animal-headed deities, a Greek statue was created as an idol and proclaimed as an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] equivalent of the highly popular Apis. It was named ''Aser-hapi'' (i.e. ''Osiris-Apis''), which became '''[[Serapis]]''', and later was said to represent Osiris fully, rather than just his [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka (vital spark)|Ka]].

The earliest mention of a ''Serapis'' is in the authentic death scene of Alexander, from the royal diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arrian |author-link=Arrian |title=Anabasis |chapter=VII |page=26|title-link=Anabasis Alexandri }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''Serapis'' has a temple at [[Babylon]], and is of such importance that he alone is named as being consulted on behalf of the dying Alexander. The presence of this temple in Babylon radically altered perceptions of the mythologies of this era, although it has been discovered that the unconnected Babylonian deity [[Enki|Ea]] was entitled ''Serapsi'', meaning ''king of the deep'', and it is Serapsi who is referred to in the diaries, not Serapis. The significance of this ''Serapsi'' in the Hellenic psyche, however, due to its involvement in Alexander's death, also may have contributed to the choice of ''Osiris-Apis'' as the chief Ptolemaic deity during their occupation of Ancient Egypt.

According to [[Plutarch]], Ptolemy stole the statue from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], having been instructed in a dream by the [[Unknown God]] to bring the statue to [[Alexandria]], where the statue was pronounced to be "Serapis" by two religious experts. Among those experts was one of the Eumolpidae, the ancient family from which the [[hierophant]] of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] traditionally had been chosen since before any historical records. The other expert supposedly was the scholarly Egyptian priest Manetho, which increased acceptability from both the [[Egyptians]] and the Greeks.

Plutarch may not be correct, however, as some Egyptologists assert that the ''Sinope'' in Plutarch's report is the hill of Sinopeion, a name given to the site of an existing Serapeum at Memphis. Also, according to [[Tacitus]], Serapis (i.e. Apis explicitly identified as Osiris in full) had been the [[tutelary deity]] of the village of [[Rhacotis]], before it suddenly expanded into the great capital of "Alexandria".

Being introduced by the Greeks, understandably, the statue depicted a fully human figure resembling [[Hades]] or [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], both being kings of the Greek [[underworld]]. The figure was enthroned with the ''[[modius (headdress)|modius]]'', which is a basket or a grain-measure, on his head, a Greek [[symbol]] for the land of the dead. He also held a [[sceptre]], indicating rulership, and [[Cerberus]], gatekeeper of the underworld, rested at his feet. It also had what appeared to be a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] at its base, fitting the Egyptian symbol of sovereignty, the [[uraeus]].

With his (i.e., Osiris') wife, [[Isis]], and their son (at this point in history) [[Horus]] (in the form of ''[[Harpocrates]]''), Serapis won an important place in the Greek world, reaching [[Ancient Rome]], with [[Anubis]] being identified as Cerberus. 
The cult survived until 385, when Christians destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria, and subsequently, the cult was forbidden by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]].

'''Biological interface engineering''' is a branch of [[bioengineering]] (specifically a subset of tissue and biological materials engineering) dedicated to the study of biological response to materials and material response to biologicals. Most applications of biological interface engineering are related (but not limited to) material, structural and geometric configurations of: [[vasculature devices]], [[orthopedic devices]], [[neurological devices]] and [[organ replacement devices]]. Biological interface engineering involves the marriage of analytical, organic and physical chemistry with genetic, cellular and whole body system biological sciences. Further, biological interface engineering uses concepts developed in traditional [[materials engineering]] to describe phenomena observed at the interface of a biological device and a living organism.

A '''biological specimen''' (also called a '''biospecimen''') is a [[Biology|biological]] [[laboratory specimen]] held by a [[biorepository]] for research. Such a specimen would be taken by [[Sampling (medicine)|sampling]] so as to be representative of any other specimen taken from the source of the specimen. When biological specimens are stored, ideally they remain equivalent to freshly-collected specimens for the purposes of research.

Human biological specimens are stored in a type of biorepository called a [[biobank]], and the science of preserving biological specimens is most active in the field of biobanking.

==Quality control==
Setting broad standards for quality of biological specimens was initially an underdeveloped aspect of biobank growth.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hewitt | first1 = R. E. | title = Biobanking: The foundation of personalized medicine | journal = Current Opinion in Oncology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–119 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21076300 | doi = 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834161b8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently discussion on what standards should be in place and who should manage those standards. Since many organizations set their own standards and since biobanks are necessarily used by multiple organizations and typically are driven towards expansion, the harmonization of [[standard operating procedures]] for lab practices are a high priority.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt; The procedures have to be evidence-based and will change with time as new research and technology becomes available.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt;

===Policy makers===
Some progress for the creation of policy-making organizations include the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s 2005 creation of the Office of Biobanking and Biospecimen Research (OBBR)&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt; and the annual Biospecimen Research Network Symposia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = H.

===Quality goals===
Quality criteria for specimens depends on the study being considered and there is not a universal standard specimen type.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt; DNA integrity is an important factor for studies which involve whole genome amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yuille | first1 = M. | last2 = Illig | first2 = T. | last3 = Hveem | first3 = K. | last4 = Schmitz | first4 = G. | last5 = Hansen | first5 = J. | last6 = Neumaier | first6 = M. | last7 = Tybring | first7 = G. | last8 = Wichmann | first8 = E. | last9 = Ollier | first9 = B. | title = Laboratory Management of Samples in Biobanks: European Consensus Expert Group Report | doi = 10.1089/bio.2010.8102 | journal = Biopreservation and Biobanking | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–9 | year = 2010 | pmid =  
24836342| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA integrity is critical for some studies and can be assessed by [[gel electrophoresis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J.

'''Blood sugar regulation''' is the process by which the levels of [[blood sugar]], primarily [[glucose]], are maintained by the body within a narrow range. This tight regulation is referred to as '''glucose homeostasis'''. [[Insulin]], which lowers blood sugar,  and [[glucagon]], which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process.&lt;ref name=Aronoff&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff SL, Berkowitz K, Shreiner B, Want L | title = Glucose metabolism and regulation: Beyond insulin and glucagon | journal = Diabetes Spectrum | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–90 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | doi = 10.2337/diaspect.17.3.183 | url = http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/3/183.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Negative Feedback Gif.gif|thumb|The flat line is the optimal blood sugar level (i.e. the homeostatic set point). Blood sugar levels are balanced by the tug-of-war between 2 functionally opposite hormones, glucagon and insulin.]]
Blood sugar levels are regulated by [[negative feedback]] in order to keep the body in [[homeostasis|balance]]. The levels of [[glucose]] in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] are among the most well understood and important.

===Glucagon===
If the blood glucose level falls to dangerous levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the [[alpha cells]] of the pancreas release [[glucagon]], a [[hormone]] whose effects on liver cells act to increase blood glucose levels. They convert [[glycogen]] into glucose (this process is called [[glycogenolysis]]).  The glucose is released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar. [[Hypoglycemia]], the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of [[dextrose]] or [[carbohydrate]] foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.

===Insulin===

When levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of [[glycogen]] conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from [[beta cells]] found in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. This hormone, [[insulin]], causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called [[glycogenesis]]), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily [[muscle]] and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the [[GLUT4]] transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into Glucose-6-Phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Ebey Soman, [[Scienceray]], [http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin Regulation of Glucose by Insulin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022545/http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin |date=July 16, 2011 }}, May 4, 2009. Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulator of metabolic control in humans.

There are also several other causes for an increase in blood sugar levels. Among them are the 'stress' hormones such as [[epinephrine]] (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body ([[insulin resistance]]). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood ([[hyperglycemia]]) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]).

'''CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System''' is a non-profit regional [[health care]] provider based in [[Tyler, Texas]] that operates eight hospitals and 82 clinic locations in East Texas.

==History==

In the early 1930s, the [[Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth|Sisters of The Holy Family of Nazareth]] came to [[Tyler, Texas]] from the Sacred Heart Province in [[Chicago]] to open Mother Frances Hospital. The hospital was named in honor of [[Franciszka Siedliska|Frances Siedliska]], the founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth.&lt;ref name="Mother_Frances"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tmfhc.org/about-us/history-and-heritage-of-trinity-mother-frances/|title=History and Heritage of CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances - CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital opened on March 18, 1937 &amp;ndash; one day ahead of schedule &amp;ndash; to care for victims of the [[New London School explosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/yqn01|title=NEW LONDON SCHOOL EXPLOSION|first=MAY, IRVIN M.,|last=JR.|date=15 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth completed the purchase of the hospital from the City of Tyler and in October 1965, Mother Frances Week was celebrated in Tyler, dedicating a new {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} wing. This $4.5 million wing added 110 new patient beds and a new cafeteria to the hospital.&lt;ref name="Mother_Frances" /&gt;

In 1934, The Trinity Clinic began as The Bryant Clinic. It was founded by Dr. William Howard Bryant and Dr. Sidney W. Bradford. The Bryant Clinic received the first call for help in Tyler to treat the victims of the New London tragedy. In 1948, The Bryant Clinic changed its name to The Medical &amp; Surgical Clinic and later, with the addition of two other Tyler-area medical practices, became Trinity Clinic.&lt;ref name="Mother_Frances"/&gt; Today, Trinity Clinic is the area's biggest multi-specialty medical group, with over 300 providers representing 38 specialties in 36 clinic locations in East Texas.

In 1995, Mother Frances Hospital and Trinity Clinic merged, creating Trinity Mother Frances Health System, one of the first integrated health care systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Mother_Frances"/&gt; In 2007, Trinity Mother Frances Health System changed its name to Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics.

In May 2016, Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics merged with [[CHRISTUS Health]] to create CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-transactions-and-valuation/trinity-mother-frances-hospitals-and-clinics-joins-christus-health-6-things-to-know.html|title=Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals and Clinics joins CHRISTUS Health: 6 things to know|last=Gooch|first=Kelly|website=www.beckershospitalreview.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, CHRISTUS Health and Hopkins County Memorial Hospital in [[Sulphur Springs, Texas]] finalized an agreement to create CHRISTUS Hopkins Health Alliance and make Hopkins County Memorial Hospital a part of CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System. The agreement included a change of name for the hospital to CHRISTUS Mother Frances Hospital - ''Sulphur Springs'' and its clinics to CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic - Sulphur Springs and CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic - Emory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irvingchamber.com/2016/06/irvings-christus-acquires-operations-of-another-texas-hospital/|title=Irving’s Christus acquires operations of another Texas hospital {{!}} Irving Chamber|website=www.irvingchamber.com|access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Magnolia Health Systems - Physicians of East Texas (MHS) became a part of CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances. This includes clinic locations in [[Palestine, Texas|Palestine]], [[Elkhart, Texas|Elkhart]], [[Fairfield, Texas|Fairfield]], [[Grapeland, Texas|Grapeland]] and [[Buffalo, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-News+Local/290992/business-notes-for-73|title=Business notes for 7-3 - TylerPaper.com|work=TylerPaper.com|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, CHRISTUS Trinity Clinic - ''Crockett'' opened as a family medicine clinic in [[Crockett, Texas]].

==Reputation==

The system has picked up a number of national awards for health care, including designations as a "100 Top Hospital" by [[Truven Health Analytics]] (2017);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://truvenhealth.com/media-room/press-releases/detail/prid/205/truven-health-analytics-ibm-watson-health-announces-100-top-hospitals-award-winners|title=Truven Health Analytics, IBM Watson Health, Announces 100 Top Hospitals Award Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=truvenhealth.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranked the No. 1 hospital in Texas for Patient Safety in Overall Hospital and Surgical Care by CareChex (2016); National Benchmarks for Success award winner by Soluticient 2006; winner of the 2007 Texas Health Care Quality Improvement Award; designated as a [[Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas|Blue Cross and Blue Shield]] Distinction Center+ for Cardiac Care, Bariatric Surgery, Spine Surgery and Knee and Hip Replacement Services; National Research Corporation Consumer Choice winner; and listed among the top five percent in the nation for patient satisfaction by Press Ganey, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmfhs.org/healthgradesawardsandrecognition "Awards/Recognition 1"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmfhs.org/awards|title=Quality &amp; Recognition - CHRISTUS Trinity Mother Frances Health System|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Sources of Safety Certification==

===CRSP (Canadian Registered Safety Professional)===

Similar to the CSP in the US, Canada offers the CRSP (Canadian Registered Safety Professional) designation, through the [[Board of Canadian Registered Safety Professionals]]

''' Pre-Requisite:'''

Applicants must meet some prerequisites prior to submitting a formal application:

# Educational Pursuits:  Must have minimally completed high school. By 2009, this requirement will change to college or university education in health and safety.
# Past Work Experience:  Must have at least three years of continuous work experience in the Occupational and Environmental Health &amp; Safety field
# Current Employment: Must include greater than 50% (over 900 hours/year), in Occupational and Environmental Health &amp; Safety activities.

''' Registration Process:'''

1. Application:  Once the applicant has met the prerequisites, they must complete the "Application for Canadian Registered Safety Professional Designation", obtained from the BCRSP board.  The lengthy application requires a compilation of all the applicant’s course and job descriptions.

2. Evaluation:  The BCRSP Board reviews the application.  The applicant is then advised if they meet the minimum requirements or not.  If the application is accepted, then the applicant is advised that they will soon be contacted for an interview.

3. Interview: The interview is set up with a member of the BCRSP’s Regional Screening Centre personnel in the applicant’s geographical area.  It’s an informal meeting, where the applicant’s work and educational Occupational Health &amp; Safety experience are discussed.

4. Examination:  The applicant has to write a comprehensive 3.5 hour multiple choice exam that covers Accident Theory, Environmental Practices, Ergonomics, Fire Prevention and Protection, Health Promotion, HSE Auditing, Law and Ethics, Occupational Health Safety and Environment Systems, Occupational Hygiene, Risk Management, and Safety Techniques and Technology.  Study guides and books are recommended by the Board, and numerous preparatory courses are available through:
::* [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]
::* [[Canadian Society of Safety Engineering]]
::* [[Institute of Quality, Safety and Environmental Management]]
::* [[Raising the Standard Consulting]]
::* [[Faculty of Extension University of Alberta]]

4. Approval:  If the applicant minimally achieves the passing score on the examination, they receive notification of such.

5. Confirmation:  The applicant revives the CRSP Designation along with their designation registration number.

 
''' Career Development:'''

In Order to maintain a professional safety designation continuing education is often required with most designations.  To be  in good standing with the certification body, continuing education units (CEU) or professional developmental conferences (PDC) must be completed within a designated time frame and approved by the certification body.  Some provincial trade associations and safety associations have their industry designations such as:
::* (NCSO) [[National Construction Safety Officer ]]
::* (HSA) [[Health and Safety Administrator ]]
::* (HSP) [[Health and safety Professional]]
::* (CHSC) [[Certified Health and Safety Consultant]]
::* (CHSMSA) [[Certified Health and Safety Management Systems Auditor]]
::* (QSR)  [[Qualified Safety Professional]]

===Safety Certification in Europe===

Internationally, other countries have set up similar programs. In the UK the highest professional standing is that of a chartered safety and health practitioner or fellow of IIRSM. The standards are maintained by both the UK’s largest body for safety professionals [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH) and also the [[International Institute of Risk and Safety Management]] (IIRSM). Like North American safety professional programs, to achieve these grades the applicant must be professionally qualified and have relevant experience. Continuing professional development (CPD) is also a strong requirement of both memberships. [[International Institute of Risk and Safety Management|IIRSM]] also offer [[Recognised Safety Professional]] (not to be confused with 'registered safety practitioners' of OSHCR) these honorary post nominal letters given by IIRSM to recognised safety practitioners.

A [[healthcare system]] is a set of activities with a common set of [[Goal|objective]]s. For each objective it is necessary to choose one, or more, criteria that can be used to measure progress or the lack of it. The [[dataset]] of criteria provides another of the essential elements of a system – the [[feedback loop]].

== Examples of the uses of the term system relevant to healthcare ==

“ The concept of a [[Operations management#Production systems|production system]] as a socio-technical system designates a general [[field of study]] concerned with the interrelations of the technical and socio-psychological organization of industrial production systems. … The concept of a [[Socio-technical systems|socio-technical system]] arose from the consideration that any production system requires both a technological organization – equipment and process layout – and a work organization relating to each other those who carry out the necessary tasks. The technological demands place limits on the type of work organization possible, but a work organization has social and psychological properties of its own that are independent of [[technology]]….. A socio-technical system must also satisfy the financial conditions of the industry of which it is a part. It must have economic validity. It has in fact social, technological and economic dimensions, all of which are interdependent but all of which have independent values of their own.’ ”   (Rice:  Productivity and Social Organization.)

“What distinguishes systems is that it is a subject which can talk about the other subjects. It is not a discipline to be put in the same set as the others, it is a meta-discipline whose subject matter can be applied within virtually any other discipline.”
Source:  Checkland, P. (1993)   Systems Thinking, Systems Practice. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester.  (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

“The systems paradigm is concerned with wholes and their properties. It is holistic, but not in the usual (vulgar) sense of taking in the whole;  systems concepts are concerned with wholes and their hierarchical arrangement rather than with the whole.”

The setting of objectives and the choice of criteria relating to the [[healthcare]] provided for a condition such as [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson Disease]] or [[Renal failure|Renal Failure]] has a number of benefits, notably

•	It allows a patient to compare the performance of that aspect of healthcare that is of most importance to them 
•	It allows those who allocate resources to judge the value that would be added if additional resources were to be invested in that system, at the expense of systems focussed on other health problems.

It is necessary to have [[closed system]]s like [[hospital]]s and [[primary care]] services to employ staff and ensure money is administered with [[probity]] but they are all parts of an open system of healthcare and changes imposed in any one closed system will have unintended consequences elsewhere through a feedback mechanism that may, or may not, be predictable. Traditional approaches have sought to manage health problems by tighter control of organisations which cover a wide range of health problems, hospitals and [[Care in the Community|community care]] for example with patients being referred to the former and discharged to the latter. This two-box approach has many weaknesses, implying, for example, that a hospital is not a community service. Another approach is to present different levels of care in the form of a [[Venn diagram]].
 
For serious, acute problems, a fractured [[femur]] for example the spectrum of the relative contributions of the different sectors of care, are consistent from between countries and within a country. [[Self care]] is minimal, primary care by an [[ambulance]] service brief, and most care is provided in [[secondary care]], with [[tertiary care]] being needed for the person who has multiple injuries in addition to the fractured femur and needs the services of a [[trauma center]]. For chronic conditions, however the distribution of care is often sub optimal because the indications for moving from one level of care to another are often unclear and may be influenced by emotional and, apparently, irrational factors. 
Even if the number of patients in each part of the spectrum is correct there will be some

•	Receiving care that is more intensive than they need
•	Receiving care that is less intensive that they need

Both groups reduce the value derived from the resources invested

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">'''Clinical trials units''' ('''CTU''') are specialised [[biomedical research]] units which design, centrally coordinate and analyse [[clinical trials]] and other studies. Some CTUs specialise in different methodologies, such as [[Randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trials]], [[Cluster randomised controlled trial|cluster randomised trials]], surgical trials, and health services research. Some specialise in one disease type, whereas others are generic units. Some CTUs focus on specific phases and types of clinical trials; others conduct all phases and types of trial.

==United Kingdom==

The UKCRC evaluates CTUs in the UK and they may be given either Full or Provisional CTU registration status. All Registered CTUs are required to provide evidence that their work is of high quality by demonstrating (1) experience of coordinating multi-centre randomised controlled trials or other well-designed studies, (2) a presence of a core team of expert staff to develop studies, (3) a presence of robust quality assurance systems and processes to meet appropriate regulations and legislation, and (4) evidence of longer-term viability of capacity for trials coordination and the development/maintenance of a trials portfolio.&lt;ref name="MHNCTU"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.clinicaltrialsunit.com/ | title = Mental Health and Neurosciences Clinical Trials Unit | work = clinicaltrialsunit.com | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512110149/http://clinicaltrialsunit.com/ | archivedate = 2011-05-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisional CTUs tend to be newer and evolving CTUs and have not yet built a track record but have relevant expertise and experience that is worth building on. Evaluation criteria for Provisional Registration were developed for CTUs that did not meet the criteria for Full Registration status, but that are working towards possessing sufficient expertise to enable Full Registration in the future.&lt;ref name="MHNCTU"/&gt;

Medicinal clinical trials are only a subset of all trials undertaken by Registered Clinical Trials Units in the academic sector. Such Units may also specialise in surgical trials, therapy trials and other complex interventions such as educational interventions.

In the [[United Kingdom]], clinical trials of medicines are approved by the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]]. This it does through its Clinical Trials Unit, which enforces standards through the Good Clinical Practice Inspectorate. In 2007, a revised version of Phase I clinical trial regulations was issued following the heavily publicized [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failures]] in several volunteers for a study of [[TGN1412]].&lt;ref name="Clark2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Todd D.|title=PharmaHandbook: a guide to the international pharmaceutical industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-qs6BtdIUAC&amp;pg=PA414|accessdate=15 April 2010|year=2007|publisher=PharmaHandbook 5th Edition|isbn=978-0-9795443-0-9|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General information ==
Ukraine has a German-Franco Model of [[Emergency Medical Service]], in which an ambulance is staffed by physicians. A part of ambulances are staffed by [[feldsher]]s.

US faced a somewhat similar problem around 50 years ago. [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] published an influential report "[[Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society]]" in 1966. It is considered a landmark in the development of the [[Emergency medical services in the United States|emergency medical services]] system in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10903120090940958 |journal=[[Prehospital Emergency Care]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=October 2000 |pages=285–289 |title=Special Contributions. Historical background to accidental death and disability: The neglected disease of modern society |first=John M. |last=Howard |accessdate=3 November 2014 |doi=10.1080/10903120090940958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded, in part, that both the public and government were "insensitive to the magnitude of the problem of accidental death and injury" in the U.S.; that the standards to which [[ambulance]] services were held were diverse and "often low"; and that "most ambulances used in this country are unsuitable, have incomplete … equipment, carry inadequate supplies, and are manned by untrained attendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Accidental Death and Disability: The Neglected Disease of Modern Society |date=September 1966 |author=Division of Medical Sciences, Committee on Trauma and Committee on Shock |publisher=National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms inaugurated by the publication of "The White Paper" led to higher quality care provided on-scene and in-transit by trained [[paramedic]]s and [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s.

Active reforming of emergency medical care was initiated right after appointment of [[Ulana Suprun]] as a head of the [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine]]. There are several main areas of this reform.&lt;ref name="КМУреф"/&gt;
* Improvement of [[Emergency medical responder|non-medical persons]] training.
* Standardization of medical care on the principles of [[evidence-based medicine]].
* Introduction of EMT and paramedics into the Ukrainian emergency medical service system.
* Training of personnel in accordance with new programs.
* Improvement of medical dispatching.
* Introduction of emergency departments.&lt;ref name="КМУреф"/&gt;

== Improvement of non-medical persons training ==
In order to improve survival from the [[preventable causes of death]], help should be brought as closer as possible to the patient. It is necessary to strengthen the whole [[chain of survival]]. There are several levels of care in pre-hospital care in Ukraine.

* Persons are obliged to provide care for people in emergency conditions (the equivalent&lt;ref name="Хто"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patriotdefence.org/ua/news/articles/xto-e-xto-u-nevidkladnij-dopomozi-ssha.html |title=Who is who in the emergency help of the USA |trans-title= |date= |author1=Гліб Бітюков |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Patriot Defence]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of an international term "[[Emergency Medical Responder]]")
* [[Emergency medical technician]]s
* [[Paramedic]]s
* Physicians of emergency medicine.&lt;ref name="ЗУ"&gt;[http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/5081-17 Law of Ukraine "On Emergency Medical Care"] in Ukrainian&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Захист Патріотів Навчання патрульних-1.jpg |right|thumb|300px|[[Patriot Defence|Patriot Defence instructors]] train policemen in emergency care.]]
According to Ukrainian legislation, there are no official terms "[[Emergency medical responder]]" or "[[Certified first responder|First responder]]".&lt;ref name="ЗУ"/&gt; But there is an equivalent – persons, who are obliged to provide emergency medical assistance to a person in urgent need. They are:
* rescuers of emergency rescue service;
* state fire brigade workers;
* police officers;
* pharmaceutical workers;
* conductors of passenger trains;
* flight attendants;
* other persons who do not have medical education, but in their official duties include practical skills in providing premedical care.&lt;ref name="ЗУ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Прикарп поліц"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravda.if.ua/print.php?id=133078 |title=Police officers in the Carpathian region were trained to provide emergency care |trans-title= |date=December 4, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=pravda.if.ua |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=December 25, 2017 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular after police reform, the [[National Police of Ukraine|National Police officers]] are obliged to provide emergency medical care to those who have suffered as a result of offenses, accidents, as well as to those who are in a helpless condition or that which can be dangerous to their life or health.&lt;ref name="Поліц"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://westnews.com.ua/politseyski-proyshli-navchannya-z-nadannya-ekstrenoyi-medichnoyi-dopomogi-poterpilim-foto/ |title=Policemen were  trained to provide emergency medical care to victims.

[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine]] on March 29, 2017 approved new training programs for the training of such persons, who are obliged to provide emergency medical assistance to a person in urgent need.&lt;ref name="УМЧ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umj.com.ua/article/106851/zatverdzheno-navchalni-programi-z-domedichnoyi-dopomogi |title=Medical Assistance Training Programs Approved |trans-title= |date=April 7, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=Ukrainian medical journal |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=December 25, 2017 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Урядовий портал"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=249908143&amp;cat_id=244277212 |title=MOH has approved new emergency medical training programs for police, firefighters, State Emergency Service workers, the National Guard |trans-title= |date=April 12, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Government of Ukraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] introduced two new specialties of [[Emergency Care Instructor|medical instructors]]:
* Pre-hospital care instructor,
* First Aid instructor.&lt;ref name="Аптека"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apteka.ua/article/433521 |title=MOH order from&amp;nbsp;09.08.2017&amp;nbsp;р. №&amp;nbsp;918 |trans-title= |date=November 1, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=www.apteka.ua |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This will standardize the teaching of relevant levels of care and attract more people to study.

[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] is currently introducing new demands to be applied to the collection of supplies of vehicle first aid kits. In Ukraine, there are about 554 traffic accidents every day. Mortality is higher here than in other European countries.&lt;ref name="Смерть на дорозі"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unian.ua/society/2088789-reyting-krajin-za-rivnem-smertnosti-u-dtp-ukrajina-v-desyattsi-infografika.html |title=Countries ranked by death rate in road accidents: Ukraine in ten (infographics) |trans-title= |date=August 18, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 22, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the first-aid kit demands did not change for 20 years.&lt;ref name="112 Аптечка"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://12kanal.com/ministerstvo-oxoroni-zdorovya-zminyuye-sklad-aptechok/ |title=The Ministry of Healthcare changes the composition of the first-aid kits |trans-title= |date=January 18, 2018 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[112 Ukraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 22, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New demands are based on [[evidence-based medicine]] and best westert practices.

== Standardization of medical care ==
=== New clinical guidlines ===
The ''Better Regulation Delivery Office'' research has shown that the Ukrainian information field is clogged up — about 35% of the acts are obsolete, irrelevant and ineffective.&lt;ref name="УПЖ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://life.pravda.com.ua/health/2017/04/26/223867/ |title=The Ministry of Health explained what new clinical protocols are and how they will work |trans-title= |date=April 26, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ukrayinska Pravda|Ukrayinska Pravda.

In April 2017 [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare]] allowed Ukrainian doctors to use [[Medical guideline|international clinical guidelines]] in their work and, so to provide medical care according to world standards.&lt;ref name="Нові прот МОЗ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moz.gov.ua/article/for-medical-staff/jak-vprovadzhuvati-novi-klinichni-protokoli-instrukcija-dlja-likariv |title=How to implement new clinical guidlines: a manual for physicians 1/4 |trans-title= |date=December 19, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of UKraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Наказ_1422"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.moz.gov.ua/ua/portal/dn_20161229_1422.html |title=Order of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine No. 1422 dated December 29, 2016. |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Протоколи_медексперт"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://med-expert.com.ua/ua/news/mizhnarodni-protokoli-likuvannja-perevagi-dlja-paciientiv-sistemi-ohoroni-zdorovja-ta-derzhavi/. |title=INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOLS OF TREATMENT: BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=Medexpert group |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to this, clinical guidelines were developed based on the method of adaptation of international clinical guidelines. In some cases, they were developed based on the clinical experience of group members. Part of them is created on the old soviet evidence base. In addition, Ukrainian unified clinical guidelines may contain trade names for certain drugs. This led to the lobbying of the relevant pharmacists.&lt;ref name="Протоколи_ФБ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/moz.ukr/posts/893483134148126:0 |title=How to implement new clinical guidelines? |trans-title= |date=December 20, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of UKraine]] official [[Facebook]] page |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the same order [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of UKraine]] also eliminated the need for the implementation of local clinical protocols.&lt;ref name="УПЖ"/&gt; Previously, each medical facility was forced to develop such documents. Often, they were based on sources of information of different antiquity and on the clinical experience of the developer.&lt;ref name="УПЖ"/&gt; At the same time, they were legally much more weighty than any world guidelines. [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH]] has allowed each institution to translate international protocols, based on evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref name="Нові прот МОЗ"/&gt; It defines a clear list of international sources for such translation and approval.&lt;ref name="Наказ_1422"/&gt;

=== HeRAMS Ukraine ===

In autumn 2017 [[World Health Organization]], in cooperation with the [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine]], launched the ''[[HeRAMS|HeRAMS Ukraine]]'' project.&lt;ref name="Седидово"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://selidovo-rada.gov.ua/novini/monitoring-medichnikh-resursiv-za-programoyu-herams-ukraine |title=Monitoring of medical resources under the HeRAMS Ukraine program |date= December 2, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Selydove|Selydove city council]] |editor= |pages= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ДонОДА"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doz.donoda.gov.ua/robota-spivrobitnikiv-upravlinnya-organizatsiyi-ta-rozvitku-medichnoyi-dopomogi-naselennyu-departamentu-ohoroni-zdorov-ya-oblderzhadministratsiyi-za-10-misyatsiv-2017-roku/ |title=Work of employees of the Department of Health of the Regional State Administration for 10 months of 2017 |date=6 December 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Donetsk Oblast|Department of Health of Donetsk Regional State Administration]] |editor= |pages= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HeRAMS (Health Resources Availability Mapping System) is an electronic system for monitoring medical resources. It is a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] tool for standardizing and assessing the availability of medical services in different countries. It is mostly used for emergency response.&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_заг"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/herams/en/ |title=Health Resources Availability Monitoring System (HeRAMS) |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[World Health Organization|WHO]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When conducting programs using HeRAMS, information is collected from health facilities in a specific area. The system collects information on four major contingencies related to emergencies:
* health care establishments (number, type ...);
* resources for the provision of services (water supply, [[cold chain]] ...);
* availability of medical services in certain spheres (emergency medicine at the pre-hospital and hospital stages, trauma care...);
* the reasons for the lack of medical services (lack of medical staff, poor training ...).
Based on the data obtained, analytical reports are made and possible measures are developed to improve the situation. Periodic monitoring is possible.&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_заг"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ВООЗ_Є"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/survey-reveals-extent-damage-yemens-health-system |title=Survey reveals extent of damage to Yemen's health system |trans-title= |date= November 6, 2016  |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 4, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first in Ukraine [[HeRAMS|HeRAMS project]] was launched only in [[War in Donbass|Donetsk and Lugansk regions]].&lt;ref name="Седидово"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ДонОДА"/&gt;

In January 2017 [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] approved a modern military [[first aid kit]], a military car first aid and backpacks for field medics. Their composition is developed in accordance with the [[Tactical Combat Casualty Care|Tactical Combat Casualty Care guidelines]].&lt;ref name="Наказ_аптечки"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.moz.gov.ua/ua/portal/dn_20161229_1422.html |title=Order of the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine No. 6 dated January 5, 2017. |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="112Д"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ua.112.ua/interview/paramedytsyna-v-ukrainskykh-realiiakh-422966.html |title=Paramedicine in Ukraine to be.

Specialists have excluded drugs that have no proven efficiency. Each medical facility or military unit will have the same equipment and medicine, so it will be able to provide high-quality medical care.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Наказ_МОУ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z0688-17 |title=Order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine No. 261 dated May 5, 2017. |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Ministry of Defense (Ukraine)|Ministry of Defense of Ukraine]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 13, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction of EMT and paramedics ==
In 2017 [[Ministry of Healthcare (Ukraine)|MOH of Ukraine]] introduced two specialties —- paramedics and [[emergency medical technician]]s.&lt;ref name="Аптека"/&gt;

=== Paramedic ===
In Ukraine paramedic is a person with a level of education not lower than a [[Higher education in Ukraine#Higher education qualifications|junior bachelor]] of the field of knowledge "Healthcare" and the corresponding specialization. This means that after 11 years of school, in order to become a paramedic, he needs to study for another 3 years. For a person with basic 9-year education, the term of training will be 4 years.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Аптека"/&gt;

In Ukraine paramedics provide a [[Advanced life support|ALS level of care]]. Qualifying requirements for paramedic are higher than those for a [[feldsher]]. The paramedic training program is more focused on providing emergency medical care. They have more advanced requirements for professional skills in this area. In September 2018, there will be the first set for this specialty in medical colleges.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;

[[Feldsher]]s working in the emergency medical teams will be able to become paramedics after undergoing advanced training to paramedic level. The Ministry of Health has defined a transitional period of 5 years for training and certification of emergency medical feldshers to the paramedic level. By this time, they can work as part of the EMS teams.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;&lt;ref name="УМЖ_реформа"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umj.com.ua/article/104511/reforma-ekstrenoyi-medichnoyi-dopomogi-ne-prizvede-do-zvilnennya-likariv |title=Emergency medical care reform will not lead to the firing of doctors |trans-title= |date=February 1, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=Український медичний часопис |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of paramedics concerns only the emergency teams. Feldsher will continue to work in feldsher-obstetrician stations in rural areas.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;

During the transition period emergency medicine physicians will still work in ambulances. However, at the moment, physicians often go to simple cases that do not meet their high qualifications. At the end of the transition period, physicians will be engaged only in some severe cases, as it is in many developed countries.&lt;ref name="Самогубство"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/air-ambulance-doctor-committed-suicide-12463360 |title=Ambulance doctor committed suicide after death of patient given wrong drug dose |trans-title= |date=January 16, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Birmingham Mail]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AirLondon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://londonsairambulance.co.uk/our-service/news/2017/10/team-spotlight-tony-joy-pru |title=Team Spotlight: Tony Joy |date=October 26, 2017|author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[London's Air Ambulance]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Австралія"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/how-prehospital-doctors-are-saving-lives-in-the-field-as-part-of-the-nsw-ambulance-special-casualty-access-team/news-story/61a4b00fbe3f3ee3acaca0a80c5359af |title=How pre-hospital doctors are saving lives in the field as part of the NSW Ambulance Special Casualty Access Team |trans-title= |date=October 3, 2015 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Daily telegraph]] |editor= |pages= |language= |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them will get a job in the [[emergency department]]s.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/uk/медична-реформа-в-україні-штучне-дихання-для-швидкої/a-36708516 |title=Medical reform in Ukraine: artificial respiration for "Ambulance" |trans-title= |date=December 13, 2016  |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 17, 2018  |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, physicians have more opportunities to use their knowledge and skills.

=== Emergency medical technician ===
Now in Ukraine ambulances are driven by ambulance drivers. But as in many countries in the past, in Ukraine these employees are not trained in emergency care. That is why new specialty of [[emergency medical technician]] was introduced. Ambulance drivers will continue to work during a 5-year transition period. During this time, everyone should be trained and certified for the level of [[emergency medical technician]].&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;
 
New emergency medical technician profession corresponds to EMT-Basic in USA.
In Ukraine EMT according to the assigned duties:
* works under the guidance of a physician or paramedic;
* provides care in the EMS team;
* assists the emergency department staff;
* interacts with other medical services;
* evaluates the environment regarding possible threats to him or other people;
* participates in the [[triage]];
* assesses the patient's condition;
* examines the patient for urgent conditions;
* conducts [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]];
* provides care in case of adverse reactions to medicines;
* assists in transporting patients and transpors patients to health care facilities;
* provides basic medical support during mass events, sports events, other events;
* drives ambulance, supports it in a state of readiness, etc.&lt;ref name="Аптека"/&gt;

The minimum requirements for emergency medical technician in Ukraine are:
* full secondary education and training by specialty "Emergency medical technician";
* the presence of a certificate of training in the program for the profession "Emergency medical technician";
* a [[driver's license]] for the relevant category for driving.&lt;ref name="Аптека"/&gt;
Term of training to become EMT lasts about a month, which includes studying in classes and practical training of skills.&lt;ref name="Портал"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.lviv.ua/news/2016/11/21/yak-ukrayintsiv-likuvatimut-po-novomu-reformuvannya-medichnoyi-galuzi |title=How Ukrainians will be treated in a new way: reforming the medical sector |trans-title= |date=November 21, 2016 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=Lviv portal |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 18, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;

== New training programs for emergency staff ==
[[File:Розумний підхід до травми.jpg |right|thumb|300px|Teaching modern principles of trauma care. Photo by [[Patriot Defence]].]]
With the participation of British and American physician, a six-day training course "Ukrainian Trauma Life Support" (UTLS) was developed. It is intended for the upgrading of doctors providing emergency medical care to the injured patients: [[surgeon]]s, [[anesthesiologist]]s, [[Traumatology|traumatologist]]s, [[emergency medicine|emergency medicine doctors]], etc.&lt;ref name="НМАПО"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nmapo.edu.ua/uk/vitaemo-koleg-z-dnem-narodzhennya/5400-zasidannya-vchenoji-radi-nmapo-imeni-p-l-shupika-vid-11-zhovtnya-2017-r |title= of the NMPE Academic Council meeting from October 11, 2017 |trans-title= |date=October 23, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[P.L.

The program takes into account the main requirements of the relevant international counterparts, such as "PHTLS", "ALS", "ATLS".&lt;ref name="НМАПО"/&gt; The course consists of seminars, workshops and simulations. It is intended to systematize the approach to the injured, to work out team work and skills of effective communication.&lt;ref name="Зправда"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zp-pravda.info/zdorovje/414-znannya-tsinoyu-v-zhittya-zakhist-patriotiv-navchae-ukrajinskikh-likariv-za-svitovimi-standartami.html |title=Knowledge of price in life: "Patriot Defence" teaches Ukrainian doctors according to world standards |trans-title= |date=March 9, 2016 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=www.zp-pravda.info |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 18, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ЗП"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patriotdefence.org/ua/navchannya/mediki/pidtrimka-zhittya-pid-chas-travmi.-ukrayinska-programa.html |title=Ukrainian Trauma Life Support |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=[[Patriot Defence]] |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 18, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, at the [[P.L. Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education|NMAPE Academic Council]] meeting was discussed and approved the curriculum and the program of the on-site training cycle of thematic improvement: "Supporting life during injuries. Ukrainian program».&lt;ref name="НМАПО"/&gt;

== Improvement of medical dispatching ==

[[File:An emergency dispatch center in Finland.jpg |right|thumb|300px|A modern emergency dispatch center in [[Finland]].]]
In most [[oblast]]s of Ukraine, [[raion]]s or city has its own emergency medical dispatch center. They coordinate teams only of their own station and in usual situation send them only to their area of their responsibility. So, if accident takes place near the "border" of neighboring area, the dispatcher won't be able to see it. Consequently, he won't be able to send an ambulance for help, even if a few are located close nearby. In some [[raion]]s, calls are taken by doctors or nontrained nurses.&lt;ref name="Твоє місто_дисп"/&gt;  Centralized dispatch centers which take calls and coordinate EMS teams of the entire oblast exist only in several regional centers.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

With the introduction of modern centralized dispatch centers, specially trained dispatchers in the oblast level will take calls from all the region. Using the dispatch protocols, a dispatcher will determine if there is an urgent necessity to send an ambulance or not. Also, all ambulances will be equipped with [[GPS tracker]]s. Using the modern system will allow to track the call location. So, the dispatcher will see the location of all places of call and EMS teams in real time on the interactive map. He will be able to direct the nearest crew to the patient or victim, regardless of which station it belongs to.&lt;ref name="Твоє місто_дисп"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Харків"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emd.kh.ua/index.php/uk/home/about-emd |title=Municipal Health Care Facility "Center of Emergency and Disaster Medicine" |trans-title= |date= |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher= |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 21, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow to provide timely medical care even with limited resources.

== Introduction of emergency departments ==

[[File:FEMA - 18213 - Photograph by Robert Kaufmann taken on 10-25-2005 in Louisiana.jpg |right|thumb|300px|Emergency department in [[Louisiana]].]]
An emergency department (ED) is a medical treatment facility specializing in [[emergency medicine]], the [[acute (medicine)|acute]] care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an [[ambulance]]. The emergency department is usually found in a [[hospital]] or other [[primary care]] center.

Currently, most hospitals in Ukraine have reception departments ({{lang-uk|приймальне відділення}}, {{IPA-uk|prɪjməlʲnɛ vidːilɛnʲːə}}). There are usually no beds for patients' stay and often there are no conditions for providing high quality care. Often there is no physician for full day or in different days there are on duty physicians from different specialities, who can not provide proper emergency care.&lt;ref name="Умань"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/news/34591-20-hvilin-blagali-dopomogti-v-umani-cherez-bajduzhist-likariv-pomer-66-richnij-cholovik.htm |title=In Uman, a 66-year-old man died|trans-title= |date=June 2, 2017 |author1= |authorlink1= |publisher=Observer |editor= |pages= |language=Ukrainian |accessdate=January 21, 2018 |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Healthcare Reform, an emergency department should be a standard for a multi-profile hospital, which provides care in the case of emergency. Only specially trained doctors of emergency medicine will work in ED. So they can better use their knowledge and skills to help patients. It will also help to bring qualitative care to the patient.&lt;ref name="112Д"/&gt;

'''''Epidemiology in Country Practice''''' is a book by  [[William Pickles]] (1885–1969), a rural [[general practitioner]] (GP) physician in [[Wensleydale]], [[North Yorkshire]], England, first published in 1939. The book reports on how careful observations can lead to correlations between transmission of infective disease between families, farms and villages.

It contains the detailed observational studies of a 1928 epidemic of [[Hepatitis A|catarrhal jaundice]] and a 1929 epidemic of [[Bornholm disease]] which were published in the ''British Medical Journal'' ''(BMJ)'' in 1930 and 1933 respectively.

==Background==
William Pickles first realised the possibilities for epidemiological studies for a GP after he read [[James Mackenzie (cardiologist)|James Mackenzie]]'s ''The Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment in Heart Affections'' in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Digby1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Digby|first=Anne|title=The evolution of British general practice 1850–1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrtQAQAAIAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=218|isbn=0-19-820513-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”:Obituary1969”/&gt; 

With the assistance of his wife Gertie, who kept the charts, Pickles recorded his observations on a 1928 epidemic of [[Hepatitis A|catarrhal jaundice]] and a 1929 epidemic of Bornholm Disease in his district. His findings were published in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1930 and 1933 respectively&lt;ref name=”:Obituary1969”/&gt; and in 1935 he presented them at the [[Royal Society of Medicine]]. The work was praised by [[Major Greenwood]] who wrote that Pickles's work would mark a "new era in [[epidemiology]]".&lt;ref name=":RCGPArchives"/&gt; His observations led to new understandings of the transmission of infective disease within families, farms and villages.&lt;ref name="Smallman-RaynorCliff2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Smallman-Raynor|first1=Matthew |last2=Cliff|first2=Andrew|title=Atlas of Epidemic Britain: A Twentieth Century Picture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMnN4fZrj70C&amp;pg=PA163|year=2012|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957292-2|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and content==
''Epidemiology in Country Practice'' contains Pickles's [[observational studies]] and a number of articles previously published in medical journals, including the detailed observational studies of the 1928 epidemic of jaundice and the 1929 epidemic of Bornholm disease.&lt;ref name=”:Obituary1969”/&gt;  The book has been described as more of an essay on [[epidemiology]] than a book filled with masses of data.&lt;ref name=jama/&gt;

Most of the research was done between 1929 and 1939.&lt;ref name=":HorderJRCGP1969"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horder|first=John|date=1969|title=The William Pickles Lecture 1969|url=https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2236908&amp;blobtype=pdf|journal=Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|volume=18|pages=9-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1937, in order to work on the book, Pickles kept evening surgeries "to a minimum and often there were no patients at all".&lt;ref name=" MoorheadJRSM2001"/&gt; He methodically reported patterns of prevalent diseases in his area;&lt;ref name="Smallman-RaynorCliff2012"/&gt; however, his data collection and publications lacked the consent processes now considered necessary to avoid identification of individuals afflicted by epidemics, particularly in small communities where recognition of persons is deemed easier.&lt;ref name=":Fraser"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=John|date=1 February 2004|title=A case report: ethics of a proposed qualitative study of hospital closure in an Australian rural community|url=https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/21/1/87/597873|journal=Family Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=87–91|doi=10.1093/fampra/cmh119|issn=0263-2136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickles was well acquainted with the eight villages he looked after,&lt;ref name="GriffithsSanders2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Griffiths|first1=Danielle |last2=Sanders|first2=Andrew |title=Bioethics, Medicine and the Criminal Law: Volume 2: Medicine, Crime and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1ggAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-61988-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once, as he looked down upon [[Wensleydale]] from the top of a hill, realised that he knew everyone in the village and most on first-name basis.&lt;ref name=" MoorheadJRSM2001"/&gt;

The book begins with a personal appeal by Pickles for GPs to consider the importance of observations, followed by eight chapters that cover cases such as "[[influenza]], [[measles]], [[scarlet fever]], [[whooping-cough]], and [[mumps]]", as a well as jaundice and myalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/epidemiology-in-country-practice/pickles/978-1-4831-6765-7|title=Epidemiology in Country Practice – 1st Edition|last=Elsevier|first=|date=|website=www.elsevier.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One story is that of a "gypsy" who accompanied her sick husband into the village in a caravan. Her husband was suffering from [[typhoid]] and Pickles was able to trace the source of the disease to a faulty water pump that the wife used to wash her laundry. In the book, he compares the case to the work of one of his heroes, [[William Budd]], who carried out similar observations.&lt;ref name="Smallman-RaynorCliff2012" /&gt;

The book also describes an epidemic of catarrhal jaundice that resulted in 250 cases out of a population of almost 6,000, many of which were children. The exact [[incubation period]] was not known and ranged from 3 to 40 days. After two years of keeping records and with assistance from the Ministry of Health, Pickles was able to show that the incubation period was 26–35 days. He cross-referenced the evidence with smaller studies in neighbouring villages and in one case was able to trace 13 infections to a single country maid who was determined to attend a fete despite Pickles attending to her in her sickbed the same morning.&lt;ref name=":RCGPArchives"&gt;[https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/download/GB%202134%20B%20PIC GB/2134/ B PIC PERSONAL PAPERS WILLIAM PICKLES], Royal College of General Practitioners, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" MoorheadJRSM2001"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pickles of Wensleydale | journal = [[J R Soc Med]] | author =R.

(1949) ''Epidemiology in Country Practice''. Bristol: John Wright &amp; Sons. pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The book was first published by [[John Wright &amp; Sons]] of Bristol in 1939. It had a preface by Major Greenwood, professor of epidemiology and vital statistics at the University of London. In April 1941, during the Second World War, the entire stock of the book, unbound sheets and the type were completely destroyed by enemy action but such was the demand for the book that in 1949 it was reissued in virtually identical form.&lt;ref name="”:Obituary1969”"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=15 March 1969|title=Obituary – W N Pickles|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1982740/pdf/brmedj02023-0097.pdf|journal=[[British Medical Journal]]|volume=1|pages=719|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jama&gt;[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/307990?

In 1970, a limited edition was published with profits going to the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]] (RCGP) appeal.&lt;ref name="FryPinsent2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0zD7CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|title=A History of the Royal College of General Practitioners: The First 25 Years|last1=Fry|first1=John|last2=Hunt|first2=John|last3=Pinsent|first3=R.J.F.H.|date=6 December 2012|publisher=MTP Press Limited|year=|isbn=978-94-011-5917-3|location=Lancaster, UK|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was subsequently reprinted by Devonshire Press of Torquay in 1972 and in later editions by the RCGP (1984: {{ISBN| 0-85084-097-X}}).&lt;ref name=jama/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
The book was described by [[John Horder (physician)|John Horder]] in 1969 as a "classic", that "makes it all sound too easy and one wonders why no one had thought of it all before".&lt;ref name=":HorderJRCGP1969"/&gt; Pickles's obituary in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1969 declared that it had "received excellent notices"&lt;ref name=”:Obituary1969”/&gt; and in 2004, J.A. Reid portrayed it as "a seminal  book  that  has  been  read and assessed during past decades by  many  public  health  students and  practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health| date=2004| volume=58 |pages=:262–263|doi= 10.1136/jech.2003.010264|title=When I’m 64 ... will you still need me?

The book facilitated the link between research and primary care, resulting in the modern expansion of surveillance practices for improvements in [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Smallman-RaynorCliff2012"/&gt; In addition, it revealed that general practitioners could carry out "world class research" in the community.&lt;ref name="Lakhani2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Yvonne H.|last2=Howe|first2=Amanda|editor=Mayur K.

The '''food industry''' is a complex, global collective of diverse [[business]]es that supplies most of the food consumed by the world's population. Only [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]], those who survive on what they grow, and [[hunter-gatherers]] can be considered outside the scope of the modern food industry.

The food Industry includes:
* [[Agriculture]]: raising of crops and livestock, and seafood
* Manufacturing: [[agrichemicals]], agricultural construction, [[farm machinery]] and supplies, [[seed]], etc.
* [[Food processing]]: preparation of fresh products for market, and manufacture of prepared food products
* [[Marketing]]: promotion of generic products (e.g., milk board), new products, advertising, marketing campaigns, [[packaging]], [[public relations]], etc.
* [[Wholesale]] and [[food distribution]]: logistics, transportation, warehousing
* [[Foodservice]] (which includes catering)
* [[Grocery]], [[farmers' market]]s, [[public market]]s and other retailing
* Regulation: local, regional, national, and international rules and regulations for food production and sale, including [[food quality]], [[food security]], [[food safety]], marketing/advertising, and industry lobbying activities
* Education: academic, consultancy, vocational
* Research and development: [[food technology]]
* Financial services: credit, insurance

== Definitions ==

It is challenging to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale. The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] describes it thus:

: "...the whole food industry – from farming and food production, packaging and distribution, to retail and catering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/ |title=Industry|website=Food Standards Agency (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic Research Service of the [[USDA]] uses the term ''food system'' to describe the same thing:

: "The U.S. food system is a complex network of farmers and the industries that link to them. Those links include makers of farm equipment and chemicals as well as firms that provide services to agribusinesses, such as providers of transportation and financial services. The system also includes the food marketing industries that link farms to consumers, and which include food and fiber processors, wholesalers, retailers, and foodservice establishments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices.aspx |title= Food market structures: Overview|website= Economic Research Service (USDA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The term food industries covers a series of industrial activities directed at the processing, conversion, preparation, preservation and packaging of foodstuffs. The food industry today has become highly diversified, with manufacturing ranging from small, traditional, family-run activities that are highly labor intensive, to large, capital-intensive and highly mechanized industrial processes. Many food industries depend almost entirely on local agriculture or fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parmeggiani|first1=Lougi|title=Encyclopædia of Occupational Health and Safety|asin=B00E1WQZ9S|pages=2538|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agriculture and agronomy ==
{{Main|Agriculture|Agronomy}}
[[File:Junín Campo Cerrito Colorado 20130124 1.jpg|thumb|A soybean field in Junin, Argentina]]
Agriculture is the process of producing food, feeding products, fiber and other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals ([[livestock]]). The practice of agriculture is also known as "[[farming]]". Scientists, inventors, and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture. 1 in 3 people worldwide are employed in agriculture,&lt;ref name=DAOLab&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e01b.pdf|website=FAO.org|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it only contributes 3% to global GDP.&lt;ref name=FAOMac&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroeconomy|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e01c.pdf|website=FAO.org|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, fibre, and [[land reclamation]]. Agronomy encompasses work in the areas of [[plant genetics]], [[plant physiology]], [[meteorology]], and [[soil science]]. Agronomy is the application of a combination of sciences. Agronomists today are involved with many issues including producing food, creating healthier food, managing environmental impact of agriculture, and extracting energy from plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ImAnAgronomist.net |title=I'm An Agronomist! |publisher=Imanagronomist.net |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food processing ==
{{Main|Food processing}}

[[File:Meat packages in a Roman supermarket.jpg|thumb|Packaged [[meat]] in a [[supermarket]]]]

Food processing includes the methods and techniques used to transform raw ingredients into food for human consumption. Food processing takes clean, harvested or slaughtered and butchered components and uses them to produce marketable food products. There are several different ways in which food can be produced.

[[Bespoke|One-off production]]: This method is used when customers make an order for something to be made to their own specifications, for example a [[wedding cake]]. The making of one-off products could take days depending on how intricate the design is.

[[Batch production]]: This method is used when the size of the market for a product is not clear, and where there is a range within a [[product line]].  A certain number of the same goods will be produced to make up a batch or run, for example a bakery may bake a limited number of [[cupcake]]s.  This method involves estimating [[consumer demand]].

[[Mass production]]: This method is used when there is a mass market for a large number of identical products, for example [[chocolate bar]]s, ready meals and [[Canning|canned food]]. The product passes from one stage of production to another along a [[production line]].

[[Just-in-time (business)|Just-in-time (JIT)]] (production): This method of production is mainly used in [[restaurant]]s. All components of the product are available in-house and the customer chooses what they want in the product. It is then prepared in a [[kitchen]], or in front of the buyer as in [[delicatessen|sandwich delicatessens]], [[pizzerias]], and  [[sushi|sushi bars]].

== Industry influence ==
The food industry has a large influence on consumerism.  Organizations, such as The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), have been criticized for accepting monetary donations from companies within the food industry, such as Coca-Cola.&lt;ref name="Brody 354–358"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brody|first=Howard|date=2016-08-01|title=Professional medical organizations and commercial conflicts of interest: ethical issues|journal=Annals of Family Medicine|volume=8|issue=4|pages=354–358|doi=10.1370/afm.1140|issn=1544-1717|pmc=2906531|pmid=20644191}}&lt;/ref&gt; These donations have been criticized for creating a conflict of interest and favoring an interest such as financial gains.&lt;ref name="Brody 354–358"/&gt;

== Regulation ==
{{See also|Category:Food law}}
Since World War II, agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system in its entirety has been characterized by models that focus on monetary [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] at the expense of social and environmental integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schattman|first1=Rachel|title=Sustainable Food Sourcing and Distribution in the Vermont-Regional Food System|url=https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations exist to protect consumers and somewhat balance this economic orientation with public interests for food quality, food security, food safety, animal well-being, environmental protection and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szajkowska|first1=Anna|title=Regulating Food Law: Risk Analysis and the Precautionary Principle as General Principles of EU Food Law|publisher=Wageningen Academic Pub|isbn=9789086861941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xv0hgss2IEC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wholesale and distribution ==
[[File:2008-07-24 International truck docked at Duke Hospital South 2.jpg|thumb|A [[foodservice]] truck at a loading dock. Trucks commonly distribute food products to commercial businesses and organizations.]]

A vast global cargo network connects the numerous parts of the industry.  These include suppliers, manufacturers, warehousers, retailers and the end consumers.  [[Wholesale marketing|Wholesale markets]] for fresh food products have tended to decline in importance in urbanizing countries, including Latin America and some Asian countries as a result of the growth of [[supermarkets]], which procure directly from farmers or through preferred suppliers, rather than going through markets.

The constant and uninterrupted flow of product from distribution centers to store locations is a critical link in food industry operations. Distribution centers run more efficiently, throughput can be increased, costs can be lowered, and manpower better utilized if the proper steps are taken when setting up a [[material handling]] system in a warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/articles/2009-01-01/Boosting-efficiency-at-the-DC |website=Grocery Headquarters|title=Boosting efficiency at the DC|accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retail ==

With worldwide urbanization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2003/WUP2003.htm |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision|website= Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (United Nations)}}&lt;/ref&gt; food buying is increasingly removed from food production.  During the 20th century, the supermarket became the defining retail element of the food industry.  There, tens of thousands of products are gathered in one location, in continuous, year-round supply.

Food preparation is another area where the change in recent decades has been dramatic. Today, two food industry sectors are in apparent competition for the retail food dollar.  The grocery industry sells fresh and largely raw products for consumers to use as ingredients in home cooking.  The [[food service]] industry by contrast offers prepared food, either as finished products, or as partially prepared components for final "assembly".  Restaurants, cafes, bakeries and mobile [[food truck]]s provide opportunities for consumers to purchase food.

== Food industry technologies ==
[[File:Passaic Agricultural Chemical Works. 1876.jpg|thumb|The Passaic Agricultural Chemical Works, an [[agrochemical]] company, in Newark, New Jersey, 1876]]
Modern food production is defined by sophisticated technologies. These include many areas. [[Agricultural machinery]], originally led by the [[tractor]], has practically eliminated human labor in many areas of production. Biotechnology is driving much change, in areas as diverse as [[agrochemical]]s, [[plant breeding]] and food processing. Many other types of technology are also involved, to the point where it is hard to find an area that does not have a direct impact on the food industry. As in other fields, computer technology is also a central force, with computer networks and specialized software providing the support infrastructure to allow global movement of the myriad components involved.

== Marketing ==
{{main|Food marketing|Agricultural marketing}}
As consumers grow increasingly removed from food production, the role of product creation, advertising, and publicity become the primary vehicles for information about food. With processed food as the dominant category, marketers have almost infinite possibilities in product creation. Of the food advertised to children on television 73% is fast or convenience foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunkel|first=Dale|year=2009|title=The Impact of Industry Self-Regulation on the Nutritional Quality of Foods Advertised to Children on Television|url=http://lahealthaction.org/library/adstudy09_report.pdf|journal=Children Now|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor and education ==
[[File:Tartu Mill 04.jpg|thumb|Some equipment at [[Tartu Mill]], the largest grain milling company in the [[Baltic states]]. Modern food processing factories are often highly automated and need few workers.]]
Until the last 100 years, agriculture was [[labor-intensive]]. Farming was a common occupation and millions of people were involved in food production. Farmers, largely trained from generation to generation, carried on the family business. That situation has changed dramatically today. In America in 1870, 70-80 percent of the US population was employed in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmersedge.ca/blog/2013/07/04/neat-facts-about-united-states-agriculture Neat Facts About United States Agriculture], Retrieved November 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, less than 2 percent of the population is directly employed in agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm |title=Employment by major industry sector |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/qlinks/extension.html |title=Extension |publisher=Csrees.usda.gov |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 80% of the population lives in cities. The food industry as a complex whole requires an incredibly wide range of skills. Several hundred occupation types exist within the food industry.

[[File:Fundal height by gestational age.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of fundal height at various points during pregnancy]]

'''Fundal height''', or '''McDonald's rule''', is a measure of the size of the [[uterus]] used to assess [[Gestational age|fetal growth]] and development during [[pregnancy]]. It is measured from the top of the mother's uterus to the top of the mother's pubic symphysis. Fundal height, when expressed in centimeters, roughly corresponds to gestational age in weeks between 16 and 36 weeks for a vertex fetus. When a tape measure is unavailable, finger widths are used to estimate centimeter (week) distances from a corresponding anatomical landmark. However, landmark distances from the pubic symphysis are highly variable depending on body type. In clinical practice, recording the actual fundal height measurement from the palpable top of the uterus to the superior edge of the pubic symphysis is standard practice beginning around 20 weeks gestation.

Most caregivers will record their patient's fundal height on every prenatal visit. Measuring the fundal height can be an indicator of proper fetal growth&lt;ref name="pmid19914874"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morse K, Williams A, Gardosi J |title=Fetal growth screening by fundal height measurement |journal=Best Pract Res Clin Obstet Gynaecol |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=809–18 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19914874 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2009.09.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521-6934(09)00118-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amniotic fluid development.

Knowledge of gestational age may impact how the height is measured.&lt;ref name="pmid17906025"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jelks A, Cifuentes R, Ross MG |title=Clinician bias in fundal height measurement |journal=Obstet Gynecol |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=892–9 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17906025 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000282758.28533.d9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundal height landmarks==
{|class="wikitable" align="center"
! [[Gestational age]] !! Fundal height landmark
|-
| 12-14 weeks || [[Pubic symphysis]]
|-
| 20-22 weeks || [[Navel|Umbilicus]]
|-
| 36-40 weeks || [[Xiphoid process]] of sternum
|-
| 37–40 weeks || Regression of fundal height between 36–32&amp;nbsp;cm
|}

==Shorter measure==
A shorter measure can happen for one of the following reasons:
*Fetus descent into the pelvis, seen normally two to four weeks before delivery
*Error in estimated date of pregnancy based on first day of last menstrual period
*Fetus is healthy but physically small
*[[Oligohydramnios]]
*Non longitudinal lie
*[[Small for gestational age]] or [[Intrauterine Growth Restriction]]

==Longer measure==
On the other side, a longer measure can be caused by:
*[[Twins]], or other types of [[multiple birth]]
*Error in estimated date of conception
*Fetus is healthy but physically large
*[[Gestational diabetes]] causing a larger baby
*[[Polyhydramnios]]
*[[Large for gestational age]]
*[[Hydatidiform Mole]]
*[[Breech birth]]

As a [[pregnancy]] approaches its end, the fundal height will become less accurate.

'''Genomatix GmbH''' is a [[computational biology]] company headquartered in [[Munich]], Germany, with a seat of business in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], U.S.A.

== History ==
Genomatix was founded in 1997 by [http://www.bioinformatik-muenchen.de/perspektive/perspektive-bioinformatik-werner/ Dr. Thomas Werner] as a spin-off from the [[Helmholtz Zentrum München]] (formerly  "GSF - National German Research Institute for Environment and Health"). Helmholtz Zentrum Munich is part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. Genomatix pioneered the analysis and understanding of eukaryotic [[gene regulation]].

== Genomatix software tools ==
Genomatix offers integrated solutions and databases for [[genome annotation]] and regulation analysis.

Genomatix product portfolio contains solutions for:

• Literature and pathway mining&lt;br /&gt;
• [[Transcription factor]] analysis&lt;br /&gt;
• Genome annotation integrating a wide variety of transcript sources and a special focus on regulatory regions&lt;br /&gt;
• Analysis technology for high throughput genomic technologies ([[microarrays]] and next generation [[sequencing]])

'''Literature mining'''&lt;br /&gt;
LitInspector is a literature search tool providing gene and signal transduction pathway mining within NCBI's PubMed database.&lt;ref name="LitInspector Publication"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19417065 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkp303 | pmc=2703902 | volume=37 | title=LitInspector: literature and signal transduction pathway mining in PubMed abstracts | year=2009 | journal=Nucleic Acids Res | pages=W135-40 | last1 = Frisch | first1 = M | last2 = Klocke | first2 = B | last3 = Haltmeier | first3 = M | last4 = Frech | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LitInspector"&gt;[http://www.litinspector.org/] LitInspector start page.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personalized medicine]] developed to a major field for Genomatix.&lt;ref name="Personaliced Medicine"&gt;[http://www.genomatix.de/en/forscher.html] Genomatix and personalized medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Genomatix is involved in several projects and international conferences e.g. 5th Santorini Conference - "Functional Genomics towards personalized health care" &lt;ref name="Santorini Conference"&gt;[http://www.santorini2010.org/] Conference about personalized health care.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 Genomatix has strongly focused on Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. Because of the large amount of data and the need for high-end computing power, Genomatix deploys its solutions as in-house installations (hardware software bundle)

Two systems are available:

1. The Genomatix Mining Station (GMS) is based on a proprietary genomic pattern recognition paradigm, or GenomeThesaurus, which allows for input of raw sequence reads plus optional quality files from any deep sequencing hardware. It provides ultra fast mapping of sequences of any length (starting from 8bp) with no practical limits on the number of point mutations and/or insertions and deletions that can be taken into account during the mapping process. Depending on the nature of the experiment, the GMS can provide SNP detection and genotyping, copy number analysis, and small RNA analysis. For ChIPseq data, the GMS delivers clustering and peak finding, and performs automated binding pattern identification. For RNAseq experiments, normalized expression values are calculated at the exon and transcript level. A special GenomeThesaurus is also provided for potential splice junctions, which allows for splice junction analysis and identification of new transcriptional units.

For genomic re-sequencing and newly sequenced genomes, a de-novo assembly will be provided.

2. The Genomatix Genome Analyzer (GGA) delivers downstream software tools and databases for the deep biological analysis of data coming from the GMS. It allows for easy integration and visualization in the terabytes of background annotation of the ElDorado genome database. GGA extensively annotates genomic coordinates and surrounding areas derived by the GMS or any other mapping procedure. Clustering and peak finding, analysis for phylogenetic conservation, large scale correlation analysis with annotated genomic elements, meta-analysis of data correlation between different experiments, pathway mining for groups of identified genes, transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis ( identification, over-representation, binding partner analysis, framework identification, phylogenetic conservation, regulatory SNP effects) and much more are all processes carried out on the GGA.

With the GGA and GMS Genomatix delivers the worldwide first integrative data analysis platform for Next Generation Sequencing analysis with custom workflows tailored towards specific needs.

Further developments will be the link-up of data from clinical sources and medical applications. Pilot projects were already started within Genomatix’ consulting platform linking genotype and phenotype information.

[[Japanese cuisine]] has spread throughout the world, and representative dishes such as sushi and ramen, among others are popular.  In many cases, Japanese food is adapted and reinvented to fit the taste buds of the local populace.  For instance, the [[California roll]] is a popular dish in the United States that is a modification of the Japanese [[sushi#makizushi|makizushi]], a type of [[sushi]].  In [[South Korea]], both the Japanese curry and the ramen have been imported and popularized primarily in the form of instant food. [[Tonkatsu]] and [[tempura]], which are derived from Western food, are now considered and marketed as uniquely Japanese, as well as the [[Japanese curry]], which derived from the Indian curry.

In many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, and Brazil, Japanese restaurants have become popular.  Among these countries, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia are key consumers, according to recent research.

The market of Japanese ingredients is also growing, with brands such as [[Ajinomoto]], [[Kikkoman]], [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]] and [[Kewpie]] mayonnaise, are establishing production base in other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia.

[[Chinese cuisine]] has become widespread throughout many other parts of the world — from [[Asia]] to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Western Europe]] and [[Southern Africa]]. In recent years, connoisseurs of Chinese cuisine have also sprouted in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[South Asia]]. [[American Chinese cuisine]] and [[Canadian Chinese food]] are popular examples of local varieties. Local ingredients would be adopted while maintaining the style and preparation technique.

Traditional Chinese cuisines include [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]], [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]], [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]], [[Szechuan cuisine|Szechuan]], and [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]],&lt;ref name="beautyfujian"&gt;[http://beautyfujian.com/Fujian/Fujian_Cuisine.html "Fujian Cuisine.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731165745/http://beautyfujian.com/Fujian/Fujian_Cuisine.html |date=July 31, 2013 }} [http://beautyfujian.com Beautyfujian.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710001538/http://beautyfujian.com/ |date=July 10, 2011 }}.

These regional cuisines are sometimes referred to as the "eight culinary traditions of China." A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine, but perhaps the best known and most influential are the Szechuan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong cuisines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.ku.edu/archived-site/chinese_food/regional_cuisine.html "Regions of Chinese food-styles/flavors of cooking."] [http://www.kas.ku.edu/ University of Kansas], Kansas Asia Scholars. Retrieved June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources, [[climate]], [[Geography of China|geography]], [[History of China|history]], cooking techniques and lifestyle. Many Chinese traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of [[food preservation]] such as [[Drying (food)|drying]], [[Salting (food)|salting]], [[pickling]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]].&lt;ref name=Hsieh&gt;J.

[[Indian cuisine]] has contributed to shaping the history of [[international relations]]; the [[spice trade]] between India and [[Europe]] is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref name="cornillez1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Spice_Trade.html |title=The History of the Spice Trade in India |first=Louise Marie M. |last=Cornillez|date=Spring 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also had the created influence on international cuisines, especially those from [[Asian cuisine#Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]], the [[British cuisine|British Isles]] and the [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="vegvoyages.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegvoyages.com/food.htm |title=Nasi, Kari, Biryani &amp; Mee |publisher=Veg Voyages |accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiafood.org/features_dietary_culture4.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010525095845/http://www.asiafood.org/features_dietary_culture4.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 May 2001 |title=Asia Food Features |publisher=Asiafood.org |accessdate=23 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Indian spices, herbs and vegetable produce have helped shaped the cuisines of many countries around the world.

Indian cuisine consists of the foods and dishes of [[India]] (and to some extent neighboring countries), is characterized by the extensive use of various [[List of Indian spices|Indian spices]]&lt;ref name="Indiancuisine"&gt;[http://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/singapore-indian-cuisine/ "Indian Cuisine."] [http://www.visitsingapore.com VisitSingapore.com].

[[Indian cuisine#Regional cuisines|Indian regional cuisine]] is primarily categorized at the regional level, but also at provincial levels. Cuisine differences derive from various local cultures, geographical locations (whether a region is close to the sea, desert or the mountains), and economics. Indian cuisine is also seasonal, and utilizes fresh produce.

The cuisine of India is very diverse with each state having an entirely different food platter. The development of these cuisines have been shaped by Hindu and Jain beliefs, in particular vegetarianism which is a common dietary trend in Indian society. There has also been Islamic influence from the years of Mughal and Delhi Sultanate rule, as well as Persian interactions on North Indian and Deccani cuisine. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies. Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played an important role in introducing certain food types and eating habits to the country. For instance, potato, a staple of North Indian diet was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chiles and breadfruit among other things. Spices were bought from India and traded in exchange for rubber and opium from Malacca. It has also influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles and the Caribbean.

American cuisine is a style of food preparation originating from the [[United States of America]]. [[European colonization of the Americas]] yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country. [[Native American cuisine]] includes all food practices of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Modern-day native peoples retain a rich body of traditional foods, some of which have become iconic of present-day Native American social gatherings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6941">'''HIV/AIDS in El Salvador''' has a less than 1 percent prevalence of the adult population reported to be [[HIV-positive]], [[El Salvador]] and therefore there is a low-HIV-prevalence country, but the [[virus]] remains a significant threat in high-risk communities, such as [[commercial sex workers]] (CSWs) and [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM).

==Prevalence==
Overall prevalence has increased since the first case was detected in 1984. Since that time, 18,282 HIV/[[AIDS]] cases have been reported in the country. Incidence appears to have declined since 2004, but there is a fear that because of the lack of an effective monitoring system, many HIV/AIDS cases are not reported (according to a [[UNAIDS]] May 2006 report, 40 to 50 percent of cases are under-reported). [[Heterosexual]] sex is the main route of HIV transmission in El Salvador, accounting for 79 percent of HIV cases in the country. The [[epidemic]] is predominantly in urban areas and is becoming increasingly feminized as the percent of women with HIV rises. Although prevalence is 3 percent among sex workers, it is as high as 16 percent in specific areas, such as [[Puerto de Acajutla]]. Prevalence is also high among MSM (17.8 percent, the highest in Central America). One study from 2002 reported by UNAIDS in 2007 demonstrated that infection levels among MSM in El Salvador were 22 times higher than among the general population. Moreover, stigma and discrimination (S&amp;D) against MSM lead to hidden behaviors, and, as a result, there is probably considerable under-reporting of the epidemic among this group. The [[National AIDS Program]] (NAP) estimates that 51 percent of reported AIDS cases occur in the 25- to 34-year-old age group. Although estimates vary, about 85 percent of infections are sexually transmitted, of which 4 percent are cases of homosexual transmission and 3 percent bisexual transmission. According to the national [[sexually transmitted disease]] (STD) and HIV/AIDS program, the range for new HIV/AIDS infections per day is between 4.5 and 5.5 cases. [[Mortality rate|Mortality]] due to AIDS represented the seventh-leading cause of death in hospitals for the population as a whole and the leading cause in the 20 to 59 age group. El Salvador contributes 18.4 percent of all cases in the Central America subregion and has the third-largest number of cases behind [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Factors that put El Salvador at risk of a larger epidemic include early initiation of sex, limited knowledge or practice of preventive practices among people engaging in high-risk behaviors, and the country’s large mobile population. The National Health Survey conducted in 2002 and 2003 indicated that 32 percent of females aged 15 to 19 were already sexually active. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS remains somewhat limited, as evidenced by one multicenter study in which 40 percent of MSM had false beliefs about the modes of transmission of HIV. Among sex workers, an estimated 90 percent do not use condoms with regular partners. Compounding these issues are S&amp;D toward HIV-infected individuals and at-risk groups, which can deter people from getting tested and receiving adequate support if they have the disease.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/lac/elsalvad_profile.pdf "Health Profile: El Salvador"]. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National response==
Although the Government of El Salvador began initial HIV/AIDS prevention activities as early as 1988, stigma surrounding HIV persists. In 2001, El Salvador passed legislation protecting patients’ rights and guaranteeing access to treatment.
El Salvador’s NAP was established in 1987, and it continues to work closely with various state ministries, civil society, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The country is now implementing its fourth HIV/AIDS strategic plan for 2005 to 2010. The new plan aims to improve the population’s knowledge about HIV/AIDS, strengthen preventive and protective measures, and extend coverage of HIV/AIDS services for vulnerable groups.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Following the worldwide [[Three Ones]] principles, El Salvador formed the National AIDS Commission (CONASIDA) to act as the country’s AIDS coordinating mechanism. One of the achievements of CONASIDA was the development of the 2005 [[National Policy for Comprehensive HIV Care]]. Important government activities include signing the Declaration of [[San Salvador]] for fighting AIDS in Central America and the Caribbean and the creation of an HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program for mobile populations. The latter is particularly important because El Salvador is a corridor for migrants. El Salvador is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006-2015 of the [[Pan American Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

Free HIV testing began in El Salvador in 1997, and in January 2002, the Ministry of Health (MOH) began to offer [[antiretroviral]] treatment (ART). By December 2006, 174 health facilities and two mobile clinics offered HIV testing for free, and 3,447 people were receiving ART without charge. In cooperation with other countries in the region, the [[Salvadoran Government]] negotiated with major [[pharmaceutical manufacturers]] and received price reductions on antiretroviral drugs. Currently, 39 percent of people infected with HIV who need ART receive it. In 2003, the country began a national program called Make the Decision to Wait to teach adolescents about safer sexual behaviors and to abstain from [[sex]], and in 2005, two major campaigns were launched to combat stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

President [[Elías Antonio Saca González]] declared June 27, 2007, [[National HIV Testing Day (El Salvador)|National HIV Testing Day]]. With the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the regional [[NGO]] [[Pan American Social Marketing Organization]] (PASMO) managed the event’s publicity campaign. The campaign resulted in 54,461 tests, exceeding the 40,000 target. Nearly three times the normal monthly average of tests done in all of 2006 were conducted on this one day. The [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] is also currently supporting the MOH and the [[United Nations Development Program]] to develop a strategy for fighting HIV/AIDS in vulnerable populations to help poverty reduction. Despite these efforts, improved monitoring and surveillance and campaigns to raise awareness are needed.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

'''Healthcare Transport''' is the systematic process by which patient- and business-critical materials, such as [[Laboratory specimen|patient specimens]], [[pharmaceuticals]], supplies and [[medical records]] are transported to and from multiple touch points within healthcare organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jhconline.com/transportation-services-and-the-supply-chain.html Healthcare transport differs from a traditional medical courier]&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_13/sr13_159.pdf Each year, 83% of adults and 90% of children in the [[United States]] have contact with a [[health care professional]]. In total, these events add to greater than 1.1 billion ambulatory care visits to physician offices, hospital outpatient departments and emergency rooms.]

According to a recent article&lt;ref&gt;[http://scm.ncsu.edu/blog/2011/05/20/re-thinking-healthcare-transportation/ Re-thinking healthcare transportation]&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Robert Handfield,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supplychainredesign.com/robert-handfield.php http://www.supplychainredesign.com/robert-handfield.php]&lt;/ref&gt; a true healthcare transport partner supports [[healthcare]] organizational business objectives beyond transactional pickups and deliveries to address cost efficiencies, centralization, standardization, error reduction, technology maximization, management reporting for strategic decision-making, system connectivity and analytics for a platform for growth.

The daily movement of these critical materials directly impacts an organization’s ability to deliver optimal care.

==Details==
The film was produced between 1966-1967 by Rinco-Film in Munich for the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|West German Federal Ministry of Health]] under health minister Käte Ströbel through the German Health Museum.&lt;ref name="MeierHäussler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Meier|author2=Thomas Häussler|title=Zwischen Masse, Markt und Macht: das Medienunternehmen Ringier im Wandel 1833-2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A11IAQAAIAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Chronos|isbn=978-3-0340-0952-2|volume=1|page=493|quote=Im Auftrag der deutschen Gesundheitsministerin Käte Ströbel produzierte sie den überaus erfolgreichen Aufklärungsfilm «Helga - Vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens»..}}&lt;/ref&gt; It documents the pregnancy of a young woman from the first visit to the doctor all the way to childbirth.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MierschBroder2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Miersch|author2=Henryk M.

==Impact==
The film has been studied due to its impact on German society  involving the sociopolitical implications of the intervention by the West German federal government in matters of sexual education involving the [[mass media]] as well as the curriculum they approved regarding sexual matters. The West German federal government used the film as an educational tool but also as a means to gain influence in areas such as public health and education which were traditionally under regional jurisdiction,  possibly even bypassing constitutional issues governing the distribution of powers between the Federal government and the regions. Up to that time, regional authorities could veto Federal policies which were seen by  them as encroaching on their cultural policies.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; 

The success of the film when viewed by an audience of a wide and diverse demographic was analysed in terms of its influence on social thinking. [[Gender issues]] related to the film have been considered due to the fact that matters  traditionally concerning privacy, intimacy and femininity, up to that point in time, were made public to a wide demographic through film and the mass media. The commercial success of the film has also been examined since it was a sex-education film without any famous actors or an elaborate plot.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The film was successful in countries such as France, Italy and England which were considered "prudish" at the time.&lt;ref name="Jogschies1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rainer Jogschies|title=Wer zweimal mit derselben pennt--: die befreiten Sechziger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XthGAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22&amp;dq=%22Helga+%E2%80%93+Vom+Werden+des+menschlichen+Lebens%22|year=1991|publisher=Ullstein|page=75|quote=So sah denn Helga - vom Werden des menschlichen Lebens (1967) auch aus - und wurde dadurch im noch prüderen Frankreich, England und Italien ein überraschender Kassenerfolg.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris, 1,500 catholic priests and nuns attended a private screening of the film arranged by ''centrale catholique''. The film was also extensively covered by print media such as ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Paris Match]]''.&lt;ref name="Julian2011"/&gt;

The film was a product of a political decision by the West German Federal government to educate the people regarding matters related to procreation and [[family planning]] at a time of advances in the fields of human genetics and contraception. The film gained acceptance in the young adult demographic due to their desire to be informed about issues related to family planning and childbirth as part of a consumer society in which women had to work. Educators, although worried about the impact of the violence of the scenes during childbirth upon the young, also accepted that the film could aid the understanding of husbands concerning the great pains experienced by their wives during childbirth. The film also  presented a new model of informed motherhood based on knowledge and social awareness.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews, with the conservative press leading the way. ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described the film as "enlightening in a comprehensive and rational manner, without hypocrisy and false shame".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; The critic added: {{blockquote|The cell proliferation is an aesthetic pleasure, an opal-like miracle of colour with effects of light and  backlight, a piece of art from the era of [[Tachisme]]. The colours are so nice, the fast changes so wonderful that one nearly forgets the subject. Other processes [e.g. the representation of the different stages of the embryo] were still difficult to represent, some shots succeeded here for the first time; experts will rack their brains over how this was achieved}}

The conservative ''Mindener Tageblatt'' commented that "the really scientific information had been conveyed in a flawlessly proper manner without prudery and without arousing inappropriate sexual feelings".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The left-liberal press was more critical of the film. The ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' critic remarked that:&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt; {{blockquote|we are at the point of wasting one of our basic rights: the right to keep silent and to privacy [verschlossene Türen] about certain aspects of life which should not be revealed to the public eye as they belong to the private sphere of human nature.}}

The press which was present at the [[sneak preview]] also criticised the film's "ridiculous frame action", "heavy didactic tone" and "lack of contraceptive information". Women correspondents also complained that Helga in "her perfect makeup" during childbirth "did not adequately depict the pain of the anonymous woman in labour".&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

Other audience reactions included those of some teenage girls which were shocked by the [[placenta]] removal scenes and the subsequent revelations that the placenta was used for the production of cosmetics. The perspective and appearance of medical instruments was also criticised as reminiscent of a horror film.&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

The ''Protestant Film Observer'' criticised the presentation  aspects of the film and the absence of information on family planning, [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="SauerteigDavidson2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7402">[[File:Jenette H. Bolles.jpg|thumb|Jenette H. Bolles, ''Representative Women of Colorado'', 1914]]
'''Jenette H. Bolles''' (1862 or 1863–1930), also known as '''Nettie Bolles''', was an American medical doctor. She was the first woman to study and have a career as an [[osteopathy|osteopath]] and the first osteopath in the state of Colorado. She held a number of positions in the medical field and was a suffragette.

==Early life and education==
Jenette Hubbard was born on September 12, 1862&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt; or 1863 in [[Douglas County, Kansas]]. Her parents were Martha Jenette (Merrill) Hubbard and David Hubbard.&lt;ref name="Derby"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Derby|author2=James Terry White|title=The National Cyclopædia of American Biography: Being the History of the United States as Illustrated in the Lives of the Founders, Builders, and Defenders of the Republic, and of the Men and Women who are Doing the Work and Moulding the Thought of the Present Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjkOAQAAMAAJ|year=1940|publisher=J. T. White}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended public school in [[Olathe, Kansas]] before studying and graduating from [[Kansas State University]] with a B.S. degree in 1885.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt; 

Bolles became interested in osteopathy based upon the treatment her family received by Dr. [[Andrew Taylor Still|Andrew Still]]. Her father had been seriously wounded by gunfire and left for dead during border skirmishes in the 1850s and Still removed the bullet and restored her father’s health. She was also satisfied later by the treatment that her mother received after she was paralyzed from a fall. She then decided to further her education by studying osteopathy.&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas A. Quinn|title=The Feminine Touch: Women in Osteopathic Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9KTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|date=April 1, 2011|publisher=Truman State University Press|isbn=978-1-935503-13-2|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[American School of Osteopathy]] in [[Kirksville, Missouri]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;  In 1908, she received a master's degree from the [[University of Denver]]. She was a member of the [[Pi Beta Phi]] sorority.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;{{cite book|author=John W. Leonard|title=Woman's Who's who of America: A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporary Women of the United States and Canada, 1914-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMQ-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA112|year=1914|publisher=American commonwealth Company|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|There is a profession… which is peculiarly adapted to women, which is fascinating, satisfactory, and directly beneficial to mankind… it is Osteopathy.|—Jenette "Nettie" Bolles, DO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas A.

Upon graduation from the School of Osteopathy, she was accepted as a member of the faculty and became a professor of anatomy.&lt;ref name="DiGiovannaSchiowitz2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eileen L. DiGiovanna|author2=Stanley Schiowitz|author3=Dennis J.

There were other women in her graduating class, but she was the only woman to pursue a long-standing career. She practice osteopathy, wrote about it, and taught it. She was also the first female educator in the field of osteopathy.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt; She specialized in diseases of the urinary system, bladder, and kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Osteopathic Physician|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6szVKFuRpaUC&amp;pg=RA7-PA1|year=1917|publisher=Osteopathic Publishing Company|pages=22–23|chapter=Activities of the Academy of Osteopathic Clinical Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first editor and publisher of the ''[[Journal of Osteopathy]]''.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;

In 1896 she moved to Denver, becoming the state's first osteopath. Bolles founded the Western Institute for Osteopathy in 1897.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt; The school, a charter member of the Associated Colleges of Osteopathy, maintained a course of four-five month terms. She was the president and her husband was the dean.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmons Rutledge Booth|title=History of Osteopathy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg6jQzKegQQC&amp;pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=JOLANDOS eK|isbn=978-3-936679-04-5|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named Bolles Institute of Osteopathy after her husband received his degree in 1898, and then in 1900 it was named College of Osteopathy. The school was transferred in 1904 to the American School of Osteopathy in Missouri.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Booth" /&gt; She held state and national positions in the medical field. In 1910, she addressed the National Association at [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt; Bolles served on the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners, the first osteopath to do so.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt; She was offered the appointment to the State Medical Board by Governor [[John F. Shafroth]], but she turned it down because they did not recognize osteopathy.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;  

She was a member of the national, state, and local osteopathic associations.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt; She was the founding president of the American Colleges of Osteopathy in 1898. The prior year, she was the vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Osteopathy, now known as the [[American Osteopathic Association]] (AOA). She became the first woman to be nominated for president of the AOA in 1917. She received the AOA Distinguished Service Certificate for "Pioneering in Osteopathy as a Profession for Women" in 1925. Bolles helped found the Osteopathic Women's National Association and served as president three times.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;

==Personal life==
She married Newton A. Bolles in 1887,&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby" /&gt; who was also a graduate of the School of Osteopathy and received his degree in 1898.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt; They had two daughters, Helen Louise, born in 1898 and Ester, born in 1900.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derby" /&gt;

Bolles was an active member of the Mother’s Congress, now called the [[Parent-Teacher Association|Parent Teachers Association]], and served on the Child Hygiene Committee. She served as the representative for Colorado at the final International Congress of Child Welfare in [[Washington, D.C.]]. She was a suffragette, [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], and a Republican.&lt;ref name="Leonard" /&gt;

She died on February 23, 1930. Her daughter Ester, her son-in-law C. Robert Starks, and grandson C. Robert Starks Jr. all became osteopaths.&lt;ref name="Quinn" /&gt;

'''Lago dell'Antenna''' is an [[artificial lake]] in north-west [[Italy]], located in the [[Province of Genoa|Genoa]] ([[Liguria]]). Concerned [[comune]]s are [[Urbe]] and [[Sassello]].&lt;ref name=lig&gt;{{cite web | title = Limiti Amministrativi (Comunali, Provinciali, Regionali) sc. 1:25000 - ed. 2011 | publisher =  Regione Liguria | url = http://geoportale.regione.liguria.it//geoviewer/pages/apps/repertorio/repertorio.html?id=637 | website = geoportale.regione.liguria.it| access-date = 2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The lake was realised blocking the [[Orba (torrente)|Orba]] with a dam a couple of km upstream San Pietro d'[[Urbe]], in oder to produce electricity in a small [[power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Rivista geografica italiana | volume = 80 | year  = 1973 | pages = 284–286 | publisher = Società di studi geografici | location = Florence  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its name comes from Monte Antenna (821&amp;nbsp;m), a mountain which overlooks the [[left bank]]s of the lake; right banks of the reservoir are flanked by the provincial road nr. 40 ''Urbe - Vara - [[Passo del Faiallo]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strada Provinciale SP 40 - Urbe - Vara - Passo del Faiallo | url = http://www.provincia.savona.it/aree-tematiche/trasporti-viabilita/284 | publisher = Provincia di Savona  | website =www.provincia.savona.it | access-date = 2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from ''Bric del Sozzo'' (650&amp;nbsp;m). The lake is located on the northern border of [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]], which encompasses its left shore.

== History ==
Antenna lake was realised in 1922 in order to provide water to the hydroelectric power plant of the ''Cotonificio Ligure'', located in San Pietro d'Orba. During the 1940s the reservoir capacity was considered insufficient and started dam extension works which ended on 1946, bringing the reservoir capacity up to around 50.000&amp;nbsp;m³. Present-day dam is a masonry [[arch-gravity dam]]; it finally inspection took place in February 1952.&lt;ref name=rel_prov_sv /&gt; Nowadays the reservoir capacity is restricted by the [[sedimentation]] on the lake bed and is estimated to be around 30,000&amp;nbsp;m³.

== Fishing ==
[[File:Diga di Antenna.png|thumb|left|upright|Antenna dam]]
Lake Antenna is classified, following [[Province of Savona]] fishing map, as a B category water body (''Acque di categoria B''), thus ''mixed population'' water. The lake is also defined as touristic fishing reserve (''riserva di pesca turistica''), and is restocked with [[rainbow trout]]s when authorised by [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua|Parco del Beigua]]. Restocking with [[Salmo trutta fario|brown trout]]s is not permitted because they are not considered native fish. The lake is the subject of a yearly fauna survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Detreminazione del direttore n.28 del 4 febbraio 2015 | publisher = Ente Parco del Beigua | url = http://www.parcobeigua.it/albOnline/2015/PRBEIdocumento27449.pdf  | access-date = 2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access rules are defined by [[Provincia di Savona]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author = m. pi.  |title = La Provincia consente apertura della pesca nella diga dell’Antenna di Urbe | date = 2011-04-29 | url = http://www.savonanews.it/2011/04/29/leggi-notizia/argomenti/attualit/articolo/la-provincia-consente-apertura-della-pesca-nella-diga-dellantenna-di-urbe.html | website = www.savonanews.it  | access-date = 2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurence Steinberg''' was born in 1952 and is an [[Americans|American]] university professor of [[psychology]], specializing in child and adolescent psychological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author =[[Claudia Dreifus]]| title =Developmental Psychologist Says Teenagers Are Different| quote = Laurence Steinberg, a developmental psychologist at Temple University in Philadelphia, is one of the leading experts in the United States on adolescent behavior and adolescent brain biology.| newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date =November 30, 2009| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/science/01conv.html| accessdate =August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TempleLSteinbergBio/&gt;
Steinberg is a professor at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he is a Distinguished University Professor, and where he holds a named position, the ''"Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology"''. He is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, has been a Faculty Scholar of the William T. Grant Foundation, and was Director of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice. Steinberg is a former President of the Division of Developmental Psychology of the American Psychological Association and of the Society for Research on Adolescence. Steinberg’s research has focused on a range of topics in the study of contemporary adolescence, including adolescent brain development, risk-taking and decision-making, parent-adolescent relationships, adolescent employment, high school reform, and juvenile justice. Steinberg proposed the [[Dual Systems Model]] of adolescent brain development. He has been a frequent consultant to state and federal agencies and lawmakers on child labor, secondary education, and juvenile justice policy.

Steinberg has been the recipient of numerous honors, including the National Academy of Sciences Henry and Bryna David Lectureship; the John P. Hill Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Study of Adolescence, given by the Society for Research on Adolescence; the Society for Adolescent Medicine’s Gallagher Lectureship; and several lifetime achievement awards given by the American Psychological Association, including the Urie Bronfenbrenner Award for Lifetime Contribution to Developmental Psychology in the Service of Science and Society, the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Research in Public Policy, and the Presidential Citation. In 2009, he was named the first recipient of the Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize for Productive Youth Development. In 2014, he received the Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Award, a national prize given to professors who have “inspired former students to make a contribution to society.”

Steinberg is the author of approximately 400 articles and essays on growth and development during the teenage years, and the author, co-author, or editor of 17 books, including ''Adolescence'', the leading college textbook on adolescent development; ''When Teenagers Work: The Psychological and Social Costs of Adolescent Employment'' (with Ellen Greenberger); ''Crossing Paths: How Your Child’s Adolescence Triggers Your Own Crisis'' (with Wendy Steinberg); ''Beyond the Classroom: Why School Reform Has Failed and What Parents Need to Do'' (with Bradford Brown and Sanford Dornbusch); ''The 10 Basic Principles of Good Parenting'', which has been published in 10 languages; ''You and Your Adolescent: The Essential Guide for Ages 10 to 25''; ''Rethinking Juvenile Justice'' (with Elizabeth Scott); and, most recently, ''Age of Opportunity: Lessons From the New Science of Adolescence''.  He has also written for many popular outlets, including the ''New York Times'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', the ''Washington Post'', ''Slate'', and ''Salon''.

Steinberg is frequently called upon to serve as an expert witness in cases involving juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name=SteinbergAgeOfOpportunity/&gt;
The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' called upon Steinberg to address, for its readers, the question as to whether 19-year-old [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]], convicted of the 2013 [[Boston Marathon bombing]], should be given a reduced sentence because he had always looked up to his older brother.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe2013-03-30/&gt;

''Age of Opportunity: Lessons from the New Science of Adolescence'', was published by Eamon Dolan/[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/12/01/science-adolescence-steinberg|title=The New Science Of Adolescence|work=[[WBUR-FM|WBUR]]|date=1 December 2014|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/laurence-steinberg/age-opportunity/|title=AGE OF OPPORTUNITY|author=Laurence Steinberg|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NprSteinbergAge/&gt; While introducing Steinberg, prior to interviewing him about this book, for [[National Public Radio]], [[Anya Kamenetz]] described how ''"his testimony has contributed to Supreme Court decisions abolishing the death penalty for juveniles and life without parole for juvenile offenders."'' Using ''Age of Opportunity'' as a starting point Wendy Leung, in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' credits Steinberg as ''"redefining"'' how we think about adolescence.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail2014-09-25/&gt; Leung notes how Steinberg's study of “[[neuroplasticity]]” justifies considering adolescence continuing up until 25 years old, because individuals brains weren't fully formed at that age.

From 1983 to 1988, he was professor at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and from 1977 to 1983, he was assistant professor at [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n7/abs/nrn3509.html|title=The influence of neuroscience on US Supreme Court decisions about adolescents' criminal culpability|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=19 August 2015|volume=14|doi=10.1038/nrn3509|pages=513–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; His PhD in [[developmental psychology]] is from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

| quote       = In his engrossing new book, Age of Opportunity: Lessons from the New Science of Adolescence, Steinberg calls for a radical change in how we think about and deal with adolescents. For starters, he redefines the term adolescence to include 10-year-olds to young adults up to the age of 25, reflecting a stage of development in which they aren’t yet socially or financially independent from their parents and their brains aren’t yet fully mature. To make this case, he draws on science that suggests individuals have heightened “neuroplasticity” during this stage of life, where their brains are more malleable than in adulthood.

:''You may also be looking for a journal [[Leisure Studies]]''
'''Leisure studies''' is a branch of the [[social sciences]] that focuses on understanding and analyzing [[leisure]]. [[Recreation]] and [[tourism]] are common topics of leisure research.

The [[National Recreation and Park Association]] is the national organization in the United States for leisure studies, and offers [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] to many universities to offer courses of study ([[Academic degree|degree]] programs) in leisure studies.

The ''Journal of Leisure Research''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr|title=Journal of Leisure Research|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'' are some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilderdom.com/journals/journalsRecreation&amp;Leisure.htm|title=Peer-reviewed Journals in Recreation &amp; Leisure Studies|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly US [[academic journal]]s of leisure studies.



==History==

While leisure studies has existed for much longer, a first centralized organization for directing leisure studies was established in [[Birmingham, England]], in May 1975, and is known as the Leisure Studies Association. In 1984, the first international conference was held by the LSA at the [[University of Sussex]] in Brighton, which also set the record as the largest LSA event held to date with over 275 attendees. LSA conferences are widely regarded as some of the most attended events for leisure researchers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leisurestudies.org/history-of-lsa|title=ORIGINS OF LSA - Leisure Studies Association|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Pursuing a degree in leisure studies will give students the opportunity to learn how to incorporate leisure into recreational activities and [[tourism]]. Students take a wide variety of classes ranging from [[psychology]] and [[social sciences]] to [[biology]] and [[anatomy]]. Students learn how to improve and foster a healthy life through leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinedegrees.org/degrees/leisure-studies/|title=Leisure Studies Degrees|work=Online Degrees|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leisure activities==
The leisure activities that people who work in leisure studies deal with include a very broad range of activities. Most of the activities can be separated into 3 sub-categories: sport and recreation, tourism, and leisure.
[[Sport]] and [[recreation]] activities is one of the broadest categories in leisure studies. This includes sports, both traditional and non-traditional, and any indoor or outdoor physical activities done for recreational purposes. Sport and recreation activities includes, but is not limited to, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[running]], [[hiking]], [[weight training|weight lifting]], [[playing]] [[games]] and other [[outdoor recreation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/parks-recreation-fitness-parks-recreation-leisure-studiesM|title=Big Future by The College Board|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tourism]] describes the traveling for leisure purposes. Destinations include [[public parks|parks]] and [[national parks]], [[hiking|hikes]], and domestic and foreign [[city|cities]].

All other activities that are not considered to be a part of sport and recreation or tourism are included general leisure activities. This category is quite vast, and includes, but are not limited to, [[yoga]], [[the arts]], [[nature conservation]], and other hobbies.&lt;ref name="csulb.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careers.csulb.edu/monographs/cohhs_recreatio.html|title=Careers Profiles|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career opportunities==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46776">The survival of some [[microorganisms]] exposed to [[outer space]] has been studied using both simulated facilities and [[low Earth orbit]] exposures. Bacteria were some of the first organisms investigated, when in 1960 a Russian satellite carried ''Escherichia coli'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'' into orbit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.indy100.com/article/bacteria-get-dangerously-weird-in-space-7380481| title=Bacteria get dangerously weird in space| last=Love| first=Shayla|date=2016-10-26| newspaper=The Independent| access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments since, as listed in the table below.

Experiments of the adaption of microbes in space have yielded unpredictable results. While sometimes the microorganism may weaken, they can also increase in their disease-causing potency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is possible to classify these microorganisms into two groups, the [[Medical microbiology|human-borne]], and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future [[Human spaceflight|crewed missions in space]], whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has pointed out that normal adults have ten times as many microbial cells as human cells in their bodies.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/microorganisms.html NASA – Spaceflight Alters Bacterial Social Networks (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also nearly everywhere in the environment, and although normally invisible, can form slimy biofilms.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Extremophiles have adapted to live in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. This includes [[hypersaline lake]]s, [[desert|arid regions]], [[deep sea]], acidic sites, cold and dry polar regions and [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of extremophiles has led to the speculation that microorganisms could survive the harsh conditions of extraterrestrial environments and be used as model organisms to understand the fate of biological systems in these environments. The focus of many of the experiments has been to investigate the possible survival of organisms inside rocks ([[lithopanspermia]]),&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt; or their survival on [[Mars]] for understanding the likelihood of past or present life on that planet.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'/&gt;  Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial [[spore]]s are considered likely potential [[Planetary protection|forward contaminants]] on robotic missions to [[Mars]].  Measuring the resistance of such organisms to space conditions can be applied to develop adequate decontamination procedures.&lt;ref&gt;

Research and testing of microorganisms in outer space could eventually be applied for [[directed panspermia]] or [[terraforming]].

The '''mandibular canine''' is the [[tooth]] located distally (away from the midline of the [[face]]) from both [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s of the [[mouth]] but mesially (toward the midline of the face) from both [[mandibular first premolar]]s.  Both the maxillary and mandibular [[Canine tooth|canine]]s are called the "cornerstone" of the mouth because they are all located three teeth away from the midline, and separate the premolars from the [[incisor]]s.  The location of the canines reflect their dual function as they complement both the premolars and incisors during [[mastication]], commonly known as chewing.  Nonetheless, the most common action of the canines is tearing of food.  The canine teeth are able to withstand the tremendous lateral pressures from chewing.  There is a single [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] on canines, and they resemble the [[prehensile]] teeth found in carnivorous animals.  Though relatively the same, there are some minor differences between the [[deciduous teeth|deciduous]] (baby) mandibular canine and that of the [[permanent teeth|permanent]] mandibular canine.

The mandibular canines begin to show calcification at age 4 months and the enamel of the crown is completely formed by age 7 years.  The permanent mandibular canines erupt at around 9 to 10 years of age.  The mandibular and maxillary canines are the longest teeth in the mouth.  The root of the mandibular canine, which is fully formed by age 13, is the longest in the mandibular arch.  The mandibular canines are slightly narrower than the maxillary canines but its crown is as long and sometimes is longer.  The mandibular canines usually have only one root, but sometimes the root may be bifurcated, or have two roots.  When it does, one root faces the tongue (lingual side) and one will face the lip (labial side).

In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal system of notation]], the deciduous mandibular canines are designated by a letter written in uppercase.  The right deciduous mandibular canine is known as "R", and the left one is known as "M".  The [[FDI World Dental Federation notation|international notation]] has a different system of notation.  Thus, the right deciduous mandibular canine is known as "83", and the left one is known as "73".

In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular canines are designated by a number.  The right permanent mandibular canine known as "27", and the left one is known as "22".  In the [[Palmer notation]], a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found.  For this tooth, the left and right canines would have the same number, "3", but the right one would have the symbol, "┐", over it, while the left one would have, "┌".  The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular canine is known as "43", and the left one is known as "33".

E-cigarette companies have been accused of using similar to [[Regulation of nicotine marketing|pre-regulation tobacco advertising]].&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt; A 2014 review said, "the e-cigarette companies have been rapidly expanding using aggressive marketing messages similar to those used to promote cigarettes in the 1950s and 1960s."&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt; E-cigarettes and nicotine are regularly promoted as safe and beneficial in the media and on brand websites.&lt;ref name=England2015/&gt; While [[tobacco advertising|advertising of tobacco]] products is banned in most countries, television and radio e-cigarette advertising in some countries may be indirectly encouraging traditional [[cigarette smoking]].&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt; There is no evidence that the cigarette brands are selling e-cigarettes as part of a plan to phase out traditional cigarettes, despite some claiming to want to cooperate in "harm reduction".&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt; 

According to a 2014 review, e-cigarettes are aggressively promoted in the US, mostly via the internet, as a healthy alternative to smoking.&lt;ref name=Rom2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rom |first1=Oren |last2=Pecorelli |first2=Alessandra |last3=Valacchi |first3=Giuseppe |last4=Reznick |first4=Abraham Z. |title=Are E-cigarettes a safe and good alternative to cigarette smoking? |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1340 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=65–74 |issn=0077-8923 |doi=10.1111/nyas.12609 |pmid=25557889|bibcode=2015NYASA1340...65R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical claims are also made, including "[[Medicalization|pharmaceuticalization]]", comparing e-cigarettes to [[nicotine inhaler]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.7326/M17-0759| issn = 0003-4819| volume = 167| issue = 4| pages = 278–280| last1 = Hendlin| first1 = Yogi Hale| last2 = Elias| first2 = Jesse| last3 = Ling| first3 = Pamela M.| title = The Pharmaceuticalization of the Tobacco Industry| journal = Annals of Internal Medicine| date = 2017-08-15| pmid = 28715843| pmc = 5568794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrity product endorsements===
[[Celebrity endorsements]] are also used to encourage e-cigarette use.&lt;ref name=Bauld2014&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311491/Ecigarette_uptake_and_marketing.pdf |author1=Linda Bauld |author2=Kathryn Angus |author3=Marisa de Andrade |title=E-cigarette uptake and marketing |publisher=[[Public Health England]] |pages=1–19 |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grana2014/&gt; A national US television advertising campaign starred [[Steven Dorff]] exhaling a "thick flume" of what the ad describes as "vapor, not tobacco smoke", exhorting smokers with the message "We are all adults here, it's time to take our freedom back."&lt;ref name=Nasaw2012/&gt; The ads, in a context of longstanding prohibition of tobacco advertising on TV, were criticized by organizations such as Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids as undermining anti-tobacco efforts.&lt;ref name=Nasaw2012/&gt; Cynthia Hallett of Americans for Non-Smokers' Rights described the US advertising campaign as attempting to "re-establish a norm that smoking is okay, that smoking is glamorous and acceptable".&lt;ref name=Nasaw2012/&gt; University of Pennsylvania communications professor Joseph Cappella stated that the setting of the ad near an ocean was meant to suggest an association of clean air with the nicotine product.&lt;ref name=Nasaw2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20583902 |title=Electronic cigarettes challenge anti-smoking efforts |publisher=BBC News |author=Daniel Nasaw |date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale===
In the United States, six large [[electronic cigarette|e-cigarette]] businesses spent $59.3 million on promoting e-cigarettes in 2013.&lt;ref name=reg_young/&gt;

=== Marketing to youth ===
[[Big tobacco]] heavily markets e-cigarettes to young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/e-cigarettes-and-lung-health.html|title=E-cigarettes and Lung Health|year=2015|publisher=American Lung Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth have been a primary target for the tobacco companies because the "use of tobacco products, no matter what type, is almost always started and established during adolescence when the developing brain is most vulnerable to nicotine addiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/tobaccoproducts/publichealtheducation/protectingkidsfromtobacco/default.htm|title=Youth and Tobacco|last=Products|first=Center for Tobacco|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), there was a sharp increase of 1.5 million more middle and high school students using e-cigarettes compared to 2017. From the analysis of the 2016 NYTS, CDC and the FDA were able to highlight some of the most common reasons why students use e-cigarettes, which included the various options of e-cigarette flavors and the false belief of inflicting less harm compared to other tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/PublicHealthEducation/ProtectingKidsfromTobacco/ucm405173.htm|title=Youth &amp; Tobacco - Youth Tobacco Use: Results from the National Youth Tobacco Survey|last=Products|first=Center for Tobacco|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marketing includes images associated with youth culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Franck |first1=Caroline |last2=Filion |first2=Kristian B. |last3=Kimmelman |first3=Jonathan |last4=Grad |first4=Roland |last5=Eisenberg |first5=Mark J. |title=Ethical considerations of e-cigarette use for tobacco harm reduction |journal=Respiratory Research |date=2016 |volume=17 |doi=10.1186/s12931-016-0370-3 |pmid=27184265 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869264/ |accessdate=19 November 2018 |issn=1465-9921|quote=However, the relative absence of restrictions to date in the US has led e-cigarette marketing to permeate most media outlets through the likes of celebrity endorsements, images associated with youth culture, and statements encouraging consumers to reclaim lost freedoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Industry strategies also include cartoon characters and candy flavors to sell e-cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/myths-and-facts-about-e-cigs.html|title=Myths and Facts About E-cigarettes|year=2015|publisher=American Lung Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flavoured products have been shown to be particularly attractive to younger people.&lt;ref name="flavoured_appeal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pepper |first1=J K |last2=Ribisl |first2=K M |last3=Brewer |first3=N T |title=Adolescents' interest in trying flavoured e-cigarettes |journal=Tobacco Control |date=November 2016 |volume=25 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=ii62–ii66 |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053174 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5125087/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies have been increasingly marketing many tobacco products that resembles different types of candy, like cotton-candy-flavored e-cigarettes. In 2014, there were more than 7,700 different e-cigarette flavours available online, with over 240 new additional flavors being added each month; fruit, candy, and dessert flavours are common.&lt;ref name=flavoured_CfTFK/&gt; Marketing flavoured e-cigarette products has been shown to attract children.&lt;ref name=flavoured_CfTFK&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nomoreflavoredtobacco.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Flavored_Tobacco_Attracts_Kids.pdf|title=FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ATTRACT KIDS|last=Bach|first=Laura|date=June 8, 2017|website=[[Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ads for flavoured e-cigarettes have been shown to cause children to be more interested in buying and trying e-cigarettes, as compared to ads for unflavoured e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ad_impact"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasiljevic |first1=Milica |last2=Petrescu |first2=Dragos C. |last3=Marteau |first3=Theresa M. |title=Impact of advertisements promoting candy-like flavoured e-cigarettes on appeal of tobacco smoking among children: an experimental study |journal=Tobacco Control |date=December 2016 |volume=25 |issue=e2 |pages=e107–e112 |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2015-052593 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5284337/ |accessdate=10 November 2018 |issn=1468-3318 |pmid=26781305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's belief that fruit-flavoured e-cigarettes are less harmful also increases their appeal, and restrictions on advertising for flavoured e-cigarettes have also been urged on these grounds.&lt;ref name="flavoured_appeal"/&gt; 

Products such as [[JUUL]] are marketed in a design which can easily be mistaken for a flash drive by parents and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/07/25/juul-under-investigation-allegedly-marketing-minors/834760002/|title=Vaping company JUUL investigated by Massachusetts for allegedly marketing to minors|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; JUUL is under federal investigation for illegally marketing to minors in the US as of 2018.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/science/juul-vaping-teen-marketing.html|title=Did Juul Lure Teenagers and Get ‘Customers for Life’?|work=[[The New York Times]]|last1=Richtel |first1=Matt |last2=Kaplan |first2=Sheila |date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth are highly exposed to the marketing of electronic cigarettes.

==Marketing regulation==
As of 2014, 39 countries containing 31% of the world's population have comprehensive e-cigarette advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans, and 19 countries containing 5% of the world's populations require products like e-cigarettes to be reviewed before being placed on the market.&lt;ref name=WHOPosition2014/&gt; However, these bans are not always well-enforced.&lt;ref name=WHOPosition2014/&gt; Easily circumvented age verification at company websites enables young people to access and be exposed to marketing for e-cigarettes.&lt;ref name=GranaLing2014&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Grana R.A., Ling P.M. |title="Smoking revolution": a content analysis of electronic cigarette retail websites |journal=Am J Prev Med |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=395–403 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2013.12.010 |pmid=24650842 |pmc=3989286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-cigarettes have been listed as drug delivery devices in several countries because they contain [[nicotine]], and their advertising has been restricted until safety and efficacy [[clinical trial]]s are conclusive.&lt;ref name=Cervellin2013&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cervellin| first1=Gianfranco| last2=Borghi| first2=Loris| last3=Mattiuzzi| first3=Camilla| last4=Meschi| first4=Tiziana| last5=Favaloro| first5=Emmanuel| last6=Lippi| first6=Giuseppe| title=E-Cigarettes and Cardiovascular Risk: Beyond Science and Mysticism|journal=Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis|volume=40|issue=01|year=2013|pages=060–065|issn=0094-6176|doi=10.1055/s-0033-1363468|pmid=24343348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since they do not contain whole [[tobacco]], television advertising in the United States is not restricted.&lt;ref name=MaloneyCappella2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maloney|first1=Erin K.|last2=Cappella|first2=Joseph N.|title=Does Vaping in E-Cigarette Advertisements Affect Tobacco Smoking Urge, Intentions, and Perceptions in Daily, Intermittent, and Former Smokers?|journal=Health Communication| year=2015| volume=31| pages=1–10| issn=1041-0236| doi=10.1080/10410236.2014.993496|pmid=25758192}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes and refill containers in print (newspaper, magazine, periodical), television, or radio media is prohibited in the [[European Union]] by the [[European Commission]]'s 2014 Tobacco Products Directive (incorporated in [[British law]] by the 2016 Tobacco and Related Products Regulations&lt;ref name="RoughBarber"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rough |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Barber |first2=Sarah |title=Briefing Paper No. 8114 |url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8114/CBP-8114.pdf |website=researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk |publisher=House of Commons Library |accessdate=9 October 2018 |pages=3, 10–12 |format=PDF |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Promotional elements on the packaging is prohibited, as is cross-border advertising and promotion of e-cigarette products.{{CN|date=November 2018}} Additionally, warning labels stating that the products contain nicotine and should not be used by non-smokers are mandatory, and a leaflet must be provided "with instructions for use and information on adverse effects, risk groups, addictiveness and toxicity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Electronic cigarettes |url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/ecigarettes_en |accessdate=9 October 2018 |work=Public Health |agency=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, billboard advertising, posters on domestic public transport, in the cinema, by leaflets or mail and in trade media is still permitted.&lt;ref name="RoughBarber" /&gt;

Due to concerns about the marketing of these flavored products targeting youths and people of color,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/san-francisco-2018-06/prop-e-flavored-tobacco-ban|title=Prop E - Flavored Tobacco Ban|date=2018-04-09|work=SPUR|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco banned the sale of flavored nicotine products, including flavoured e-liquids, in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/san-francisco-first-city-to-ban-e-cigarette-flavors|title=San Francisco first city to ban e-cigarette flavors|date=2018-06-26|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Yes-on-Prop-E-to-uphold-S-F-tobacco-12813433.php|title=Editorial: Yes on Prop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3674">'''Medical consensus''' is a public statement on a particular aspect of [[Medicine|medical]] knowledge at the time the statement is made that a representative group of experts agree to be [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] and [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] (state-of-the-science) knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, [http://www.leitlinien.de/mdb/edocs/pdf/literatur/coe-rec-2001-13.pdf Developing a methodology for drawing up guidelines on best medical practice] (Recommendation Rec(2001)13 and explanatory memorandum), Strasbourg: Council of Europe Publishing, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Its main objective is to counsel [[physician]]s on the best possible and acceptable way to diagnose and treat certain [[disease]]s or how to address a particular [[decision-making]] area. It is usually, therefore, considered an authoritative, community-based expression of a [[consensus decision-making]] and publication process.
==Methods==
There are many ways of producing medical consensus, but the most usual way is to convene an independent panel of experts, either by a [[medical association]] or by a governmental authority.

Since consensus statements provide a "snapshot in time" of the state of knowledge in a particular topic, they must periodically be re-evaluated and published again, replacing the previous consensus statement.

Consensus statements differ from [[Guideline (medical)|medical guideline]]s, another form of state-of-the-science public statements. According to the NIH, "Consensus statements synthesize new information, largely from recent or ongoing [[medical research]], that has implications for reevaluation of routine medical practices. They do not give specific [[algorithm]]s or guidelines for practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/infoquality/guidelines/NIHinfo2.shtml |title=Guidelines for Ensuring the Quality of Information Disseminated to the Public |date=13 December 2006 |publisher=United States Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 1977 to 2013, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (United States) promoted about five to six consensus panels per year, and organized this knowledge by means of a special Consensus Development Program, managed by the NIH's Office of Disease Prevention (ODP). It was retired in 2013 in deference to other agencies and organizations that had picked up the lead, such as the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]], the [http://www.thecommunityguide.org/about/aboutTF.html Community Preventive Services Task Force], [http://iom.nationalacademies.org/ Institute of Medicine], and [[Cochrane (organization)|Cochrane]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14833">In [[statistics]] and [[regression analysis]], '''moderation''' occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable.  The third variable is referred to as the '''moderator variable''' or simply the '''moderator'''.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cohen, Jacob |author2=Cohen, Patricia |author3=Leona S. Aiken |author4=West, Stephen H. | title = Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences | publisher = L. Erlbaum Associates | location = Hillsdale, N.J | year = 2003 | pages = | isbn = 0-8058-2223-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]];&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; that is, a [[Categorical variable|categorical]] (e.g., sex, ethnicity, class) or [[Level of measurement|quantitative]] (e.g., level of reward) [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] that affects the direction and/or strength of the relation between [[dependent and independent variables]].  Specifically within a [[correlation]]al analysis framework, a moderator is a third variable that affects the zero-order correlation between two other variables, or the value of the slope of the dependent variable on the independent variable. In [[analysis of variance]] (ANOVA) terms, a basic moderator effect can be represented as an [[interaction (statistics)|interaction]] between a focal [[Statistical independence|independent]] variable and a factor that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R. M., &amp; Kenny, D. A. (1986).  "The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations",  ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]],'' 5 (6), 1173–1182 (page 1174)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Moderation analysis in the [[behavioral sciences]] involves the use of [[linear regression|linear multiple regression analysis]] or causal modelling.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; To quantify the effect of a moderating variable in multiple regression analyses, regressing [[random variable]] ''Y'' on ''X'', an additional term is added to the model.  This term is the interaction between ''X'' and the proposed moderating variable.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt;

Thus, for a response ''Y'' and two variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and moderating variable ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3(x_1\times x_2) + \varepsilon \, &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the role of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a moderating variable is accomplished by evaluating ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the parameter estimate for the interaction term.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt;  See [[linear regression]] for discussion of statistical evaluation of parameter estimates in regression analyses.

== Multicollinearity in moderated regression ==
{{Details|Multicollinearity}}
In moderated regression analysis, a new [[Interaction (statistics)|interaction]] predictor (&lt;math&gt;x_1x_2&lt;/math&gt;) is calculated. However, the new interaction term will be correlated with the two main effects terms used to calculate it. This is the problem of [[multicollinearity]] in moderated regression. Multicollinearity tends to cause coefficients to be estimated with higher [[standard error]]s and hence greater uncertainty.

Mean-centering (subtracting raw scores from the mean) has been suggested as a remedy for multicollinearity.  However, mean-centering is unnecessary in any regression analysis, as one uses a correlation matrix and the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross-product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: Pearson Product-Moment Correlation). Also see the article by Kromrey &amp; Foster-Johnson (1998) on ''"Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing".''

== Post-hoc probing of interactions ==
Like simple main effect analysis in ANOVA, in post-hoc probing of interactions in regression, we are examining the simple slope of one independent variable at the specific values of the other independent variable. Below is an example of probing two-way interactions. 
In what follows the regression equation with two variables A and B and an interaction term A*B, 
:&lt;math&gt;Y = b_0 + b_1A + b_2B + b_3A*B + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;  
will be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=Testing and Interpreting Interactions in Regression-In a Nutshell|url=http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/psystat/documents/interaction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Two categorical independent variables ===
If both of the independent variables are categorical variables, we can analyze the results of the regression for one independent variable at a specific level of the other independent variable. For example, suppose that both A and B are single dummy coded (0,1) variables, and that A represents ethnicity (0 = European Americans, 1 = East Asians) and B represents the condition in the study (0 = control, 1 = experimental). Then the interaction effect shows whether the effect of condition on the dependent variable Y is different for European Americans and East Asians and whether the effect of ethnic status is different for the two conditions. 
The coefficient of A shows the ethnicity effect on Y for the control condition, while the coefficient of B shows the effect of imposing the experimental condition for European American participants.
 
To probe if there is any significant difference between European Americans and East Asians in the experimental condition, we can simply run the analysis with the condition variable reverse-coded (0 = experimental, 1 = control), so that the coefficient for ethnicity represents the ethnicity effect on Y in the experimental condition. In a similar vein, if we want to see whether the treatment has an effect for East Asian participants, we can reverse code the ethnicity variable (0 = East Asians, 1 = European Americans).

=== One categorical and one continuous independent variable ===
If the first independent variable is a categorical variable (e.g. gender) and the second is a continuous variable (e.g. scores on the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)), then b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represents the difference in the dependent variable between males and females when [[life satisfaction]] is zero. However, a zero score on the Satisfaction With Life Scale is meaningless as the range of the score is from 7 to 35. This is where centering comes in. If we subtract the mean of the SWLS score for the sample from each participant's score, the mean of the resulting centered SWLS score is zero. When the analysis is run again, b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; now represents the difference between males and females at the mean level of the SWLS score of the sample.

Cohen et al. (2003) recommended using the following to probe the simple effect of gender on the dependent variable (Y) at three levels of the continuous independent variable: high (one standard deviation above the mean), moderate (at the mean), and low (one standard deviation below the mean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cohen Jacob |author2=Cohen Patricia |author3=West Stephen G. |author4=Aiken Leona S. |title=Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-2223-2|pages=255–301|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the scores of the continuous variable are not standardized, one can just calculate these three values by adding or subtracting one standard deviation of the original scores; if the scores of the continuous variable are standardized, one can calculate the three values as follows: high = the standardized score minus 1, moderate (mean = 0), low = the standardized score plus 1. Then one can explore the effects of gender on the dependent variable (''Y'') at high, moderate, and low levels of the SWLS score. As with two categorical independent variables, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect of the SWLS score on the dependent variable for females. By reverse coding the gender variable, one can get the effect of the SWLS score on the dependent variable for males.

==== Coding in moderated regression ====
When treating categorical variables such as ethnic groups and experimental treatments as independent variables in moderated regression, one needs to code the variables so that each code variable represents a specific setting of the categorical variable. There are three basic ways of coding: Dummy-variable coding, Effects coding, and Contrast coding. Below is an introduction to these coding systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aiken L.S., West., S.G.|title=Multiple regression testing and interpretation.|year=1996|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Newbury Park, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=0-7619-0712-2|edition=1. paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cohen Jacob |author2=Cohen Patricia |author3=West Stephen G. |author4=Aiken Leona S. |title=Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences|year=2003|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-2223-2|pages=302–353|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dummy coding is used when one has a reference group or one condition in particular (e.g. a control group in the experiment) that is to be  compared to each of the other experimental groups. In this case, the intercept is the mean of the reference group, and each of the unstandardized regression coefficients is the difference in the dependent variable between one of the treatment groups and the mean of the reference group (or control group). This coding system is similar to ANOVA analysis, and is appropriate when researchers have a specific reference group and want to compare each of the other groups with it.

Effects coding is used when one does not have a particular comparison or control group and does not have any planned orthogonal contrasts. The intercept is the grand mean (the mean of all the conditions). The regression coefficient is the difference between the mean of one group and the mean of all the group means (e.g. the mean of group A minus the mean of all groups). This coding system is appropriate when the groups represent natural categories.

Contrast coding is used when one has a series of orthogonal contrasts or group comparisons that are to be investigated. In this case, the intercept is the unweighted mean of the individual group means. The unstandardized regression coefficient represents the difference between the unweighted mean of the means of one group (A) and the unweighted mean of another group (B), where A and B are two sets of groups in the contrast. This coding system is appropriate when researchers have an a priori hypothesis concerning the specific differences among the group means.

=== Two continuous independent variables ===
[[File:Two-way interaction effect example.png|thumbnail|right|An example of a two-way interaction effect plot]]
If both of the independent variables are continuous, it is helpful for interpretation to either center or standardize the independent variables, ''X'' and ''Z''. (Centering involves subtracting the overall sample mean score from the original score; standardizing does the same followed by dividing by the overall sample standard deviation.) By centering or standardizing the independent variables, the coefficient of ''X'' or ''Z'' can be interpreted as the effect of that variable on Y at the mean level of the other independent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, J. F. (2013). Moderation in management research: What, why, when and how. Journal of Business and Psychology. DOI: 10.1007/s10869-013-9308-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

To probe the interaction effect, it is often helpful to plot the effect of ''X'' on ''Y'' at low and high values of ''Z'' (some people prefer to also plot the effect at moderate values of ''Z'', but this is not necessary). Often values of ''Z'' that are one standard deviation above and below the mean are chosen for this, but any sensible values can be used (and in some cases there are more meaningful values to choose). The plot is usually drawn by evaluating the values of ''Y'' for high and low values of both ''X'' and ''Z'', and creating two lines to represent the effect of ''X'' on ''Y'' at the two values of ''Z''. Sometimes this is supplemented by simple slope analysis, which determines whether the effect of ''X'' on ''Y'' is [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] at particular values of&amp;nbsp;''Z''. Various internet-based tools exist to help researchers plot and interpret such two-way interactions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeremydawson.co.uk/slopes.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher-level interactions ===
The principles for two-way interactions apply when we want to explore three-way or higher-level interactions. For instance, if we have a three-way interaction between ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', the regression equation will be as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;Y = b_0 + b_1A + b_2B + b_3C + b_4A\cdot B + b_5A\cdot C + b_6B\cdot C + b_7A\cdot B\cdot C + \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Spurious higher-order effects ===
It is worth noting that the reliability of the higher-order terms depends on the reliability of the lower-order terms. For example, if the reliability for variable A is 0.70, and reliability for variable B is 0.80, then the reliability for the interaction variable A&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;B is 0.70&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;0.80&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.56. In this case, low reliability of the interaction term leads to low power; therefore, we may not be able to find the interaction effects between A and B that actually exist. The solution for this problem is to use highly reliable measures for each independent variable.
 
Another caveat for interpreting the interaction effects is that when variable A and variable B are highly correlated, then the A&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;B term will be highly correlated with the [[Omitted-variable bias|omitted variable]] A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; consequently what appears to be a significant moderation effect might actually be a significant nonlinear effect of A alone. If this is the case, it is worth testing a nonlinear regression model by adding nonlinear terms in individual variables into the moderated regression analysis to see if the interactions remain significant. If the interaction effect A*B is still significant, we will be more confident in saying that there is indeed a moderation effect; however, if the interaction effect is no longer significant after adding the nonlinear term, we will be less certain about the existence of a moderation effect and the nonlinear model will be preferred because it is more parsimonious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25031">The '''National Resident Matching Program''' ('''NRMP'''), also called '''The Match''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/ NRMP homepage] Retrieved on June 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[United States]]-based private [[non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization]] created in 1952 to place U.S. [[Medical education in the United States|medical school]] students into [[residency (medicine)|residency]] training programs located in United States teaching hospitals.  Its mission has since expanded to include the placement of U.S. citizen and non-U.S. citizen international medical school students and graduates into residency and fellowship training programs.  In addition to the annual Main Residency Match that encompasses more than 43,000 applicants and 31,000 positions, the NRMP conducts Fellowship Matches for more than 60 subspecialties through its Specialties Matching Service (SMS). The NRMP is sponsored by a Board of Directors that includes medical school deans, teaching hospital executives, graduate medical education program directors, medical students and residents, and one public member. 

NRMP International, a subsidiary of the National Resident Matching Program, was established in 2010 to provide medical matching services outside the United States and Canada. 

== History ==
From shortly after the first residency programs were formally introduced in the 1920s, the hiring process was "characterized by intense competition among hospitals for (an inadequate supply) of interns."&lt;ref name="Gusfield3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=Dan|title=The Stable Marriage Problem: Structure and Algorithms|year=1989|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=0-262-07118-5|pages=3–4|author2=Robert W. Irving|chapter=1.1.1}}
: Description of market based on {{cite journal|last=Roth|first=A.E.|title=The evolution of the labor market for medical interns and residents: a case study in game theory|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1984|volume=92|pages=991–1016|doi=10.1086/261272|citeseerx=10.1.1.535.561}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, hospitals benefited from filling their positions as early as possible, and applicants benefited from delaying acceptance of positions.  The combination of those factors led to offers being made for positions up to two years in advance of the start of postgraduate training.&lt;ref name="roth2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roth|first1=Alvin E.|title=The Theory and Practice of Market Design|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/roth-lecture.pdf|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, medical schools decided not to release any transcripts or permit any letters of recommendation to be written until a particular date. In that way, they managed to move the date of residency selection back to the fourth year of medical school. However, the competition for residents simply took on another form. Programs began to issue offers with a time limit for reply. The time limit rapidly decreased from 10 days in 1945 to less than 12 hours in 1950. Students were being issued "exploding" offers that required them to make a decision about training before hanging up the telephone. 

In the early 1950s, the National Interassociation Committee on Internships (NICI) examined existing matching plans and chose the Boston Pool Plan, utilized at the time by Boston-area programs, as the model for a trial run of a new centralized system. In October 1951, student representatives from 79 medical schools formed the National Student Internship Committee (NSIC) to discuss the findings of the NICI trial Match and consider an NICI proposal to replicate the Boston Pool Plan at the national level. NSIC petitioned to have the algorithm modified to more equitably represent applicants, and the modified algorithm was adopted and used for the first Match on April 15, 1952. That Match was a success, and the NICI recommended the creation of an organization to administer and oversee the running of the Match. The organization, known as the National Intern Matching Program (NIMP), was incorporated on January 7, 1953.

Modifications to the algorithm proposed by students in 1951 were based on concerns that the matching process favored hospitals over applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Medical seniors hit interne plan. New York Times 1951; 22 Oct:25 (col. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiller JG. An alum recalls the first matching plan.

Acad Med 1995; 70:470-476.&lt;/ref&gt; The students believed the algorithm gave them incentives to misrepresent their true preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Peranson E, Randlett R. Comments on Williams' "A reexamination of the NRMP matching algorithm". Acad Med. 1995;70:490-494. (footnote at the bottom of page 492)&lt;/ref&gt; A publication in 1962 by David Gale &amp; Lloyd Shapley noted that there always exists a stable solution when colleges are matching with students, but that it is possible to favor colleges as a group over applicants as a group (and vice versa).&lt;ref name=galesharpley1962&gt;Gale D, Shapley LS. College admissions and the stability of marriage. American Mathematics Monthly. 1962;69:9-15.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, Gale and Shapley found that there is a college-optimal stable match and an applicant-optimal stable match.&lt;ref name=galesharpley1962/&gt; [[Lloyd Shapley]] along with [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]], would go on to win the 2012 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for their work on stable allocations.

A debate arose regarding whether the matching program was susceptible to manipulation or unreasonably fair to programs.&lt;ref name="Roth748"&gt;Roth "Redesign" 748&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, it was shown that in simple cases (i.e. those that exclude couples, second-year programs, and special cases for handling unfilled slots) that had multiple "stable" matchings, the algorithm would return the solution that preferred the preferences of programs over applicants.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Sara|title=Are Medical Students Meeting Their (Best Possible) Match?|journal=SIAM News|date=April 2003|issue=3|page=36|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/305.pdf|accessdate=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield "Stable Marriage" 64 references {{cite journal|last=Roth|first=A.E.|title=The evolution of the labor market for medical interns and residents: a case study in game theory|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1984|volume=92|pages=991–1016|doi=10.1086/261272|citeseerx=10.1.1.535.561}} as proving that the pre-1995 algorithm is essentially the hospital-optimal algorithm described in Gusfield 39.  Gusfield 41 demonstrates that the hospital-optimal algorithm is also applicant-pessimal.&lt;/ref&gt;  A correspondence in ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 1981 recognized that the algorithm in use was program-optimal for individual applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Williams KJ, Werth VP, Wolff JA.

Later researchers, such as Marilda Sotomayor in 1983, Alvin Roth in 1984, and Klaus et al. in 2007, found that when couples are allowed to match together, there may exist no stable matching.&lt;ref&gt;Roth AE.

The NRMP algorithm saw only minor and incremental changes after its institution in 1952.&lt;ref name="Gusfield3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth749" /&gt; However, in the fall of 1995 the NRMP Board of Directors commissioned a preliminary research study to evaluate of the current algorithm and recommend changes to be considered in its operation and description, &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19961221144319/http://www.pitt.edu/~alroth/nrmp.html Evaluation of changes to be considered in the NRMP algorithm], by Alvin E. Roth. October 24, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a study comparing a new algorithm with the existing one.&lt;ref name="Roth749"&gt;Roth "Redesign" 749&lt;/ref&gt;  A new applicant-proposing algorithm was adopted in May 1997 and has been in use since its first application in March 1998,&lt;ref name="Roth749" /&gt; although the study showed that the net effect of the change on actual matches has been minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Roth "Redesign" 752, 760&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matching algorithm ==
Matching applicants to programs is a generalization of the [[stable marriage problem]]; as a result, the solutions are very similar. A simplified version of the algorithm that is used to perform the matching process is described below and on the [http://www.nrmp.org/matching-algorithm/ NRMP website]. However, this description does not include the handling of couples (pairs of applicants who participate in a Match together, perhaps to stay in the same geographic location), second-year positions, or special handling of residency positions that remain unfilled. The full algorithm is described in {{cite journal|last=Roth|first=Alvin|author2=Elliott Peranson|title=The Redesign of the Matching Market for American Physicians: Some Engineering Aspects of Economic Design|journal=The American Economic Review|date=September 1999|volume=89|issue=4|pages=756–757|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/papers/rothperansonaer.PDF|accessdate=23 Feb 2016|doi=10.1257/aer.89.4.748}}

=== Inputs ===
The application process for residency training begins prior to the opening of the Main Residency Match in September.  Applications usually are sent to programs through the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), a service of the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]].  After applicants apply to programs, programs review applications and invite selected candidates for interviews held between October and February. After the interview period is over, programs and applicants each compile "rank order lists" that they submit to the NRMP.  Programs list applicants, ranked in order from most to least preferred, whom they wish to train.  Similarly, applicants rank programs where they wish to train.  For applicants matching as a couple, the rank order lists include pairs of program choices that are considered simultaneously by the matching algorithm.  Applicants' rank order lists can include a combination of categorical programs (training that is 3-5 years in length and begins in the first post-graduate year); preliminary programs (training that is one year in length and begins in the first post-graduate year); or advanced programs (training that is 3-4 years in length and begins after one or more years of preliminary training).  For advanced programs on the rank order list, applicants can append a supplemental list of preliminary programs to attempt to match to a full course of training.

=== Simple case ===
The matching process begins with an attempt to match an applicant to the program most preferred on that applicant’s rank order list.  If the applicant cannot be matched to that first choice program, an attempt is made to place the applicant into the second choice program, and so on, until the applicant is tentatively matched to a program that has an open position and who prefers that applicant or all the applicant’s choices on the ROL have been exhausted. This process is carried out for all applicants until each applicant has either been tentatively matched to the most preferred choice possible or all choices submitted by all applicants have been exhausted.  Tentative matches then become final.

To understand how the current NRMP algorithm works, it is helpful to begin by considering the simpler case where there are no couples or secondary programs.

As in the [[stable marriage problem]], the basic goal it to match applicants to programs so that the results are "stable". "Stability" in this case means that there is no applicant A and program P such that both of the following are true:
* A is unmatched or would prefer to go to P over the program to which A matched
* P has a free slot or would prefer A over one of the other applicants matched to the program.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield "Stable Marriage" 38&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be shown that for any instance of the problem, there is at least one valid solution.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield "Stable Marriage" 41&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the old (pre-1995) NRMP algorithm that favored programs' preferences over applicants', programs could benefit in certain cases from lying about their preferences.  That no longer is true under the current algorithm.  Neither applicants nor programs can benefit by lying about their preferences, even if they have perfect knowledge of everyone's preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield "Stable Marriage" 59&lt;/ref&gt;  

Under the current system, it also is impossible for an applicant to be harmed by including more residency programs at the bottom of a list if those programs are indeed preferable to not being matched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/nrmp.html |title=Analysis of the National Residency Matching Program |publisher=Tedlab.mit.edu |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Couples ===
Couples' rank order lists are processed simultaneously by the matching algorithm, which complicates the problem.  In some cases there exists no stable solution (with stable defined the way it is in the simple case).  In fact, the problem of determining whether there is a stable solution and finding it if it exists has been proven [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusfield "Stable Marriage" 54 gives an example of a situation with no stable solution and states that proof of NP completeness comes from {{cite journal|last=Ronn|first=Eytan|title=NP-complete stable matching problems|journal=Journal of Algorithms|date=June 1990|volume=11|issue=2|pages=285–304|doi=10.1016/0196-6774(90)90007-2|issn=0196-6774}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, while there is no randomization in the NRMP algorithm—so it will always return the same output when given exactly the same input&lt;ref&gt;Roth "Redesign" 759&lt;/ref&gt;—different outcomes can be produced by changing trivial features of the data such as the order in which applicants and programs are processed. However, in initial testing of the algorithm over 5 years of residency match data and a variety of different initial conditions, the current NRMP algorithm always terminated quickly on a stable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Roth "Redesign" 757&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing also showed that "none of [the trivial] sequencing decisions had a large or systematic effect on the matching produced"—the maximum number of applicants ever observed to be affected in a single run was 12 out of 22,938.&lt;ref&gt;Roth "Redesign" 758&lt;/ref&gt;

In general ''once the programs' rank order lists have been set'', there is no way for an applicant to match into a better position by deciding to match as part of a couple.  For example, if a very strong applicant and a very weak applicant match as a couple, there is no mechanism ''in the algorithm'' that allows the stronger applicant to somehow improve the desirability of the weaker applicant.&lt;ref name="full_alg_description"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=Alvin|author2=Elliott Peranson|title=The Redesign of the Matching Market for American Physicians: Some Engineering Aspects of Economic Design|journal=The American Economic Review|date=September 1999|volume=89|issue=4|pages=756–757|url=http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=wilson|accessdate=14 October 2010|doi=10.1257/aer.89.4.748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Of course, if the programs know prior to processing the matching algorithm that the stronger and weaker applicant are participating in the Match as a couple, they are free to change their lists accordingly, which could affect the final outcome.)

== Failure to match ==
It is possible for an applicant not to match to a program. Until the 2010 Main Residency Match, applicants who did not obtain a position went through a process called the Scramble.&lt;ref name="soap"&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/soap.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226032103/http://www.nrmp.org/soap.pdf |date=December 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 12:00 p.m. on Monday of Match Week, the NRMP notified applicants whether they had matched to a program (but did not release the name of the program) and released a list of unfilled programs. Applicants then applied en masse to programs that had unfilled positions, frequently having to change their preferred specialty in the process. The Scramble was widely recognized to be chaotic, disorganized, and lacking in transparency. The Scramble ended on Match Day, which was Thursday of Match Week. Most positions filled within the first few hours, and nearly all in the first 48 hours.&lt;ref name="soap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sdn-scramble-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentdoctor.net/2010/10/using-soap-to-clean-up-the-scramble/ |title=Using "SOAP" to Clean Up the Scramble |publisher=Studentdoctor.net |date=2010-10-24 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrambling was extremely competitive: in 2008, roughly 10,600 applicants, many of whom were foreign-trained, scrambled for only 1,392 residency positions.&lt;ref name="sdn-scramble-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentdoctor.net/2009/03/the-scramble-how-it-works-and-how-it-can-be-improved/ |title=The Residency Scramble: How It Works and How It Can Be Improved |publisher=Studentdoctor.net |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2010 Main Residency Match, the Scramble was replaced by the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program, or SOAP.&lt;ref name="soap"/&gt; In SOAP, unmatched applicants are offered positions in unfilled programs through a series of rounds, creating a systematic way for applicants to find training positions without the chaos of the Scramble.&lt;ref name="soap-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/faq/us_seniors_faq.html |accessdate=December 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202180322/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/faq/us_seniors_faq.html |archivedate=December 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In SOAP, all appointments are made through the NRMP (no direct matching allowed, unlike the Scramble), and unmatched applicant data and unfilled program data are released at the same time on Monday of Match Week.&lt;ref name="sdn-scramble-1"/&gt;  Match Day is now Friday of Match Week.

==International medical graduates==
To participate in the NRMP, an [[international medical graduate]] must meet the requirements for [[ECFMG certification]] (not required of M.D. graduates of Canadian medical schools, who are not considered IMGs in the U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html nrmp.org &gt; Independent Applicants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084648/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/ind_app/verif_new.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated 09/08/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by the "Rank Order List Certification Deadline" in February of the year of the Match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html nrmp.org &gt; 2012 Main Match Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035954/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/yearly.html |date=2011-07-16 }} Updated 05/19/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To acquire ECFMG certification, IMGs must: 
*Obtain passing scores on [[USMLE Step 1]], [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge]] and [[USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills]]
*Obtain a [[medical diploma]] of [[medical education]] taken at an institution registered in the [[International Medical Education Directory]] (IMED)
In comparison, students and graduates from medical schools in the United States are bound to the graduation requirements of their individual schools.  Both U.S. and foreign-trained applicants can participate in the NRMP while completing their final year of medical school before acquiring their medical diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html nrmp.org &gt; U.S. Seniors &gt; Registering with the NRMP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084824/http://www.nrmp.org/res_match/special_part/us_seniors/registration.html |date=2011-07-21 }} Updated August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Lawsuit ==
{{Main article|Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges}}
In 2002, 16 law firms filed a lawsuit on behalf of 3 residents seeking to represent all residents matching through the NRMP.  The plaintiffs put forward a case which sought to show that the NRMP colluded with other national medical and medical education organization and with residency-sponsoring institutions to depress resident wages, operating in violation of United States antitrust legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Antitrust Against the Resident Match.  http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic926634.files/7.1%20Antitrust%20Lawsuit%20Against%20the%20Resident%20Match.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief complaint read:

{{cquote|"Plaintiffs bring this action under the federal antitrust laws for: (a) money damages and other appropriate relief to compensate resident physicians for the harm they suffered as a result of a longstanding, nationwide contract, combination and conspiracy among Defendants and others to illegally restrain competition in the market for resident physician services; and (b) injunctive relief to end the illegal restraints.

Defendants and others have illegally contracted, combined and conspired among themselves to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and compensation of resident physicians, and to impose a scheme of restraints which have the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other terms of employment.

Defendants' illegal combination and conspiracy has restrained competition in the employment of resident physicians by: (a) stabilizing wages below competitive levels by exchanging competitively sensitive information regarding resident physician compensation and other terms of employment; (b) eliminating competition in the recruitment and employment of resident physicians by assigning prospective resident physician employees to positions through the National Resident Matching Program ("NRMP"); and (c) establishing and complying with anticompetitive accreditation standards and requirements through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ("ACGME").

Each of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class is currently, or was recently, employed as a resident physician or is seeking such employment and has been injured by Defendants' illegal contract, combination and conspiracy.

The United States '''Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory''' ('''NRDL''') was an early military lab created to study the effects of radiation and nuclear weapons. The facility was based at the [[Treasure Island Naval Station Hunters Point Annex|Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard]] in San Francisco, California.

==History==
The NRDL was formed in 1946 to manage testing, decontamination, and disposition of US Navy ships contaminated by the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ships that survived the atomic detonations were towed to Hunter's Point for detailed study and decontamination. Some of the ships were cleaned and sold for scrap. The aircraft carrier [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS Independence,]] which had been heavily damaged and contaminated with nuclear fallout by Operation Crossroads explosions in July 1946, was brought to the NRDL for study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socket.kongshem.com/2007/10/farallon-islands-nuclear-waste-dump.html|title=:: Socket ::: The Farallon Islands Nuclear Waste Dump|website=socket.kongshem.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of trying in vain to decontaminate the ship enough that it could be safely sold for scrap, the Navy ultimately packed the ship full of nuclear waste and scuttled the radioactive hulk off California near the [[Farallon Islands]] in January 1951. The ship's wreck was discovered resting upright under 790m of water in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/us/sunken-navy-carrier-revealed/index.html|title=Aircraft carrier that survived atomic blasts surveyed|last=CNN|first=Brad Lendon|website=CNN|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_27931161/scientists-find-radioactive-aircraft-carrier-off-san-francisco|title=Scientists find radioactive WWII aircraft carrier off San Francisco coast|website=www.mercurynews.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL used several buildings at the Hunter's Point shipyard from 1946 to 1969. Working with the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] (predecessor to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] established in 1974), the Navy conducted a wide variety of radiation experiments on materials and animals at the lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/hunters_point.htm|title=Hunters Point / San Francisco Naval Shipyard|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the construction of a [[cyclotron]] on the site for use in radiation experiments and storage for various nuclear materials.

===Activities===
An article published 2 May 2001 in [[SF Weekly]] detailed various aspects of nuclear testing at NRDL from declassified records:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Quote|text= 
The NRDL often experimented with and disposed of nuclear material with little apparent concern that it was operating in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Among other things, historical documents show, scientists at the NRDL: 
* – Oversaw the dumping of huge amounts of contaminated sand and acid into San Francisco Bay after they were used in attempts to clean irradiated ships.
* – Spread radioactive material on- and off-base, as if it were fertilizer, to practice decontamination.
* – Burned radioactive fuel oil in a boiler, discharging the smoke into the atmosphere.
* – Sold radioactive ships as scrap metal to a private company in Alameda.
* – Hung a source of cobalt-60, a nuclear isotope that emits high-energy electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays, in San Francisco Bay for two weeks, apparently just to see what would happen.
* – Conducted human experiments that included requiring people to drink radioactive elements.
* – Experimented with significant amounts of a wide variety of long-lived radiological poisons, including plutonium, cesium, uranium, thorium and radium.
* – Studied and disposed of thousands of irradiated mice, rats, dogs, goats, mules, and pigs, among other animals. At one point, the lab owned a ranch in Contra Costa County used specifically to raise animals for radiation testing.
* – Sought permission to dump 1,000 gallons of liquid waste containing "small amounts of fission products" into San Francisco Bay, as an experiment to study how tidal action would dilute the radioactivity. The experiment was meant as a precursor to the disposal of 1,000 gallons of liquid radioactive waste in the bay every day. (The documents do not say whether the experiment or the daily dumping occurred.) |source=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|author=Davis, Lisa |title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}

===Contamination===
The first use of radioactive materials at NRDL predated the issuing of licenses by the Atomic Energy Commission, but the AEC later issued licenses for a broad spectrum of radioactive materials to be used in research at the NRDL. Radioactive materials specific to nuclear weapon testing were exempted from AEC licensing. For closure of the NRDL in 1969, the AEC issued licenses for decommissioning activities. AEC licenses for the shipyard and NRDL were terminated in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/hunters-point-naval-shipyard.html|title=NRC: Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard|website=www.nrc.gov|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL testing and decontamination activities caused significant contamination of the shipyard site.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf|title=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|last=|first=|date=August 2014|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRDL and the military radiation training school at nearby [[Naval Station Treasure Island]] loaded the nuclear waste left from experiments into steel barrels and sent weekly barges to dump them offshore near the [[Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary|Gulf of the Farallons]], which is a US National Wildlife Refuge and a major commercial fishery.

'''''Nowatske v. Osterloh''''', 198 Wis.2d 419, 543 N.W.2d 265 (Wis. 1996), ''on remand'', 201 Wis.2d 497, 549 N.W.2d 256 (Wis. App. 1996), is a case relating to the law of [[medical malpractice]] in Wisconsin.

==Factual background and procedural history==
The plaintiff,&lt;ref&gt;Actually, there were two plaintiffs:  Kim Nowatske and his wife Julie.  In the state supreme court opinion, only Kim Nowatske, the patient, is referred to as the &amp;#8220;plaintiff.&amp;#8221;&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Nowatske underwent [[Scleral buckle|retinal reattachment]] surgery in his right eye in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Nowatske v. Osterloh'', 198 Wis.2d 419, 426, 543 N.W.2d 265 (Wis. 1996); ''Nowatske v. Osterloh'', 201 Wis.2d 497, 502, 549 N.W.2d 256 (Wis. App. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the surgery, Nowatske could not see out of the eye in question.  During routine post-operative testing, defendant surgeon used his finger (instead of a [[tonometer]]) to measure the pressure inside Nowatske's eye and, noting a normal "back-off" response to light, did not specifically ask the patient whether he could see in his right eye or not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nowatske v. Osterloh'', 198 Wis.2d 419, 426, 543 N.W.2d 265 (Wis. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
The patient thought the inability to see was a normal consequence of the surgery.  After the patient was discharged, he experienced severe pain; the surgeon, learning that the patient did not receive the pain medication prescribed, called in a prescription to a local pharmacy without inquiring further of the patient regarding the pain.  The next day, Nowatske was examined by the surgeon and learned that the blindness in the right eye was permanent.  In 1991, he and his wife sued the surgeon, and the case went to trial.  A jury determined that the surgeon was not negligent,&lt;ref&gt;''Nowatske v. Osterloh'', 201 Wis.2d 497, 501; 549 N.W.2d 256 (Wis. App. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the plaintiff appealed.

==Issues on appeal==
On appeal, the plaintiff argued:
* that the [[pattern jury instructions]] regarding the law of medical malpractice were erroneous,
* that the trial court erroneously allowed the defense attorney to ask improper questions to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the plaintiff's expert during cross-examination,
* that the trial court erred in allowing the defendant to point an [[ophthalmoscope]] at members of the jury during his testimony in his own defense, and
* that [[sufficiency of the evidence|the evidence was insufficient]] to support the verdict.

==Results==
The [[Wisconsin Court of Appeals]] [[certified question|certified]] the first three legal questions to the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]].  The state supreme court agreed to consider only the question of whether the pattern jury instructions were correct or not, and held that the jury instructions contained no [[error (law)|legal error]] but "should be improved."&lt;ref&gt;198 Wis.2d at 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wisconsin Court of Appeals then determined that the questions asked during impeachment were improper, but that this was [[harmless error]].  Allowing the defendant to demonstrate the use of an ophthalmoscope in the courtroom was within the trial court's discretion, and although the appeals court did "not approve of the involvement of jurors in such a demonstration,"&lt;ref&gt;201 Wis.2d at 508&lt;/ref&gt; this had no effect on the outcome of the case and therefore was not reversible error.

Finally, the court of appeals held that "[w]e will sustain a jury verdict if there is any credible evidence to support it. ''See'' ''Nieuwendorp v. American Family Ins. Co.'', 191 Wis. 2d 462, 472, 529 N.W.2d 594, 598 (1995). Our consideration of the evidence must be done in the light most favorable to the verdict, and when more than one inference may be drawn from the evidence, we are bound to accept the inference drawn by the jury . . . . It is the jury's responsibility to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be afforded their testimony."&lt;ref&gt;201 Wis.2d at 509, 511&lt;/ref&gt;  There was conflicting testimony from experts&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 201 Wis.2d at 510&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the standard of care (as to whether, after this type of surgery, a doctor may measure [[intraocular pressure]] using his finger or whether the doctor should use a [[tonometer]]) and, as it is the role of the jury and not the court of appeals to weigh expert testimony, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;201 Wis.2d at 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28683">The '''pathophysiology of a spider bite''' is due to the effect of its [[venom]]. A spider envenomation occurs whenever a spider injects [[venom]] into the skin. Not all spider bites inject venom – a dry bite, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. Some spider bites do leave a large enough wound that [[infection]] may be a concern. However, it is generally the toxicity of spider venom that poses the most risk to human beings; several spiders are known to have venom that can cause injury to humans in the amounts that a spider will typically inject when biting.

Only a small percentage of species have bites that pose a danger to people. Many spiders do not have mouthparts capable of penetrating human skin. While venoms are by definition toxic substances, most spiders do not have venom that is toxic to humans (in the quantities delivered) to require medical attention. Of those that do, fatal outcomes are exceedingly rare.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Spider venoms work on one of two fundamental principles; they are either neurotoxic (impairing the nervous system) or necrotic (dissolving tissues surrounding the bite). In some cases, the venom targets vital organs and systems.

==Neurotoxic venom==
Spiders paralyze prey with [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] venom of some sort. A few have a venom that cross reacts with mammalian nervous system, though the specific manner in which the [[nervous system]] is attacked varies from spider to spider.&lt;ref name="pmid15066413"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escoubas P, Rash L |title=Tarantulas: eight-legged pharmacists and combinatorial chemists |journal=Toxicon |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=555–74 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15066413 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.02.007 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17096075"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Escoubas P |title=Molecular diversification in spider venoms: a web of combinatorial peptide libraries |journal=Molecular Diversity |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=545–54 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17096075 |doi=10.1007/s11030-006-9050-4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18482741"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang L, Peng L, Chen J, Zhang Y, Xiong X, Liang S |title=Molecular diversification based on analysis of expressed sequence tags from the venom glands of the Chinese bird spider ''Ornithoctonus huwena'' |journal=Toxicon |volume=51 |issue=8 |pages=1479–89 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18482741 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.03.024 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When motor neurons are excited the symptoms include muscle spasms, cramps, and twitching. When autonomic nerves are involved sweating, drooling, gooseflesh. In the extreme unstable blood pressure and heart rate can result.
*[[Widow spider]] venom contains components known as [[latrotoxin]]s, which cause the massive release of the [[neurotransmitters]] causing muscle contractions, sweating, and gooseflesh. This can affect the body in several ways, including causing painful abdominal cramps&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Diaz, James H|title=The global epidemiology, syndromic classification, management, and prevention of spider bites|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|volume=71|issue=2|date= August 1, 2004 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/full/71/2/239|pages=239–250|pmid=15306718|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The atracotoxins of [[Australian funnel-web spider]]s work by opening [[sodium channel]]s, causing excessive neural activity including strange sensations (paresthesias), muscle contractions, unstable blood pressure (hypertension or hypotension). The venom may cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that can be fatal.
*The venom of [[Brazilian wandering spider]]s is also a potent neurotoxin, which attacks multiple types of [[ion channel]]s.&lt;ref name="GomezKalapothakis2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez|first1=Marcus V.|last2=Kalapothakis|first2=Evanguedes|last3=Guatimosim|first3=Cristina|last4=Prado|first4=Marco A.

With severe envenomation heart and lung failure can result in death In addition, the venom contains high levels of [[serotonin]], making an envenomation by this species particularly painful.

==Necrotic venom==
Spiders known to have [[necrotoxin|necrotic]] venom occur most notoriously in the family [[Sicariidae]], which includes both the [[recluse spider]]s and the six-eyed sand spiders in the genus ''[[Hexophthalma]]''. Spiders in this family possess a known dermonecrotic agent [[sphingomyelinase D]],&lt;ref name="pmid18207690"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Senff-Ribeiro A, Henrique da Silva P, Chaim OM, Gremski LH, Paludo KS, Bertoni da Silveira R, Gremski W, Mangili OC, Veiga SS |title=Biotechnological applications of brown spider (Loxosceles genus) venom toxins |journal=Biotechnology Advances |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=210–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18207690 |doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2007.12.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19042943"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Binford GJ, Bodner MR, Cordes MH, Baldwin KL, Rynerson MR, Burns SN, Zobel-Thropp PA |title=Molecular Evolution, Functional Variation, and Proposed Nomenclature of the Gene Family That Includes Sphingomyelinase D in Sicariid Spider Venoms |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=547–66 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19042943 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msn274 |url= |pmc=2767091}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is otherwise found only in a few pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid15777950"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Binford GJ, Cordes MH, Wells MA |title=Sphingomyelinase D from venoms of Loxosceles spiders: evolutionary insights from cDNA sequences and gene structure |journal=Toxicon |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=547–60 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15777950 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.11.011 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16332712"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cordes MH, Binford GJ |title=Lateral gene transfer of a dermonecrotic toxin between spiders and bacteria |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=264–8 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16332712 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti811 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species in this family are more venomous than others; according to one study, the venom of the [[Chilean recluse]] and several species of six-eyed sand spider indigenous to southern [[Africa]], contains an order of magnitude more of this substance than do other sicariid spiders such as the [[brown recluse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the absence of systemic effects, serious bites from sicariid spiders may form a necrotising [[Skin ulcer|ulcer]] that destroys soft tissue and may take months and very rarely years to heal, leaving deep [[scar]]s. The damaged tissue may become [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and eventually slough away. Initially there may be no pain from a bite, but over time the wound may grow to 10 inches (25&amp;nbsp;cm) in extreme cases. Bites usually become painful and itchy within two to eight hours, pain and other local effects worsen 12 to 36 hours after the bite, and then necrosis will develop over the next few days.&lt;ref name="ClinTox-Wasserman"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wasserman G, Anderson P | title = Loxoscelism and necrotic arachnidism | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 21 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 451–72 | year =1983–1984 | pmid = 6381752 | doi = 10.3109/15563658308990434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systemic effects are unusual but include mild [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[fever]], [[rash]]es, and muscle and joint pain. Rarely, more severe symptoms occur including red blood cell destruction ([[hemolysis]]), low platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]), and loss of clotting factors ([[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]).&lt;ref name="NEJM2005-Wasserman"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wasserman G | title = Bites of the brown recluse spider | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 19 | pages = 2029–30; author reply 2029–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15892198 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200505123521922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may be more susceptible to systemic [[loxoscelism]] effects. Deaths have been reported for both the brown recluse and the related South American species ''[[Loxosceles laeta]]'' and ''[[Loxosceles intermedia]]'' related to hemolysis and the injury that results to the kidney.

==Differential diagnosis==
The skin manifestations of recluse venom are thought to arise from [[Sphingomyelinase]] D. The enzyme acts on cell membranes. The action is therefore limited as the venom can only spread through a set area. The originally red swollen area becomes a dry black ulcer. Skin infections, in particular the widespread methicillin-resistant [[Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcal aureus]], remain swollen and red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dominguez|first1=TJ|title=It's not a spider bite, it's community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.|journal=The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice / American Board of Family Practice|date=May–June 2004|volume=17|issue=3|pages=220–26|pmid=15226288|doi=10.3122/jabfm.17.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pus forms and the lesion often drains. It can continue to spread and expand as the bacteria grow. Other skin lesions and infections are much more common than spider bites. Physicians have reported brown recluse spider bites where no brown recluse exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=RS|last2=Bush|first2=SP|title=Reports of presumptive brown recluse spider bites reinforce improbable diagnosis in regions of North America where the spider is not endemic.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=15 August 2002|volume=35|issue=4|pages=442–45|pmid=12145729|doi=10.1086/341244}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ed: in 100 pictures retrieved online only 3 were consistent with Sphingomyelinase pathophysiology.''

==Incidence of severe envenomation==
Despite public concern about spider bites, severe envenomation is rare. Few spiders have toxins in sufficient volume to harm people. Of those that do, some have limited habitats. Spider behavior may be caused by limited human interaction. Spider defense against predators include camouflage, and escape by falling or running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pekár|first1=Stano|last2=Hardy|first2=Ian|title=Comparative analysis of passive defences in spiders (Araneae)|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=July 2014|volume=83|issue=4|pages=779–790|doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12177|pmid=24205934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biting is a last resort and the amount of venom injected varies greatly. Spider venom toxicity can be evaluated in experimental animals, or reported from accidental bites. Different experimental animals have different reactions to the same venom. The dose that is lethal to half of the animals poisoned is the LD50 and those values for mice is below. The LD50 of many poisons is known for humans but not that of spider venom.

Serious bites develop symptoms quickly, within the hour. While a serious medical condition may result (see latrodectims and loxocelism) fatalities are exceedingly rare. Appropriate medical treatment can improve speed of recovery. The scenario given in movies such as ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'', where bite victims die within minutes, does not occur. Small children are considered an exception because the amount of venom dispersed throughout the body is many times the concentration in an adult. There is at least one recorded case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a [[Sydney funnel-web spider]]; that death occurred before the development of an [[antivenom]]. Since the antivenom was developed there have been no fatalities due to this species.

The neurotoxic venoms of the [[Sydney funnel-web spider]] and the [[Brazilian wandering spider]] are both known to have lethal complications. For the Brazilian wandering spider only 1 out of 200 bites is serious &lt;ref name="revistas"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.revistas.usp.br/rimtsp/article/view/30402|title=A clinico-epidemiological study of bites by spiders of the genus Phoneutria &amp;#124; BUCARETCHI &amp;#124; Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo|journal=Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo|volume=42|pages=17–21|accessdate=14 February 2015|doi=10.1590/S0036-46652000000100003|year=2000|last1=Bucaretchi|first1=Fábio|last2=Deus Reinaldo|first2=Cláudia Regina de|last3=Hyslop|first3=Stephen|last4=Madureira|first4=Paulo Roberto|last5=De Capitani|first5=Eduardo Mello|last6=Vieira|first6=Ronan José}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Atrax robustus'' has a limited distribution and few bites are reported yearly.

The geographical range of the widow spiders is very great. As a result, far more people are exposed, worldwide, to widow bites than any other spider. Widow spiders bites are most often mild but may rarely cause serious complications in people. Fatalities had been reported as high as 5% of bites and as low as 0.2% of bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bettini S | title = Epidemiology of Latrodectism | journal = Toxicon | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 93–102 | year = 1964| pmid = 14301291|doi=10.1016/0041-0101(64)90009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loxosceles live in areas of South America and the southern United States. There are populations of desert and Arizona recluse in the Western deserts of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insects.about.com/od/spiders/tp/brown-recluse-lies.htm|title=5 Lies About the Brown Recluse Spider|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but bites are rarely reported from these species. In established areas many spiders may populate the home. Even still the "reclusive" nature of the spider limits true bites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=Richard S.|last2=Barger|first2=Diane K.|title=An Infestation of 2,055 Brown Recluse Spiders (Araneae: Sicariidae) and No Envenomations in a Kansas Home: Implications for Bite Diagnoses in Nonendemic Areas|journal=Journal of Medical Entomology|date=1 November 2002|volume=39|issue=6|pages=948–951|doi=10.1603/0022-2585-39.6.948|pmid=12495200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, more bites had been reprted in Florida than recluses ever found in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=Richard S.|last2=Edwards|first2=G.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; Several other kinds of tarantulas in the pet trade are regarded as giving non-trivial bites. Tarantulas are typically far larger than spiders with the most toxic kinds of venom. However, the sheer volume of the venom may compensate for its lesser toxicity. The effects of a full envenomation are probably unknown for many species of tarantulas, so due caution is advisable.

'''Prajateerpu''' was a [[participatory action research]] (PAR) initiative on the future of food and farming in [[Andhra Pradesh]] that took place on 25&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;July 2001 at the Government of India's Farmer Liaison Centre (KVK) in Algole Village, Zaheerabad Taluk, Medak District, Andhra Pradesh, India. Initiated by a coalition of local community groups, it involved the participation of marginal-livelihood citizens from Andhra Pradesh and drew on approaches such as the [[citizens' jury]] and [[scenario workshop]]s.

At a meeting held at the UK Houses of Parliament on 18 March 2002, a smallholder from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh stood up to launch a report in which she gave a personal account of a controversial participation process called Prajateerpu (Telegu for 'people's verdict'). Anjamma and her fellow jurors concluded that [[genetically modified crops]] would have little foreseeable impact on reducing malnutrition in Andhra Pradesh, and also expressed concern over the impact that reliance on artificial fertilizers and pesticides would have on smallholders in the region. They called for local self-sufficiency and endogenous development in farming and food, thereby joining a growing global movement for [[food sovereignty]].

The '''Rancho Los Amigos Scale''' ('''RLAS'''), a.k.a. the '''Rancho Los Amigos Levels of Cognitive Functioning Scale''' ('''LOCF''') or '''Rancho Scale''', is a medical scale used to assess individuals after a [[closed head injury]], including [[traumatic brain injury]], based on cognitive and behavioural presentations as they emerge from [[coma]].&lt;ref&gt;Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. (1 March 2011). ''The Rancho Levels of Cognitive Functioning''. Retrieved May 15, 2011, from https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024558/http://rancho.org/Research_RanchoLevels.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the [[Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center]], located in [[Downey, California]], United States in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]].

After being assessed based on the LOCF, individuals with brain injury receive a score from one to eight. A score of one represents non-responsive cognitive functioning, whereas a score of eight represents purposeful and appropriate functioning.&lt;ref name="fulk"&gt;Fulk, G. D. (2007). Traumatic Brain Injury. In S. B. O’Sullivan &amp; T. J. Schmitz (Eds.), ''Physical Rehabilitation'' (5th ed., pp. 895-935). Philadelphia, PA: F. A. Davis Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Each of the eight levels represents the typical sequential progression of recovery from brain damage. However, individuals progress at different rates and may plateau at any stage of recovery. These patients are scored based on combinations of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="fulk"/&gt;

* responsiveness to stimuli
* ability to follow commands
* presence of non-purposeful behavior
* [[cooperation]]
* [[confusion]]
* [[attention]] to environment
* focus
* coherence of verbalization
* appropriateness of verbalizations and actions
* [[memory recall]]
* [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]]
* [[judgement]] and [[reasoning]]

LOCF scores are used by the health care professionals for standardized communication about patient status and can be used by [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|physiatrists]], [[physical therapists]], [[occupational therapists]], [[recreational therapists]], and [[Speech language pathology|speech language pathologists]] as the basis for treatment planning.&lt;ref name="fulk"/&gt;

This eight-level scale was found to possess test-retest and interrater reliability as well as concurrent and predictive validity.&lt;ref&gt;Gouvier, W. D., Blanton, P. D., LaPorte, K. K., &amp; Nepomuceno, C. (1987). Reliability and validity of the Disability Rating Scale and the Levels of Cognitive Functioning Scale in monitoring recovery from severe head injury. ''Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation'', 68(2), 94-97.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used clinically and is often paired with the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] in health care facilities.&lt;ref name="fulk"/&gt;

Under federal law the manufacture, importation, distribution, and advertisement of tobacco is regulated whilst the 16 federal states of [[Germany]] each have their own legislation regarding smoking in public places,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/nosmoking.html |title=Smoking Laws in Germany |author= |date= |website=howtogermany.com |page= |publisher=Chuck Emerson Media Service |access-date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which range from relatively weak regulations to full [[smoking bans]] in all licensed premises, childcare facilities, schools and governmental institutions. As of July 2016, nearly 40% of the German population live in a state which bans smoking in all restaurants, pubs, cafés and nightclubs (Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland). The other 13 states permit smoking in designated rooms or in bars with a floor area of less than 75 square meters.

According to a 2013 micro-census survey, 24.5% of the German population aged fifteen years and over are smokers (29% of men, 20% of women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2014/11/PD14_386_239.html |title=Jeder zweite Erwachsene in Deutschland hat Übergewicht |author= |date=2014-11-05 |language=de |website=destatis.de |page= |publisher=Statistisches Bundesamt |access-date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 18-25 age group, 35.2% are smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/german-youths-smoking-less-tobacco-industry-remains-powerful-1320561 |title=German Youths Smoking Less, But Tobacco Industry Remains Powerful |author=Palash Ghosh |date=2013-06-24 |website= |page= |publisher=IBT Media Inc. |access-date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political measures against smoking ==

=== Misleading labels ===

Since 2003 it is illegal to label a tobacco product as "light", "mild", "low-tar” or any other misleading form of advertisement which could cause the impression that the product causes less damage than other tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shortnews.de/id/139100/eu-verbot-fuer-zigaretten-bezeichnungen-light-und-medium |title=EU-Verbot für Zigaretten-Bezeichnungen "Light" und "Medium" |author=tomrau |date=2000-10-30 |language=de |website=shortnews.de |page= |publisher=ShortNews |access-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/tabprodv/gesamt.pdf |title=Tabakprodukt-Verordnung &lt;sup&gt;§ 9 Irreführende Angaben&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date=2002-11-20 |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===

[[File:Kiosk-frankfurt-gallus.jpg|thumb|250px|Advertisement of tobacco in front of a shop]]

All radio and television advertisement for tobacco products was banned in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipv-ev.de/bilder/lmbg.pdf |title=Lebensmittel- und Bedarfsgegenständegesetz – LMBG &lt;sup&gt;§ 22 Werbeverbote&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=ipv-ev.de |page=14 |publisher= |access-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation was extended by the "Rundfunkstaatsvertrag" on August 1, 1999, banning any kind of sponsoring of television and radio shows. In 2002, the "Protection of Young Persons Act" banned the advertising of tobacco products in cinemas before 6 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/juschg/__11.html |title=Jugendschutzgesetz (JuSchG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 11 Filmveranstaltungen&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website= |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2007, the European Tobacco advertisement directive came into effect, banning the advertising of tobacco products on the internet, in newspapers and magazines. The regulation also banned sponsorship of any event which is broadcast internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:152:0016:0019:DE:PDF |title=RICHTLINIE 2003/33/EG DES EUROPÄISCHEN PARLAMENTS  UND DES RATES &lt;sup&gt;zur  Angleichung  der  Rechts-  und  Verwaltungsvorschriften  der  Mitgliedstaaten  über  Werbung  und Sponsoring zugunsten  von  Tabakerzeugnissen&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |page= |publisher= |access-date=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany is the only EU member state to still legally permit billboard and cinema advertising for tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dkfz.de/de/tabakkontrolle/Tabakwerbung_und_Sponsoring.html |title=Tabakwerbung_und_Sponsoring |author= |date= |language=de |publisher=DKFZ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warning labels ===

In accordance with EU Tobacco Products Directive II, all sold cigarettes, rolling tobacco and hookah tobacco manufacturers have to cover 65% of the packaging with combined pictorial and textual warning labels on both sides, in addition to additional warning labels on the any smaller sides since May 2017.

=== Tobacco taxation ===
 {{multiple image

 | caption2 = 2014: 5,00 Euros for 20 cigarettes
 }}

In Germany the amount of tobacco and the value of the product is used to calculate the tax (§ 3 TabakStG). In order to calculate the tobacco tax for each package the number of cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos or the quantity in grams (smoking tobacco) and the retail selling price is required. The information is printed on the "Steuerbanderole" (tax strip) of each tobacco package in full Euro and cent values.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2002 and 2003, the tobacco tax was increased to finance anti-terrorist measures.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2004 and 2005 three increases followed to financially support health insurance.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 2010 tax increases were decided for the next 5 successive years starting May 1, 2011 over January 1, 2012 to January 1, 2015.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

As of 2015, the tobacco tax rate was 9.82 cents per cigarette and 21.69 percent of the retail price, which makes a minimum sum of 19.636 cents per cigarette minus the sales tax of the retail selling price.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==== Minors ====

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R79014, Schwarzmarkt, Jugendliche handeln mit Zigaretten.jpg|thumb|Juveniles smoking and trading cigarettes in 1948]]

Under Germany's "Protection of Young Persons Act" it is unlawful to sell or supply any tobacco product to anyone who is under eighteen years of age. It is also illegal to permit minors to smoke in any public place. Although it is not a crime for minors to purchase, attempt to purchase or consume tobacco products it is unlawful for any retailer or other responsible person to sell, supply or tolerate the consumption of tobacco by a person underage. If a minor is found smoking in public, the police have a duty to seize the tobacco products.

{{Quote|text='''Protection of Young Persons Act - Section 10 Smoking in public, tobacco products'''&lt;br&gt;(1) Tobacco products may not be sold to children or adolescents nor may the latter be permitted/allowed to smoke in restaurants, shops or other public places.&lt;br&gt;(2) Tobacco products may not be made available from vending machines unless the following conditions are satisfied: 
# The vending machine is installed at a location where it is not accessible to children or adolescents. 
# The vending machine is fitted with mechanical means of ensuring or is permanently guarded to ensure that children and adolescents cannot buy tobacco products from them. |sign= |source=[http://www.bmfsfj.de/RedaktionBMFSFJ/Abteilung5/Pdf-Anlagen/juSchGenglisch,property=pdf,bereich=,rwb=true.pdf Protection of Young Persons Act 2002 as amended 2008, Gazette I, p. 2149 § 10]}}

Prior to September 1, 2007 the minimum age for purchasing and smoking tobacco products had been 16 years. Until January 1, 2009 all tobacco vending machines had to be removed or refitted to ensure that minors could not purchase tobacco products from them. Since then, all vending machines require some form of identification before dispensing tobacco, usually an [[Electronic cash]] bank card, [[German identity card]] or [[European driving licence]], to verify that the buyer is at least 18 years of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==== Sale of loose cigarettes ====

It is unlawful to sell any tobacco product in a package containing less than 19 cigarettes or 30 grams of loose fine-cut tobacco. To ensure this is the case, retailers may not destroy a tax strip on tobacco packaging. The law provides an exception for cigarillos and cigars under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tabstg_2009/__25.html |title=Tabaksteuergesetz (TabStG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 25 Packungen im Handel, Stückverkauf&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Retail price maintenance ====

Selling tobacco products for more or less than the retail sale price set by the manufacturer and printed on the tax strip is unlawful. The only exception is when providing free samples to a customer for advertising purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tabstg_2009/__26.html |title=Tabaksteuergesetz (TabStG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 26 Verbot der Abgabe unter Kleinverkaufspreis&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tabstg_2009/__28.html |title=Tabaksteuergesetz (TabStG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 28 Verbot der Abgabe über Kleinverkaufspreis&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gaming and gambling ====

Tobacco products may not be used as a prize in any form of commercial gaming or gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tabstg_2009/__29.html |title=Tabaksteuergesetz (TabStG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 29 Ausspielung&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tie-on sales ====

Adding or supplying anything else than the tobacco product to a package of cigarettes, cigars or cigarillos except for change is unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tabstg_2009/__24.html |title=Tabaksteuergesetz (TabStG) &lt;sup&gt;§ 24 Beipackverbot&lt;/sup&gt; |author= |date= |language=de |website=gesetze-im-internet.de |page= |publisher=juris GmbH |access-date=2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ticha Reservoir''' ({{lang-bg|язовир Тича}}, ''yazovir Ticha'') is a reservoir in [[Varbitsa Municipality]], [[Shumen Province]], northeastern [[Bulgaria]], located to the north and northeast of the town of [[Varbitsa (town)|Varbitsa]]. It is one of the largest lakes of Bulgaria. The Ticha Dam is located in the northeastern part of the reservoir, in the southeastern part of [[Kotel Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://birdsinbulgaria.org/ovm.php?l=en&amp;pageNum_Ovm_All=0&amp;totalRows_Ovm_All=113&amp;id=29|title=Important Bird Areas: Kotlenska Mountain|publisher=Birds in Bulgaria|accessdate=19 January 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reservoir lies along the Golyama Kamchia River, one of the two rivers that merge to form the [[Kamchiya|Kamchia]].&lt;ref name="bgenc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Българска енциклопедия А-Я |publisher=БАН, Труд, Сирма |language=Bulgarian |year=2002 |chapter=КАМЧИЯ (в древността: Панисус, през средновековието: Тича) |isbn=954-8104-08-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before entering the reservoir, the river gathers waters from the hilly [[Gerlovo]] region.&lt;ref name="rdg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shumen.dag.bg/struct/lang/1/type/L/id/191/unit_single|title=ДЛС Преслав|publisher=Регионална дирекция по горите Шумен|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the reservoir is derived from the medieval name of the Kamchia: the Ticha.&lt;ref name="bgenc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bluelink-hydro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluelink.net/water/chmr/kamchia/obshti_hidrl_danni.htm|title=Камчия: Общи хидроложки данни|publisher=BlueLink|accessdate=19 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005165453/http://www.bluelink.net/water/chmr/kamchia/obshti_hidrl_danni.htm|archivedate=5 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some measurements, it is the third-largest reservoir in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="btv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btv.bg/news/bulgaria/bedstvia-avarii/story/1706966408-Yazovir_%E2%80%9ETicha_preliva.html|title=Язовир "Тича" прелива|date=2010-07-11|publisher=bTV|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By design, the Ticha Reservoir is used mainly for [[irrigation]];&lt;ref name="knight"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=C.

The dam overflowed in July 2005 and July 2010, threatening the surrounding villages and land. Due to this, the water level of the reservoir is closely monitored and [[Dyke (construction)|dyke]]s have been built.&lt;ref name="btv"/&gt; Unlike the 2005 flood, which caused significant damage in the village of [[Byal Bryag]], the 2010 overflow did not lead to floods in the neighbouring populated places.&lt;ref name="dnevnik"&gt;{{cite news|title=Язовир "Тича" прелива, няма опасност за населението|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2010/07/12/931518_iazovir_ticha_preliva_niama_opasnost_za_naselenieto/|date=2010-07-12|work=Дневник|publisher=Икономедиа|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the [[tap water]] in [[Shumen]]&lt;!--the city, or the whole province?--&gt;, which comes from the Ticha Reservoir, was declared unsuitable for drinking as a result of the presence of ''[[E. coli]]'' strains.&lt;ref name="dnevnik2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2010/02/19/861454_vodata_v_shumen_e_negodna_za_piene/|title=Водата в Шумен е негодна за пиене|work=Дневник|publisher=Икономедиа|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trilogy of Fallot''' is a congenital heart disease consisting of the following defects: pulmonary valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy and atrial septal defect. This disease is 1.6-1.8% of all congenital heart defects.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Mechanism==
It consists of the following:
* [[pulmonary valve stenosis]]
* [[right ventricular hypertrophy]]
* [[atrial septal defect]]

The first two of these are also found in the [[tetralogy of Fallot]]. However, the tetralogy has a [[ventricular septal defect]] instead of an atrial one, and it also involves an [[overriding aorta]].
==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=September 2017}}

==Treatment==
[[Thoracotomy]] is used to surgically correct this pathology.&lt;ref name="pmid10397435"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Open-heart surgery in 48 patients via a small right anterolateral thoracotomy |journal=Tex Heart Inst J |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=124–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10397435 |pmc=325616 |doi= |url= |display-authors=3 |author1=Wang YQ |author2=Chen RK |author3=Ye WW |name-list-format=vanc |last4=Zhong |first4=BT |last5=He |first5=QC |last6=Chen |first6=ZL |last7=Li |first7=ZJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions''' (HELP) generally considers matters relating to these issues.  Its jurisdiction extends beyond these issues to include several more specific areas, as defined by [[United States Senate|Senate]] rules.

While currently known as the HELP Committee, the first iteration of this committee was founded on January 28, 1869 as the Committee on Education. The committee name was changed to the Committee on Education and Labor on February 14, 1870, when petitions relating to labor were added to their jurisdiction from the Committee on Naval Affairs.

The committee’s jurisdiction at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on issues relating to federal employees’ working conditions and federal education aid. Prominent issues considered by the committee in the 1910s and 1920s included the creation of a minimum wage, the establishments of a Department of Labor, a Department of Education, and a Children’s Bureau. During the 1930s, the committee took action on the [[National Labor Relations Act]], the [[Walsh–Healey Public Contracts Act|Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936]] and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938.

In 1944, the jurisdiction of the Public Health Service was transferred from the Commerce Committee over to the Committee on Education and Labor, resulting in the committee taking over issues relating to public health matters. The name of the committee changed during the 80th Congress to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, which was part of the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]] (Public Law 79-601). As part of this bill, the jurisdiction of the committee was expanded to include the issues of rehabilitation, health, and education of veterans. Mine safety legislation was also added to the committee’s jurisdiction in 1949.

During the Johnson Administration, the committee established itself as the principal committee for the legislation pertaining to the [[War on Poverty]], as part of the [[Economic Opportunity Act of 1964]]. Through the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970]] (Public Law 91-510), certain issues pertaining to veterans were transferred to the newly created [[United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Committee on Veterans Affairs]]. In the 95th Congress, the Senate passed S. Res. 4 which renamed the committee to be the Committee on Human Resources. However, the name was again changed in the 96th Congress in S. Res. 30 to become the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. On March 18, 1992, the committee’s jurisdiction was updated to include all of the areas listed below. The current name of the Committee, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, was created on January 19, 1999 in S. Res. 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/10458034|title=U.S. Senate.
