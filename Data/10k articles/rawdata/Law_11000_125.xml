'''''Allonby v Accrington &amp; Rossendale College''''' (2004) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62001CJ0256&amp;from=EN C-256/01] is a [[European Union law]] case concerning the right of men and women to [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for work of equal value under Article 141 of the [[Treaty of the European Community]].

==Facts==
Part-time lecturers at [[Accrington and Rossendale College]] did not have their contracts renewed. They were rehired through an agency, ELS, and said to be "self-employed independent contractors" under the new arrangement. They were denied access to the Teachers Superannuation Scheme. It was apparent that more of the part-time lecturers were women than the staff that remained under permanent contracts with the college. 

They brought a claim for unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. The Tribunal held that while there was no sex discrimination, there was an unfair dismissal. Lindsay J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal held there were sound business reasons for the change, given that the College was in financial trouble, and therefore objective justification of the disparate impact on women and no discrimination.

==Judgment==

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal referred to the European Court of Justice for advice on the application of Art. 141.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] ICR 1189&lt;/ref&gt; It held that the EAT failed to consider whether there could ever be a justification if the primary aim of the dismissal was discriminatory. Sedley LJ commented as follows, without saying whether the outcome would be favourable when it was reconsidered at tribunal, which would have to decide again on proportionate impact.

{{Cquote|Once a finding of a condition having a disparate and adverse impact on women had been made, what was required was at the minimum a critical evaluation of whether the college's reasons demonstrated a real need to dismiss the applicant; if there was such a need, consideration of the seriousness of the disparate impact of the dismissal on women including the applicant; and an evaluation of whether the former were sufficient to outweigh the latter. There is no sign of this process in the tribunal's extended reasons.}}

===European Court of Justice===
The ECJ held&lt;ref&gt;See also [2004] IRLR 224&lt;/ref&gt; that despite the contract saying they were self-employed, and despite national legislation under the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] applying only to employees, workers and those personally performing work (which may have brought the outside the Act's protection&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Mingeley v Pennock and Ivory (t/a Amber Cars)|Mingeley v Pennock and Ivory]]'' [2004] EWCA Civ 328&lt;/ref&gt;) the lecturers did fall within the Community definition of worker.

{{cquote|64. The term worker within the meaning of Article 141(1) EC is not expressly defined in the EC Treaty. It is therefore necessary, in order to determine its meaning, to apply the generally recognised principles of interpretation, having regard to its context and to the objectives of the Treaty.

65. According to Article 2 EC, the Community is to have as its task to promote, among other things, equality between men and women. Article 141(1) EC constitutes a specific expression of the principle of equality for men and women, which forms part of the fundamental principles protected by the Community legal order (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-270/97 and C-271/97 Deutsche Post [2000] ECR I-929, paragraph 57). As the Court held in Defrenne II, cited above (paragraph 12), the principle of equal pay forms part of the foundations of the Community .

66. Accordingly, the term worker used in Article 141(1) EC cannot be defined by reference to the legislation of the Member States but has a Community meaning. Moreover, it cannot be interpreted restrictively.

67. For the purposes of that provision, there must be considered as a worker a person who, for a certain period of time, performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration (see, in relation to free movement of workers, in particular Case 66/85 ''Lawrie-Blum'' [1986] ECR 2121, paragraph 17, and ''Martínez Sala'', paragraph 32).

68. Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 141(2) EC, for the purpose of that article, pay means the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of his employment, from his employer. It is clear from that definition that the authors of the Treaty did not intend that the term worker, within the meaning of Article 141(1) EC, should include independent providers of services who are not in a relationship of subordination with the person who receives the services (see also, in the context of free movement of workers, Case C-337/97 ''Meeusen'' [1999] ECR I-3289, paragraph 15).

69. The question whether such a relationship exists must be answered in each particular case having regard to all the factors and circumstances by which the relationship between the parties is characterised.

70. Provided that a person is a worker within the meaning of Article 141(1) EC, the nature of his legal relationship with the other party to the employment relationship is of no consequence in regard to the application of that article (see, in the context of free movement of workers, Case 344/87 Bettray [1989] ECR 1621, paragraph 16, and Case C-357/89 ''Raulin'' [1992] ECR I-1027, paragraph 10).

71. The formal classification of a self-employed person under national law does not exclude the possibility that a person must be classified as a worker within the meaning of Article 141(1) EC if his independence is merely notional, thereby disguising an employment relationship within the meaning of that article.

72. In the case of teachers who are, vis-à-vis an intermediary undertaking, under an obligation to undertake an assignment at a college, it is necessary in particular to consider the extent of any limitation on their freedom to choose their timetable, and the place and content of their work. The fact that no obligation is imposed on them to accept an assignment is of no consequence in that context (see to that effect, in relation to free movement of workers, ''Raulin'', paragraphs 9 and 10).}}

However, while they fell within the category of "worker", their claim failed because she could not point to a comparator that came from the same "single source".

Yet the ECJ stated that the rule that only "employees" could join the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme could well be incompatible with Article 141. The rule would be incompatible and should be disapplied if it shown to have an adverse impact on more women than men. If it is disapplied, it is not necessary for the claimant to point to a comparator of the opposite sex working for the same employer who has been adversely affected by the rule.

An '''asset-protection trust''' is any form of trust which provides for funds to be held on a [[discretionary trust|discretionary basis]]. Such trusts are set up in an attempt to avoid or mitigate the effects of [[taxation]], [[divorce]] and [[bankruptcy]] on the beneficiary. Such trusts are therefore frequently proscribed or limited in their effects by governments and the courts.

The asset-protection trust is a trust that splits the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership. The beneficiaries of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable interests in the trust assets, but they do not hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of [[asset protection]] planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or [[tax evasion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} A creditor's ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary's interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary's interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Such trusts must be irrevocable (a revocable trust will not provide asset protection because and to the extent of the settlor's power to revoke). Most of them contain a spendthrift clause preventing a trust beneficiary from alienating his or her expected interest in favor of a creditor. The spendthrift clause has three general exceptions to the protection afforded: the self-settled trusts (if the settlor of a trust is also a beneficiary of a trust), the case when a debtor is the sole beneficiary and the sole trustee of a trust, and the support payments (a court may order the trustee to satisfy a beneficiary's support obligation to a former spouse or minor child). The first general exception, which accounts for the majority of asset protection trusts, no longer applies in several jurisdictions. The laws of certain jurisdictions including Alaska, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands allow self-settled trusts to afford their settlors the protection of the spendthrift clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1163&amp;context=alr|first=Jeremy M.|last=Veit|title=Self-Settled Spendthrift Trusts and the Alaska Trust Act: Has Alaska Moved Offshore?|journal=Alaska Law Review|volume=16|issue=2|page=269}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of trusts==
{{main|Trust law}}

Trusts were developed at common law in England originally to minimize the impact of inheritance taxes arising from transfers at death.  The essence of the trust was to separate "legal" title, which was given to someone to hold as "trustee", from "equitable title", which was to be retained by the trust beneficiaries.

In the United States and England, a practice developed whereby trust [[settlor]]s began to use "[[Spendthrift trust|spendthrift]]" clauses to prevent trust beneficiaries from alienating their beneficial interests to creditors.  Over time, courts were asked to determine the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against the trust beneficiaries seeking to engage in such assignments, and the creditors of those beneficiaries seeking to reach trust assets. A case law doctrine developed whereby courts may generally recognize the efficacy of spendthrift clauses as against trust beneficiaries and their creditors, but not against creditors of a settlor.

==Domestic asset protection trust==

Alaska was the first US jurisdiction to enact laws allowing protection for self-settled trusts (in 1997) and was shortly followed by Delaware, Nevada, South Dakota and a few others. These trusts are known as ''Domestic Asset Protection Trusts'' (DAPTs). Usually, a DAPT must comply with the following requirements:
* the trust must be irrevocable and spendthrift;
* at least one resident trustee must be appointed;
* some administration of the trust must be conducted in respective state;
* the settlor cannot act as a trustee.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Trusts are generally governed by the laws of the jurisdiction that is designated by the settlor as the governing jurisdiction. There are two exceptions to the general rule, which may create conflicts of law: (i) states will not recognize laws of sister states that violate their own public policy, and (ii) if the trust owns real property, such property will be governed by the law of jurisdiction that is the property's situs. Additionally, the [[Full Faith and Credit clause]] of the Constitution provides that each state must give full faith and credit to the laws of every other state. This means that if a court from another state refuses to recognize the protection of a DAPT and enters a judgment for the creditor, the creditor may be able to enforce the judgment against the trustee of the DAPT, even if that trustee was located in the DAPT jurisdiction. The efficacy of a DAPT may also be challenged under the Supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, under the applicable [[fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]] statute, or because the settlor retained some prohibited control over the trust.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

These jurisdictions are also known as ''United States Asset Protection Trusts'' (USAPTs), from the point of view of the non-US settlors. The issues that would seem to apply on a USAPT established by a non-US settlor are: 1) whether a non-US court has jurisdiction over the USAPT; 2) the conflict of US versus non-US laws (i.e., which jurisdiction's laws will apply to the trust and the protection it purports to offer); 3) which fraudulent transfer law would apply; and 4) whether the US state court will recognize the non-US judgment.&lt;ref name="USAPT"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States As An Offshore Asset Protection Trust Jurisdiction – The World’s Best Kept Secret |author=Alexander A. Bove, Jr. |publisher=Trusts &amp; Trustees, Vol. 14 Issue 1 (Oxford Journals, 2008) |url=http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085701/http://www.bovelanga.com/publications/articles/US%20as%20Offshore%20Asset%20Protection%20Jurisdiction.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context of a non-US settlor has a few advantages over that of a US settlor. The issue of the Full Faith and Credit clause doctrine of the US Constitution would not apply to a non-US settlor facing a non-US judgment. Creditors of non-US settlors would have to first obtain a judgment in their home jurisdiction and then attempt to enforce that "foreign" judgment in the US against the trustee of the USAPT, who was not a party to the original action. Therefore, except in unusual cases, this would mean that the only issues to litigate would be whether a fraudulent transfer has taken place, and in turn, which jurisdiction's fraudulent transfer laws would apply. Despite that, the non-US creditor must still seek to first have the foreign judgment recognized, because without formal legal acknowledgment of the judgment in the US court, there would be no basis on which to question the transfer.&lt;ref name="USAPT"/&gt;

==U.S. jurisdictions==

===South Dakota===

South Dakota was one of the first states (1983) to allow a trust to endure perpetually, essentially jumping outside the onerous federal transfer (gift, estate and generation-skipping) tax system theoretically forever. Currently, twenty-four other states have joined the ranks of offering a long-term trust. Nineteen of these states, including South Dakota, allow a trust to continue in perpetuity.

South Dakota does not impose any form of state taxation on the assets that comprise a trust located there. This includes, but is not limited to: no state income, capital gains, dividend/interest and/or intangible's taxes. Additionally, South Dakota has the lowest insurance premium tax of any state (i.e., 8 basis points or 8/100ths of 1%) and also offers other very favorable insurance legislation. South Dakota also has both excellent self-settled trust as well as third party discretionary trust statutes, both allowing for domestic asset protection planning with trusts.

South Dakota is the first and only state in the US with a third party discretionary trust statute for asset protection, which states that a discretionary interest in third party trust, limited power of appointments, and remainder interests are not considered property interests. This statute is extremely important to properly asset protect trusts set up to benefit one's family. South Dakota also has some of the top-rated Asset Protection statutes for LLCs and LPs based upon a powerful "sole remedy charging order statute". Consequently, most of the unique and creative trust strategies for the wealthy involve trust administration in South Dakota without the necessity of having the trust's family reside there.

==Offshore jurisdictions==

The trust laws of the offshore world are typically founded on the trust laws of the onshore world. For those jurisdictions which are currently possessions of the UK, or were former possessions of the UK, typically the UK Trustee Act of 1925 is the common starting point. From there, each jurisdiction has sought to develop and evolve the law in a race to develop the most attractive trust environment which maintains acceptable standards, preserves the concepts of a trust, yet is attractive to potential users. Many of these jurisdictions share similar characteristics.

===Bahamas===

The Commonwealth of the Bahamas have traditionally been associated with offshore planning.  However, the Bahamas are probably more noteworthy for offshore banking.  The Bahamas do not recognize self-settled spendthrift trusts, unlike the Cook Islands, Nevis, or Belize.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Bahamian Trust has a limitation period of two years, the same as Cook Islands.

The quality of the banking and investment services is reasonable for the uses of a Trustee of an asset protection trust, however, the quality of the judiciary is considered low, as the legal profession is generally closed to the entry of non-Bahamians, and it is therefore difficult bring the knowledge of a specialised trust lawyer to the jurisdiction when needed.

===Belize===

[[Belize]], offers immediate protection from court action initiated by creditors which challenges the settlor's transfer of property into the trust.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country.

===Bermuda===

[[Bermuda]], entry to follow

===Cayman Islands===

[[Cayman Islands]] trusts are governed principally by the Cayman Islands Trusts Law (2009 Revision), however elements of the Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 are relevant when considering the asset protection benefits of Cayman Trusts.

A number of offshore jurisdictions have enacted modern asset protection legislation based on the Cayman Island's Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989 (the "FDL").&lt;ref&gt;Cayman Islands Fraudulent Dispositions Law 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Cayman Islands FDL states "Every disposition of property made with an intention to defraud, and at undervalue, shall be voidable at the insistence of an eligible creditor thereby prejudiced".&lt;ref&gt;STEP Diploma in International Trust Management Course Notes Module 11&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of proof is borne by the creditor applying to set aside the trust, and in the case of the Cayman Islands, the creditor/claimant must bring an action in the Cayman Islands courts (not in their home jurisdiction). The bar is set high for a potential claimant to successfully challenge a transfer. They must demonstrate an intention to defraud on behalf of the Settlor, and they must demonstrate they are an "eligible creditor" - meaning that at the date of the transfer, the transferor owes an obligation to the claimant. They must also be willing to bring an action in the Cayman Islands, which by itself is an expensive proposition.

The burden of proof for a claimant to challenge a transfer into a Cayman Trust has a limitation period of six years.

In Cayman it is possible to register a trust as an Exempt Trust &lt;ref&gt;Cayman Trusts Law (2009 Revision - Part VI - Section 74(1))&lt;/ref&gt; however it is voluntary registration regime only, so most trusts remain unregistered. As most Cayman trusts are therefore private arrangements, it is hard to give exact figures for the popularity of AP Trusts governed by Cayman law. However the number of licensed trust companies give us some indication of how the jurisdiction is viewed. As of 30 September 2012 the Fiduciary Services Division of CIMA, the body responsible for licensing and regulating trust companies in the Cayman Islands has supervisory responsibility for 146 active trust licences.&lt;ref&gt;CIMA website: http://www.cimoney.com.ky/Stats_Reg_Ent/stats_reg_ent.aspx?id=298&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Dependent Territory, the quality of the judiciary is considered excellent, with the islands able to draw on the services of UK lawyers and solicitors when contentious cases arise and expert lawyers with appropriate experience are required. The quality of banking and investment services are reasonably good.

===Cook Islands===

The Cook Islands claims to be the first country to have enacted an explicit asset protection law, implementing particular provisions in 1989 to its International Trusts Act.&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these changes have been adopted in one form or another in several other countries and a handful of a U.S. states.  The most important of these changes permits the settlor of a trust to be named as a spendthrift beneficiary.

The trust laws of the Cook Islands provide a shortened statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer claims.  While most U.S. states have a four-year statute of limitations (and the Statute of Elizabeth in some common law jurisdictions has no statute of limitations), the general statute of limitations in the Cook Islands is reduced to two years for fraudulent transfers; in certain circumstances, it may be as short as one year.  If the trust is funded while the settlor is solvent, then the transfer cannot be challenged.(i.e., there is no time period for the creditor to challenge the transfer)&lt;ref name="Howard Rosen"/&gt;

Several provisions of the Cook Islands law specify the form of pleading that a creditor must establish in order for its claim to be heard in a Cook Islands court.  The effect of these provisions is to raise the burden of proof to "beyond a reasonable doubt," something akin to a criminal law standard, in order for a creditor to establish a fraudulent transfer.  The "constructive" fraudulent transfer theories are eliminated under Cook Islands law, requiring the creditor to prove that the transfer was made with specific intent to avoid the creditor's claim.

It is believed that the Cook Islands now has more registered asset protection trusts than any other country, although it should be noted that in most jurisdictions a Trust is considered a private arrangement and it is not a requirement to register a Trust.  Case law is somewhat lacking in the Cook Islands. However, some landmark decisions show that the Cook Islands Court intends to uphold the asset protection trust law.  In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission attempted to recover assets from a Cook Islands Trust.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Titling Assets: Pitfalls to be Avoided - Part I|url=http://protectyou.com/2007/06/titling-assets-pitfalls-to-avoid/|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit filed by the FTC against a trust company was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="protectyou.com"/&gt; The quality of the judiciary and the associated banking and investment services offered from the Cook Islands are considered poor.

===Nevis===

Nevis was one of the first countries to follow the Cook Islands, duplicating an older version of the Cook Islands law and naming it the Nevis International Exempt Trust Ordinance, 1994.  One distinguishing feature of the Nevis legislation is that a creditor must post a bond of ECB 25,000 (roughly USD 13,000) to lodge a complaint against a trust registered in Nevis.

Very little case law exists in Nevis, which many attorneys interpret to mean that creditors are effectively deterred from bringing suit in Nevis.  It has a small offshore banking industry, with St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Bank and Bank of Nevis International as the only licensed offshore banks.

LLC legislation modeled after the Delaware LLC Act was passed in 1996.  This has enabled Nevis to distinguish itself as a primary offshore jurisdiction for LLC formations, as opposed to other countries that are well known for IBC formations (British Virgin Islands) or trust formations (Cayman Islands).  A Nevis LLC is often used in conjunction with an asset protection trust because it gives the creator of the trust direct control over the assets if the creator is listed as the manager of the Nevis LLC.  This gives the creator added security in that it keeps the assets one step removed from the trustee of the asset protection trust.  Because the managers and members of a Nevis LLC are not public information, the creator of the trust is able to assume control over the assets without disclosing his control on any public records.

===Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)===

The Channel Islands have been long regarded as being the first jurisdictions to develop an offshore finance industry, each is often regarded as being one of the best quality jurisdictions to use.  Fully compliant with anti money laundering laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054208/https://www.bedellgroup.com/siteFiles/resources/docs/insights/Briefings/Money%20Laundering%20-%20Jersey%20Briefings/TheAnti-MoneyLaunderingRegime-AJerseyOverview.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |title=The Anti-Money Laundering Regime: A Jersey Overview |publisher=Bedell Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing taxation information with an increasing number of countries, modern case law indicate that creditors, who have a rightful claim, are able to freeze trust assets in the Channel Islands.  Tax law initiatives in the UK have largely eliminated the tax advantages of UK citizens placing assets in trust in the Channel Islands, which in the early years had been a source of business.  While the Channel Islands enjoys a modern banking sector, most attorneys do not regard the Channel Islands as appropriate for asset protection planning.

The judicial systems of the Channel Islands are split into two distinct Bailiwicks. The [[Bailiwick of Jersey]], and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] (which includes the islands of Guernsey, Alderney Sark, and Herm). The legal systems in each island follows a dual system based on Norman-French codified law overlaid with elements of English common law. Whilst specialised training is required in order to practice law in each of the Bailiwicks, the Bar is not open to everyone, the quality of the judiciary is generally considered very good, if not very expensive. Regulation of Fiduciary companies and the related banking and investment services offered in the Channel Islands is also considered good to excellent.

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===

Switzerland and Liechtenstein are noteworthy for large banking sectors and sophisticated wealth management services.  While both countries now recognize trusts (particularly trusts established under the laws of another jurisdiction, such as Nevis), there is no available case law yet which indicates how the courts of those two countries will enforce offshore asset protection trust laws.

Many attorneys establish asset protection trusts under the laws of another country and deposit the trust assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein.  One question raised by this approach is whether a creditor can seize assets in Switzerland or Liechtenstein without having to bring a claim in the trust-protective jurisdiction.  Again, a lack of precedent suggests that this is an open issue in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Both countries are also known for offering asset protection annuities, with a six-month statute of limitations on fraudulent transfers into an annuity.  Unfortunately for most Americans, these annuities cannot invest in US securities without punitive taxation due to the offshore status of the insurance carriers that offer these annuity products.  Furthermore, many lawyers peddling these annuity products to their clients collect commissions from the insurance carriers.  These reasons, among others, may help explain why annuities offered in these two countries are not particularly popular with U.S. persons.  This does not mean that taxpayers of other jurisdictions may not significantly benefit from holding a Swiss or Liechtenstein annuity.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to: How [http://www.swissannuity.ch Asset protection with Swiss/Liechtenstein annuity works]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, U.S. persons may benefit from holding an annuity issued by a carrier in an asset-protective jurisdiction (such as the Cook Islands), particularly if the carrier is an electing 953(d) carrier (a reference to a provision of US tax law).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 953(d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

Whether such a trust is a [[spendthrift trust]] on the U.S. model, a [[protective trust]] on the Commonwealth model or another form of discretionary trust, it is more likely to be subject to challenge under the [[common law]] doctrine of sham or under specific statutory provisions if any person setting up the trust (or their spouse and their spouse in turn as in a [[reciprocal trust]]):
*can benefit under its provisions;
*is the person under risk financially;
*benefits (whether permitted or not) from the trust; or
*if the person setting up the trust is at risk financially, if bankruptcy or divorce occurs soon after the establishment of the trust ([[fraudulent conveyance]]).

[[Offshore trust]]s and other asset protection vehicles typically do not prevent action against the individual concerned in his or her home country. Orders under divorce and creditor protection laws can typically be made against that individual notwithstanding the alleged independence of such trustees. If a judge determines that the trust settlor controls the assets of the offshore trust, the judge may order the settlor to repatriate the trust assets.  Failure to comply with the court's order may lead to a finding of contempt of court and imprisonment.  For this reason, a properly established asset protection trust should provide a clear separation between the settlor and those who exercise control over the trust assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of Proper APT Design &amp; Counsel|url=http://www.protectyou.com/newsletters/apn7-2.htm|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US v. Grant ===
The most recent case to rule on the merits of a contempt order is ''US v. Grant''.  In 2005, a federal district court in Miami ordered a domestic protector of an offshore asset protection trust, under threat of contempt, to exercise her power to replace the foreign trustee with a domestic trustee chosen by the court. The ruling, ''U.S. v. Grant'' Case No. 00-08986-Civ-Jordan (D.C. So. Fla. 2005), threatened to draw into question the viability of an asset-protection trust if a domestic protector could be compelled to appoint a domestic trustee to marshal the assets and bring them within the purview of the domestic court proceedings.

In May 2008, the U.S. government sought to hold the domestic protector in contempt of court for failing to secure the cooperation of the foreign trustee to resign and repatriate the trust assets. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled against the government, finding that the domestic protector could not be held in contempt for failure to gain the cooperation of the offshore trustee. In denying the government's contempt motion, the judge observed:

"I understand that it has been more than two years since the repatriation order was issued and that the funds had not yet been repatriated. But this failure is not for a lack of effort. I am reluctant to fault Mrs. Grant for her trustees' denial of her requests to repatriate the funds." ''U.S. v. Grant'', 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51332, 101 A.F. T.R.2d (RIA) 2676 (D.C. So. Fla. 2008).

For years, lawyers have vigorously debated the vulnerability of an asset protection trust with a domestic protector. The Grant case stands for the proposition that no vulnerability exists if the domestic protector complies with the court's orders. While a domestic protector may be required to make an effort to repatriate trust assets, failure to achieve repatriation should not entail any dire consequences to the trust or to the domestic protector. As long as a duress clause permits the foreign trustee to ignore the pleas of a domestic protector acting under threat of a contempt order, the selection of a domestic protector should not jeopardize the integrity of the offshore asset protection trust.

While most attorneys draft trust agreements to limit the domestic protector's powers to those of a negative nature (i.e., the domestic protector may veto trustee decisions, but a domestic protector cannot order a trustee to do anything), the ruling in ''Grant'' implies that even positive powers exercisable by a domestic protector may not jeopardize an offshore asset protection trust containing a duress clause. Whether this leads attorneys to be more cavalier in their trust drafting remains to be seen. At least we know that traditional offshore asset protection trust planning works as anticipated.

== Taxation ==

There are rigorous US tax reporting requirements that apply to taxpayers who establish offshore trusts.  While no additional tax is usually imposed, certain forms of asset protection trusts require full disclosure of all trust assets and activities on the U.S. contributor's tax returns.  Confidentiality is usually not enjoyed under these arrangements.

Most asset protection trusts established by U.S. settlors are considered "grantor trusts" under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all income of the trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., the settlor's) individual income tax return.  Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.

The '''Banishment Stela''' or '''Maunier Stela''' (Louvre C 256&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=19025&amp;langue=fr Full picture of the stela from Louvre official website]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian stela issued in c.1050 BCE. It contains an amnesty decree of the [[21st Dynasty]] [[Theban High Priests of Amun]] [[Menkheperre]].

==History==
The Banishment Stela was discovered in [[Luxor]] around 1860 by the then [[French people|French]] Vice-[[Consul]], [[Henri Maunier]]; it was carried to [[Paris]] in 1884 and exhibited at the [[Louvre]] where it still is.&lt;ref name=tuat&gt;Sternberg-el Hotabi, Heike (1986). "Die Stele der Verbannten", in: ''Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments, II/1'', pp. 112–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The stela is made from [[diorite]] and measures {{convert|127|cm|in|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width. The upper part is poorly preserved, and only a depiction of Menkheperre praying to the god [[Amun]] is still visible; the lower portion is in better condition and of the 23 lines of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] text, only the first 4 are mostly lost.&lt;ref name=tuat/&gt;

==Content==
The stela mentions three dates, although it is not entirely clear what happened on them, or even to which reign(s) they belonged. These dates are (in the order in which they appear in the text, which is not necessarily their correct chronological order):

*Date A: year 25, [[Epip|third month]] of the [[Season of the Harvest]] (= month 11), day 29
*Date B: year 25, [[Thout|first month]] of the [[Season of the Inundation]] (= month 1), day 4 or 5
*Date C: year ... , fourth month of the Season of the Harvest, [[epagomenal days]], Birth of [[Isis]]

According to Von Beckerath, with date C, for reasons of space, the regnal year could only have been relatively low. Acceptable solutions would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 or 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jürgen|last=von Beckerath|authorlink=Jürgen von Beckerath|year=1968|title= Die Stele der Verbannten im Museum des Louvre|journal=Revue d'Égyptologie|p=33, footnote 2|url=|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stela apparently reports that in the regnal Year 25 of an unknown [[pharaoh]] a revolt sparked in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] against the Priesthood of Amun. The revolt was suffocated in the same year, and the rebels were banished (date A) into the [[Kharga Oasis]] by decision of the [[oracle]] of Amun. Shortly after (date B) Menkheperre was installed as ''[[generalissimo]]'' and High Priest of Amun “by the god Amun himself”; in the early reign of another king (date C), Menkheperre again resorted to the oracle and obtained the recall and [[pardon]] of the [[exile]]s, just before issuing the stela to celebrate this act.&lt;ref name=tuat/&gt;&lt;ref name=jvb&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jürgen|last=von Beckerath|authorlink=Jürgen von Beckerath|year=1968|title= Die Stele der Verbannten im Museum des Louvre|journal=Revue d'Égyptologie|pp=7–36|url=|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king whose regnal Year 25 is reported on the stela (date A) could only have been the founder of the 21st Dynasty [[Smendes]], who is generally assumed to have reigned for around 25–26 years. The king who was in charge when the stela was issued (date C) was one of his immediate successors, most likely the ephemeral and poorly known [[Amenemnisu]], or alternatively but less likely, [[Psusennes I]].&lt;ref name=kk&gt;{{cite book |last=Kitchen |first=Kenneth A. |authorlink= Kenneth Kitchen |date=1996 |title=The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650&amp;nbsp;BC) |url= |location= Warminster |publisher= Aris &amp; Phillips Limited |page=608 |isbn= 0-85668-298-5}}, §§ 213, 217–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bill Chamber''' was formerly a [[court of Scotland|court]] of Scotland, often considered as part of the [[Court of Session]] but in fact separate from it. It dealt with petitions for [[Bill of suspension|suspension]] ([[Appeal cases|appeal]]), [[Interdicts in Scots law|interdict]], [[sequestrations]] etc., and was the approximate equivalent to sittings [[in camera]] (in chambers) in [[American law|American]] or [[English law]].

The Bill Chamber was "under the same roof" as the Court of Session, but was a separate court or jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission on the Court of Session and the Office of Sheriff Principal with Summary of Evidence|publisher=Royal Commission on Court of Session and Office of Sheriff Principal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its history and function were discussed in the report of the [[Royal Commission on the Court of Session and the Office of Sheriff Principal]] (1927) which concluded "the usefulness of the Bill Chamber as a Court separate from the Court of Session no longer exists" and it was thus abolished by the [[Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1933]].

Some of its processes are now carried out by the [[Accountant in Bankruptcy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9030">A '''capital asset''' is defined to include property of any kind held by an assessee, whether connected with their business or profession or not connected with their business or profession. It includes all kinds of property, movable or immovable, [[tangible]] or [[intangible asset|intangible]], fixed or circulating. Thus, land and building, plant and machinery, motorcar, furniture, [[jewellery]], route permits, [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]], tenancy rights, [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[shares]], [[debentures]], [[securities]], units, [[mutual funds]], [[zero-coupon bond]]s etc. are capital assets.

==Excluded from the definition==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{+rs|date=April 2016}}
{{Globalize|section|date=March 2014}}}}

# Any stock in trade, consumable stores, or raw materials held for the purpose of business or profession have been excluded from the definition of capital assets.
# Any movable property (excluding jewellery made out of gold, silver, precious stones, and drawing, paintings, sculptures, archeological collections, dinosaur bones, etc.) used for personal use by the assessee or any member (dependent) of assessee’s family is not treated as capital assets. ''For example'', wearing apparel, furniture, car or scooter, TV, refrigerator, musical instruments, gun, revolver, generator, etc. is the examples of personal effects. (But see IRS publication 544 chapter 2.)
# Agricultural land situated in rural area.
# 6.5% gold bonds or 7% gold bonds 1980, national defense gold bond 1980, issued by the central government.
# Special bearer bonds, 1991
# Gold deposit bonds issued under gold deposit scheme, 1999.

==Specific common definitions==

*In [[financial economics]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] refers to any [[asset]] used to make money, as opposed to assets used for personal enjoyment or consumption. This is an important distinction because two people can disagree sharply about the value of personal assets, one person might think a sports car is more valuable than a pickup truck, another person might have the opposite taste. But if an asset is held for the purpose of making money, taste has nothing to do with it, only differences of opinion about how much money the asset will produce. With the further assumption that people agree on the probability distribution of future cash flows, it is possible to have an objective [[capital asset pricing model]]. Even without the assumption of an agreement, it is possible to set rational limits on capital asset value.&lt;ref name="Fama"&gt;Eugene F. Fama and Merton H. Miller, ''The Theory of Finance'', Holt Rinehart and Winston (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;
*For United States Federal government accounting, capital assets have been defined including land (including parklands), structures, equipment (including motor and aircraft fleets), and [[intellectual property]] (including software), that have an estimated useful life (also known as [[service life]]) of two years or more. Capital assets exclude items acquired for resale in the ordinary course of operations or held for the purpose of physical consumption such as operating materials and supplies.&lt;ref name="OMBA-II"&gt;Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A–11: Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition of Capital Assets, Supplement-Capital Programming Guide.(2-14) Accessed at [http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/a11_current_year/capital_programming_guide.pdf] {{PD-USGov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The cost of a capital asset is its full [[life-cycle cost]], including all [[Direct costs|direct]] and [[indirect costs]] associated with the [[Capital budgeting|planning]], [[Infrastructure_and_economics#Engineering|engineering]], procurement including [[construction]] (purchase price and all other costs incurred to bring it to a form and location suitable for its intended use), operations and maintenance (including service contracts), and disposal.&lt;ref name="OMBA-II"/&gt; 
**Capital assets may be acquired in different ways: through purchase, construction, or manufacture; through a lease-purchase or other [[capital lease]], regardless of whether the title has passed to the Federal Government; through an [[operating lease]] for an asset with an estimated useful life of two years or more; or through an exchange. Capital assets include the environmental remediation of land to make it useful, leasehold improvements and land rights; assets owned by the Federal Government but located in a foreign country or held by others (such as Federal contractors, State and local governments, or colleges and universities); and assets whose ownership is shared by the Federal Government with other entities.&lt;ref name="OMBA-II"/&gt; 
**Capital assets include not only the assets as initially acquired but also additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements and reinstallations, and major improvements (but not ordinary repairs and maintenance).&lt;ref name="OMBA-II"/&gt; 
*For State or Local governmental accounting in the United States with reference to [[public capital]] or [[infrastructure]] a capital asset is defined as any asset used in operations with an initial useful life extending beyond one reporting period.&lt;ref name="GASB"&gt;Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 34, ''Basic Financial Statements—and Management’s Discussion and Analysis—for State and Local Governments'', paragraph 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, government managers have a "stewardship" duty to maintain capital assets under their control.  ''See [[International Public Sector Accounting Standards]] for details.  See [[Triple bottom line]] for widely used public sector accounting methods in which [[natural capital]] and [[social capital]] are characterized not as [[intangible asset|intangibles]] or [[externalities]] but as actual capital assets.''
*In some income tax systems (for example, in the United States), gains and losses from capital assets [[Capital gains tax|are treated differently than other income]]. Sale of non-capital assets, such as inventory or stock of goods held for sale, generally is taxed in the same manner as other income.  Capital assets generally include those assets outside the daily scope of business operations, such as investment or personal assets.  The United States system defines a capital asset by exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221- 26 USC 1221].  ''Also see the discussion of capital gains and losses in [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#en_US_publink100010476 IRS Publication 550].&lt;/ref&gt;  Capital assets include all assets ''except''  inventory of supplies or property held for sale (including subdivided real estate), [[Depreciation|depreciable]] property used in a business, accounts or [[notes receivable]], certain commodities derivatives and hedging items, and certain copyrights and similar property held by the creator of the property.  The United Kingdom has an even broader definition.&lt;ref&gt;See HMRC discussion of [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/intro/when-to-pay.htm assets liable to capital gains tax].&lt;/ref&gt;''

==US tax definition versus broader economic definition==
A well-known [[Financial accountancy|financial accounting]] textbook&lt;ref name="Stickney"&gt;Clyde P. Stickney and [[Roman L. Weil]], ''Financial Accounting'', p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt; advises that the term be avoided except in [[Tax accounting in the United States|tax accounting]] because it is used in so many different senses, not all of them well-defined. For example it is often used as a synonym for [[fixed assets]]&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;John Owen Edward Clark, ''Dictionary of International Accounting Terms'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; or for investments in [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name="Stickney"/&gt;

However this advice is questionable beyond the US private context. Several public sector standards in global use, notably [[triple bottom line]] accounting as defined by [[ICLEI]] for world cities, require that employees or the environment or something else be treated as a capital asset. In this context it means something managers have a responsibility to maintain, and to report changes in value as gains or losses.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;David F. Robinson, "Human asset accounting", ''Long Range Planning'', v. 7, i. 1, February 1974, Pp. 58-60.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''See [[human capital]], [[natural capital]], [[triple bottom line]], [[human development theory]].''

Capital assets should not be confused with the [[Capital requirement|capital]] a financial institution is required to hold. This [[Capital requirement|capital]] is computed from the right-hand side of the [[balance sheet]] while [[asset]]s are found on the left-hand side.&lt;ref name="Stickney" /&gt;  ''See [[Basel III]] for a summary of how such requirements are proposed to be calculated.''

Smart is an important figure within the feminist criminology world. Her book titled ''Women, Crime and Criminology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smart | first = Carol | title = Women, crime, and criminology: a feminist critique | publisher = Routledge &amp; K. Paul | location = London Boston | year = 1977 | isbn = 9780710088338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1976, remains a key feminist critique of criminology. Smart was also the co-director of the [[Arthur Lewis Building|Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life]] at Manchester.

== Career ==
Smart began her academic career by studying sociology at [[Portsmouth Polytechnic]], which is now [[Portsmouth University]]. After completing her BA, she moved on to complete her masters in criminology from the [[University of Sheffield]]. She also completed her PhD in Socio-Legal studies also from Sheffield in 1983.

Smart began her teaching career at the then, Trent Polytechnic, (as a lecturer and senior lecturer). After that, she became a professor at the [[University of Leeds]]. In 2005, she moved to the Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life in the [[Arthur Lewis Building]] of the University of Manchester, where she was co-director. She retired in 2014&lt;ref name="offhp"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/Carol.smart/ |title=Prof Carol Smart - personal details}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Smart has published works in the areas of criminology, family law and social policy. Her main interests over the last few years have been family life and intimacy and how people conduct their personal lives. Smart has done much research on divorce and separation and how this affects children, the couple and other kin, and on gay and lesbian civil partnerships and their commitment ceremonies. More recently she has been working on 'Relative Strangers',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/morgancentre/research/relative-strangers/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; a project which explores the experiences of families with donor-conceived children.

She was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2017 New Year Honours]] for services to the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61803|supp=y|page=N10|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[confiscation]] of Armenian properties''' by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] governments involved seizure of the assets, properties and land of the country's [[Turkish Armenians|Armenian community]]. Starting with the [[Hamidian massacres]] in the mid-1890s and peaking during the [[Armenian Genocide]], the confiscation of the Armenian property lasted continuously until the [[Istanbul pogrom]] of 1955 and with renewed efforts in 1974.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=11|ps=: "[[Sait Çetinoglu]] has placed the expropriation of Armenians during the 1915 genocide in a much wider historical context. He argues that from the prism of the longue durée, the period 1895–1955 brought a complete obliteration to the economic life of Ottoman Armenians. This process moved from the 1895 Abdulhamid massacres to the Adana massacre, reached a zenith with the genocide and ultimately in the burning of Smyrna, continued in peacetime during the interwar discriminations, accelerated during the Wealth Tax launched during World War II, and found a conclusion in the 6–7 September 1955 pogrom. Within only sixty years, Ottoman Armenians had been eradicated–economically and in many other ways."}} Much of the confiscations during the Armenian Genocide were made after the Armenians were deported into the [[Syrian Desert]] with the government declaring their goods and assets left behind as "abandoned". Virtually all properties owned by Armenians living in their ancestral homeland in [[Western Armenia]]  were confiscated and later distributed among the local Muslim population. Renewed efforts were introduced in 1974 where the property acquired by the Armenian community after the property declaration of 1936 was confiscated.

Historians argue that the mass confiscation of Armenian properties was an important factor in forming the economic basis of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] while endowing Turkey's economy with [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The appropriation led to the formation of a new Turkish [[bourgeoisie]] and an exclusive middle class.

{{double image|right|OrientAbandonedProperties 02.png|135|OrientAbandonedProperties_01.png|170|The "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation" was published in many newspapers throughout the Ottoman Empire. Above is an example of one such publication, a 23 October 1915 issue of the English language Turkish newspaper ''[[The Orient (newspaper)|The Orient]]'', which fully published the law with all eleven articles. [[Arthur von Gwinner]], head of the [[Deutsche Bank]], mocked the law by saying that the eleven articles should be reduced to two, "1. All goods of the Armenians are confiscated. 2.

While the Tehcir law was being carried out, the Directorate for the Settlement of Tribes and Refugees (Turkish: Iskan-i Asairin Muhacirin Muduriyeti), under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was tasked in June 1915 to deal with the property left behind by deported or killed Armenians. This commission, whose salaries were provided by property confiscated by Armenians, produced the "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation ("Abandoned Properties" law) and published in the official register on 27 September (13 September according to the Islamic calendar) and passed a further directive for implementation of the law on 8 November.&lt;ref name=anastasia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lekka|first=Anastasia|title=Legislative Provisions of the Ottoman/Turkish Governments Regarding Minorities and Their Properties|journal=Mediterranean Quarterly|date=Winter 2007|volume=18|issue=1|pages=135–154|issn=1047-4552|doi=10.1215/10474552-2006-038}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|p=204}}{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=351}} The objectives of the laws were simultaneously to reduce Armenian property ownership, enrich national politicians, and to resettle Turkish Muslim refugees in property which was seized.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt;{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|p=204}} The property confiscated included personal property (including land, buildings, and bank accounts), businesses, and also community property (e.g. churches).

These resettlement laws did contain formal reporting of property to national authorities and contained procedures for those who had property taken to sue, but the specifics of the law made these provisions serve the larger goal to "[[Turkification|Turkify]]" regions and economic sectors.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|pp=204–205}} The property records and revenue generated from the sale or rent of confiscated property were all recorded and deposited with the Ministry of Financial Affairs to provide for the possible return of property to owners.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; In addition, the law provided that those whose property had been confiscated to sue for return of the property (and payment for any damages which occurred). However, the law required property owners to sue and be present themselves (not allowing the [[power of attorney]]), an impossibility when property owners had been killed or deported. In addition, the defendant in any case would be the state which made the chances of success in any lawsuit extremely unlikely.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; Finally, the law provided that the confiscated property be sold at auction; however, because the law specified that "anybody other than Turkish Muslim refugees can only acquire property in Turkey with the approval of the Ministry of Internal Affairs", the result was that non-Turkish Muslims were effectively excluded.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; Property was provided often to national and local political elites, who eventually gave them to Turkish Muslim refugees.{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|pp=205}}

In this way all the Armenian houses, stores, shops, fields, gardens, vineyards, merchandise, household goods, rugs, were taken. The work was the charge of a commission, the members of which I met personally a number of times. It was commonly said that the commission did not actually receive enough for the government purposes to cover its expenses. Real estate was put up for rent at auction and was most of it bid in at prices ridiculously low by persons who were on the inside. This I know not only as a matter of common information but directly from a Turkish attorney who was in our employ and who provided himself with one of the best Armenian houses. Turks moved out of their more squalid habitations into the better Armenian houses whose owners had been 'deported.' All the property of the Armenians except some remnants left to the Armenians who had embraced Mohammedanism was thus plundered.

The impact of these laws were immediate. According to a report in June 1916 by the German ambassador stationed in Constantinople, the goods of the Armenians "have long since been confiscated, and their capital has been liquidated by a so-called commission, which means that if an Armenian owned a house valued at, say, £T100, a Turk – a friend or member [of the Ittihad and Terakki] – could have it for around £T2."{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=115}}

The only notable domestic opposition was by Ottoman parliamentary representative [[Ahmed Riza]], who stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as "abandoned goods" for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods&amp;nbsp;... Nobody can sell my property if I am unwilling to sell it.

Formal directives were made to have much of the properties and businesses confiscated from the Armenians to be transferred into the hands of Muslims. On 6 January 1916, [[Talaat Pasha]], the Interior Minister of the Ottoman Empire, decreed:

Although the exact extent of confiscated property during the Armenian Genocide is unknown, according to [[Talaat Pasha]]'s private documents, the chief initiator of the [[Tehcir Law]],{{sfn|Akçam|2007|pp=186–7}} a total of 20,545 buildings were confiscated including 267,536 acres of land along with other parcels of agricultural and tillable lands such as 76,942 acres of vineyards, 703,941 acres of olive groves, and 4,573 acres of mulberry gardens.&lt;ref name=ungor1234&gt;{{cite journal|last=Üngör|first=Uğur Ümit|title=The Armenian Genocide: A Multi-Dimensional Process of Destruction|journal=Global Dialogue|date=Winter 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=97–106|publisher=Centre for World Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=82}}

During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Armenian delegation presented an assessment of $3.7 billion (about ${{Inflation|US|3.7|1919|r=0|fmt=c}} billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church.&lt;ref name=avedian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avedian|first=Vahagn|title=State Identity, Continuity, and Responsibility: The Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey and the Armenian Genocide|journal=European Journal of International Law|date=August 2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=797–820|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|issn=0938-5428|doi=10.1093/ejil/chs056}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the restitution of property and assets seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal property and assets of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 [[francs]] respectively; totaling to an estimated ${{Inflation|US|298|2008|r=0|fmt=c}} billion today.{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=275}}{{sfn|Turabian|1962|pp=265-7}} Furthermore, the Armenian community asked for the restitution of church owned property and reimbursement of its generated income.{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=118}} The Ottoman government never responded to this declaration and so restitution did not occur.{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=118}}

The issue of confiscated Armenian property came about in a number of treaties signed between the [[First Republic of Armenia]] and the Ottoman Empire.  Both the [[Treaty of Batum]] (signed 4 June 1918) and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (signed 10 August 1920) contained provisions related to the restitution for confiscated properties of Armenians.&lt;ref name=acemoglu /&gt; The Treaty of Sèvres under Article 144 specified that the Abandoned Property commissions and Liquidation commissions must be abolished and the laws of confiscation be annulled.&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt;{{sfn|Hovannisian|2008|p=35}} Meanwhile, however, those who seized the assets and properties of Armenians turned to support the Turkish national movement since the dissolution of the Ottoman government would mean that the properties and assets would be protected under their name.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets" /&gt; Thus, on 8 May 1920, the first law promulgated by the newly established parliament was to pardon those charged of massacre and expropriation of property by the [[Turkish courts-martial of 1919-20]]. Furthermore, with the establishment of the Turkish republic and the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (24 July 1923), the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres eventually never took effect and the liquidation committees involved with the confiscation of Armenian property resumed operations.&lt;ref name=acemoglu /&gt;&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt;

In addition to confiscated property, large sums of money and precious metals belonging to Armenians were also seized and deposited into the treasuries of the Ottoman government or in various German or Austrian banks during the war. Such sums were believed to be withdrawn from the bank accounts of deported and killed Armenians.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=66}} An official memorandum prepared by former British Prime Ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[H. H. Asquith]] was sent to then Prime Minister of Great Britain [[Ramsay MacDonald]] describing such seizures and deposits:
{{quotation|The sum of 5,000,000 Turkish gold pounds (representing about 30.000 kilograms of gold) deposited by the Turkish government at the Reichsbank in Berlin in 1916, and taken over by the Allies after the Armistice, was in large part (perhaps wholly) Armenian money. After the forced deportation of the Armenians in 1915, their current and deposit accounts were transferred, by government order, to the State Treasury in Constantinople.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=77}}}}

Much of the money deposits into banks and other financial institutions have also been subsequently seized in the immediate aftermath of the deportations. Once a deposit was made, a certificate was given to the depositor as a proof of deposit. However, once the deportations began, withdrawals were prohibited. Much of the deportees who had held deposits were left with only certificates in their possession. Many of the depositors still carry the certificates of deposit today. Historian Kevork Baghdjian states that the worth of these deposits "should rise to astronomical sums today," with the "deposited capital and interests combined."{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=277}}

Following the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the creation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the confiscation resumed with most Armenians having been deported or killed.&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt; During the early Republican era, the legal terminology was changed from "transported persons" to "persons who lost or fled from the country."&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets" /&gt;

On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the  [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish government enacted the "Law of Abandoned Properties" which confiscated properties of any Armenian who was not present on their property, regardless of the circumstances of the reason. While local courts were authorized to appraise the value of any property and provide an avenue for property owners to make claims, the law prohibited the use of any [[power of attorney]] by absent property holders, preventing them from filing suit without returning to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confiscation des biens des réfugiés arméniens par le gouvernement turc|year=1929|publisher=Le Fur|pages=87–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZElAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=|author1=Gilbert Gidel |author2=Albert Geouffre de Lapradelle |author3=Louis Le Fur |author4=André Nicolayévitch Mandelstam |author5=Cómité des réfugiés arménins |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the defendant in the case would be the state of Turkey which had created specially tasked committees to deal with each case.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt;{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=191}}

In addition to this law, the Turkish government continued revoking the citizenship of many people with a law on 23 May 1927 which stated that "Ottoman subjects who during the War of Independence took no part in the National movement, kept out of Turkey and did not return from 24 July 1923 to the date of the publication of this law, have forfeited Turkish nationality."&lt;ref name=matossian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Der Matossian|first=Bedross|title=The Taboo within the Taboo: The Fate of 'Armenian Capital' at the End of the Ottoman Empire|journal=European Journal of Turkish Studies|date=6 October 2011|url=http://ejts.revues.org/4411|ISSN=1773-0546}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Law No. 1042 of the Republic of Turkey, 23 May 1927|group="n"}} Additionally, a further law passed on 28 May 1928 stipulated that those who had lost their citizenship would be expelled from Turkey, not allowed to return, and that their property would be confiscated by the Turkish government, and Turkish migrants would be resettled in the properties.&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt;

In the preparation for possible entry into [[World War II]], the Turkish government introduced a tax, the [[Varlık Vergisi]], which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents. Many Armenians, and other non-Muslim populations, were forced to sell their property at significantly reduced prices through public auctions in order to pay for the sudden tax hike or have the properties confiscated by the state.{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}} In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person in order to pay the tax.{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}} From this tax, the Turkish government collected 314,900,000 [[Turkish lira|lira]]s or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.&lt;ref name=bulent&gt;{{cite news|last=Günal|first=Bülent|title=Atatürk olsa Varlık Vergisi olmazdı|url=http://www.haberturk.com/polemik/haber/787272-ataturk-olsa-varlik-vergisi-olmazdi|newspaper=Haber Turk|date=21 October 2012|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period coincided with further confiscations of private property belonging to Armenians. Special commissions were created to separate the evictions of non-Muslims from others. The investigators of this commission usually expedited the evacuation and eventual confiscation of the non-Muslim property in question.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|pp=56-7}}

The Varlık Vergisi was followed by the [[Istanbul pogrom]] a few years later, where an organized [[Angry mob|mob]] attacked Greeks and Armenians on 6–7 September 1955. The material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties (including 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 2 monasteries, 1 synagogue, and 26 schools).&lt;ref name=guven1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Güven|first=Dilek|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=163380|title=6–7 Eylül Olayları (1)|work=[[Radikal]]|date=9 September 2005|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the economic cost of the damage range from the Turkish government's estimate of 69.5 million [[Turkish lira]] (equivalent to 24.8 million [[USD|US$]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120208101850/http://www.ceterisparibus.net/veritabani/1923_1990/doviz.htm Turkish currency exchange rates 1923–1990]&lt;/ref&gt; the British estimate of 100 million [[GBP]] (about 200 million US$), the [[World Council of Churches]]' estimate of 150 million US$, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.{{sfn|Vryonis|2005|page=32}}&lt;ref name=aysehur&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/yazilar/ayse-hur/6-7-eylulde-devletin-muhtesem-orgutlenmesi/1821/ |accessdate=2008-09-21 |title=6-7 Eylül'de devletin 'muhteşem örgütlenmesi' |work=[[Taraf]] |date=2008-09-07 |first=Ayşe |last=Hür |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911162900/http://www.taraf.com.tr/yazilar/ayse-hur/6-7-eylulde-devletin-muhtesem-orgutlenmesi/1821/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pogrom eventually lead to an exodus of non-Muslims out of the country, resulting in a significant amount of "abandoned" properties.

[[File:1936surptateospchurchdeclaration.jpg|thumb|220px|In 1936, the Turkish government requested from minority foundations to provide a list of their owned assets and properties.

In the 1960s, new laws were passed, which made it impossible for Armenians to establish new foundations nor to buy or bequeath additional properties. One such law code (Law no. 903) adopted in 1967, along with a second paragraph amended to the Turkish Civil Code (no. 743) declared that, "The registration of foundations that are in violation of law, morality, tradition or national interests, or that were established to support a political belief, a certain race or members of a minority will not be approved."{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=69}} Such laws are considered by legal experts as a violation of articles concerning minority rights found in the Treaty of Laussane, the Turkish constitution, and [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 11]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which grants the "freedom to establish foundations and hold meetings."{{sfn|Hatemi|Kurban|2009|p=28}} The new amendment and law code became the basis for a new series of confiscations that significantly obstructed the daily lives of Armenians in Turkey.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=69}}

The monastery was described in a letter dated 24 June 1913 as a "house with garden and land located at 60 Ortaköy Pişmişoğlu Street (known as Çevirmeci Street today), leased from (icareli) the Sultan Beyazıt Veli Hazretleri Foundation, 9000 zira (approximately 5167 square meters), and previously leased (icareli) from the Ibrahim Pasha Foundation, 1000 zira (approximately 574 squaremeters)."{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=125}}

The monastery was formally registered on 14 October 1913.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=127}}

With the last priest dying in 1924, the property was left vacant. Nevertheless, the title remained in the hands of the Armenian community during the 1936 declaration.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=127}}

On 23 February 1950, the land along with the monastery was rendered "ownerless" and was subsequently confiscated by the Treasury.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

A lawsuit was filed on 20 December 1966 against Istanbul Chamber of the Directorate of Law and the Treasury for unlawfully seizing the land and the building. The 15th Civil Court of Istanbul rejected the claims in 1974.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

Through renewed legal efforts by the Directorate General of Foundations in 2006, the property is now in the hands of the Directorate General of Foundations.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

Under current regulations, the monastery and its lands is considered a park. As a result, many offers of renting out the property by various businesses and companies were rejected.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=131}}

[[File:Moravská Zemská Sněmovna II.jpg|thumb|right|Seat of the Court in Brno.]]
The '''Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic''' ({{lang-cz|Ústavní soud České republiky}}) is a specialized type of [[court]] which primarily works to protect the people in the Czech Republic against violations of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]] by either the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|legislature]], [[Government of the Czech Republic|government]] or by any other subject that violates people's constitutional rights and freedoms. In this respect, it is similar in functionality to the [[US Supreme Court]], but is distinct from the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic]]. Of all the various levels of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|Czech Judiciary]] it is the one created with the greatest specificity in the constitution.

The decisions of the Court are final, cannot be overturned and are considered a source of law, similar to [[precedent]]s in a common law system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2023&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Court itself was established only in 1993, its Czechoslovak predecessor was already provided for in the Constitution of 1920, making Czechoslovakia the first country in the world with a system of [[judicial review]] by a specialized court (although the court itself first convened after the Austrian one). It was later adopted by many other countries.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{Cite book

== History and predecessors ==

=== 1848–1918 ===
The development of the Czech constitutional tradition went initially hand in hand with that in [[Austria-Hungary]], to which the [[Czech Crown lands]] belonged between 1806-1918. The first attempts to establish a system based on constitution were connected with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 Revolution]]. A number of constitutions were enacted during the Austrian period (April 1848, March 1849, February 1861 all enacted by the king, December 1867 enacted by the Parliament), however these were far from being democratic and did not include the possibility of judicial review of the acts of the Parliament nor the Habsburg sovereigns. Although the attempt to democratize the Habsburg monarchy failed at the time, it marked the beginning of Czech political activization which ultimately brought about personalities such as [[Karel Kramář]] or [[Tomáš Masaryk]], who later took part in the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] and its constitutional tradition.&lt;ref name="Zimek"&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn =978-80-210-1354-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1918–1948 ===
Following the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|establishment of Czechoslovakia]], the Interim Constitution was passed in November 1918 (Act No. 37/1918 Coll.), which did not yet establish the Constitutional court.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

Meanwhile the works on the Czechoslovak constitution were at full pace. The new constitution was influenced by the following models:
* 1867 Austrian constitution in the sphere of civil rights,
* 1787 [[constitution of the USA]] in the sphere of judiciary and checks and balances,
* 1875 French constitution in the sphere of the powers of the president and the parliament,
* the Swiss constitution in the sphere of the powers of the government.
The new constitution was further influenced by the Czech humanist tradition ([[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chelčický]], [[Jan Amos Komenský]], [[František Palacký]], [[František Rieger]], Tomáš Masaryk) as well as the peace conferences which took place after the first world war.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;
[[File:JUDr. Karel Baxa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Karel Baxa]], Chief Justice 1921-1931]]
The new constitution was accepted on February 2, 1920 as Act No. 121/1920 Coll.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt; With this constitution Czechoslovakia became the first country in the world to adopt a system where a review of acts of the national parliament's constitutionality was possible by a special court - the Constitutional Court (while in USA and Australia this power was vested in the hands of their Supreme Courts already before and the Austrian Constitutional Court already had the power to examine laws of the [[federal states|States of Austria]] in 1919&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/vfgh/geschichte.htmlConstitutional Court of Austria - History]&lt;/ref&gt;). Later, a similar system of judicial review on national level was adopted by [[Austria]] (1920) which came into force before the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court took up its duties. It later became generally known as the ''[[Austrian Constitutional Court#Judicial and administrative review|Austrian System]]'', being taken over by many other countries e.g. [[Liechtenstein]] (1925), [[Greece]] (1927), [[Spain]] (1931), [[Ireland]] (1937) etc. The Constitutional Court of Czechoslovakia itself came into existence in the assembly hall of the presidium of the Council of Ministers at Prague Castle on 17 November 1921.&lt;ref name="Lang" /&gt;

The Constitutional Court had the jurisdiction to decide about constitutionality of the enactments of the Republic, of Assembly of the [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (this was only theoretical, as the presumption of its autonomy was not reached until 1938) and of legal measures of Permanent Committee (which consisted of 16 members of the Chamber of the Deputies and 8 Senators and took action in urgent cases when the Parliament was not in session). The motions for review of enactments could be brought by the Supreme Court, Supreme Administrative Court, Chamber of Deputies, Senate and the Assembly of the Carpathian Ruthenia, while the legal measures of the Permanent Committee were subject to automatic review immediately after being passed. Unlike today, the Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear citizens' individual petitions.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

The Court was active in the period of 1921-1931, when it reviewed a number of legal measures of the Permanent Committee, however no motions for review of enactments were ever brought before it. Although the legal basis for the Court and its jurisdiction remained unchanged, it was vacant and inactive between 1932-1937.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt; The Chief Justice for the period of 1938-1939 was [[Jaroslav Krejčí]].

Although the Constitution remained in force during the German Nazi occupation and after the war, the rights it was providing for became only theoretical and the Constitutional Court had not convened during and after the second world war.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

=== 1948–1989 ===
Due to extermination of a large number of Czechoslovakian elites by the Nazi Germans, disillusion with the Western countries following the [[Munich Agreement]] and high influence of the [[Soviet Union]], which liberated almost whole of the country, the post-war era may be characterized by the growing influence of the communists, which culminated in [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|February 1948 Communist coup]]. A new constitution was adopted in May 1948. It was essentially a 1920 constitution modified by socialist ideas in order to serve the ideology of the communist party. For example, the list of fundamental rights was extended to cover also social and cultural rights, but on the other hand the right of a [[Ownership right|private ownership]] was limited. Formally, the constitution was democratic and influenced by the idea of "[[People's Republic|People's Democracy]]". In reality, however, democracy was curbed with the communist party controlling the state and the fundamental rights not being observed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

The 1948 constitution did not adopt the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

Another constitution was adopted in 1960, being influenced mostly by the Soviet constitution of 1936. It legally established the "leading role" of the communist party, declared [[Marxism-Leninism]] as the state's leading ideology, removed the division of power. This constitution was to a large degree modified in 1968, establishing Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics within the Czechoslovakia as a federative socialist state. The 1968 constitution re-introduced the Constitutional Court, or in fact three of them - one for the Federation and two for the Republics. The Federal Constitutional Court was to have a jurisdiction over constitutionality of federal enactments and disputes over competencies between the Federation and the Republics. The Constitution anticipated adoption of an enactment dealing in detail with Constitutional Court, but that did not happen until 1991, precluding the factual establishment of the Court. Officially the need for the Court had not arisen as the presumed disputes over competencies between the Federation and the Republics never took place.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

=== 1989–1992 ===
The first changes to the Constitution took place already during the [[Velvet Revolution]]. On November 30, 1989, the leading role of the communist party was abolished as well as mentioning of the Marxism-Leninism. A number of other novelizations led to democratization of the constitution. In 1991 the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted as a part of the Constitutional order, which was followed by an implementing enactment dealing with the Constitutional Court, as presumed by the 1968 constitution.&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt;

The Constitutional Court of Czechoslovakia was thus re-established, although only for a brief period of time in 1992 before the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="Zimek" /&gt; The dissolution itself was actually carried out by a constitutional act (No. 542/1992 Coll.).&lt;ref name="Filip"&gt;{{Cite book

=== Since 1992 ===
On 16 December 1992 a [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|new Constitution (Act No. 1/1993 Coll.)]] and the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms|Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms (Act No. 2/1993 Coll.)]] were adopted. Article 83-89 of the Constitution established the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, the processes of which are further elaborated in [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/zakon_o_US Act No. 182/1993 Coll.].

A '''constitutional and electoral age referendum''' was held in [[Denmark]] on 28 May 1953.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p524 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both proposals were approved by voters, leading to both a new [[Danish constitution|constitution]] taking effect on 5 June, and the [[electoral age]] being lowered from 25 to 23 years, also starting on 5 June.&lt;ref name="grundloven"&gt;[http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227110116/http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="retsinfo"&gt;[http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19530016930-REGL http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19530016930-REGL] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duf"&gt;http://www.duf.dk/servlet/SaveImage?URL=http://web/data.nsf/webDocuments/0238362B6A7EBF55C1256D4E003A34C4/$file/16aar-valgret-hvadskaldertil.doc {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voter turnout was 59.1% for the constitution question and 57.1% for the voting age question.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, 532-533&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitution==
According to the previous constitution of 1915, with changes from 1920, in order for a new constitution to pass, it must first be passed in one [[Rigsdag]], which must then be disbanded, a new parliamentary [[election]] called, and the new parliament must then also pass the constitution, in unchanged form; and finally, a majority of voters in a referendum, with a requirement of at least 45% turnout, must also pass the proposed constitution.&lt;ref name="old constitution"&gt;[http://thomasthorsen.dk/dk-co-1920.html http://thomasthorsen.dk/dk-co-1920.html] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the referendum took place on May 28, 1953, it concluded the last of these three steps, and the constitution could take effect on June 5.

===Changes from the previous constitution===
The [[Ministry of Education of Denmark]] lists the changes from the previous constitution as follows:&lt;ref name="uvm"&gt;[http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_16_grundlov_53.html http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_16_grundlov_53.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132841/http://sekr.uvm.dk/historie/tekster_tidssoejle/tid_hist/dan_16_grundlov_53.html |date=2011-07-19 }} {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] was changed so that females could also inherit the [[Danish throne]], though still preferring even younger brothers. As the reigning King [[Frederick IX of Denmark|Frederick IX]] had three daughters and no sons, this meant that [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Princess Margrethe]] became the [[Heir Presumptive]] instead of her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]]. As Frederick IX's wife [[Ingrid of Sweden|Queen Ingrid]] was not expected to (and in fact did not) have any more children, this effectively ensured that Princess Margrethe would become [[Queen of Denmark]], which she did.
* [[Parliamentarism]], in the sense that no government may have a majority of members of parliament against it, is made explicit in the constitution. (This principle had de facto existed since 1901, but the 1953 constitution made it law).
* The [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] was abolished, and the [[Folketing]] expanded to 179 members.
* Voting by [[convict]]s and the poor is no longer outlawed in the constitution, but subject to normal laws.
* The electoral age was removed, to be decided by referendums.
* [[Greenland]] was made a coequal part of Denmark, and would elect two members of parliament.
* Referendums can be held over most kinds of laws, provided that one third of parliament demand it (this has only happened [[Danish land laws referendum, 1963|once]]).
* Citizens' [[civil right]]s are increased.
* The office of Folketing's [[ombudsman]] is established.
* [[Sovereignty]] can be forfeited to what the constitution calls ''mellemfolkelige myndigheder'', which can include [[Supranational union]]s such as the current [[European Union]]. For this to take place, it must either happen with 5/6 of members of parliament voting in favour, or by holding a referendum.

==Voting age==
One of the proposed changes in the new constitution was that the electoral age would now be decided by laws that required a binding referendum. Prior to the 1953 referendum, the electoral age was 25 years. The electoral age portion of the referendum asked whether the new electoral age should be 23 or 21 years, with 30.0% voting for 23 years and 25.0% for 21 years, thus passing the former of the two.&lt;ref name="duf"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12462">{{About|American law in criminal defense|other uses of "Duress"|Duress (disambiguation)}}
{{Criminal defenses}}
In [[jurisprudence]], '''duress''' or '''coercion''' refers to a situation whereby a person performs an act as a result of violence, threat, or other pressure against the person. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (6th ed.) defines duress as "any unlawful [[intimidation|threat]] or [[coercion]] used... to induce another to act [or not act] in a manner [they] otherwise would not [or would]". Duress is pressure exerted upon a person to coerce that person to perform an act they ordinarily would not perform. The notion of duress must be distinguished both from [[undue influence]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]]. In [[criminal law]], [[duress and necessity]] are different defenses.&lt;ref&gt;''[[People v. Unger]]'', 362 N.E.2d 319 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Handbook on Criminal Law 381 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Duress has two aspects. One is that it negates the person's [[consent]] to an act, such as [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or the entering into a contract; or, secondly, as a possible [[defense (legal)|legal defense]] or justification to an otherwise unlawful act.&lt;ref name=Gaines&gt;{{cite book |last=Gaines |first=Larry |authorlink= |author2=Miller, LeRoy |title=Criminal Justice In Action: The Core |year=2006 |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location= |isbn=0-495-00305-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A defendant utilizing the duress defense admits to breaking the law, but claims that he/she is not [[Legal liability|liable]] because, even though the act broke the [[law]], it was only performed because of extreme unlawful pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pi1stclass.com/glossary.htm|title=1st Class Investigations Glossary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In criminal law, a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty, admitting partial [[culpability]], so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted.

Duress or [[coercion]] can also be raised in an allegation of [[rape]] or other [[sexual assault]] to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation.

==Discussion==
A defendant who raises a defense of duress has actually done everything to constitute the ''[[actus reus]]'' of the crime, and has the ''[[mens rea]]'' because they intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of [[culpability]] already attaches to the defendant for what was done. 

In criminal law, the defendant's motive for breaking the law is generally irrelevant unless a defendant is raising an [[affirmative defense]] allowed for by law. (Duress may or may not be allowed as an affirmative defence for some particular charge -- in particular, it is generally forbidden for [[murder]], and many jurisdictions also forbid it for [[sexual assault]]. ''[[Malum in se]]'' offences, generally, are less likely to recognise duress as a defence than ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' offences.)

A successful affirmative defence means not that a criminal act was justified, but that the act was not criminal at all. But if no affirmative defence of duress is available, then the duress may be considered as justifying a lighter [[sentence (law)|sentence]], typically in proportion to the degree of duress. If the duress is extreme enough, for example, the defendant might be found guilty of murder but given a minimal, or even trivial, sentence.

In some rare cases, a successful argument of duress -- even when not an affirmative defence -- might result in the jury [[Jury nullification|nullifying]] the charge by refusing to convict.

The basis of the defense is that the duress actually overwhelmed the defendant's will and would also have overwhelmed the will of a person of ordinary courage (a hybrid test requiring both subjective evidence of the accused's state of mind, and an objective confirmation that the failure to resist the threats was reasonable), thus rendering the entire behavior involuntary. Thus, the liability should be reduced or discharged, making the defense one of [[exculpation]].

The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a matter of [[public policy]]. A state may say that no threat should force a person to deliberately break the law, particularly if this breach will cause significant loss or damage to a third person.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law.

A mutant of duress involves [[hostage]] taking, where a person is forced to commit a criminal act under the threat, say, that their family member or close associate will be immediately killed should they refuse (commonly known as a [[Tiger kidnapping]]).  This has been raised in some cases of [[ransom]], where a person commits theft or embezzlement under orders from a kidnapper in order to secure a family member's life and freedom.  However, duress is not a complete defense to all crimes.  For example, the general rule, both at common law and today, is that duress is never a defense to murder; that is, one is never justified in killing another innocent person even if one's own life has been threatened, although this part may be questioned when multiple people are threatened with death if the defendant does not kill a single or fewer people than threatened (such a situation is similar to the [[trolley problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Anderson'', 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
For duress to qualify as a defense, four requirements must be met:&lt;ref name=Gaines /&gt;
# The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death
# The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime
# The threat must be immediate and inescapable
# The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

A person may also raise a duress defense when force or violence is used to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge.

== In contract law ==
{{Contract law}}
''Duress'' in the context of contract law is a [[common law]] defence brought about when one of the parties to the contract enjoyed an ascendant position in relation to the other party and abused that position by subjecting the other to ''threats.'' A party who has entered into a contract under duress is entitled to rescind or set aside the contract, rendering it voidable (in equity).

Duress is a threat of harm made to compel someone to do something against their will or judgment; especially a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition. - Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)

Duress in contract law falls into two broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4lawnotes.com/outlines/duress.htm|title=Duress : Introduction to Contracts Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical duress
* Economic duress&lt;ref&gt; See ''Pao On v Lau Yiu Long'' [1979] 3 All ER 65; [[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long]]; Applied in ''Con Ange v Calogo Bloodstock AG t/as Coolmore Australia'' [2012] NSWSC 666. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical duress===
====Duress to the person====
Professor Ronald Griffin, Florida Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Law, Orlando, FL, puts physical duress simply:  "Your money or your life."  
In ''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Barton v Armstrong]]'' [1976] AC 104 [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1973/2.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a decision of the [[Privy Council]], Armstrong (defendant) sought to coerce Barton (plaintiff) into executing a deed relating to the sale of certain companies by threatening to have him murdered. While the plaintiff took the threats seriously, other business reasons existed for signing the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person need only prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract. Furthermore, once it is established that the threat was made, the onus lies on the person who made the threat to prove that the threat made no contribution to the plaintiff's decision to enter the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Crescendo Management Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corp'' (1988) 19 NSWLR 40, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law took a narrow view of the concept of duress in that it was concerned with actual or threatened violence to the person or unlawful imprisonment. Equity, however, adopted a broader "fusion" view of what sort of pressure could constitute coercion for purposes of relief and has since prevailed. &lt;ref&gt;See J Paterson, A Robertson and A Duke, ''Principles of Contract Law'', (4th edn Thomson Reuters 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Duress to goods====
In such cases, one party refuses to release the goods belonging to the other party until the other party enters into a contract with them. For example, in ''Hawker Pacific Pty Ltd v Helicopter Charter Pty Ltd'' (1991) 22 NSWLR 298, the contract was set aside after Hawker Pacific's threats to withhold the helicopter from the plaintiff unless further payments were made for repairing a botched paint job.

===The elements of economic duress===

Economic duress is the use of unlawful economic pressure to compel a party to a contract to agree to demands which they would not have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Wrongful or improper threat''': No precise definition of what is wrongful or improper.  Examples include: morally wrong, criminal, or tortious conduct; one that is a threat to breach a contract "in bad faith" or threaten to withhold an admitted debt "in bad faith".
#'''No reasonable alternative (but to accept the other party's terms)'''. If there is an available legal remedy, an available market substitute (in the form of funds, goods, or services), or any other sources of funds this element is not met.
#'''The threat actually induces the making of the contract'''. This is a subjective standard, and takes into account the victim's age, their background (especially their education), relationship of the parties, and the ability to receive advice.
#'''The other party caused the financial distress'''. The majority opinion is that the other party must have caused the distress, while the minority opinion allows them to merely take advantage of the distress.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} See ''Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel)'' [1981] UKHL 9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1981] UKHL 9|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1981/9.html|website=Bailii|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insane duress==
In criminal law, when a person is found legally insane because they believed God ordered them to do the crime ("[[deific-decree]]"), one interpretation of the insanity is that they acted under a delusion of duress by God.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|615-625}}

An '''earth structure''' is a building or other structure made largely from [[soil]]. Since soil is a widely available material, it has been used in construction since prehistoric times.
It may be combined with other materials, compressed and/or baked to add strength. 
Soil is still an economical material for many applications, and may have low environmental impact both during and after construction.

Earth structure materials may be as simple as [[mud]], or mud mixed with straw to make [[Cob (material)|cob]]. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from [[sod]] or turf. Soil may be stabilized by the addition of lime or cement, and may be compacted into [[rammed earth]]. Construction is faster with pre-formed [[adobe]] or [[mudbrick]]s, [[compressed earth block]]s, [[Earthbag construction|earthbag]]s or [[brick|fired clay brick]]s.{{efn|Fired bricks and concrete are derived from earth, but structures built from these materials are usually not considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

Types of earth structure include [[earth sheltering|earth shelters]], where a dwelling is wholly or partly embedded in the ground or encased in soil. Native American [[earth lodge]]s are examples. [[Wattle and daub]] houses use a "wattle" of  poles interwoven with sticks to provide stability for mud walls. [[Sod house]]s were built on the northwest coast of Europe, and later by European settlers on the North American prairies. Adobe or mud-brick buildings are built around the world and include houses, apartment buildings, mosques and churches. [[Fujian Tulou]]s are large fortified rammed earth buildings in southeastern China that shelter as many as 80 families. Other types of earth structure include mounds and pyramids used for religious purposes, [[levee]]s, [[mechanically stabilized earth]] retaining walls, forts, trenches and [[embankment dam]]s.

==Soil==
[[File:SoilTexture USDA.png|thumb|[[Soil type]]s by clay, silt and sand composition as used by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]]]
Soil is created from rock that has been chemically or physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated.{{sfn|USDA|1974|p=112-113}}
Soil particles include [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]].  Sand particles are the largest at {{convert|2|to|0.05|mm}} in diameter and clay the smallest at less than {{convert|0.002|mm}} in diameter.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
Both sand and silt are mostly inert rock particles, including  [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[feldspar]] and [[mica]].{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}

Clays typically are [[phyllosilicate]] minerals with a sheet-like structure.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}
The very small clay particles interact with each other physically and chemically. 
Even a small proportion of clay affects the physical properties of the soil much more than might be expected.{{sfn|Shah|Shroff|2003|p=22}}
Clays such as [[kaolinite]] do not expand or contract when wetted or dried, and are useful for brick-making. 
Others, such as [[smectite]]s, expand or contract considerably when wet or dry, and are not suitable for building.{{sfn|Soil Composition and Formation, SCDNR}}

[[Loam]] is a mix of sand, silt and clay in which none predominates. 
Soils are given different names depending on the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay such as "Silt Loam", "Clay Loam" and "Silty Clay".{{sfn|Ball|Norton|2002|p=219}}
Loam construction, the subject of this article, referred to as adobe construction when it uses unfired clay bricks, is an ancient building technology. It was used in the early civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], in the [[Indus]], [[Ganges]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] river valleys, in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. 
As of 2005 about 1.5 billion people lived in houses built of loam.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=1}}{{efn|One source estimates that as many as three billion people live in earth buildings.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}} }}

In recent years, interest in loam construction has revived in the developed world. It is seen as a way to minimize use of fossil fuels and pollution, particularly carbon dioxide, during manufacture, and to create a comfortable living environment through the high mass and high absorption of the material.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}
The two main technologies are stamped or rammed earth, clay or loam, called ''pise de terre'' in French, and [[adobe]], typically using sun-dried bricks made of a mud and straw mixture.{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}}{{efn|The word "adobe" is derived from the ancient Egyptian "tob", meaning "brick". The Arabs adopted the word as "at-tub" or "attuba", and the Spanish made this "adobe".{{sfn|Koch|Koch|Seidl|2005|p=2}} }}

[[File:Mud houses are commonly found in various regions of Afghanistan..jpg|thumb|Mud houses in [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan]]
Earth usually requires some sort of processing for use in construction. It may be combined with water to make [[mud]], straw may be added, some form of stabilizing material such as lime or cement may be used to harden the earth, and the earth may be compacted to increase strength.{{Sfn|Watson|1993|p=290}}

===Mud===

Coursed mud construction is one of the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}
In Iran, puddled mud walls are called ''chine'' construction. Each course is about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} thick, and about {{convert|18|to|24|in}} high. Typically the technique is used for garden walls but not for house construction, presumably because of concern about the strength of walls made in this way.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=110}}
A drawback to the approach is that a lot of time can be spent waiting for each course to dry.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
Another technique, used in areas where wood is plentiful, is to build a wood frame house and to infill it with mud, primarily to provide insulation. In parts of England a similar technique was used with cob.{{sfn|Cornerstones Community Partnerships|2006|p=72}}

===Cob===
[[File:Cob wall in Harwell - geograph.org.uk - 1483279.jpg|thumb|Cob wall in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], England, hundreds of years old, thatched to protect it from water]]
[[Cob (material)|Cob]], sometimes referred to as "monolithic adobe",{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} is a [[natural building]] material made from soil that includes clay, sand or small stones and an organic material such as [[straw]]. Cob walls are usually built up in courses, have no mortar joints and need 30% or more clay in the soil. Cob can be used as in-fill in post-and-beam buildings, but is often used for load bearing walls, and can bear up to two stories.  A cob wall should be at least {{convert|16|in}} thick, and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime, soil and sand. Cob is fireproof, and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures.{{sfn|ICAEN|2004|p=114}} 
Tests have shown that cob has some resistance to seismic activity. However, building codes in the developed world may not recognize cob as an approved material.{{sfn|Goodnow|2007}}

===Sod or turf===
[[File:Sod House Detail (4245555122).jpg|thumb|Sod bricks in a house wall]]
Cut [[sod]] bricks, called ''terrone'' in Spanish, can be used to make tough and durable walls. The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots, which may be found in river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}}
European settlers on the North American Prairies found that the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs.{{sfn|Rollings-Magnusson|2012|p=28}} Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=232}}
The Icelanders find that the best quality turf is the ''Strengur'', the top {{convert|5|cm}} of the grass turf.{{sfn|Berge|2009|p=233}}

===Stabilized earth===

Clay is usually hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, but if the wall is directly exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated and collapse.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=4}}
Earth may be "stabilized" to make it more weather resistant. The practice of stabilizing earth by adding burnt lime is centuries old.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}}
[[Portland cement]] or [[bitumen]] may also be added to earth intended for construction which adds strength, although the stabilized earth is not as strong as fired clay or concrete.{{sfn|Teter|Liu|Kent|1964|p=1}} Mixtures of cement and lime, or [[pozzolana]] and lime, may also be used for stabilization.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

Preferably the sand content of the soil will be 65% – 75%. Soils with low clay content, or with no more than 15% non-expansive clay, are suitable for stabilized earth.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}} The clay percentage may be reduced by adding sand, if available.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=8}}
If there is more than 15% clay it may take more than 10% cement to stabilize the soil, which adds to the cost.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=6}}
If earth contains little clay and holds 10% or more cement, it is in effect concrete.
Cement is not particularly environmentally friendly, since the manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}
Low-density stabilized earth will be porous and weak. The earth must therefore be compacted either by a machine that makes blocks or within the wall using the "rammed earth" technique.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=5}}

===Rammed earth===
[[File:Alte Schule Bonbaden 1.jpg|thumb|Old school built of rammed earth in 1836–37 in [[Bonbaden]], Hesse, Germany ]]
Rammed earth is a technique for building walls using natural raw materials such as earth, [[chalk]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] or [[gravel]].
A rammed earth wall is built by placing damp soil in a temporary form. The soil is manually or mechanically compacted and then the form is removed.{{sfn|Fleming|Honour|Pevsner|1966}}
Rammed earth is generally made without much water, and so does not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water from above, and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

In China, rammed earth walls were built by the [[Longshan culture|Longshan people]] in 2600–1900 BC, during the period when cities first appeared in the region. Thick sloping walls made of rammed earth became a characteristic of traditional Buddhist monasteries throughout the Himalayas and became very common in northern Indian areas such as [[Sikkim]].{{sfn|Outlook|2008|p=38}} The technique spread to the Middle East, and to North Africa, and the city of [[Carthage]] was built of rammed earth. From there the technology was brought to Europe by the Romans.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}
Rammed earth structures may be long lasting. Most of the [[Great Wall of China]] was made from rammed earth, as was the [[Alhambra]] in the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. In Northern Europe there are rammed earth buildings up to seven stories high and two hundred years old.{{sfn|Keable|2012}}

===Concrete===

The Romans made durable concrete strong enough for load-bearing walls.{{sfn|Snell|2004|pp=27-28}} Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and ''pozzolana'', a volcanic material that contributed significantly to its strength.{{sfn|Lancaster|2005|p=3}} Roman concrete structures such as the [[Colosseum]], completed in 80 AD, still stand.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=28}}
Their longevity may be explained by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets.{{sfn|Snell|2004|p=29}} Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not usually be considered earth structures.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=9}}

==Building units==

===Mud brick or adobe brick===
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], Kyrgyzstan]]
[[File:Working mudbrick press 5.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Making mudbricks near [[Cooktown, Australia]]]]
{{Main|Mudbrick|Adobe}}
Mudbricks or Adobe bricks are preformed modular masonry units of sun-dried mud that were invented at different times in different parts of the world as civilization developed.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=3}} Construction with bricks avoids the delays while each course of puddled mud dries. Wall murals show that adobe production techniques were highly advanced in Egypt by 2500 BC.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=4}} 
Adobe construction is common throughout much of Africa today.{{Sfn|Elleh|1998|p=47}} 
Adobe bricks are traditionally made from sand and clay mixed with water to a plastic consistency, with straw or grass as a binder.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}{{efn|The straw and grass in adobe does not make the brick any stronger in the long term, but helps ensure that the bricks shrink uniformly as they dry.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}} }}
The mud is prepared, placed in wooden forms, tamped and leveled, and then turned out of the mold to dry for several days. 
The bricks are then stood on end to air-cure for a month or more.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=49}}

In the southwest United States and Mexico adobe buildings had massive walls and were rarely more than two stories high. 
Adobe mission churches were never more than about {{convert|35|ft}}.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}
Since adobe surfaces are fragile, coatings are used to protect them. 
These coatings, periodically renewed, have included mud plaster, lime plaster, whitewash{{efn|Whitewash, made of ground [[gypsum]] mixed with water and clay, has been used to protect earth walls since ancient times.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}} }} or stucco.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=51}}
Adobe walls were historically made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks at the same rate as the bricks when wetted or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.{{sfn|Look|Tiller|2004|p=50}}

===Compressed earth block===
[[File:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|[[Compressed earth block]] housing being built in [[Midland, Texas]] in 2006]]
[[Compressed earth block]]s (CEB) were traditionally made by using a stick to ram soil into a wooden mold. Today they are usually made from subsoil compressed in a hand-operated or powered machine. In the developing world, manual machines can be a cost-effective solution for making uniform building blocks, while the more complex and expensive motorized machines are less likely to be appropriate. 
Although labor-intensive, CEB construction avoids the cost of buying and transporting materials.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=138}}
Block-making machines may form blocks that have interlocking shapes to reduce the requirement for mortar.
The block may have holes or grooves so rods such as bamboo can be inserted to improve earthquake resistance.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=139}}

Suitable earth must be used, with enough clay to hold the block together and resist erosion, but not too much expansive clay.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=140}}
When the block has been made from stabilized earth, which contains cement, the concrete must be given perhaps three weeks to cure.
During this time the blocks should be stacked and kept from drying out by sprinkling water over them. 
This may be a problem in hot, dry climates where water is scarce.
Closely stacking the blocks and covering them with a polythene sheet may help reduce water loss.{{sfn|Jagadish|2007|p=24}}

===Earthbags===

[[Earthbag construction]] is a [[natural building]] technique that has evolved from historic military construction techniques for [[bunker]]s.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Local subsoil of almost any composition can be used, although an adobe mix would be preferable.
The soil is moistened so it will compact into a stable structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
The bags are laid in courses, with barbed wire between each course to prevent slipping. Each course is tamped after it is laid.{{sfn|Calkins|2008|p=162}}
The structure in pp bags is similar to adobe but more flexible. With mesh tubing the structure is like rammed earth.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=149}}
Earthbags may be used to make dome-shaped or vertical wall buildings. With soil stabilization they may also be used for retaining walls.{{sfn|Kennedy|Wanek|Smith|2002|p=152}}

===Fired clay brick===
[[File:English Bond - geograph.org.uk - 702506.jpg|thumb|English bond bricks from 1454 at the Old College in [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire, England]]
The technique of firing clay [[brick]]s in a kiln dates to about 3500 BC. 
Fired bricks were being used to build durable masonry across Europe, Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still remain an important building material.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=163}} Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales, shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8–12 hours at a temperature of 900–1150&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}{{efn|Yellow [[Dutch brick]]s were made from clay or mud dredged from the [[IJssel]] and other rivers, which was molded and burned in peat-fired kilns for three or four weeks. The bricks were then given about three weeks to cool before being removed.{{sfn|Manufacture of Brick – Yellow Dutch Brick 1840|p=290}} 
Modern processes use higher temperatures and much shorter firing times.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}} }}
The result is a [[ceramic]] that is mainly composed of silica and alumina, with other ingredients such as quartz sand. The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration. The bricks may vary in color depending on the amount of iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used, and the amount of oxygen in the kiln.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=164}}
Bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on the brick or in its pores, from frost action and from acidic gases.{{sfn|Ingham|2010|p=166}}

Bricks are laid in courses bonded with mortar, a combination of Portland cement, lime and sand.{{sfn|Kreh|1997|p=72}}
A wall that is two bricks thick will include stretcher bricks with their long, narrow side exposed and header bricks crossing from side to side. 
There are various [[brickwork]] "bonds", or patterns of stretchers and headers, including the English, Dutch and Flemish bonds.{{sfn|Lloyd|1929|p=81}}

==Examples==

===Earth sheltering===
[[File:Iceland Keldur Earth covered homes.JPG|thumb|[[Icelandic turf house|Turf houses]] in [[Keldur]], [[Iceland]], an example of [[Earth sheltering]]]]
[[Earth sheltering]] has been used for thousands of years to make energy-efficient dwellings.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}}
There are various configurations. At one extreme, an earth sheltered dwelling is completely underground, with perhaps an open courtyard to provide air and light. 
An [[earth house]] may be set into a slope, with windows or door openings in one or more of its sides, or the building may be on ground level, but with earth mounded against the walls, and perhaps with an earth roof.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

Pit houses made by [[Hohokam]] farmers between 100 and 900 AD, in what is now the southwest of the US, were bermed structures, partially embedded in south-facing slopes. Their successful design was used for hundreds of years.{{sfn|McHenry|1984|p=2}}
At [[Matmata, Tunisia]], most of the ancient homes were built {{convert|12|m}} below ground level, and surrounded courtyards about {{convert|12|m}} square.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}}{{efn|The opening scenes of ''[[Star Wars]]'' were shot in the Hotel Sidi Driss in [[Matmata, Tunisia]], an earth sheltered dwelling around a deeply sunken courtyard.{{sfn|Robb|2012|p=33}} }}
The homes were reached through tunnels. Other examples of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both hot and cold climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=4}} A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=3}} By setting an earth house into the ground, the house will be cooler in the warm season and warmer in the cool season.{{sfn|Boyer|Grondzik|1987|p=8}}

===Native American earth lodge===

An [[earth lodge]] is a circular building made by some of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of North America. 
They have wood post and beam construction and are dome-shaped.{{sfn|Earth Lodge, Random House}}
A typical structure would have four or more central posts planted in the ground and connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
The structure was covered by sticks and brush or grass, covered in turn by a heavy layer of earth or [[sod]].
Some groups plastered the whole structure with mud, which dried to form a shell.{{sfn|Nabokov|1989|p=126}}
[[File:School in a Maasai village on the A109 road, Kenya.jpg|thumb|School in a [[Maasai people|Maasai]] village on the A109 road, Kenya]]

===Wattle and daub===
[[Wattle and daub]] is an old building technique in which vines or smaller sticks are interwoven between upright poles, and then mud mixed with straw and grass is plastered over the wall.{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
The technique is found around the world, from the Nile Delta to Japan, where bamboo was used to make the wattle.{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}
In [[Cahokia]], now in Illinois, USA, wattle and daub houses were built with the floor lowered by {{convert|1|to|3|ft}} below the ground. 
A variant of the technique is called ''bajareque'' in [[Colombia]].{{sfn|Young|Fowler|2000|p=46}}
In prehistoric Britain simple circular wattle and daub shelters were built wherever adequate clay was available.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=5}}
Wattle and daub is still found as the panels in timber-framed buildings.{{sfn|Sunshine|2006|p=Back cover}} Generally the walls are not structural, and in interior use the technique in the developed world was replaced by lath and plaster, and then by [[gypsum wallboard]].{{sfn|Racusin|McArleton|2012|p=252}}

===Prairie sod house===
[[File:Omer Kem's sod house.jpg|thumb|[[Omer Madison Kem]], (later, Representative to the United States Congress) in front of his sod house in Nebraska (1886)]]
European pioneer farmers in the prairies of North America, where there is no wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a covering over the entrance. When they had time, they would build a [[sod house]]. The farmer would use a plow to cut the sod into bricks {{convert|1|by|2|ft}}, which were then piled up to form the walls.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The sod strips were piled grass-side down, staggered in the same way as brickwork, in three side-by-side rows, resulting in a wall over {{convert|3|ft}} thick. The sod wall was built around door and window frames, and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them. The roof was made with poles or brush, covered with prairie grass, and then sealed with a layer of sod.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}
Sod houses were strong and often lasted many years, but they were damp and dirty unless the interior walls were plastered.{{sfn|White|1991|p=228}}
The roofs tended to leak, and sometimes collapsed in a rainstorm.{{sfn|Porterfield|2004|p=39}}

===Mud brick buildings===

There are innumerable examples of mud brick or adobe building around the world. The walled city of [[Shibam]] in Yemen, designated a World Heritage Site in 1982, is known fr its ten-story unreinforced mud-brick buildings.{{sfn|Jerome|2006|p=144}}
The [[Djinguereber Mosque]] of [[Timbuktu]], Mali, was first built at the start of the 14th century AD (8th century AH) from round mud bricks and a stone-mud misture, and was rebuilt several times afterwards, steadily growing in size.{{sfn|Sliwoski|2007|p=70}}
Further south in Mali, the [[Great Mosque of Djenné|Great Mosque]] of [[Djenné]], a dramatic example of Sahel mudbrick architecture. was built in 1907, based on the design of an earlier Great Mosque first built on the site in 1280. Mudbrick requires maintenance, and the fundamentalist ruler [[Seku Amadu]] had let the previous mosque collapse.{{sfn|Ham|2009|p=498}}

The [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], now a national monument in Arizona protected by a modern roof, is a massive four-story adobe structure built by Hohokam people between 1200 and 1450 AD.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=13}}
The first European to record the great house was a Jesuit priest, Father [[Eusebio Kino]], who visited the site in 1694. 
At that time it had long been abandoned.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=6}}
By the time a temporary roof was installed in 1903 the adobe building had been standing empty and unmaintained for hundreds of years.{{sfn|Houk|1996|p=9}}

[[Huaca de la Luna]] in what is now northern Peru is a large adobe temple built by the [[Moche culture|Moche people]]. The building went through a series of construction phases, growing eventually to a height of about {{convert|32|m}}, with three main platforms, four plazas and many smaller rooms and enclosures. The walls were covered by striking multi-colored murals and friezes; those visible today date from about 400–610 AD.{{sfn|Jackson|2008|p=22}}

===Toulous===
[[File:Snail pit tulou.jpg|thumb|[[Tianluokeng Tulou cluster]] in [[Fujian]] province, China]]
A [[Fujian Tulou]] is a type of rural dwelling of the [[Hakka people]] in the mountainous areas in southeastern [[Fujian]], China.{{sfn|Needham|1971|pp=133–134}}
They were mostly built between the 13th and the 20th centuries.{{sfn|Fujian Tulou, UNESCO}} 
A tulou is a large, enclosed and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with very thick load-bearing [[rammed earth]] walls between three and five stories high.
A toulou might house up to 80 families. Smaller interior buildings are often enclosed by these huge peripheral walls which can contain halls, storehouses, wells and living areas.
The structure resembles a small fortified city.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}
The walls are formed by compacting earth mixed with stone, bamboo, wood and other readily available materials, and are to {{convert|6|ft}} thick. 
The result is a well-lit, well-ventilated, windproof and earthquake-proof building that is warm in winter and cool in summer.{{sfn|Earthen Houses (Tulou), Fujian Province}}

===Mounds and pyramids===
[[File:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|thumb|Ziggurat at [[Ali Air Base]] in Iraq]]
[[Ziggurat]]s were elevated temples constructed by the [[Sumer]]ians between the end of the 4th millennium BC and the 2nd millennium BC, rising in a series of terraces to a temple up to {{convert|200|ft}} above ground level. The [[Ziggurat of Ur]] contained about three million bricks, none more than {{convert|15|in}} in length, so construction would have been a huge project.{{sfn|Forrest|1969|p=6}}
The largest ziggurat was in Babylon, and is thought by some to be the [[Tower of Babel]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. It was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]] and only the foundations remain, but originally it stood {{convert|300|ft}} high on a base about {{convert|660|ft}} square.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=17}}
Sun-dried bricks were used for the interior and kiln-fired bricks for the facing. 
The bricks were held together by clay or bitumen.{{sfn|Faiella|2005|p=18}}

Many pre-Columbian Native American societies of ancient North America built large [[pyramid]]al earth structures known as [[platform mound]]s. Among the largest and best-known of these structures is [[Monks Mound]] at the site of [[Cahokia]] in what became Illinois, completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large. They are believed to have played a central role in the mound-building peoples' religious life and documented uses include semi-public [[Tribal chief|chief]]'s house platforms, public [[temple]] platforms, [[mortuary]] platforms, [[charnel house]] platforms, [[earth lodge]]/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.{{sfn|Lindauer|Blitz|1997|p=169ff}}{{sfn|Fogelson|2004|p=741}}

The {{convert|207|ft}} [[Pyramid of the Sun]] in [[Teotihuacan]], Mexico, was started in 100 AD. 
The stone-faced structure contains two million tons of rammed earth.{{sfn|Rael|2009|p=17}}

===Earthworks===
[[File:Retaining wall, Ramsden Wood Road - geograph.org.uk - 1268429.jpg|thumb|Retaining wall near [[Todmorden]], West Yorkshire, England]]
[[Earthworks (engineering)|Earthworks]] are engineering works created through moving or processing quantities of soil or unformed rock. 
The material may be moved to another location and formed into a desired shape for a purpose.{{sfn|Merritt|Loftin|Ricketts|1995|p=13.1}}
[[Levee]]s, embankments and dams are types of earthwork.
A levee, floodbank or stopbank is an elongated natural ridge or artificially constructed [[fill dirt|dirt fill]] wall that regulates water levels. It is usually earthen and often runs parallel to the course of a river in its [[floodplain]] or along low-lying coastlines.{{sfn|Petroski|2006|pp=7–11}}

[[Mechanically stabilized earth]] (MSE) retaining walls may be used for embankments.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}}
MSE walls combine a concrete leveling pad, wall facing panels, coping, soil reinforcement and select backfill.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
A variety of designs of wall facing panels may be used.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=3}}
After the leveling pad has been laid and the first row of panels has been placed and braced, the first layer of earth backfill is brought in behind the wall and compacted.
The first set of reinforcements is then laid over the earth.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=15}}
The reinforcements, which may be tensioned polymer or galvanized metal strips or grids, are attached to the facing panels.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=2}}
This process is repeated with successive layers of panels, earth and reinforcements.
The panels are thus tied into the earth embankment to make a stable structure with balanced stresses.{{sfn|Passe|2000|p=16-17}}

Although construction using the basic principles of MSE has a long history, MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s. The reinforcing elements used can vary but include [[steel]] and [[geosynthetic]]s. The term MSE is usually used in the US to distinguish it from "Reinforced Earth", a trade name of the Reinforced Earth Company, but elsewhere Reinforced Soil is the generally accepted term.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=131}} MSE construction is relatively fast and inexpensive, and although labor-intensive, it does not demand high levels of skill. It is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries.{{sfn|Alfaro|Balasubramaniam|Bergado|Chai|1994|p=132-133}}

===Forts and trenches===
[[File:Soldiers in trench.jpg|thumb|Soldiers in a trench on [[Gallipoli]] during World War I]]
Earth has been used to construct fortifications for thousands of years, including strongholds and walls, often protected by ditches.
Aerial photography in Europe has revealed traces of earth fortifications from the Roman era, and later medieval times.{{sfn|Bourgeois|Meganck|2005|p=323}}
[[Offa's Dyke]] is a huge earthwork that stretches along the disputed border between England and Wales.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=31}}
Little is known about the period or the builder, King [[Offa of Mercia]], who died in 796 AD.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=32}}
An early timber and earth fortification might later be succeeded by a brick or stone structure on the same site.{{sfn|Pluskowski|2013|p=118}}

Trenches were used by besieging forces to approach a fortification while protected from missiles.
Sappers would build "saps", or trenches, that zig-zagged towards the fortress being attacked.
They piled the excavated dirt to make a protective wall or gabion. The combined trench depth and gabion height might be {{convert|8|to|10|ft}}. 
Sometimes the sap was a tunnel, dug several feet below the surface. Sappers were highly skilled and highly paid due to the extreme danger of their work.{{sfn|Nolan|2008|p=417}}

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861−1865) trenches were used for defensive positions throughout the struggle, but played an increasingly important role in the campaigns of the last two years.{{sfn|Hess|2011|p=xiv}}
Military earthworks perhaps culminated in the vast network of trenches built during [[World War I]] (1914−1918) that stretched from [[Switzerland]] to the [[North Sea]] by the end of 1914.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=6}}
The two lines of trenches faced each other, manned by soldiers living in appalling conditions of cold, damp and filth.{{sfn|Hamilton|2010|p=7}}
Conditions were worst in the Allied trenches. The Germans were more willing to accept the trenches as long-term positions, and used concrete blocks to build secure shelters deep underground, often with electrical lighting and heating.{{sfn|Horne|2011|p=214}}

===Embankment dams===
[[Image:MicaDam.JPG|thumb|The [[Mica Dam]] in [[Canada]]]]
An [[embankment dam]] is a massive artificial [[dam|water barrier]]. It is typically created by the emplacement and [[soil compaction|compaction]] of a complex semi-[[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or [[Seepage#Permeability and seepage|seepage]] [[erosion]].{{sfn|Dam Basics, PBS}}
The force of the impoundment creates a downward thrust upon the mass of the dam, greatly increasing the weight of the dam on its foundation. This added force effectively seals and makes waterproof the underlying foundation of the dam, at the interface between the dam and its [[stream bed]].{{sfn|Embankment dam: forces, PBS}} 
Such a dam is composed of fragmented independent material particles. 
The friction and interaction of particles binds the particles together into a stable mass rather than by the use of a cementing substance.{{sfn|Graham|1997}}

The [[Syncrude Tailings Dam|Syncrude Mildred Lake Tailings Dyke]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, is an embankment dam about {{convert|18|km}} long and from {{convert|40|to|88|m}} high. By volume of fill, as of 2001 it was believed to be the largest earth structure in the world.{{sfn|Morgenstern|2001|p=58}}

==Structural Issues==
===Designing for Earthquakes===
Regions with low seismic risk are safe for most earth buildings, but historic construction techniques often cannot resist even medium earthquake levels effectively because of earthen buildings' three highly undesirable qualities as a seismic building material: being relatively 'weak, heavy and brittle'. However, earthen buildings can be built to resist seismic loads.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture: A fresh and updated look at clay-based construction&lt;/ref&gt;

Key factors to improved seismic performance are soil strength, construction quality, robust layout and seismic reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Randolph (2005) Collapse from the Inside Out. SismoAdobe 2005, Catholic University of Peru&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger soils make stronger walls. Adobe builders can test cured blocks for strength by dropping from a specific height or by breaking them with a lever.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) 4298:1998 [http://studylib.net/doc/18328751/nzs-4298--materials-and-workmanship-for-earth-buildings Materials and Workmanship for Earth Buildings] pp. 64-65, 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; Builders using immediate techniques like earthbag, cob, or rammed earth may prefer approximate crushing tests on smaller samples that can be oven-dried and crushed under a small lever.&lt;ref&gt;Stouter, Patti (2017) Field Tests for Strength of Building Soils, Build Simple Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders must understand construction processes and be able to produce consistent quality for strong buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Smart Shelter Foundation [http://www.smartshelterfoundation.org/smart-shelter-techniques/21-improving-building-quality/ Improving the Overall Construction Quality] (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robust layout means buildings more square than elongated, and symmetrical not L-shaped,&lt;ref&gt;Totten,
 Craig (ed.) (2010) [http://aidg.org/documents/CM-Handout%20MASTER%20v3%20English.pdf Confined Masonry Workshop Handbook], 3rd edition, AIDG AWB and Haiti Rewired&lt;/ref&gt; as well as no 'soft' first stories (stories with large windows, buildings on unbraced columns). New Zealand's earthen building guidelines check for enough bracing wall length in each of the two principal directions, based on wall thickness, story height, bracing wall spacing, and the roof, loft and second story weight above earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt;Standards New Zealand (1998) [http://www.eastue.org/project/linea-adobe/norme/NZD4299-1998-Earth_Buildings_Not_Requiring_Specific_Design.pdf 4299:1998 Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismic-Resistant Construction Techniques===
Building techniques that are more ductile than brittle, like the [[contained earth]] type of earthbag, or tire walls of [[earthships]], may better avoid collapse than brittle unreinforced earth. Contained gravel base courses may add [[base isolation]] potential.

Wall containment can be added to techniques like adobe to resist loss of material that leads to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Blondet, Marcial, G. Villa Garcia M., S. Brzev and A. Rubinos (2011) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Adobe_Tutorial.pdf Earthquake Resistant Construction of Adobe Buildings: A Tutorial] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Confined masonry is effective for adobe against quake forces of 0.3 g&lt;ref&gt;San Bartolome, A., E. Delgado and D. Quiun (2009) Seismic Behavior of a Two Story Model of Confined Adobe Masonry. 11th Canadian Masonry Symposium, Toronto, Ontario, May 31- June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez,
 Mario (undated) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Confined-Masonry_Rodriguez.pdf Confined Masonry Construction] Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; may be useful with earthen masonry.

Many types of reinforcement can increase wall strength, such as plastic or wire mesh and reinforcing rods of steel or fiberglass or bamboo. Earth resists compression well but is weak when twisted. Tensile reinforcement must span potential damage points and be well-anchored to increase out-of-plane stability. Bond beams at wall tops are vital and must be well attached to walls.&lt;ref&gt;King, Bruce. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Builders should be aware that organic reinforcements embedded in walls may be destroyed before the building is retired. Attachment details of reinforcement are critical to resist higher forces. Best adobe shear strength came from horizontal reinforcement attached directly to vertical rebar spanning from footing to bond beam.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Hugh (1993) The Strength of Engineered Earth Buildings. Ipenz Annual Conference 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Interlaced wood in earthen walls reduces quake damage if wood is not damaged by dry rot or insects. Timberlacing includes finely webbed Dhajji,&lt;ref&gt;Schacher, Tom and Q. Ali (2009) [http://www.world-housing.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Dhajji_English.pdf Dhajji Construction for One and Two Story Earthquake Resistant Houses], United Nations Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; and other types.&lt;ref&gt;Langenbach, Rudolph [https://www.conservationtech.com/RL%27s%20resume&amp;%20pub%27s/RL-publications/Eq-pubs/2010-Kingdom-Of-Bhutan/Langenbach-BHUTAN.pdf Earthquake Resistant Traditional Construction is not an Oxymoron] Bhutan International Conference on Disaster Management and Cultural Heritage, 12–14 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Gun laws by country}}
In [[South Africa]], the Firearms Control Act 60 of 2000 regulates the ownership of firearms by civilians. Ownership of a firearm is conditional on a competency test and several other factors, including background checking of the applicant, inspection of an owner's premises, and licensing of the weapon by the police introduced in July 2004. The process is currently undergoing review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunownerssa.org/downloads/2010-call-for-submissions/41555185.pdf Government Request for Submissions]&lt;/ref&gt; as the police are at present, not able to adequately or within reasonable time, process either competency certification, new licences or renewal of existing licences. Minimum waiting period used to exceed 2 years from date of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gunownerssa.org/downloads/2010-call-for-submissions/GOSA-submission.pdf Reply to Government Enquiry by Gun Owners South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Firearms Registry implemented a turnaround strategy that has significantly improved the processing period of new licences. The maximum time allowed to process a licence application is now 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18 June 2012 at 09:27am By ZELDA VENTER |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/gun-licence-woes-are-over-1.1321126#.UoW7JPmVOQ4 |title=Gun licence woes ‘are over’ - Crime &amp; Courts &amp;#124; IOL News |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/11167-1007-53-Process_of_issuing_firearm_licences_to_be_speeded_up |title=Process of issuing firearm licences to be speeded up &amp;#124; The New Age Online |publisher=Thenewage.co.za |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current law==
In South Africa, citizens or permanent residents (over the age of 21 years generally, but if need can be shown then technically no age limit applies) who wish to own firearms are required to obtain a licence per individual firearm, and may own a maximum amount of only four firearms, and a maximum of 200 rounds of ammunition per license. Should the individual acquire 'dedicated status' conferred by registered shooting club, the individual can theoretically license an unlimited amount of firearms and ammunition limits also then fall away.&lt;ref name="westerncape.gov.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/Text/2003/firearms_control_act_60_of_2000.pdf |title=Firearms Control Act 60 of 2000 |publisher=South African Government |date= |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*any person who is accredited to use firearms for such other business purpose as the Registrar may determine&lt;ref name="westerncape.gov.za"/&gt;

====Prohibited firearms====
Prohibited firearms are:
*Any fully automatic firearm;
*any gun, cannon, recoilless gun, mortar, light mortar or launcher manufactured to fire a rocket, grenade, self-propelled grenade, bomb or explosive device;
*any frame, body or barrel of such a fully automatic firearm, gun, cannon, recoilless gun, mortar, light mortar or launcher;
*any projectile or rocket manufactured to be discharged from a cannon, recoilless gun or mortar, or rocket launcher;

**the mechanism of which has been altered so as to enable the discharging of more than one shot with a single depression of the trigger;
**the calibre of which has been altered without the written permission of the Registrar;
**the barrel length of which has been altered without the written permission of the Registrar;&lt;ref name="westerncape.gov.za"/&gt;

===Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns===
Semi-automatic firearms are not prohibited under law. However, semi-automatic long guns are only permitted with a business licence, restricted firearms licence for self-defence, and dedicated hunting and shooting licences. There is no official magazine capacity restriction for semi-automatic rifles.&lt;ref name="westerncape.gov.za"/&gt;

===Handguns===
Handguns of all firing actions (except fully automatic) are legal under all licences. There is no magazine capacity restriction for handguns.&lt;ref name="westerncape.gov.za"/&gt;

===Carrying of firearms in public===
Carrying legally owned firearms in South Africa is legal under all licence types and requires no additional permit. No person may carry a firearm in a public place unless the firearm is carried:

* in the case of a handgun—
** in a holster or similar holder designed, manufactured or adapted for the carrying of a handgun and attached to his or her person; or
** in a rucksack or similar holder; or
* in the case of any other firearm, in a holder designed, manufactured or adapted for the carrying of the firearm.
A firearm contemplated in subsection 
* must be completely covered and the person carrying the firearm must be able to exercise effective control over such firearm (carrying firearms in public is allowed if done in that manner).

==== Prohibited places (Gun Free Zones) ====
In South Africa, private guns are prohibited by law as per the Control of Access to Public Premises and Vehicles Act of 1985 (CAPPVA), in government buildings.&lt;ref name="Control of Access to Public Premises and vehicles Act of 1985"&gt;http://www.gov.za/documents/control-access-public-premises-and-vehicle-act-8-may-1985-0000/&lt;/ref&gt; The Firearms Control Act of 2000 does allow for firearm-free zones, but this must not be confused with the mandate of the CAPPVA of 1985, which has effectively made all government buildings and vehicles firearm-free by law without the input of the FCA which came about almost two decades later. According to the FCA under section 140, firearm-free zones can be applied for and must be granted FFZ status by the minister. To date, there have been no firearm-free zone declared by the minister.&lt;ref name="Firearms Control Act of 2000"&gt;http://www.acts.co.za/firearms-control-act-2000/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Firearm Control Act 60 of 2000 &amp; Regulations, together with amendments and regulations form the legal framework for gun ownership in South Africa. All current firearms owners, approximately 2.6 to 3 million according to the SA Central Firearm Registry (which is less than 6% of the population), are required by the Act to re-register their [[firearms]]. Its constitutionality is currently{{when|date=June 2012}} being challenged in two high-profile cases.

The South African Hunters Association has successfully challenged the transitional provisions to the implementation of the act, meaning that the full implementation of the Act has been placed on hold for several years now. The government has failed to challenge the interim ruling of North Gauteng High Court Judge Bill Prinsloo. The South African Gunowners Association (SAGA) have applied to have Bill Prinsloo's interim judgement confirmed and made permanently binding. Other parties including [[Gun Owners of South Africa]] (GOSA) have raised constitutional challenges to aspects of the FCA in particular the government's non-compliance with compensation aspects of the law. The argument is that if a citizen is deprived of property, e.g. the surrender of a firearm, due to compliance with the act, the government must compensate the citizen for lost property, as is provided for in the act.

===Criticism and legal challenges===
The Black Gun Owners Association of South Africa is challenging the loss of revenue and employment, and is seeking compensation for the loss of income. Furthermore, it is challenging the political motivations of the act as Abios Khoele, chairperson of the Black Gun Owners Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2010/07/16/black-gun-association-to-sue-government|title=Black gun association to sue government|website=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt; told a press briefing in Johannesburg: "This government is hell-bent on disarming black people because they've made so many service delivery promises to them which they have not fulfilled. They are scared that if blacks are armed they will turn on the government."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Black-gun-owners-to-sue-govt-20100716 News24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-231987220.html 'Scared government set on disarming black people'. Highbeam research&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the Black Gun-Owners Association of South Africa (BGOASA), filed a R3.2 Billion lawsuit against the government in regards to the poor implementation of the firearms act, claiming 40,000 Black people were refused firearm licences between 2004 and 2010.&lt;ref name="timeslive-bgoasa"&gt;[http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article554333.ece/Black-gun-association-to-sue-government BGOASA Lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt; which is claimed to have cost 10,000 jobs in the firearms sector and closed 800 shops.&lt;ref name="timeslive-bgoasa"/&gt; Licensing takes over 2 years to process before revenue can be recognised or is arbitrarily dismissed and rejected by the police. These two factors lead to many dealers not being able to maintain their businesses, in light of greatly reduced revenues.

On 30 November 2012, the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed an order brought by a group of gun owners that would have compelled the minister of police to pay compensation for all firearms voluntarily surrendered for destruction under the Firearms Control Act 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africacheck.org/reports/did-gun-control-cause-fall-in-gun-crime-the-data-backs-the-claim/ AfricaCheck: Did gun control cause fall in gun crime?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63602">The '''freedom of movement for workers''' is a policy chapter of the [[Acquis|acquis communautaire]] of the [[European Union]]. It is part of the [[free movement of persons]] and one of the [[Internal market|four economic freedoms]]: [[free movement of goods]], [[free movement of services|services]], [[free movement of labour|labour]] and [[free movement of capital|capital]]. Article 45 [[TFEU]] (ex 39 and 48) states that:

{{quote|
# Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community.
# Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.
# It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health:
#:(a) to accept offers of employment actually made;
#:(b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;
#:(c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action;
#:(d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission.
#The provisions of this article shall not apply to employment in the public service.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html Treaty of Rome] (consolidated version). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right to free movement has both 'horizontal' and 'vertical' [[direct effect]],&lt;ref name="Bosman"&gt;''Union royale belge des sociétés de football association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61993J0415:EN:NOT Case C-415/93]. EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angonese"&gt;''[[Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA]]'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61998J0281:EN:NOT Case C-281/98] (2000). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt; such that a private citizen can invoke the right, without more, in an ordinary court, against other persons, both governmental and non-governmental.

==History==
The [[Treaty of Paris (1951)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/treaty_establishing_the_european_coal_and_steel_community_paris_18_april_1951-en-11a21305-941e-49d7-a171-ed5be548cd58.html Article 69] part of Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Rome, 25 March 1957) on CVCE website.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] established a right to free movement for workers in these industries and the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaty of Rome (1957)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/treaty_establishing_the_european_economic_community_rome_25_march_1957-en-cca6ba28-0bf3-4ce6-8a76-6b0b3252696e.html Title 3] part of Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Rome, 25 March 1957) on CVCE website.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a right for the free movement of workers within the [[European Economic Community]]. The [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely]] assembles the different aspects of the right of movement in one document, replacing ''inter alia'' the directive 1968/360/EEC. It also clarifies procedural issues, and it strengthens the rights of family members of [[European citizen]]s using the freedom of movement.
According to the official site of the European Parliament, the explanation of the freedom of workers goes as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Freedom of movement and residence for persons in the EU is the cornerstone of Union citizenship, which was established by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. Its practical implementation in EU law, however, has not been straightforward. It first involved the gradual phasing out, of internal borders under the Schengen agreements, initially in just a handful of Member States. Today, the provisions governing the free movement of persons are laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. However, the implementation of this directive continues to face many obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_2.1.3.html |title=Free movement of persons |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition of "worker"==
The meaning of '[[worker]]' is a matter of European Union law.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoekstra (née Unger) v Bestuur der Bedrijfsvereniging voor Detailhandel en Ambachten'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61963J0075:EN:NOT Case 75-63] (1964). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt; "The essential feature of an [[employment]] relationship, however, is that for a certain period of time a person performs [[service (economics)|service]]s for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives [[remuneration]]."&lt;ref name="Lawrie-Blum"&gt;''Deborah Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Württemberg'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61985J0066:EN:NOT Case 66/85] (1986). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;

*Purpose: under the [[European Court of Justice]] caselaw, the rights of free movement of workers applies regardless of the worker's purpose in taking up employment abroad,&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;''Levin v Staatssecretaris van Justitie'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61981J0053:EN:NOT Case 53/81] (1982). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt; so long as the work is not solely provided as a means of rehabilitation or reintegration of the workers concerned into society.&lt;ref name="Bettray"&gt;''Bettray v Staatssecretaris van Justitie'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0344:EN:NOT Case 344/87] (1989). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;
*Time commitment: the right of free movement applies to both [[part-time]] and [[full-time]] work, so long as the work is effective and genuine&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt; and not of such small scale, irregular nature or limited duration to be purely marginal and ancillary.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raulin"&gt;''Raulin v Minister van Onderwijs en Wetenschappen'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61989J0357:EN:NOT Case C-357/89] (1992). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;
*Remuneration: a [[wage]] is a necessary precondition for activity to constitute work, but the amount is not important. The right to free movement applies whether or not the worker required additional financial assistance from the Member State into which he moves.&lt;ref name="Kempf"&gt;''Kempf v Staatssecretaris van Justitie'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61985J0139:EN:NOT Case 139/85] (1986). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt; Remuneration may be indirect ''[[quid pro quo]]'' (e.g. board and lodging) rather than strict [[consideration]] for work.&lt;ref name="Steymann"&gt;''Udo Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0196:EN:NOT Case 196/87] (1988). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;
*Direction of another: where a person is [[self-employed]], he can avail himself of the [[freedom to provide services]] and [[freedom of establishment]].

==Extent of the right==
The right to free movement applies where the legal relationship of employment is entered into in or shall take effect within the territory of the European Community.&lt;ref name="Walrave"&gt;''Walrave and Koch v Association Union cycliste internationale, Koninklijke Nederlandsche Wielren Unie et Federación Española Ciclismo'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61974J0036:EN:NOT Case 36-74] (1974). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boukhalfa"&gt;See also''Ingrid Boukhalfa v Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61994J0214:EN:NOT C-214/94] (1996). EUR-Lex&lt;/ref&gt; The precise legal scope of the right to free movement for workers has been shaped by the [[European Court of Justice]] and by [[Directive (European Union)|directives]] and [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]]. Underlying these developments is a tension "between the image of the Community worker as a mobile [[unit of production]], contributing to the creation of a single market and to the economic prosperity of Europe" and the "image of the worker as a human being, exercising a [[civil right|personal right]] to live in another state and to take up employment there without discrimination, to improve the standard of living of his or her family".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|de Búrca|2003|p=701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitional provisions in new member states==
In the [[Treaty of Accession 2003]], the [[Treaty of Accession 2005]], and the [[Treaty of Accession 2011]], there is a clause about a transition period before [[worker]]s from the new member states can be [[employed]] on an equal, non-discriminatory terms in the old member states. The old member states have the right to impose such transitional period for 2 years, then to decide to extend it for additional 3 years, and then, ''if there is serious proof'' that [[Workforce|labour]] from new member states would be disruptive to the market in the old member states then the period can be extended for the last time for 2 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = European Commission

According to the principle of reciprocity, new member states have the right to impose restrictions for all the countries that introduced restrictions and transitional periods to their citizens. Croatia has decided to apply this rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Croatia - Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion - European Commission|url = http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1067&amp;langId=en|website = ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of movement in the European Economic Area==
The citizens of the member states of the [[European Economic Area]] (which includes the EU) have the same right of freedom of movement in the EEA as EU citizens do within the Union. Additionally, the [[European Union]] and [[Switzerland]] have concluded a bilateral agreement with the same meaning. The EEA member states outside the EU ([[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]) and [[Switzerland]] are treated as "old member states" in regard to the Treaty of Accession of the new EU members, so they can impose such 2+3+2 transitional periods.

Switzerland initially granted freedom of movement to EEA citizens in 2005-2011. It briefly reimposed restrictions in 2012-2013, but lifted them again in 2014. A [[Swiss immigration referendum, February 2014|2014 Referendum]] directed the Swiss government  to impose permanent quotas on residence/work permits for citizens of all EEA countries except Liechtenstein, starting from 2017 at the latest.&lt;ref name="SwissDEA"&gt;{{cite web|title = Free movement of persons|url = https://www.eda.admin.ch/dea/en/home/bilaterale-abkommen/ueberblick/personenfreizuegigkeit.html|work = Directorate for European Affairs|publisher = [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate = 6 June 2014|location = [[Bern]]|date = May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SwissFOM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Free Movement of Persons Switzerland – EU/EFTA|url = https://www.bfm.admin.ch/bfm/en/home/themen/fza_schweiz-eu-efta.html|work = Federal Office for Migration|publisher = [[Federal Department of Justice and Police]]|accessdate = 6 June 2014|location = [[Bern]]|date = May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swisscroatia&gt;{{cite web|title = Working in Switzerland as a citizen of an EU/EFTA member state - www.ch.ch|url = https://www.ch.ch/en/working-switzerland-eu-efta/|website = www.ch.ch|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 22 December 2016, Switzerland and the EU concluded an agreement that a new Swiss law (in response to the referendum) may require Swiss employers to give priority to Swiss-based job seekers (Swiss nationals and foreigners registered in Swiss job agencies) but does not limit the free movement of EU workers to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://euobserver.com/justice/136398 EU and Switzerland agree on free movement]{{snd}}[[euobserver]],  22 Dec 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Liechtenstein imposes a permanent quota for all EEA citizens (issuing 56 ''residence'' permits per year)&lt;ref name=liechgov&gt;[https://www.liechtenstein-business.li/en/for-employees/work-and-residence/ Liechtenstein Wirtschaft] Work permits and residence&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiechQuota"&gt;{{cite web|title=Work permits and labour market restrictions in some EU countries|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/abroad/work-permits/index_en.htm|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]]|accessdate=2 June 2014|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a separate quota for Swiss citizens (a further 12 ''residence'' permits per year).&lt;ref name=liechgov/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1857">The '''Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards''' ('''GAGAS'''), commonly referred to as the "'''Yellow Book'''", are produced in the [[United States]] by the [[Government Accountability Office]] ('''GAO''').

The standards apply to both [[Financial audit|financial]] and [[performance audit]]s of [[Government agency|government agencies]].  Five general standards are included:

* [[Internal audit#Organizational independence|Independence]]
* [[Due Care]]
* [[Continuing Professional Education]] ('''CPE''')
* [[Supervisor|Supervision]]
* [[Quality control|Quality Control]]

The Yellow Book standards are used by auditors who examine the federal government, including the Government Accountability Office, various offices of Inspectors General, and others.  Many local government performance auditors also use the yellow book standards.  In addition, CPA firms who perform local government financial audits that include an A-133 "single audit" must follow yellow book standards.

In addition to financial audits, the Yellow Book standards cover Performance Audits, which evaluate the performance of a program or project against defined objectives, such as objectives for efficiency and effectiveness.

'''Half-year convention''' is a principle of [[United States]] [[taxation]] law.

Certain property is subject to [[depreciation]].  Depreciation allows one to deduct a certain amount of the value or basis of depreciable property per taxable year.  A person with depreciable property must know when to start depreciating his/her property.  The tax code explains how to do this through, what is called, the [[applicable convention]].  

In [[tax accounting]] the '''half-year convention''' is the default applicable convention used for federal income tax purposes.   Like other conventions, the half-year convention affects the depreciation deduction computation in the year in which the property is placed into service.  Using the half-year convention, a taxpayer claims a half of a year's depreciation for the first taxable year, regardless of when the property was actually put into service.  It is assumed that the property being depreciated was placed into service at the midpoint of the year.  To compensate for this computation, the taxpayer is entitled to another half-year of depreciation at the end of the normal recovery period.  § 168(d)(4) of the Federal Income Tax Code defines half-year convention as a convention which treats all property placed in service during any taxable year (or disposed of during any taxable year) as placed in service (or disposed of) on the midpoint of such taxable year.

==Example==
Consider you are a taxpayer with five-year property worth $50,000.  Also, assume that the property depreciates $10,000 per year. 
 
Year 1- limited to half of the deduction normally entitled in a full year. One 
deduction of $5,000 allowed at the end of the year, since the property is put into
service on July 1, year 1.

Year 2- $10,000 deduction taken.  $5,000 deducted on June 30.  $5,000 deducted	
on December 31.

Year 3- $10,000 deduction taken.  $5,000 deducted on June 30.  $5,000 deducted 
on December 31.

Year 4- $10,000 deduction taken.  $5,000 deducted on June 30.  $5,000 deducted 
on December 31.

Year 5- $10,000 deduction taken.  $5,000 deducted on June 30.  $5,000 deducted 
on December 31.

Year 6- $5,000 deduction taken on June 30.

==Practical effects==
For taxpayers, the half-year convention does not require knowledge or proof of the date on which depreciable property is placed in service.  Depreciable property is assumed to be placed into service on July 1 of the year in which it is placed into service.  The Internal Revenue Service is fond of the rule because without it, taxpayers would be tempted to buy property in the second half of the year and claim full depreciation deductions as if the property were used for the entire year.  Taxpayers like the rule because it does not require them to keep track of or prove exactly when depreciable property was placed into service.  Nonetheless, the IRS is wary of abuse of the half-year convention.  Under § 168(d)(3) of the Federal Income Tax Code, if a taxpayer purchases a lot of depreciable assets in the last three months of the taxable year, they may be forced to use the less beneficial "mid-quarter convention".  This convention treats such property as placed into service in the midpoint of the last quarter of the taxable year.  See § 168(d)(4)(c).

The obsolete [[German language|German]] legal concept ''Kranzgeld'' (literally "wreath money") is '''heart balm''' (see [[breach of promise]]) rewarded as compensation to a woman of "immaculate reputation" if a man broke off his [[engagement]] (or caused it to be broken off e.g. through unfaithfulness) after having had [[sexual intercourse]] with her. Immaculate reputation in this context meant mainly [[virginity]], but could also be lost though other factors such as being convicted of a crime.

The loss of virginity, it was assumed, would diminish the woman's expectations to gain a good [[matchmaking|match]] for a [[husband]]. Thus, the money is a form of legal [[damages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/kranzgeld Kranzgeld]. Reverso Dictionary. Accessed May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to the [[wreath]] that a [[bride]] traditionally wears at her [[wedding]]. In some European cultures, notably Germany, a virgin bride was entitled to wear a wreath of [[Myrtus|myrtle]] flowers; a non-virgin bride, on the other hand, had to wear a wreath made of [[straw]].

In [[Germany]], ''Kranzgeld'' was regulated in paragraph §1300 of the [[family law]], part of the [[civil code]] ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' published in 1896 and taking effect in 1900. After being long considered irrelevant, it was finally abolished on May 4, 1998, when the entire law was renewed, on the occasion of a [[trial]] in 1993 where the [[judge]]s decided the law was outdated. A woman had then tried to sue for 1000 [[German mark|DM]] (in 2004, roughly €500 or $500), but the request was denied on the grounds of [[Gender equality|equal rights]] between man and woman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11800">[[English law]] did not originally make a distinction between [[English criminal law|criminal]] and [[English civil law|civil proceedings]].

The first signs of the modern distinction between crimes and civil matters emerged during the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;see, Pennington, Kenneth (1993) ''The Prince and the Law, 1200–1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradition,'' University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest criminal trials had very little, if any, settled law to apply. However, the civil [[delict|delictual law]] was highly developed and consistent in its operation (except where the King wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[Writ]]).

The development of the state dispensing [[justice]] in a court only emerged parallel to or after the emergence of the concept of sovereignty. It was only in the 18th century that European countries began operating police forces. From this point, criminal law had the mechanisms for enforcement.

The '''Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission''' ({{lang-gv|Barrantee Oaseirys Karrooghys Vannin}}) (formerly the '''Gambling Control Commission''') is the [[Gaming Control Board]] of the [[Isle of Man]]. It regulates most forms of gambling in its territory including land based ([[casino]], amusement and [[slot machines]], betting offices and [[lotteries]]) and online gambling services.

The Commission was established in 1962 to protect the interests of gamblers in the Island by ensuring that gambling remains fair and crime-free and that players receive their winnings.  It gained worldwide notice with the advent of [[online gambling]] in the early 21st Century due to the Isle's reputation as a tax-friendly jurisdiction. It was one of the first jurisdictions to offer legislation to regulate the activity of e-gaming companies and create a secure atmosphere for the gamblers. One of the main documents underpinning the activity of the Commission is the Online Gambling Regulation Act 2001 (OGRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/gambling/ograpersonalreferenceformv2.pdf Online Gambling Regulation Act 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Isle of Man licence to operate a live dealer in online casino gaming was given to [[Celton Manx]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/108221/sbo-granted-first-isle-of-man-licence-for-live-dealer-casino.thtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710174021/http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/108221/sbo-granted-first-isle-of-man-licence-for-live-dealer-casino.thtml |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Isle of Man sub-licence was issued to Know How Gaming, successfully applied for by licensed Corporate Services Provider, ILS World.

==Functions==

The Commission deals with:

*Licensing and regulation of the gaming operators.
*Guidance and cooperation at all stages of the application process.
*Protection of player's funds – the organisation makes sure that their licensees have appropriate systems that regulate player's funds. All the money deposited and withdrawn from the licensed sites is secure and can be enforced by law.
*External testing of games – the Commission approves independent testing facilities to ensure the randomness of results of all games of chance. All companies seeking to be licensed by the Isle of Man have to test their software systems with one of the companies approved by the Commission.
*Monitoring – the activities of the licensed operators (including marketing activities) are constantly monitored by the Commission to ensure their compliance with the law and principles of fair gaming.
*Investigation of complaints concerning the licensees on behalf of the players.

The Commission can't enforce any operator to return the stakes that have been voluntary placed and lost in a fair game, but it can provide advice and assistance in enforcing the deposited money and the actual winnings.

==Commissioners==

*Ron Spencer, Chairman, - present
*Jerry Carter, Commissioner, - present
*[[Neil Kinrade]], Commissioner, - present
*Jon Allen, Commissioner,  - present
*Howard Callow, Commissioner,  - present

==Status==

As the Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency, they have their own government and legislation, therefore gambling legislation and licensing requirements do not have to be the same as in the UK. Nevertheless, this jurisdiction has very strict rules and therefore remains one of the countries named in the [[whitelisted gambling jurisdictions|whitelist]] of the UK [[Gambling Commission]] and allowed to advertise their services on the territory of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rga.eu.com/pages/en/advertising-in-the-uk.html Remote Gambling Association: Advertising of foreign gambling in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Isle of Man gambling jurisdiction meets the UK government's regulatory requirements regarding the openness, fairness and security of the licensed online gambling operators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/WhiteListingCriteria.pdf Gambling Act 2005: Whitelisting criteria]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010 the Commission licences several well-known online gambling companies. The list of current licence holders of the Gambling Supervision Commission is provided on their website.

The '''Italian irredentism in Istria''' was the political movement supporting the unification to [[Italy]], during the 19th and 20th centuries, of the peninsula of [[Istria]]. It is considered closely related to the [[Italian irredentism]] in [[Trieste]] and [[Fiume]], two cities bordering the peninsula.

==History==

Istria, since Roman times, has been an eastern region of Italy, populated by romanized people who were initially related to the [[Roman Empire]] and -after the [[Middle Ages]]- to the [[Republic of Venice]]. In the northeastern section of Istria after [[Charlemagne]] started to settle some [[Slav]] people, who increased in number inside all Istria mainly after the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish invasions]] of the [[Balkans]] (mostly as refugees).

When [[Napoleon]] defeated Venice in 1797, he found that Istria was populated by Italians on the coast and in the main cities, but the interior was populated mainly by Croats and Slovenians: this dual ethnicity in the same peninsula created a situation of antagonism between Slavs and Italians for the supremacy of Istria, when started the first [[nationalism]]s after Napoleon's fall.

Since 1815 Istria was a part of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] monarchy, and [[Croats]]/[[Slovenians]] and Italians engaged in a nationalistic feud with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Benussi, Bernardo. ''L' Istria nei suoi due millenni di storia''. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence Istria has been the theater of an ethnic struggle between them, with bloody [[nationalism|nationalistic]] wars, during the 19th and 20th centuries. The [[Italian irredentism]] was actively followed by many Italians in Istria, like the Italian hero [[Nazario Sauro]] of [[Koper|Capodistria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marina.difesa.it/storia/movm/parte04/bio04/movm420b.asp Biography of Nazario Sauro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, between 1918 and 1947 Istria was part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], but after [[World War II]] was part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Furthermore, after the war was created the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] in north-western Istria: in the years following the division of the territory between Italy and Yugoslavia, up to 40,000 Istrian Italians&lt;ref&gt;Arrigo Petacco, ''The exodus. The story of the Italian population of Istria, Dalmatia, and Venezia Giulia'', Mondadori, Milan, 1999. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hhD0R8DBr_UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Petacco&amp;ei=UY49R9e7OpeS7QKTuu3BAg&amp;sig=093Luifi2PuSl4AyuVhwZFe-GUA English translation.]&lt;/ref&gt; chose to leave the Yugoslav "B zone" and move to the "A zone" or Italy for various reasons - some were intimidated into leaving and some simply preferred not to live in [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s Yugoslavia.

Since the end of World War II the irredentism has totally disappeared in Istria, even because of the [[Istrian exodus]].

Actually Istria is populated mainly by Slavs, but nearly 50,000 Italians still live there (divided between the areas of Istria belonging to [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and Italy).

==Italian irredentism==

After Napoleon the idea of "unification" of all the Italian people in a "united Italy" started to be developed by intellectuals like the Istrian Carlo Combi.  As a consequence, the [[Italian irredentism]] promoted the unification of those areas not included in the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] after 1861: Istria was one of those.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NK3PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA455&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=italian+irredentism+in+istria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FLKfQHrAA-&amp;sig=NKoxbHJlU8-CK9-DZT4V42fZvHE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ujfFS9K7MI649QTyrbCgDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Unredeemed Italy: Istria (Google Book)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|''The irredentist ideas of the Italian nationalists became stronger after the unification of Italy (1861). The main representatives of these ideas in historical writings are Pacifico Valussi and the Istrians Carlo Combi, Tommaso Luciani and Sigismondo Bonfiglio. Opinion about the Slavs had entirely changed: they were seen as peasant folk unable to build a nation of their own and therefore condemned to be assimilated within an Italian identity. And they already envisaged the frontiers of Italy extending to the Oriental Alps and to Arsa, some even to Fiume/Rijeka.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zrs-kp.si/zrs/zgodovina/e-period.html Istria and irredentism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Italians in Istria (like Tomaso Luciani of [[Albona]] and many other "patriots") fully supported the Italian [[Risorgimento]] and, because of this, the Austrians saw the Italians as enemies and favored the Slav communities of Istria &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fvgnews.net/view.php?t=n&amp;k=2790 Paolo Radivo: Italian Irredentism in Istria (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; This fact created a huge emigration of Italians from Istria before [[World War I]], reducing their percentage inside the peninsula inhabitants (they were more than 50% of the total population during [[Napoleon I]]'s times (when General Marmont did a French census), but at the end of the 19th century they were reduced to only two fifth according to some estimates).
{|style="float:right;"
| [[File:Istria census 1910.PNG|thumb|The [[Istrian Italians|Italian community]] in [[Margravate of Istria|Istria]] (38%) was concentrated on its western coast. Croats formed the majority in the rest of the peninsula, with Slovenes in the north]]

}}
|}

Indeed, in 1910, the ethnic and linguistic composition was completely mixed and the Italians were reduced to a minority in the Austrian province of Istria (even if huge). According to the Austrian census results, out of 404,309 inhabitants in the "Margravate of Istria", 168,116 (41.6%) spoke [[Croatian language|Croatian]], 147,416 (36.5%) spoke [[Italian language|Italian]], 55,365 (13.7%) spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]], 13,279 (3.3%) spoke [[German language|German]], 882 (0.2%) spoke [[Romanian language|Romanian]], 2,116 (0.5%) spoke other languages and 17,135 (4.2%) were non-citizens, which had not been asked for their language of communication.

But scholars like [[Matteo Bartoli]] complained that these census percentages included areas outside Istria (like the island of Veglia/[[Krk]] and the city of Castua/[[Kastav]], a mostly Croatian town situated north of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] and outside the real Istrian peninsula): in his opinion the peninsula of Istria was still with a majority of Italians during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Matteo. ''Le parlate italiane della Venezia Giulia e della Dalmazia''. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally speaking, Italians lived on coast, while Croats and Slovenes lived inland.

In the second half of the 19th century a clash of new ideological movements, Italian irredentism (which claimed Trieste and Istria) and Slovene and Croatian [[nationalism]] (developing individual identities in some quarters whilst seeking to unite in a South Slav bid in others), resulted in growing ethnic conflict between Italians one side and Slovenes and Croats in opposition. This was intertwined with the class and religious conflict, as inhabitants of Istrian towns were mostly Italian, whilst [[Croats]] or [[Slovenes]] largely lived out in the countryside even if in western and southern Istria there were many Italians in the agricultural areas.

{{Quote|''Slav priests had an important role (in the ethnic conflict)... they, controlling the official church registration of the names, did many abuses (changing to slav many Italian family names).... In 1877 the Italian deputy to the Vienna Parliament Francesco Sbisà denounced the transformation of Italian names and surnames to slavic ones.... In 1897 Matteo Bartoli, a linguist from Rovigno, pinpointed that 20,000 names were changed with this forgery, mainly in eastern Istria and even in some Dalmatian islands.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fvgnews.net/view.php?t=n&amp;k=2790 Irredentism in Istria (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Koper|Capodistria]] was the center of the irredentism in Istria. In this city there was the main ''Comitato istriano'' (Istrian Committee for Union to Italy), the meeting place of the most famous Istrian irredentists like Carlo Combi e Antonio Madonizza.  From there sailed in 1848 many [[Istrian Italians]] to fight for Venice against the Austrians with the ''Legione Istriano-dalmata''.

After 1866 -when Venice and the [[Veneto]] region were united to Italy- in all Istria there was full support for the irredentism: Tino Gavardo, Pio Riego Gambini and [[Nazario Sauro]] where the most renowned between those who promoted the Istrian unification to Italy. Many of them enrolled voluntarily in the [[Italian Army]] during World War I against the Austrian Empire. Someone was captured and hanged by the Austrians, like the Italian national hero Nazario Sauro in August 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Pignatti Morano, Carlo. ''La vita di Nazario Sauro ed il martirio dell'eroe''. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 Pio Riego Gambini, Luigi Bilucaglia e Piero Almerigogna created the ''Fascio Giovanile Istriano'', while in 1915 the Austrians interned in concentration camps nearly 100,000 Istrian Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Vivante Angelo. ''Irredentismo Adriatico'' third chapter&lt;/ref&gt;

After Istria was united to Italy, following the Italian victory during World War I,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/12/23/96282678.pdf NYTimes on Italian irredentism in Istria in 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; some Istrian irredentists reached high levels of importance inside the Italian government, like general Vittorio Italico Zupelli, who was appointed minister.

After [[WW2]] there has been a huge exodus of Italian speaking people from Istria.

Actually there it is a growing movement in Italy (and Europe) toward asking for the official recognition of "genocide" or even [[democide]][https://books.google.com/books?id=hhD0R8DBr_UC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=ethnic+cleansing+of+dalmatian+italians&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5WAZ_hWme1&amp;sig=ZdO3tsGQPWkJ0Ln1CRM04sK5lOo&amp;hl=en] of the Italians in Istria (like has been done with the Armenian massacre done by the Turks).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=1.0.1865663799  Italy-Croatia: World War II killings were ethnic cleansing, Napolitano says&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, there it is a long history of ethnic cleansing in Croatia &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/IV.htm The policy of ethnic cleansing (1994)/Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to Security Council resolution 780 (1992), about massacres done by Croats (and others) in former Iugoslavia in the early nineties&lt;/ref&gt;
and former Yugoslavia, as reported by many academics like [[R.J. Rummel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP9.HTM Democide in Tito's Yugoslavia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the legal industry==

In the 2016 report, [[Deloitte]] estimated that more than 110,000 law jobs in just the United Kingdom alone could be gone within the next twenty years because of automation. That could result in the creation of more highly skilled jobs and reduction of paralegal and temp positions. Deloitte's report asserts that "there is significant potential for high-skilled roles that involve repetitive processes to be automated by smart and self-learning algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;"Developing legal talent: Stepping into the future law firm." Deloitte. N.p., Feb. 2016. Web. 17 June 2017. &lt;https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/audit/articles/developing-legal-talent.html#&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to law and justice==

It has been widely estimated for at least the last generation that all the programs and resources devoted to ensuring access to justice address only 20% of the civil legal needs of low-income people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Documenting the Justice Gap in America: The Current Unmet Civil Legal Needs of Low Income Americans, 2009, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on this experience, in late 2011, the U.S. government-funded [[Legal Services Corporation]] decided to convene a summit of leaders to explore how best to use technology in the access-to-justice community. The group adopted a mission for The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice (Summit) consistent with the magnitude of the challenge: "to explore the potential of technology to move the United States toward providing some form of effective assistance to 100% of persons otherwise unable to afford an attorney for dealing with essential civil legal needs".&lt;ref&gt;Legal Services Corporation, Report of The Summit on the Use of Technology to Expand Access to Justice, p. 1; December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, joined by [[Microsoft]] and [[Pro Bono Net]], the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) announced a pilot program to develop online, statewide legal portals to direct individuals with civil legal needs to the most appropriate forms of assistance. These portals will use cutting-edge, user-centered technology to help ensure that all people with civil legal needs can navigate their options and more easily access solutions and services available from legal aid, the courts, the private bar, and community partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Press Release: The Legal Services Corporation Announces Pilot States for Innovative Program to Increase Access to Justice."

The '''Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences''' ({{lang-ru|Библиотека Российской академии наук  (БАН)}}) is a large state-owned [[Russia]]n library based in [[Saint Petersburg]] on [[Vasilievsky Island]] and open to employees of institutions of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and scholars with higher education. It is a part of the academy and includes, besides the central collection, the library collections housed by specialized academic institutions in Saint Petersburg and other cities.

The library was founded in [[Saint Petersburg]] by a decree of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] in 1714 and subsequently included into the structure of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Since 1747 all academic institutions and since 1783 all publishers in the country have been legally obliged to provide the library with a free copy of each published item.

In 1728-1924 its collections were stored in the building of [[Kunstkamera]], with which it had formed a single academic institution until 1803. In the 1920s the library received many items confiscated during nationalization in Soviet Russia.

In 1924-1925 the collections were transferred to the new building built for the library in 1914 and occupied by a military hospital during the [[First World War]].

During the [[siege of Leningrad]] in 1941-1944 the collections stayed in the besieged city and the library was open.

On February 15, 1988, the library suffered the [[1988 Library of the USSR Academy of Sciences fire|most catastrophic fire in its history]] which destroyed or damaged a considerable part of the collections.

Before the fire, as of October 1, 1986, the collection of the library and libraries subordinate to it consisted of 17,288,365 items.&lt;ref&gt;Справочник-путеводитель по сети специальных библиотек ленинградских академических учреждений / Отв. ред.

'''Maguire v SOCOG 2000''' was a legal case in [[Australia]] about making a website accessible to a visually impaired person.

==Complaint==
On 7 June 1999, Maguire made a complaint to the human rights and equal opportunity commission (HREOC), alleging that the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) had discriminated against him as a person disabled, in contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 &lt;ref name=dda1992&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264.txt], Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing,
Attorney General’s Department, Canberra, 27 March 2006, DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 4:51pm EST, " http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264.txt".&lt;/ref&gt; in three aspects: the failure to provide braille copies of the information required to order Olympic Games tickets; the failure to provide braille copies of the
Olympic Games [[souvenir programme]]; and the failure to provide a website which was accessible to Maguire.&lt;ref name=maguire1999&gt;[http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/1999/DD000150.htm], Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Website,   17 December 2007,   Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 4pm EST, "http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/1999/DD000150.htm".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maguire2000&gt;[http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/2000/DD000120.htm], Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Website, 17 December 2007, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, last visited on Saturday 30 August 2008, 1:43pm, "http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/2000/DD000120.htm".&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the ticket book case (''[[Maguire v SOCOG 1999]]'' ) on 30 September 1999, conciliation on the remaining matters was attempted but by 29 November 1999, the talks failed.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

==Maguire v SOCOG 2000 (HREOC)==
Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission), No. H 99/115,   11 August 2000 (hearing), 24 August 2000 (decision).&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The commissioner, on 25 February 2000, notified the two parties about resuming the inquiry  on 27 March 2000.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; On that day 27 March, SOCOG in a direction conference agreed to provide the Souvenir programme to Maguire in braille.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

===Seeking information===
From 27 March 2000 to 4 August 2000, several direction conferences and letters from Maguire's solicitor to SOCOG solicitor asking SOCOG to provide information in order for Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus who were experts in computers and adaptive technology to complete their assessment did not result in the experts receiving the complete amount of information.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; In providing Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus with incomplete information, SOCOG maintained that the html source code was commercially sensitive to SOCOG and  its contractor IBM.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;
The complete information that was sought was "a sample page in electronic format from the proposed Results Table on the SOCOG website relating to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic website" (the latter request was abandoned upon advice by SOCOG that it was not involved in the organisation of the Paralympic Games); the current content plan for the Olympic website; the number of templates to be used; the details of the tools used to generate the pages of the Olympic website; and detailed calculations of certain "ball park" figures."&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

===Jurisdiction===
At the 3 July hearing, SOCOG presented the amended legislation effective from 13 April 2000 that transferred complaint hearing powers from HREOC to the Federal Court.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The commissioner felt that the amendment did not apply because of 31 August 1999 directions.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; SOCOG sought Federal Court review of the commissioner's ruling,&lt;ref name=MaguirevSocogFca&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2000/1112.html ], Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games [2000] FCA 1112 (3 August 2000), 11 August 2000,  Federal Court of Australia, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 9:57pm, "http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2000/1112.html" .&lt;/ref&gt; but on 3 August 2000, the Federal court dismissed the case.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

===Number of complaints===
A witness statement submitted on 1 May 2000 confirmed that Maguire accessed SOCOG's website on 17 April 2000 and found some changes to the website but some other areas remained inaccessible.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The witness statement asked for 
"That SOCOG include ALT text on all images and image map links on the website; That SOCOG ensure access from the Schedule page to the Index of Sports; and That SOCOG ensure access to the Results Tables on the web site during the Olympic Games." .&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; SOCOG used this statement to argue that the April 2000 complaint was different from the June 1999 complaint.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The commissioner maintained that SOCOG's website was inaccessible and did not meet the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] guidelines on accessibility.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; It was noted that SOCOG on 27 July 2000 provided Maguire information of URL addresses of each of the 37 individual sports to access the index of sports from the schedule.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; Even though the original complaint was general which was then particularised for the three areas, the commissioner felt the April 2000 and the June 1999 complaints were the same.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

===Service===
SOCOG argued that the promotional material of the website was not included by the DDA 1992 definition of "service".&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The commissioner declared that the provision of information was included by the Section 4 definition of "service" which made Section 24 valid.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s4&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html ], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 4 Interpretation, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:48pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html ], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 24 Goods, services and facilities, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treated less favourably===
SOCOG submitted that there was not any direct discrimination as Maguire in using the website was not treated less favourably than a sighted person.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; The incompletion of adding ALT texts and an imperfect mode access that should not be attempted by a sighted person were reasons that caused the commissioner to find that SOCOG in providing services in a manner accessible to sighted persons but inaccessible or partially accessible to a blind person violated section 5 and 24 of DDA 1992 &lt;ref name=dda1992s5&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s5.html], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 5&gt;[ Disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Saturday 30 August 2008, 9:30pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s5.html.&lt;/ref&gt; and.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24/&gt; Additionally, the commissioner found that SOCOG violated Section 6 by imposing a requirement that Maguire should be able to read print, with which a substantially greater proportion of persons without Maguire's disability was able to comply.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s6&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 6 Indirect disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 8:35pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unjustifiable hardship===
SOCOG said that it did not discriminate unlawfully against Maguire but if it did, that the cost and effort in retraining staff and redrawing entire development methods was an unjustifiable hardship in providing an accessible website.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s11&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 11 Unjustifiable hardship, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html.&lt;/ref&gt; SOCOG argued that the Table of Results is composed of data sourced from a number of different databases of results for each of 37 sporting disciplines; the site consists currently of 6,000 pages and approximately 55,000 pages will be generated during the course of the Games; there are 37 sports webpage templates each with approximately 35 result templates – in total 1,295 templates for results alone; the tables of results will contain "wrapped text within cells"; there will be approximately six billion "hits" on the site and the site needs to be fast and very responsive; to reformat the site and its contents in a way which will make the website accessible to the complainant will in effect require the development of a new or separate website; extensive changes to infrastructure are required; there is a requirement for specialised skills which are limited and expensive; there will be possible adverse effects upon the support and maintenance systems; one person working 8 hour business days would require 368 days to complete the task properly; $2.2 million of additional infrastructure would be required to separately host the additional designs necessary to an accessible Table of Results.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

However, Maguire with expert witnesses argued that the number of templates is significantly less than 1,295 and the reformatting of the templates will require considerably less than the two hours for each alleged by SOCOG; a more realistic estimate for the minor changes required is ten minutes each; nor is there the need for unique manually generated formats; no new infrastructure will be required because it is allegedly extant; a team of one experienced developer with a group of 5-10 assistants could provide an accessible site to Level A compliance in four weeks; wrapping in each cell can be met by using a simple device namely the inclusion of an invisible end of cell character which would indicate to a blind person the end of the text in each cell; the cost of making the site accessible is a modest amount; the number of templates has been estimated at 357 for 28 sports. Additional templates would be required for 37. Because of the failure of respondent to supply the information requested by letter on 31 March 2000 the number of templates has been estimated.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

The expert witnesses of Maguire who provided months of advice convinced the commissioner more than the expert witnesses of SOCOG who provided days of advice just before the August hearing.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; Despite conflicting arguments stated above, the Commissioner found that SOCOG who had unlawfully discriminated in violation of the DDA, delayed the final determination of that complaint of the commissioner and took advantage of matters consequential upon that delay in order to support its alleged inability to cure its problem.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

===Final decision===
The Commissioner found that SOCOG had engaged in unlawful discrimination against Maguire in violation of Section 24 of the DDA 1992.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24/&gt; SOCOG was ordered to render its website accessible including ALT text on all images and image map links on its website; providing access to the Index of Sports from the Schedule page; and providing access to the Results Tables to be used on the website during the Sydney Olympic Games by 15 September 2000.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt; Failure on SOCOG's part to comply with that order would give Maguire the option to press for compensation.&lt;ref name=maguire2000/&gt;

== Bruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games 2000 HREOC==
Bruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Respondent) (HREOC)  H 99/115, date of hearing: 6 November 2000, date of ex tempore decision: 6 November 2000, date of written decision: 18 November 2000.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt;

The Commissioner found that SOCOG only partially complied and as a result, by section 103(1)(b)(iv) of the DDA, the commissioner awarded Maguire $20,000.&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;[http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/2000/DD000200.htm], Bruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Respondent) H 99/115 (2000), 17 December 2007, Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, last visited on Saturday 30 August 2008, 10:43pm, http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/2000/DD000200.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case significance==
Australian governments have decided to adopt the W3C Guidelines, with the Commonwealth Government requiring all agency websites to pass accessibility tests by 1 December 2000.&lt;ref name=olympicfailure&gt;[http://www.tomw.net.au/2000/bat.html], Olympic Failure: A Case for Making the Web Accessible, 2000,  Tom Worthington, last visited on Sunday 14 September 2008, 11:06am, "http://www.tomw.net.au/2000/bat.html".&lt;/ref&gt;

It is questionable what tests are to be complied with, and what degree of compliance would be required.&lt;ref name= olympicfailure/&gt; Since this case there been greater scrutiny of the accessibility of subsequent Olympic Games websites.&lt;ref name=athens&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/index.php?news=1082654074], GamesBids.com - Athens 2004 Web Site Not Disabled Friendly?, Thursday, 22 April 2004, GamesBids.com, last visited on Sunday 14 September 2008, "http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/index.php?news=1082654074".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beijing&gt;[http://www.tomw.net.au/2003/beijing_olympics.shtml], website for the 2008 Beijing Olympics: Integrating Sport, Money, Phones and Politics,  1 July 2007, Tom Worthington, last visited on Sunday 14 September 2008, 11:42am, "http://www.tomw.net.au/2003/beijing_olympics.shtml".&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Coroneos from the Internet Industry Association warned businesses that the SOCOG decision confirmed that the DDA applied to online services and that Australian websites targeting overseas customers may be liable under equivalent legislation.&lt;ref name= olympicfailure/&gt;

The wool around the buttocks can retain feces and urine, which attracts flies. The
scar tissue that grows over the wound does not grow wool, so is less likely to attract the flies that cause flystrike. Mulesing is a common practice in [[Australia]] for this purpose, particularly on highly wrinkled [[Merino]] sheep.&lt;ref name="Model Code"/&gt; Mulesing is considered by some to be a skilled [[Surgery|surgical]] task.&lt;ref name="DPI SOP"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulesing can only affect flystrike on the area cut out and has no effect on flystrike on any other part of the animal's body.

Mulesing is a controversial practice. The [[National Farmers Federation]] of Australia says that "mulesing remains the most effective practical way to eliminate the risk of 'flystrike' in sheep" and that "without mulesing up to 3,000,000 sheep a year could die a slow and agonising death from flystrike".&lt;ref name="NFF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nff.org.au/get/2432305991.doc|title=Mulesing of Sheep|publisher=National Farmers Federation|date=|accessdate=2008-09-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829232718/http://www.nff.org.au/get/2432305991.doc|archivedate=29 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Veterinary Association]] (AVA) "recognises the welfare implications of mulesing of sheep. However, in the absence of more humane alternatives for preventing breech strike, the AVA accepts that the practice of mulesing should continue as a sheep husbandry procedure". The AVA also supports the use of [[analgesics]] and the accreditation of mulesing practitioners.&lt;ref name="AVA"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Mulesing is named after John WH Mules, who developed the practice.&lt;ref name="BBC_row"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/4699931.stm |title=Australian wool in animal rights row | publisher=''[[BBC]]'' |date=20 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-11-07 |first=Sue |last=Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] a [[Domestic sheep|ewe]] which had suffered several [[flystrike]]s, Mules's hand slipped and his [[Blade shearing|blade shears]] removed some skin from her hind end. Mules noticed that this prevented the occurrence of flystrike. The procedure was refined, experimented with, and demonstrated to reduce flystrike. It was approved for use in Australia in the 1930s. In Australia, it is thought that the fly primarily responsible for flystrike, ''[[Lucilia cuprina]]'', was introduced from South Africa in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="AWI Blowfly"&gt;{{cite book |title = Battling the blowfly – plan for the future |url = http://www.wool.com.au/mediaLibrary/attachments/Publications/insight_Blowfly_211106.pdf |format = pdf |date = 3 June 2006 |accessdate = 2007-01-09 |ISBN = 1-920908-21-8 |author = Jules Dorrian |publisher = Australian Wool Innovation |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907064910/http://www.wool.com.au/mediaLibrary/attachments/Publications/insight_Blowfly_211106.pdf |archivedate = 7 September 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, mulesing was carried out on sheep after they were [[wean]]ed because it was considered "too rough" for lambs. However, lambs appear to cope with the procedure better than older sheep as the actual area of [[skin fold]] removed on young lambs is quite small, and they are protected for an extra year as well. For young lambs older than two months, the discomfort period seems to last for approximately two weeks by which time healing is almost, if not entirely, complete. Current codes of practice ban mulesing for sheep over 12 months of age.&lt;ref name = "Model Code" /&gt;

==Method==
Mulesing is a procedure which, in Australia, is carried out by a person who has completed the mandatory accreditation and training programme, usually a professional mulesing contractor.&lt;ref name = "Model Code"/&gt;

While the lamb is under restraint (typically in a marking cradle), the wrinkled skin in the animal's breech ([[rump (animal)|rump]] area) is cut away from the perianal region down to the top of the hindlimbs. Originally, the procedure was typically performed with modified wool-trimming metal shears, but now there are similar metal shears designed specifically for mulesing. In addition, the tail is docked and the remaining stump is sometimes skinned.&lt;ref name="sheepguide"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sheep Production Guide |last=Livestock &amp; Grain Producers Assoc. |year=1978 |publisher= Macarthur Press |location=Parramatta }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cuts are executed to avoid affecting underlying muscle tissue.

The [[New South Wales]] Department of Primary Industries states in the Standard Operating Procedures that, "While the operation causes some pain, no pre or post operative pain relief measures are used". [[Antiseptics]], [[anaesthesia]] and [[painkillers]] are not required by Australian law during or after the procedure but are often applied, as the procedure is known to be painful to the animal.&lt;ref name = "Model Code"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "DPI SOP"/&gt; Products have been approved for pain relief during the procedure, including Tri-Solfen. The minor use permit for Tri-Solfen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://permits.apvma.gov.au/PER8660.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009055705/http://permits.apvma.gov.au/PER8660.PDF |archivedate=9 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; makes the product available for use by both veterinarians and sheep industry employees, such as mulesing contractors and graziers.&lt;ref name="AVA 2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ava.com.au/news.php?c=0&amp;action=show&amp;news_id=120 |title = AVA welcomes mulesing pain relief | author = Eddie Ripard | date = 29 August 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-10 | publisher = Australian Veterinary Association |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060927185238/http://www.ava.com.au/news.php?c=0&amp;action=show&amp;news_id=120 |archivedate = 27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a heavy mules, non-wooled skin around the [[anus]] (and [[vulva]] in ewes) is pulled tight, the cut heals and results in smooth scar tissue that does not get fouled by [[feces|fæces]] or [[urine]]. Most sheep have a light mules which does not leave the skin bare, but simply removes the skin wrinkle leaving a reduced area to grow wool and stain.&lt;ref name="sheepguide" /&gt;

When managed according to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the [[CSIRO]], [[domestic sheep|lamb]]s are normally mulesed a few weeks after birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as [[Earmark (agriculture)|ear marking]], [[docking (animal)|tail docking]], and [[vaccination]]. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.

Mulesed lambs should be released onto clean [[pasture]]. The ewes and suckling lambs should receive minimal disturbance until all wounds are completely healed (about four weeks). Observation should be carried out from a distance.&lt;ref name = "Model Code"/&gt;

Mulesing should be completed well before the flystrike season, or else chemical protection should be provided to reduce risk to the lambs and ewes.

Lambs that are slaughtered soon after weaning generally do not need mulesing because they can be protected by chemical treatment for the short time they are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;

==Comparison to crutching==
Mulesing is different from [[crutching]]. Crutching is the mechanical removal of wool around the tail, [[anus]] (and [[vulva]] in ewes) in breeds of sheep with woolly points where this is necessary. Mulesing is the removal of skin to provide permanent resistance to breech strike in [[Merino]] sheep. Other breeds tend to have less loose skin, and wool, so close to the tail and may have less dense wool.

Crutching has to be repeated at regular intervals as the wool grows continuously. Frequent crutching of Merinos reduces the incidence of flystrike, but not as much as mulesing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

At the time mulesing was invented, crutching was done with blade shears. In Australia, these have been almost universally replaced with [[sheep shearing|machine shears]]. Hand shears were being used when Mules inadvertently carried out the procedure during crutching. Mulesing would not inadvertently occur using modern machine shears.

==Opposition to mulesing==
Some [[animal rights]] activists consider unanesthetised mulesing to be inhumane and unnecessary. They have also argued that mulesing may mask genetic susceptibility to flystrike allowing for genetic weaknesses to be continued.&lt;ref name="Animal Liberation"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mulesing | url=http://www.animalliberation.com.au/issues/mulesing.html | publisher=Animal Liberation (WA) Inc | accessdate=2007-01-09 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121013331/http://www.animalliberation.com.au/issues/mulesing.html | archivedate=21 November 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of mulesing are largely from Australia where severe and often fatal flystrike is common.

In October 2004, American fashion retailer [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.]] responded to pressure from PETA to boycott Australian merino wool due in part to the use of mulesing in Australia. The National Farmers' Federation responded by stating "Abercrombie and Fitch does not use Australian wool".&lt;ref name="AGE_ridicule" /&gt; Then, in December 2008, one of the world's largest retailers, [[Liz Claiborne]], (in which PETA is a shareholder)&lt;ref&gt;Land Newspaper, "PETA pulling Wool", p. 18, Rural Press, Richmond, 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; banned the use of Australian Merino wool in its products in opposition to the mulesing practice, at the time an Australian Wool Innovations spokesman said "the company did not purchase any Australian wool".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sl.farmonline.com.au/news/nationalrural/wool/general/peta-claims-another-retailer-joins-wool-boycott/1388691.aspx PETA claims another retailer joins wool boycott] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106062628/http://sl.farmonline.com.au/news/nationalrural/wool/general/peta-claims-another-retailer-joins-wool-boycott/1388691.aspx |date=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, British department store chain John Lewis joined the wool boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/uk-retailer-bans-aussie-mulesing-wool-20100621-yrn9.html|title=UK retailer bans Aussie mulesing wool|date= 21 June 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Petrina|last=Berry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international fashion retailer New Look also refuses to stock products made from Australian Merino wool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlookgroup.com/sites/default/files/attachments/animal_protection_and_product_testing_policy_0.pdf New Look Animal Welfare and Animal Protection Policy] 9 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign by PETA also seeks to draw attention to Australia's [[live export|live sheep export trade]].

Australian interior furnishing wholesaler Instyle Contract Textiles endorses the cessation of mulesing. In early 2008, the company signed an exclusive worldwide agreement with The SRS Company to source wool from non-mulesed Merino sheep that have been bred specifically to be naturally resistant to [[flystrike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instyle.com.au/news/news_mulesing.html|title=LIFE Textiles + Etheco Wool - Instyle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staton, J: "Ethical Wool Emerging, but what is it?", p. 23, Australian Farm Journal, September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy reignited after a television programme aired in [[Sweden]]. This programme alleged that a lobbying consultant, Kevin Craig, acting on behalf of the Australian Wool and Sheep Industry Taskforce offered a Swedish activist a free trip to Australia if the activist agreed not to go on camera nor do an interview. As a consequence, all clothing manufacturers and retailers in Sweden banned the purchase of wool from sheep that have been mulesed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Since then, the Swedish Agriculture Minister, Eskil Erlandsson, has said that "he was satisfied that Australia appeared to be responding to international concerns about mulesing and that bans or boycotts were not necessary". "But in the long run we hope there is going to be a final end to all sorts of mulesing."&lt;ref name="wool-industry-granted-reprieve" /&gt;

Some European retailers have agreed to lift their ban on Australian merino wool if pain relief is used during mulesing. The retailers have not been named in an effort to avoid any backlash.&lt;ref name="wool-industry-granted-reprieve" /&gt;

In order to help comply with the 2010 deadline to phase out mulesing, Western Australia's governmental research stations ceased mulesing their sheep on 1 April 2008.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA mulesing ends in three weeks |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23349611-5005961,00.html |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315045211/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23349611-5005961,00.html |archivedate=15 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) has pledged to phase out mulesing by 2010, but PETA has accused the Australian wool industry of trying to extend this deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2008/11/26/29891_latest-news.html|title=PETA warns on mulesing delay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 2009, the Australian wool industry dumped its long-standing pledge to phase out mulesing by the end of 2010, a move that was harshly criticized by animal welfare groups and led to criticism by some farmers.&lt;ref name="AGE"&gt;{{cite news | title=Mulesing deadline abandoned| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/mulesing-deadline-abandoned-20090727-dytn.html | publisher=[[The Age]] | date=28 July 2009 | accessdate=2009-07-28 | location=Melbourne | first=Darren | last=Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AWI maintains that pursuing a deadline approach to eliminating mulesing was not based on "sound health and welfare science" and risked a serious deterioration in the welfare of sheep. Alternative methods of mulesing, such as using clips and intradermals, were "not sufficiently developed to support a wholesale cessation of the procedure in 2010", AWI said.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news | title=Wool industry abandons mulesing deadline| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/wool-industry-abandons--mulesing-deadline-20090728-dzxr.html |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=28 July 2009 | accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present (2011) approach of AWI is that it "supports all woolgrowers in their choice of best practice animal health and hygiene in flystrike control", including the practice of mulesing without pain relief,&lt;ref name="AWI on flystrike prevention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wool.com/Grow_Animal-Health_Flystrike-prevention.htm|title=Page Not Found - Wool.com - Australian Wool Innovation|website=www.wool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but aims to provide animal welfare improvements such as pain relief and antiseptics.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to mulesing must meet health standards for both the lamb and its handlers in addition to being safe for consumption as [[mutton|meat]] or [[wool|textile]].

===Breeding programs===
Merino sheep bred on selection principles may be more resistant to flystrike because they are plain bodied (lower skin wrinkling around the breech). Studies have shown that flystrike is lower in plain bodied sheep. However, mulesed animals had consistently lower flystrike than unmulesed regardless of body type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The resistance of plain-bodied Merino sheep to flystrike arose from field investigations by Australian scientists, Drs H.R. Seddon and H.B. Belschner, in the early 1930s. Non-mulesed Merino ewe bodies were graded as plain (A class), wrinkly (B class) and very wrinkly (C class). The plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes were much less susceptible to flystrike than wrinkly-bodied Merinos (B and C class).

In these Merino flocks, the sheep are plainer than the plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes and therefore more resistant to flystrike. The rams and semen from these studs are used in over 3,000 of the 45,000 Merino farms in Australia.  Using breeding principles, wrinkle-skinned Merino flocks which require mulesing have been transformed into plain-bodied and mules-free flocks within five years.&lt;ref name=ABC-2007-04&gt;{{cite web

===Non-surgical alternatives===
Several non-surgical alternatives are currently being researched:

* Insecticides: Any number of insecticides are now available for prevention of fly strike.&lt;ref&gt;"Insecticide works better than mulesing" ABC Rural News http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/news/content/201301/s3674132.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and even early reviews proclaimed the effectiveness of using dip across the whole animal, rather than cutting one small portion that left the rest of the animal still susceptible "dipping is still the most cost effective means of protecting sheep from flystrike". &lt;ref&gt;Heath (1994) quoted in CJC Phillips research in Animal Welfare 2009"A review of mulesing and other methods to control flystrike (cutaneous myiasis) in sheep" https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:233179/UQ233179_fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Topical protein-based treatments which kill wool follicles and tighten skin in the breech area (''intradermal injections'')&lt;ref name="AWI Alternatives"&gt;{{cite web | title = Alternatives to mulesing | url = http://www.wool.com.au/Animal_Health/Alternatives_to_mulesing/page__2050.aspx | work = Animal Health | publisher = Australian Wool Innovation | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108103310/http://www.wool.com.au/Animal_Health/Alternatives_to_mulesing/page__2050.aspx | archivedate = 8 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biological control of [[Blow-fly|blowflies]].&lt;ref name="AWI Blowfly"/&gt;
* Plastic clips on the sheep's skin folds which act like castration bands, removing the skin (''breech clips'').&lt;ref name="AWI Alternatives"/&gt;
* [[Tea tree oil]] as a 1% formulation dip where tests have shown a 100% kill rate of first stage maggots and a strong repellent effect against adult flies, which prevented eggs being laid on the wool for up to six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tea tree oil beats fly strike and sheep lice | url = http://sl.farmonline.com.au/news/state/livestock/sheep/tea-tree-oil-beats-fly-strike-and-sheep-lice/2430626.aspx | work = Animal Health | publisher = Stock &amp; Land | accessdate = 2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''doctrine of nondelegation''' is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] or [[wikt:implicit|implicit]] in all written [[constitution]]s that impose a strict structural [[separation of powers]]. It is usually applied in questions of constitutionally improper delegations of powers of any of the three branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities. Although it is usually constitutional for executive officials to delegate executive powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.

==Australia==

[[Federalism in Australia|Australian federalism]] does not permit the federal Parliament or Government to delegate its powers to state or territorial parliaments or governments, nor territorial parliaments or governments to delegate their powers to the federal Parliament or Government, but the states parliaments delegate its powers to the federal parliament by means of section 51 subsection (xxxvii) of the Constitution Act 1901.

==Canada==

[[Canadian federalism]] does not permit Parliament or the provincial legislatures to delegate their powers to each other.

==United States==

In the [[Federal Government of the United States]], the ''nondelegation doctrine'' is the principle that the [[Congress of the United States]], being vested with "all legislative powers" by [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 1 of the [[United States Constitution]], cannot delegate that power to anyone else.  However, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an [[Implied powers|implied power]] of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an "[[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]] principle" to guide the executive branch: "'In determining what Congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch, the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the government co-ordination.' So long as Congress 'shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.'"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'' (1989), citing ''[[J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States]]'', 276 U.S. 394, 406, 48 S.Ct. 348, 351(1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is an agency in the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]] created by Congress with the power to regulate [[food]] and [[approved drug|drugs]] in the United States. Congress has given the FDA a broad mandate to ensure the safety of the public and prevent [[false advertising]], but it is up to the agency to assess risks and announce prohibitions on harmful additives, and to determine the process by which actions will be brought based on the same. Similarly, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has been given the responsibility of collecting taxes that are assessed under the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Although Congress has determined the amount of the tax to be assessed, it has delegated to the IRS the authority to determine how such taxes are to be collected. [[Independent agencies of the United States government|Administrative agencies]] like these are sometimes referred to as the [[Fourth Branch]] of government.

===Case law===
The origins of the nondelegation doctrine, as interpreted in U.S., can be traced back to, at least, 1690, when [[John Locke]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Legislative  transfer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated Power from the People, they, who have it, cannot pass it over to others. . . . And when the people have said, We will submit to rules, and be govern'd by Laws made by such Men, and in such Forms, no Body else can say other Men shall make Laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any Laws but such as are Enacted by those, whom they have Chosen, and Authorised to make Laws for them. The power of the Legislative being derived from the People by a positive voluntary Grant and Institution, can be no other, than what the positive Grant conveyed, which being only to make Laws, and not to make Legislators, the Legislative can have no power to transfer their Authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise of Civil Government]] (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of nondelegation was ''Wayman v. Southard'' (1825).&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=23&amp;invol=1 FindLaw.com ''Wayman v. Southard'' decision tesxt]&lt;/ref&gt; Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe [[Due process|judicial procedure]]; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between "important" subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that "a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details." In 1892, the Court in ''Field v. Clark'', 143 U.S. 649, noted "That congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution"&lt;ref name="field"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&amp;court=us&amp;vol=143&amp;invol=649 FindLaw.com ''Field v. Clark'' decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; while holding that the tariff-setting authority delegated in the [[McKinley Tariff|McKinley Act]] "was not the making of law," but rather empowered the executive branch to serve as a "mere agent" of Congress.&lt;ref name="field"/&gt;

During the 1930s, Congress provided the executive branch with wide powers to combat the [[Great Depression]]. The Supreme Court case of ''[[Panama Refining v. Ryan]]'', [[Case citation|293 U.S. 388]] (1935) involved the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], which included a provision granting the [[President of the United States|President]] the authority to prohibit the interstate shipment of [[petroleum]] in excess of certain quotas. In the ''Panama Refining'' case, however, the Court struck down the provision on the ground that Congress had set "no criterion to govern the President's course."

Other provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act were also challenged. In ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'' (1935), the Supreme Court considered a provision which permitted the President to approve trade codes, drafted by the businesses themselves, so as to ensure "fair competition." The Supreme Court found that, since the law sets no explicit guidelines, businesses "may roam at will and the President may approve or disapprove their proposal as he may see fit." Thus, they struck down the relevant provisions of the Recovery Act.

In the 1989 case ''[[Mistretta v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.buffalo.edu/Academics/courses/631/eemeid/materials/Mistretta.htm ''Mistretta v. United States decision text]&lt;/ref&gt; the Court stated that:

{{quote|Applying this "intelligible principle" test to congressional delegations, our jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society, replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives. Accordingly, this Court has deemed it "constitutionally sufficient" if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority.}}

Only rarely has the Supreme Court invalidated laws as violations of the nondelegation doctrine. Exemplifying the Court's legal reasoning on this matter, it ruled in the 1998 case ''[[Clinton v. City of New York]]'' that the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]], which authorized the President to selectively void portions of [[appropriation bill]]s, was a violation of the [[Presentment Clause]], which sets forth the formalities governing the passage of legislation. Although the Court noted that the attorneys prosecuting the case had extensively discussed the nondelegation doctrine, the Court declined to consider that question. However, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], in a [[concurring opinion]], wrote that he would have found the statute to violate the exclusive responsibility for laws to be made by Congress.

===Original Sixteenth Amendment===

The original [[United_States_Bill_of_Rights|Bill of Rights]] approved by the House of Representatives included a Sixteenth Article, which stated that "(t)he powers delegated by the Constitution to the government of the United States, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the powers vested in the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive the powers vested in the Legislative or Judicial; nor the Judicial the powers vested in the Legislative or Executive." This article was not included in subsequent versions of the Articles or in the final Amendments.

{{Politics of the Philippines}}

The '''Overseas Absentee Voting Act''', officially known as '''Republic Act No. 9189''', is a [[list of Philippine laws|law]] in the [[Philippines]] passed on February 4, 2003 which provides for a system for citizens of the [[Philippines]] currently residing or working outside of the Philippines to vote in an election.&lt;ref name="law"&gt;{{cite web | title=Republic Act No. 9189| url= http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2003/ra_9189_2003.html| work=Twelfth Congress Second Regular Session| accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This act was a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2104 and House Bill No. 3570, the first draft was authored in congress on July 22, 2002. The act is implemented by the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) with the help of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] (DFA).

==Eligible positions==
A registered overseas absentee voter may vote for the following positions:&lt;ref name="law"/&gt;
*[[President of the Philippines|President]] (only in presidential election years)
*[[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice president]] (only in presidential election years)
*[[Senate of the Philippines|Senators]]
*[[Sectoral representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Party-list representatives]] (The party is the one being voted)

==Eligibility==
R.A. 9189 states that all [[Philippines|Filipino]] citizens abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Overseas Absentee voting| url= http://www.philippineembassy-usa.org/Information%20on%20OAV.pdf| work=Foreign Services of the Philippines| accessdate=2009-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who are not disqualified by law and at least 18 years old by the time of elections will be entitled to vote. The eligible individuals are required to file their applications personally at the Philippine embassy or consulate nearest their region. They are also required to be holders of a valid Philippine passport with an accomplished overseas absentee voting (OAV) registration form from the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|commission on elections]]. For seafarers a photocopy of their seaman’s book is required. Lastly if the individual availed the citizen retention and reacquisition act (R.A. 9225), they would need to submit their order of approval application for the said act.

==2004 Elections==
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spent a total of 112.71 million pesos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Senate Investigation on low OAV turnout| url= http://www.senate.gov.ph/13th_congress/spot_reports/Oversight%20Absentee%20Voting_dec1304.pdf | work=Philippine Senate| accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the overseas absentee voters in 2004. The Philippine government put-up 89 registration centers across the globe along with 44 posts in 154 area dedicated for field registration. Data capturing machines were also based at DFA embassies and consulates. The registration period for 7 months was trimmed to 2 months.

The turnout&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Senate Investigation on low OAV turnout| url= http://www.senate.gov.ph/13th_congress/spot_reports/Oversight%20Absentee%20Voting_dec1304.pdf | work=Philippine Senate| accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielded 364,187 registrants where 233,092 went on to vote. The 64 percent turnout rate was lower than what was expected thus prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine senate]] to do a joint congressional inquiry on December 13, 2004, [[Rodolfo Biazon|Sen. Rodolfo Biazon]] was the preceding chairman of the committee. The factors that affected the low turnout were attributed to the following:

*Registration period being shortened by 5 months
*The voting requirements made it difficult for [[Overseas Filipino|overseas Filipino workers (OFW)]] and seafarers who were geographically dispersed in more than 180 countries
*The voting facilities were only limited to 87 polls
*Limited days off at work prevented many from registering
*Cost considerations
*Immigrant disqualification

==2010 Elections==
Preparations for the 2009 registration began as early as April 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mission: Get overseas Pinoys to register and vote| url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/ofw/12/26/08/mission-get-overseas-pinoys-register-and-vote| work=ABS-CBN News| accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where the commissioner of Comelec took charge of the overseas absentee voting process. Comelec held consultations with non-governmental organizations, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the [[Commission on Filipinos Overseas]] (CFO) to ensure that voter turnout in the 2004 elections would not be repeated. A massive information dissemination campaign was also proposed to help out in the information drive. The registration period was postponed to start on February 1, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overseas Registration for 2010 Elections Postponed to 1 February 2009 |url=http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/index.cfm?GPID=241 |work=Embassy of the Philippines |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306121839/http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/index.cfm?GPID=241 |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  instead of the originally planned start date of December 1, 2008, this was done to ensure that the embassies and consulates have enough time to prepare. The registration period ends on August 31, 2009 for a total of almost seven months, two months shorter of the original plan.

Makati Rep. Teodoro "Teddy Boy" Locsin Jr has taken on the initiative to make the necessary amendment to the overseas absentee voting bill. The amendment will take off one of the requirements needed for registration, specifically the affidavit of intent to return which is required of Filipino immigrants to avail of the OAV bill. This takes away the fear of Filipino U.S. green card holders who fear that their residency will be affected by submitting this affidavit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12678">'''Performance-based regulation''' ("PBR") is an approach to [[Public utility|utility]] [[regulation]] designed to strengthen utility performance incentives.  Thus defined, the term PBR is synonymous with incentive regulation.  The two most common forms of PBR are award-penalty mechanisms (“APMs”) and multiyear rate plans (“MRPs”).  Both involve mathematical formulas that can lower regulatory cost at the same time that they encourage better performance.  This constitutes a remarkable potential advance in the “technology” of regulation. Economic theorists whose work has supported the development of PBR include Nobel prize-winning economist [[Jean Tirole]].

Implementation of applicable methods of incentive regulation represents a complex problem for regulatory authorities. Therefore, this problem should be analyzed though different aspects, taking into consideration parameters, such as incentive’s mechanism defined by regulatory authorities, enabling thus the development of regulated activity and increase of efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Eraldo Banovac, Ivona Štritof. Analysis of applicable methods of incentive regulation in the field of distribution of electricity. WSEAS Transactions on Systems, Vol. 4, Issue 8, 2005, pp. 1224-1232. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Award Penalty Mechanisms==

An APM is designed to strengthen performance incentives in targeted areas.  It is sometimes for this reason called a targeted performance incentive.  Basic components of such mechanisms include a key performance indicator (called an “output” in Britain), a performance appraisal that compares the utility’s value for the indicator to a benchmark value, and a mechanism for adjusting utility rates to reflect the performance appraisal.  Here are some common performance areas targeted by APMs.

*Reliability (e.g. [[SAIDI]], [[SAIFI]])
*Other customer service dimensions (e.g. telephone response time)
*[[Energy demand management|Demand-side management]] (e.g. estimated net benefits)
*Cost (e.g. cost/dkth of gas procured)

APMs targeting cost are often used to bolster incentives when a regulatory system features a mechanism, such as a fuel cost adjustment clause, that is believed to weaken cost containment incentives.

==Multiyear Rate Plans==

MRPs are the most common approach to PBR around the world.  An MRP features a moratorium on rate cases which typically lasts three to five years. An attrition relief mechanism (“ARM”) adjusts rates or revenues automatically between rate cases to reflect inflation and other changes in business conditions. Some costs are typically addressed separately using cost trackers.  Some MRPs feature earnings sharing mechanisms that share surplus or deficit earnings between the utility and customers when the return on equity deviates from its target.  Plans may also feature an efficiency carryover mechanism that incentivizes long term performance gains and discourages the opportunistic timing of expenses by permitting the utility to keep a share of cost savings (or absorb a share of high costs) when rates are trued up to cost at the end of the plan.

Since infrequent rate cases lessen concerns about cost allocations and cross-subsidies, MRPs can permit regulators to sanction greater marketing flexibility.  Most MRPs also include APMs to balance incentives for cost containment with incentives to pursue other goals (e.g. reliability or energy conservation) that matter to customers.

The design of the ARM is a key issue in a proceeding to approve an MRP.  Several approaches to ARM design are well established.

*An index-based ARM is developed using industry price and productivity research and is calibrated to produce superior returns for superior productivity performance.  This approach was developed in the United States but is more popular today in Canada and countries overseas.  US utilities that have operated under index-based ARMs include Boston Gas, Central Maine Power, [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]], [[Southern California Gas Company|Southern California Gas]], and [[NSTAR (company)|NSTAR]].
*A stairstep ARM increases revenue by a certain percentage each year, with the percentages set in advance.  This gives allowed revenue a stairstep trajectory.  This is currently the most popular approach to ARM design in the United States.  It is currently used by utilities in California, Georgia, Colorado, North Dakota, and New York.
*Two hybrid approaches to ARM design have been widely used.  In North America, the allowance for O&amp;M expenses may be indexed, while the allowance for capital cost has a stairstep trajectory. This approach to ARM design was developed in California, where the frequency of general rate cases has been limited since the 1980s.  It is currently used in the MRP of [[Southern California Edison]].  In Britain, a multiyear cost forecast is approved and a revenue cap index with an RPI – X formula (RPI is the retail price index) is chosen that yields equivalent net present value.  A similar approach to ARM design is used in Australia.

==Precedents==
In North America, MRPs have been especially popular where utilities need marketing flexibility.  Such plans have helped railroads, oil pipelines, and telecommunications utilities provide a complex array of services to markets with diverse competitive pressures from a common set of assets. Most of these plans featured index-based ARMs called "price caps".  Early papers encouraging the use of input price and productivity research in ARM design include Sudit (1979) and [[William Baumol|Baumol]] (1982).

MRPs are also favored for energy distributors in most populous provinces of Canada and are increasingly popular for gas and electric utilities in the United States.

Overseas, the privatization of many utilities in the last 20 years has forced governments to choose a regulatory system. The majority have chosen MRPs over cost of service regulation. Regulators in Britain, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand are recognized MRP leaders.

The British approach to MRP design dates back to the early 1980s.  The latest version of this approach, called "RIIO" (Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), has been implemented for gas and power transmission utilities and will begin for power distributors in 2015.  The heart of the RIIO system is an MRP, which the British call a "price control".  A revenue cap ARM has an RPI - X formula.  The typical plan term is 8 years.   Since the ARM is based on multiyear cost forecasts, the regulator must carefully review utility business plans.  Statistical benchmarking and independent engineering studies loom large in cost appraisals.  30 months is typically required to process a RIIO application.  There are APMs for a wide range of outputs.  Special cost trackers fund innovative projects.

==Outlook==
Recent developments have increased the potential usefulness of MRPs in US electric utility regulation.
 
*Slower volume growth due to conservation, slow economic growth, and increased [[distributed generation]] has reduced the “gravy” many utilities relied on in the past to help finance cost growth.
*Natural gas-fired technologies have replaced solid-fuel technologies as the low cost choice for incremental generating capacity.
*Vertically integrated electric utilities need fewer plant additions, and those that they do need are smaller than in the past.
*Some utilities are engaged in accelerated modernization of distribution systems that involve high levels of capital expenditure for several years.
*Diffusion of “[[smart grid]]” technologies creates opportunities for new products and services.
*Some customers will pay a premium for better quality service.

Under cost of service regulation, utilities will respond to these conditions by filing rate cases more frequently and requesting additional marketing flexibility.  Frequent rate cases raise regulatory cost and weaken utility cost containment incentives.  The recurrent issues of cost allocation and cross-subsidies will incline regulators to discourage desired marketing flexibility.

RIIO has recently been touted as a promising approach to regulating US electric utilities in an era of smart grid innovations and increased distributed generation.  Advantages of the RIIO approach include the mandatory consideration of multiyear investment strategies.  However, many components of RIIO (e.g. MRPs and APMs) are already widely used in America, and Americans have developed their own approaches to addressing certain regulatory challenges.  For example, integrated resource planning has been used for years in some states, and planning can be extended to incorporate DG and smart grid innovations.  Shared savings incentives have long been used for utility conservation programs and can be extended to distributed generation.  There is a long tradition of "pilot" projects to encourage innovation.  Alternative approaches to ARM design are more familiar and can lower implementation costs.

==Alternative definition==

PBR is sometimes defined more narrowly as that subset of IR in which mechanisms are calibrated using statistical research to yield superior (or inferior) returns for superior (or inferior) performance.  One example of PBR that conforms to this definition is an MRP with an index-based ARM that is calibrated so that utilities earn superior (inferior) returns for productivity growth exceeding (falling short of) the industry norm.  Another example is an APM for reliability that uses a benchmark reflecting industry norms.

Such approach is called [[regulatory benchmarking]]. If properly applied, benchmarking presents new incentives for a regulated
firms to behave efficiently. However, regulatory benchmarking is subject to many issues. For instance, regulated companies may be motivated to short-term savings which result in postponement of investments, which may result in the deterioration of quality of service. Also, the quality of data is crucial.&lt;ref name="Machek 2014"&gt;Machek, O., Hnilica, J.

[[File:HH Polizeihauptmeister MZ.jpg|thumb|[[Landespolizei|German State Police]] officer in [[Hamburg]], with the rank of ''Polizeihauptmeister mit Zulage'' (Confirmed Police Sergeant Major)]]

A '''police''' force is a constituted body of persons empowered by a [[State (polity)|state]] to [[law enforcement|enforce the law]], to protect people and property, and to prevent [[crime]] and [[civil disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =The Role and Responsibilities of the Police| publisher = Policy Studies Institute |url =http://www.psi.org.uk/publications/archivepdfs/Role%20pol/INDPOL-0.P.pdf|accessdate =2009-12-22|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their powers include the [[Arrest|power of arrest]] and the [[Monopoly of violence|legitimized use of force]]. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a [[sovereign state]] that are authorized to exercise the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from [[military]] or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, [[gendarmerie]] are military units charged with civil policing. The police force is usually a public sector service, funded through taxes.

Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Walker| first =Samuel| title =A Critical History of Police Reform: The Emergence of Professionalism| publisher =Lexington Books| year =1977| location =Lexington, MT| page =143| isbn = 978-0-669-01292-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Neocleous| first =Mark| title =Fabricating Social Order: A Critical History of Police Power| publisher =Pluto Press| year =2004| location = | pages =93–94| isbn = 978-0-7453-1489-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the [[class system]] and the protection of [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Larry J. |title=Criminology |pages=515, 516 |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2005}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=PRmhu3M2jv8C&amp;pg=PA515&amp;lpg=PA515&amp;dq=police+american+colonies&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Dxk8AuzQR6&amp;sig=KokKB0NmB0Gs5DWxF3Jl3OhQQcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt; Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies. Some are involved to varying degrees in [[police corruption|corruption]], [[police brutality]] and the enforcement of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian rule]].

Alternative names for a police force include [[constabulary]], [[gendarmerie]], police department, police service, [[crime prevention]], protective services, [[law enforcement agency]], [[Civil Guard (disambiguation)|civil guard]] or [[Civic Guard (disambiguation)|civic guard]]. Members may be referred to as [[police officer]]s, [[Trooper (police rank)|troopers]], [[sheriff]]s, [[constable]]s, [[ranger (disambiguation)|ranger]]s, [[peace officer]]s or civic/civil guards. The word police is most universal and can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/06/prints_of_persia.html|title=Prints of Persia|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=2009-06-17|work=Slate|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As police are often interacting with individuals, [[slang]] terms are numerous. Many [[List of slang terms for police officers|slang terms for police officers]] are decades or centuries old with lost etymology.  One of the oldest, "cop", has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession.&lt;ref&gt;Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, 1999 CD edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the early 15th century, initially in a range of senses encompassing '(public) policy; state; public order', the word ''police'' comes from [[Middle French]] ''police'' ('public order, administration, government'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/146823|website=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from Latin ''politia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpolitia politia], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which is the Latinisation of the Greek πολιτεία (''politeia''), "citizenship, administration, civil polity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitei%2Fa πολιτεία],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; This is derived from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), "city".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flis πόλις], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of criminal justice}}

===Ancient policing===
Law enforcement in [[History of China|ancient China]] was carried out by "prefects" for thousands of years since it developed in both the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] kingdoms of the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having limited authority and employment period. They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their "prefecture", or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were "subprefects" who helped collectively with law enforcement in the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Prefects could also be women.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Jake. "UC Davis East Asian Studies". University of California, Davis. [http://eastasian.ucdavis.edu/research.htm UCdavis.edu]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007143652/http://eastasian.ucdavis.edu/research.htm |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the "prefecture system" spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan.

In [[ancient Greece]], publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police. In [[Athens]], a group of 300 [[Scythian]] slaves (the {{lang|grc|ῥαβδοῦχοι}}, "rod-bearers") was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for [[crowd control]], and also assisted with dealing with [[criminals]], handling prisoners, and making arrests. Other duties associated with modern policing, such as investigating crimes, were left to the citizens themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hunter| first =Virginia J.| title =Policing Athens: Social Control in the Attic Lawsuits, 420-320 B.C.| publisher =Princeton University Press| year =1994| location =Princeton, NJ| page =3| url =http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5349.html| isbn =978-1-4008-0392-7| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070421233311/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5349.html| archivedate =2007-04-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman empire]], the army, rather than a dedicated police organization, provided security. Local watchmen were hired by cities to provide some extra security. Magistrates such as ''[[Procurator Fiscal|procurators fiscal]]'' and ''[[quaestor]]s'' investigated crimes. There was no concept of public prosecution, so victims of crime or their families had to organize and manage the prosecution themselves.

Under the reign of [[Augustus]], when the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants, 14 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] were created; the wards were protected by seven squads of 1,000 men called ''"[[vigiles]]"'', who acted as firemen and nightwatchmen. Their duties included apprehending thieves and robbers and capturing runaway slaves. The vigiles were supported by the [[Urban Cohort]]s who acted as a heavy-duty anti-riot force and even the [[Praetorian Guard]] if necessary.

===Medieval policing===
[[File:Jakobsweg - Pilger 1568 - Hurden IMG 5664.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|left|The [[Santa Hermandad]]es of medieval Spain were formed to protect pilgrims on the [[Camino de Santiago]].]]
In medieval [[Spain]], ''[[Santa Hermandad]]es'', or "holy brotherhoods", peacekeeping associations of armed individuals, were a characteristic of municipal life, especially in [[Castile and León|Castile]]. As medieval Spanish kings often could not offer adequate protection, protective municipal leagues began to emerge in the twelfth century against [[banditry]] and other rural criminals, and against the lawless [[nobility]] or to support one or another claimant to a crown.

These organizations were intended to be temporary, but became a long-standing fixture of Spain. The first recorded case of the formation of an ''hermandad'' occurred when the towns and the peasantry of the north united to police the pilgrim road to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and protect the pilgrims against robber knights.

Throughout the Middle Ages such alliances were frequently formed by combinations of towns to protect the roads connecting them, and were occasionally extended to political purposes. Among the most powerful was the league of North Castilian and Basque ports, the [[Hermandad de las marismas]]: [[Kingdom of Toledo|Toledo]], [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], and [[Villarreal]].

As one of their first acts after end of the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] in 1479, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the centrally-organized and efficient ''Holy Brotherhood'' as a national police force. They adapted an existing brotherhood to the purpose of a general police acting under officials appointed by themselves, and endowed with great powers of summary jurisdiction even in capital cases. The original brotherhoods continued to serve as modest local police-units until their final suppression in 1835.

The [[Vehmic court]]s of Germany provided some policing in the absence of strong state institutions.

In [[France]] during the [[Middle Ages]], there were two [[Great Officers of the Crown of France]] with police responsibilities: The [[Marshal of France]] and the [[Constable of France]]. The military policing responsibilities of the Marshal of France were delegated to the Marshal's provost, whose force was known as the Marshalcy because its authority ultimately derived from the Marshal. The marshalcy dates back to the [[Hundred Years' War]], and some historians trace it back to the early 12th century. Another organisation, the [[Constabulary]] (French: Connétablie), was under the command of the [[Constable of France]]. The constabulary was regularised as a military body in 1337. Under [[Francis I of France]] (who reigned 1515–1547), the Maréchaussée was merged with the Constabulary. The resulting force was also known as the Maréchaussée, or, formally, the Constabulary and Marshalcy of France.

The [[England|English]] system of maintaining public order since the Norman conquest was a private system of [[tithing]]s, led by a [[constable]], which was based on a social obligation for the good conduct of the others; more common was that local lords and nobles were responsible for maintaining order in their lands, and often appointed a [[constable]], sometimes unpaid, to enforce the law. There was also a system investigative "[[jury|juries]]".

The [[Assize of Arms of 1252]], which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms, quell [[breach of the peace|breaches of the peace]], and to deliver offenders to the [[sheriff]]s or [[reeve (England)|reeves]], is cited as one of the earliest creation of the English police.&lt;ref name="police1889"&gt;{{cite book | title= Police! | last1= Clarkson | first1= Charles Tempest | last2= Richardson | first2= J.

From about 1500, private watchmen were funded by private individuals and organisations to carry out police functions. They were later nicknamed 'Charlies', probably after the reigning monarch King Charles II. [[Thief-taker]]s were also rewarded for catching thieves and returning the stolen property.

The first use of the word police ("Polles") in English comes from the book "The Second Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England" published in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_1IzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=police&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T5mvTK6FGomgOrf_vL8F&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=police&amp;f=false |title=The second part of the Institutes of the lawes of England: Containing the exposition of many ancient, and other statutes; whereof you may see the particulars in a table following…|last=Coke|first=Sir Edward |publisher=Printed by M. Flesher and R. Young, for E.D., R.M., W.L. and D.P.|year=1642|page=77|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern policing===
The first centrally organised police force was created by the government of King [[Louis XIV]] in 1667 to police the city of [[Paris]], then the largest city in Europe. The royal edict, registered by the ''[[Parlement]]'' of Paris on March 15, 1667 created the office of ''[[lieutenant général de police]]'' ("lieutenant general of police"), who was to be the head of the new Paris police force, and defined the task of the police as "ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals, purging the city of what may cause disturbances, procuring abundance, and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties".

[[File:Gabriel-Nicolas de la Reynie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], founder of the first uniformed police force in the world.]]
This office was first held by [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]], who had 44 ''commissaires de police'' (police commissioners) under his authority. In 1709, these commissioners were assisted by ''inspecteurs de police'' (police inspectors). The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the ''commissaires'', each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy. The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699, resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities and towns.

After the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoléon I]] reorganized the police in Paris and other cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants on February 17, 1800 as the [[Prefecture of Police]]. On March 12, 1829, a government decree created the first uniformed police in [[France]], known as ''sergents de ville'' ("city sergeants"), which the Paris Prefecture of Police's website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm |title=Bicentenaire: theme expo4 |publisher=prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr |accessdate=2009-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm |archivedate = May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1737, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] began paying some London and Middlesex watchmen with tax monies, beginning the shift to government control. In 1749 [[Henry Fielding]] began organizing a force of quasi-professional constables known as the [[Bow Street Runners]]. The [[Macdaniel affair]] added further impetus for a publicly salaried police force that did not depend on rewards. Nonetheless, In 1828, there were [[private police|privately financed police]] units in no fewer than 45 parishes within a 10-mile radius of London.

The word "police" was [[Loanword|borrowed]] from French into the English language in the 18th century, but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces. The word, and the concept of police itself, were "disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression" (according to ''[[Britannica 1911]]''). Before the 19th century, the first use of the word "police" recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the [[Marine Police Force|Marine Police]] in 1798.

===In London===
[[File:Patrick Colquhoun.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Patrick Colquhoun]], founder of the [[Thames River Police]].]]
In 1797, [[Patrick Colquhoun]] was able to persuade the [[West Indies]] merchants who operated at the [[Pool of London]] on the [[River Thames]], to establish a police force at the docks to prevent rampant theft that was causing annual estimated losses of £500,000 worth of cargo.&lt;ref name=paterson&gt;Dick Paterson, [http://www.thamespolicemuseum.org.uk/h_police_1.html Origins of the Thames Police], ''Thames Police Museum''. Retrieved 4 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a police, as it then existed in [[France]], was considered as a potentially undesirable foreign import. In building the case for the police in the face of England's firm anti-police sentiment, Colquhoun framed the political rationale on economic indicators to show that a police dedicated to crime prevention was "perfectly congenial to the principle of the British constitution". Moreover, he went so far as to praise the French system, which had reached "the greatest degree of perfection" in his estimation.&lt;ref name=critchley&gt;T. A. Critchley, ''A History of Police in England and Wales'', 2nd edition. Montclair, NJ: Patterson Smith, 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:No Police!! Well Done Aberystwyth Boys 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Poster against "detested" Police at the town of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]]; April 1850.]]
 
With the initial investment of £4,200, the new trial force of the [[Thames River Police]] began with about 50 men charged with policing 33,000 workers in the river trades, of whom Colquhoun claimed 11,000 were known criminals and "on the game". The force was a success after its first year, and his men had "established their worth by saving £122,000 worth of cargo and by the rescuing of several lives". Word of this success spread quickly, and the government passed the Marine Police Bill on 28 July 1800, transforming it from a private to public police agency; now the oldest police force in the world. Colquhoun published a book on the experiment, ''The Commerce and Policing of the River Thames''. It found receptive audiences far outside London, and inspired similar forces in other cities, notably, [[New York City]], [[Dublin]], and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=paterson/&gt;

Colquhoun's utilitarian approach to the problem – using a [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit]] argument to obtain support from businesses standing to benefit – allowed him to achieve what [[Henry Fielding|Henry]] and [[John Fielding]] failed for their Bow Street detectives. Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36618/police  "Police: The formation of the English Police"], Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007. Retrieved 6 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His other contribution was the concept of [[preventive policing]]; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames.&lt;ref name=critchley/&gt; Colquhoun's innovations were a critical development leading up to [[Robert Peel]]'s "new" police three decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/1639/Police-History-beginning-modern-policing-in-England.html|title=Police: History - The Beginning Of "modern" Policing In England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the authorities in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] successfully petitioned the government to pass the [[Glasgow Police Act 1800|Glasgow Police Act]] establishing the [[City of Glasgow Police]] in 1800. Other Scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotia-news.com/issue5/ISSUE05a.htm |title=Glasgow Police |work=Scotia-news.com |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716173010/http://www.scotia-news.com/issue5/ISSUE05a.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ireland]], the Irish Constabulary Act of 1822 marked the beginning of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]. The Act established a force in each barony with [[chief constable]]s and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at [[Dublin Castle]]. By 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men.

====Metropolitan police force====
[[File:A "Peeler" of the Metropolitan Police Service in the 1850s.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A Peeler of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] in the 1850s.]]
London was fast reaching a size unprecedented in world history, due to the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Costello |url=http://www.nettlesworth.durham.sch.uk/time/victorian/vindust.html |title=Industrial Revolution |publisher=Nettlesworth.durham.sch.uk |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501202603/http://www.nettlesworth.durham.sch.uk/time/victorian/vindust.html |archivedate=May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that the locally maintained system of volunteer constables and "watchmen" was ineffective, both in detecting and preventing crime. A parliamentary committee was appointed to investigate the system of policing in [[London]]. Upon [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] being appointed as [[Home Secretary]] in 1822, he established a second and more effective committee, and acted upon its findings.

[[Royal assent]] to the [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] was given&lt;ref name="ndad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/1/detail.html |title=The National Archives &amp;#124; NDAD &amp;#124; Metropolitan Police |publisher=Ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122044922/http://www.ndad.nationalarchives.gov.uk/AH/1/detail.html |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] was established on September 29, 1829 in [[London]] as the first modern and professional police force in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=73|title=Policing Profiles of Participating and Partner States|publisher=POLIS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004148/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=73|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8863085/Modern-Police-Force|title=Modern Police Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A BRIEF GUIDE TO POLICE HISTORY |url=http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/205/205lect04.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908151018/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/205/205lect04.htm |archivedate=September 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peel, widely regarded as the father of modern policing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminologycareers.about.com/od/Criminology_Basics/a/The-History-Of-Modern-Policing.htm|title=The History of Modern Policing: How the Modern Police Force Evolved|author=Timothy Roufa}}&lt;/ref&gt; was heavily influenced by the social and legal philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]], who called for a strong and centralised, but politically neutral, police force for the maintenance of social order, for the protection of people from crime and to act as a visible [[Preventive police|deterrent]] to urban [[crime]] and disorder.&lt;ref name="brodeur284"&gt;{{cite book|last =Brodeur| first =Jean-Paul |editor1=Kevin R.

[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse]]'' (1885–1887), painting by [[Christian Krohg]].]] 
Due to public fears concerning the deployment of the military in domestic matters, Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than [[paramilitary]]. To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red which was then a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheon]] and a [[Ratchet (instrument)|rattle]] to signal the need for assistance. Along with this, [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom|police ranks]] did not include military titles, with the exception of [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. [http://www.constabulary.com/mystery/rattle.htm "The Victorian Police Rattle Mystery"/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218043036/http://www.constabulary.com/mystery/rattle.htm |date=February 18, 2010 }} ''The Constabulary'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

To distance the new police force from the initial public view of it as a new tool of government repression, Peel publicised the so-called [[Peelian principles]], which set down basic guidelines for ethical policing:

* Every [[police officer]] should be issued an [[warrant card]] with a unique identification number to assure accountability for his actions.
* Whether the police are effective is not measured on the number of arrests but on the lack of crime.
* Above all else, an effective authority figure knows trust and accountability are paramount. Hence, Peel's most often quoted principle that "The police are the public and the public are the police."

The 1829 Metropolitan Police Act created a modern police force by limiting the purview of the force and its powers, and envisioning it as merely an organ of the judicial system. Their job was apolitical; to maintain the peace and apprehend criminals for the courts to process according to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYoJQVYwFB8C&amp;dq=bentham+on+policing&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Policing Web|author=Brodeur, Jean-Paul|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was very different to the "[[Continental Europe|continental]] model" of the police force that had been developed in France, where the police force worked within the parameters of the [[absolute monarchy|absolutist state]] as an extension of the authority of the monarch and functioned as part of the governing state.

In 1863, the Metropolitan Police were issued with the distinctive [[custodian helmet]], and in 1884 they switched to the use of whistles that could be heard from much further away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejanuarist.com/joseph-hudson-inventor-of-the-police-and-referee-whistles/|title=Joseph Hudson: Inventor of the Police and Referee Whistles|author=Dan Zambonini|date=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police became a model for the police forces in most countries, such as the [[United States]], and most of the [[British Empire]]. Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.together.gov.uk/article.asp?c=442&amp;aid=1275 |title=Respect - Homepage |publisher=Together.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230202637/http://www.together.gov.uk/article.asp?c=442&amp;aid=1275 |archivedate=December 30, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victorian Police Motorcycle, Geelong, Aust, jjron, 30.9.2010.jpg|thumb|[[Police motorcycle]]s are commonly used for patrols and escorts, as seen here in [[Australia]]]]
In [[Australia]] the first police force having centralised command as well as jurisdiction over an entire colony was the [[South Australia Police]], formed in 1838 under [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].

However, whilst the [[New South Wales Police Force]] was established in 1862, it was made up from a large number of policing and military units operating within the then Colony of New South Wales and traces its links back to the Royal Marines. The passing of the Police Regulation Act of 1862 essentially tightly regulated and centralised all of the police forces operating throughout the Colony of New South Wales.

The [[New South Wales Police Force]] remains the largest police force in Australia in terms of personnel and physical resources. It is also the only police force that requires its recruits to undertake university studies at the recruit level and has the recruit pay for their own education.

====Brazil====
{{Main article|Law enforcement in Brazil}}
[[File:Fnst.jpg|right|thumb|Brazil's [[National Force (Brazil)|National Public Security Force]] (Força Nacional de Segurança Pública)]]
In 1566, the first police investigator of [[Rio de Janeiro]] was recruited. By the 17th century, most [[captaincy|captaincies]] already had local units with law enforcement functions. On July 9, 1775 a [[Minas Gerais Military Police|Cavalry Regiment]] was created in the state of [[Minas Gerais]] for maintaining law and order. In 1808, the Portuguese royal family relocated to Brazil, because of the French invasion of Portugal. [[Dom João VI|King João VI]] established the "Intendência Geral de Polícia" (General Police Intendancy) for investigations. He also created a [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|Royal Police Guard for Rio de Janeiro]] in 1809. In 1831, after independence, each province started organizing its local "[[Military Police (Brazil)|military police]]", with order maintenance tasks. The [[Federal Railroad Police]] was created in 1852, [[Federal Highway Police]], was established in 1928, and [[Federal Police of Brazil|Federal Police]] in 1967.

====Canada====
{{Main article|Law enforcement in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] was founded in 1729, making it the first police force in present-day Canada. It was followed in 1834 by the [[Toronto Police]], and in 1838 by police forces in [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]]. A national force, the [[Dominion Police]], was founded in 1868. Initially the Dominion Police provided security for parliament, but its responsibilities quickly grew. The famous [[Royal Northwest Mounted Police]] was founded in 1873.
The merger of these two police forces in 1920 formed the world-famous [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].

====Lebanon====
In [[Lebanon]], modern police were established in 1861, with creation of the [[Gendarmerie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isf.gov.lb/English/LeftMenu/General+Info/History/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602061225/http://www.isf.gov.lb/English/LeftMenu/General+Info/History/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 2, 2006 |title=Historical overview |publisher=Interior Security Forces (Lebanon) |accessdate=June 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], the police is under the control of respective [[States and union territories of India|States and union territories]] and is known to be under [[State Police Services (India)|State Police Services]] (SPS). The candidates selected for the SPS are usually posted as [[Deputy Superintendent of Police]] or [[Assistant Commissioner of Police]] once their probationary period ends.

====United States====
{{Main article|Law enforcement in the United States}}
In [[British North America]], policing was initially provided by local elected officials. For instance, the New York Sheriff's Office was founded in 1626, and the [[Albany County Sheriff's Department (New York)|Albany County Sheriff's Department]] in the 1660s. In the colonial period, policing was provided by elected sheriffs and local militias.

In 1789 the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] was established, followed by other federal services such as the [[United States Park Police|U.S. Parks Police]] (1791)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/uspp/ |title=The history of the Park Police |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Mint Police|U.S. Mint Police]] (1792).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmint.gov/about_the_mint/mint_police/ |title=United States Mint Police |publisher=[[United States Mint]] |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first city police services were established in [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia]] in 1751,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_history.php |title=Department History |publisher=Philadelphia Police Department |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517082302/http://www.ppdonline.org/hq_history.php |archivedate = May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1807,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.richmond.va.us/Police/HistoryPoliceDepartment.aspx |title=History of the Richmond Police Department |publisher=City of Richmond |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston]] in 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/police/about/history.asp |title=A Brief History of The B.P.D. |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304222909/http://www.cityofboston.gov/police/about/history.asp |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York City|New York]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/New+York+City+Police+Department |title=New York City Police Department |newspaper=New York Daily News |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118042703/http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Secret Service]] was founded in 1865 and was for some time the main investigative body for the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml |title=Secret Service History |publisher=[[United States Secret Service]] |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219142622/http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml |archivedate=February 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[American Old West]], policing was often of very poor quality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The Army often provided some policing alongside poorly resourced [[sheriff]]s and temporarily organized [[posse comitatus (common law)|posses]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Public organizations were supplemented by private contractors, notably the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]], which was hired by individuals, businessmen, local governments and the federal government. At its height, the Pinkerton Agency's numbers exceeded those of the [[United States Army]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In recent years, in addition to federal, state, and local forces, some [[Special district (United States)|special districts]] have been formed to provide extra police protection in designated areas. These districts may be known as neighborhood improvement districts, crime prevention districts, or security districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/govs/go/index.html |title=Lists &amp; Structure of Governments |work=Census.gov |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of theory===
[[Michel Foucault]] claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in [[Public administration]] and [[Statistics]] in the 17th and early 18th centuries, most notably with Nicolas Delamare's ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081112154147/http://cujas.synasoft.fr/page.asp?ouvrage=225 Traité de la Police]'' ("Treatise on the Police"), first published in 1705. The German ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' (Science of Police) first theorized by [[Philipp von Hörnigk]] a 17th-century Austrian [[Political economist]] and civil servant and much more famously by [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] who produced an important theoretical work known as [[Cameral]] science on the formulation of police.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Von Justi see ''Security Territory Population'' p.329 Notes 7 and 8 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault cites [[Magdalene Humpert]] author of ''Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften'' (1937) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however, this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.311-332 p.330 Note 11 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Public Finance|last = Jürgen Backhaus and Richard E. Wagner|first = and |publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers|year = 2005|isbn = |location = |pages = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As conceptualized by the ''Polizeiwissenschaft'', according to Foucault the police had an administrative, economic and social duty ("procuring abundance"). It was in charge of [[demographics|demographic]] concerns and needed to be incorporated within the western political philosophy system of [[raison d'état]] and therefore giving the superficial appearance of empowering the [[population]] (and unwittingly supervising the population), which, according to [[mercantilist]] theory, was to be the main strength of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Thus, its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities and included [[public health]] concerns, [[urban planning]] (which was important because of the [[miasma theory of disease]]; thus, [[cemeteries]] were moved out of town, etc.), and surveillance of [[prices]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault]], ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp. 311–332, 333–361. 1977–78 course published in English, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Jeremy Bentham]], philosopher who advocated for the establishment of preventive police forces and influenced the reforms of Sir [[Robert Peel]].]]
The concept of preventive policing, or policing to deter crime from taking place, gained influence in the late 18th century. Police Magistrate [[John Fielding]], head of the [[Bow Street Runners]], argued that "...it is much better to prevent even one man from being a rogue than apprehending and bringing forty to justice."&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;R. J. Marin, "The Living Law." In eds., W. T. McGrath and M. P. Mitchell, ''The Police Function in Canada''. Toronto: Methuen, 1981, 18-19. {{ISBN|0-458-93920-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]] philosopher, [[Jeremy Bentham]], promoted the views of [[Italy|Italian]] [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Marquis Cesare Beccaria]], and disseminated a translated version of "Essay on Crime in Punishment". Bentham espoused the guiding principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is better to prevent crimes than to punish them. This is the chief aim of every good system of legislation, which is the art of leading men to the greatest possible happiness or to the least possible misery, according to calculation of all the goods and evils of life.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Patrick Colquhoun]]'s influential work, ''A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis'' (1797) was heavily influenced by Benthamite thought. Colquhoun's [[Marine Police Force|Thames River Police]] was founded on these principles, and in contrast to the [[Bow Street Runners]], acted as a deterrent by their continual presence on the riverfront, in addition to being able to intervene if they spotted a crime in progress.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew T. Harris, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20150907073749/https://ohiostatepress.org/Books/Book%20PDFs/Harris%20Policing.pdf Policing the City: Crime and Legal Authority in London, 1780-1840]'' [[PDF]]. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press, 2004, 6. {{ISBN|0-8142-0966-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1829 article, "Preventive police" in the ''London Review'',&lt;ref&gt;Marjie Bloy, "[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chad1.html Edwin Chadwick (1800-1890)]," The Victorian Web.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that prevention ought to be the ''primary'' concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that "A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation." In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - "crime doesn't pay". In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the "object" of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the "principal object," which was the "prevention of crime."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in H. S. Cooper, "The Evolution of Canadian Police." In eds., W. T. McGrath and M. P. Mitchell, ''The Police Function in Canada''. Toronto: Methuen, 1981, 39. {{ISBN|0-458-93920-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later historians would attribute the perception of England's "appearance of orderliness and love of public order" to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel's police system.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reith, "Preventive Principle of Police," ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1931-1951),'' vol. 34, no. 3 (Sept.-Oct. 1943): 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of modern police forces around the world was contemporary to the formation of the state, later defined by sociologist [[Max Weber]] as achieving a "[[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]]" and which was primarily exercised by the police and the [[military]]. [[Marxist]] theory situates the development of the modern state as part of the rise of capitalism, in which the police are one component of the [[bourgeoisie]]'s repressive apparatus for subjugating the [[working class]]. By contrast, the [[Peelian principles]] argue that "the power of the police...is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behavior", a philosophy known as [[policing by consent]].

==Personnel and organization==
Police forces include both preventive (uniformed) police and [[detective]]s. Terminology varies from country to country. Police functions include protecting life and property, enforcing [[criminal law]], criminal investigations, regulating traffic, crowd control, and other public safety duties. Regardless of size, police forces are generally organized as a [[hierarchy]] with multiple [[Police rank|ranks]]. The exact structures and the names of rank vary considerably by country.

===Uniformed police===
[[File:Brazilian Federal Highway Police.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian [[Federal Highway Police]] at work.]]
The police who wear [[uniform]]s make up the majority of a police service's personnel. Their main duty is to respond to calls to the [[emergency telephone number]]. When not responding to these call-outs, they will do work aimed at preventing crime, such as patrols. The uniformed police are known by varying names such as preventive police, the uniform branch/division, administrative police, order police, the patrol bureau/division or patrol. In Australia and the United Kingdom, patrol personnel are also known as "general duties" officers.&lt;ref name="bayley-1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bayley, David H. |title=Police Function, Structure, and Control in Western Europe and North America: Comparative and Historical Studies |journal=Crime &amp; Justice |volume=1 |year=1979 |pages=109–143 |id={{NCJ|63672}} |doi=10.1086/449060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atypically, [[Brazil]]'s preventive police are known as [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policiamilitar.mg.gov.br/_pmmg.htm |title=PMMG |publisher=Policiamilitar.mg.gov.br |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712083616/http://www.policiamilitar.mg.gov.br/_pmmg.htm |archivedate=July 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As implied by the name, uniformed police wear [[uniform]]s. They perform functions that require an immediate recognition of an officer's legal authority and a potential need for force. Most commonly this means intervening to stop a crime in progress and securing the scene of a crime that has already happened. Besides dealing with crime, these officers may also manage and monitor traffic, carry out [[community policing]] duties, maintain order at public events or carry out searches for [[Missing person|missing people]] (in 2012, the latter accounted for 14% of police time in the United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19360824|title=What happens when someone goes missing?|publisher=BBC News|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most of these duties must be available as a [[24/7 service]], uniformed police are required to do [[shift work]].

===Detectives===
[[File:vehicle drug search australia.jpg|thumb|left|[[New South Wales Police Force]] officers search the vehicle of a suspected [[drug smuggler]] at a border crossing. [[Wentworth, New South Wales]], [[Australia]]]]
Police [[detective]]s are responsible for investigations and detective work. Detectives may be called Investigations Police, Judiciary/Judicial Police, and Criminal Police. In the [[UK]], they are often referred to by the name of their department, the [[Criminal Investigation Department|Criminal Investigation Department (CID)]]. Detectives typically make up roughly 15–25% of a police service's personnel.

Detectives, in contrast to uniformed police, typically wear 'business attire' in bureaucratic and investigative functions where a uniformed presence would be either a distraction or intimidating, but a need to establish police authority still exists. "Plainclothes" officers dress in attire consistent with that worn by the general public for purposes of blending in.

In some cases, police are assigned to work "[[undercover]]", where they conceal their police identity to investigate crimes, such as [[organized crime]] or [[narcotic]]s crime, that are unsolvable by other means. In some cases this type of policing shares aspects with [[espionage]].

The relationship between detective and uniformed branches varies by country. In the United States, there is high variation within the country itself. Many US police departments require detectives to spend some time on temporary assignments in the patrol division.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The argument is that rotating officers helps the detectives to better understand the uniformed officers' work, to promote [[cross-training]] in a wider variety of skills, and prevent "cliques" that can contribute to corruption or other unethical behavior.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Conversely, some countries regard detective work as being an entirely separate profession, with detectives working in separate agencies and recruited without having to serve in uniform. A common compromise in English-speaking countries is that most detectives are recruited from the uniformed branch, but once qualified they tend to spend the rest of their careers in the detective branch.

Another point of variation is whether detectives have extra status. In some forces, such as the [[New York Police Department]] and [[Philadelphia Police Department]], a regular detective holds a higher rank than a regular police officer. In others, such as [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police forces]] and [[Law enforcement in Canada|Canadian police forces]], a regular detective has equal status with regular uniformed officers. Officers still have to take exams to move to the detective branch, but the move is regarded as being a specialization, rather than a promotion.

===Volunteers and auxiliary police===
Police services often include part-time or volunteer officers, some of whom have other jobs outside policing. These may be paid positions or entirely volunteer. These are known by a variety of names, such as reserves, [[auxiliary police]] or [[special constables]].

Other volunteer organizations work with the police and perform some of their duties. Groups in the U.S. including [[Retired and Senior Volunteer Program]], [[Community Emergency Response Team]] and the Boy Scout's [[Law Enforcement Exploring|Police Explorers]] provide training, traffic and crowd control, disaster response and other policing duties. In the U.S., the [[Volunteers in Police Service]] program assists over 200,000 volunteers in almost 2,000 programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bja.gov/publications/iacp_vips_resourceguide.pdf Volunteer Programs - enhancing Public safety by leveraging resources], Bureau of Justice Assistance, U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers may also work on the support staff. Examples of these schemes are [[Volunteers in Police Service]] in the US, [[Police Support Volunteers]] in the UK and [[Police Service (Volunteer Police) Amendment Act 1992|Volunteers in Policing]] in New South Wales.

===Specialized units===
[[File:Rakshak.JPG|thumb|After the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], the [[Mumbai Police]] created specialized, quick response teams to deal with terror threats.]]

Specialized preventive and detective groups, or [[Specialist Investigation Department]]s exist within many law enforcement organizations either for dealing with particular types of crime, such as traffic law enforcement and crash investigation, [[homicide]], or [[fraud]]; or for situations requiring specialized skills, such as [[Scuba diving|underwater search]], [[aviation]], [[Bomb disposal|explosive device disposal]] ("[[bomb squad]]"), and [[computer crime]].

Most larger jurisdictions also employ specially selected and trained quasi-[[military]] units armed with military-grade weapons for the purposes of dealing with particularly violent situations beyond the capability of a patrol officer response, including high-risk warrant service and barricaded suspects. In the United States these units go by a [[List of Special Response Units in the United States|variety of names]], but are commonly known as [[SWAT]] (Special Weapons And Tactics) teams.

In [[counterinsurgency]]-type campaigns, select and specially trained units of police armed and equipped as [[light infantry]] have been designated as [[police field force]]s who perform [[paramilitary]]-type patrols and ambushes whilst retaining their police powers in areas that were highly dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;p.Davies, Bruce &amp; McKay, Gary ''The Men Who Persevered:The AATTV'' 2005 Bruce &amp; Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

Because their situational mandate typically focuses on removing innocent bystanders from dangerous people and dangerous situations, not violent resolution, they are often equipped with non-lethal tactical tools like [[chemical agents]], "[[Flashbangs|flashbang]]" and concussion grenades, and rubber bullets. The London Metropolitan police's [[Specialist Firearms Command]] (CO19)&lt;ref&gt;formerly named SO19 {{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/co19/ |title=Metropolitan Police Service - Central Operations, Specialist Firearms unit (CO19) |publisher=Metropolitan Police Service |accessdate=2008-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915102427/http://www.met.police.uk/co19/ |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of armed police used in dangerous situations including hostage taking, armed robbery/assault and terrorism.

===Administrative duties===
Police may have administrative duties that are not directly related to enforcing the law, such as issuing firearms licenses. The extent that police have these functions varies among countries, with police in [[France]], [[Germany]], and other [[continental Europe]]an countries handling such tasks to a greater extent than British counterparts.&lt;ref name="bayley-1979"/&gt;

===Military police===
[[File:RUC PSNI Dungiven.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] barracks in [[Northern Ireland]]. The high walls are to protect against [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] bomb attacks.]]
Military police may refer to:

* a section of the [[military]] solely responsible for policing the [[armed forces]] (referred to as [[Provost (military police)|provosts]])
* a section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population (most [[gendarmerie]]s, such as the [[National Gendarmerie|French Gendarmerie]], the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Carabinieri]], the Spanish [[Guardia Civil]] and the [[Portuguese Republican National Guard]] also known as GNR)
* a section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (such as the [[Romanian Gendarmerie]])
* the civilian preventive police of a [[Brazilian state]] ([[Military Police (Brazil)|Policia Militar]])
* a special military law enforcement service, like the [[Russian Military Police]]

===Religious police===
[[File:Taliban beating woman in public RAWA.jpg|thumb|Two members of the Taliban religious police (Amr bil Ma-roof, or Department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) beating a woman for removing her burqa in public.]]
Some [[Islamic]] societies have [[religious police]], who enforce the application of Islamic [[Sharia law]]. Their authority may include the power to arrest unrelated men and women caught socializing, anyone engaged in homosexual behavior or prostitution; to enforce Islamic dress codes, and store closures [[salat|during Islamic prayer time]].&lt;ref name="asianews.it"&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 Saudi Arabia Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh - Asia News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323184717/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 |date=March 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2399885.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Saudi minister rebukes religious police |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-11-04 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International policing==
Most countries are members of the [[International Criminal Police Organization - Interpol|International Criminal Police Organization]] (Interpol), established to detect and fight transnational crime and provide for international co-operation and co-ordination of other police activities, such as notifying relatives of the death of foreign nationals. Interpol does not conduct investigations or arrests by itself, but only serves as a central point for information on crime, suspects and criminals. [[Political crime]]s are excluded from its competencies.

The terms international policing, transnational policing, and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state (Nadelmann, 1993),&lt;ref name="Nadelmann, E. A. 1993"&gt;Nadelmann, E. A. (1993) Cops Across Borders; the Internationalization of US Law Enforcement, [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Sheptycki, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Sheptycki, J. (1995) 'Transnational Policing and the Makings of a Postmodern State', British Journal of Criminology, 1995, Vol. 35 No. 4 Autumn, pp. 613-635&lt;/ref&gt; These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that, in some sense, transcend national borders. This includes a variety of practices, but international police cooperation, criminal intelligence exchange between police agencies working in different nation-states, and police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states are the three types that have received the most scholarly attention.

Historical studies reveal that policing agents have undertaken a variety of cross-border police missions for many years (Deflem, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, M. (2002) Policing World Society; Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation, Oxford: Calrendon&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 19th century a number of European policing agencies undertook cross-border surveillance because of concerns about anarchist agitators and other political radicals. A notable example of this was the occasional surveillance by [[Prussia]]n police of [[Karl Marx]] during the years he remained resident in London. The interests of public police agencies in cross-border co-operation in the control of political radicalism and ordinary law crime were primarily initiated in Europe, which eventually led to the establishment of [[Interpol]] before the [[Second World War]]. There are also many interesting examples of cross-border policing under private auspices and by municipal police forces that date back to the 19th century (Nadelmann, 1993).&lt;ref name="Nadelmann, E. A. 1993"/&gt; It has been established that modern policing has transgressed national boundaries from time to time almost from its inception. It is also generally agreed that in the post–[[Cold War]] era this type of practice became more significant and frequent (Sheptycki, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Sheptycki, J. (2000) Issues in Transnational Policing, London; Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken. A notable exception is [[James Sheptycki]]'s study of police cooperation in the English Channel region (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Sheptycki, J. (2002) In Search of Transnational Policing, Aldershot: Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work. The study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-Channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned. By 1992, with the signing of the [[Schengen Treaty]], which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the [[European Union]], there were worries that much, if not all, of this intelligence sharing was opaque, raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in Europe (Joubert and Bevers, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Joubert, C. and Bevers, H. (1996) Schengen Investigated; [[The Hague]]: [[Kluwer Law International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of this kind outside of Europe are even rarer, so it is difficult to make generalizations, but one small-scale study that compared transnational police information and intelligence sharing practices at specific cross-border locations in North America and Europe confirmed that low visibility of police information and intelligence sharing was a common feature (Alain, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Alain, M. (2001) 'The Trapeze Artists and the Ground Crew - Police Cooperation and Intelligence Exchange Mechanisms in Europe and North America: A Comparative Empirical Study', Policing and Society, 11/1: 1-28&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence-led policing is now common practice in most advanced countries (Ratcliffe, 2007)&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe, J. 2007"&gt;Ratcliffe, J. (2007) Strategic Thinking in Criminal Intelligence, Annadale, NSW: The Federation Press&lt;/ref&gt; and it is likely that police intelligence sharing and information exchange has a common morphology around the world (Ratcliffe, 2007).&lt;ref name="Ratcliffe, J. 2007"/&gt; James Sheptycki has analyzed the effects of the new information technologies on the organization of policing-intelligence and suggests that a number of 'organizational pathologies' have arisen that make the functioning of security-intelligence processes in transnational policing deeply problematic. He argues that transnational police information circuits help to "compose the panic scenes of the security-control society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Sheptycki, James | year=2007 | title=High Policing in the Security Control Society | journal=Policing | volume=1 | number=1 | pages=70–79 | doi=10.1093/police/pam005 | url=http://policing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/1/1/70 | accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradoxical effect is that, the harder policing agencies work to produce security, the greater are feelings of insecurity.

Police development-aid to weak, failed or failing states is another form of transnational policing that has garnered attention. This form of transnational policing plays an increasingly important role in [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] and this looks set to grow in the years ahead, especially as the international community seeks to develop the rule of law and reform security institutions in States recovering from conflict (Goldsmith and Sheptycki, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, A. and Sheptycki, J. (2007) Crafting Transnational Policing; State-Building and Global Policing Reform, Oxford: Hart Law Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; With transnational police development-aid the imbalances of power between donors and recipients are stark and there are questions about the applicability and transportability of policing models between jurisdictions (Hills, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Hills, A. (2009) 'The Possibility of Transnational Policing, Policing and Society, Vol. 19 No. 3 pp. 300-317&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the greatest question regarding the future development of transnational policing is: in whose interest is it? At a more practical level, the question translates into one about how to make transnational policing institutions democratically accountable (Sheptycki, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Sheptycki, J. (2004) 'The Accountability of Transnational Policing Institutions: The Strange Case of Interpol' The Canadian Journal of Law and Society, Vol. 19 No. 1, pp. 107-134&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the Global Accountability Report for 2007 (Lloyd, et al. 2007) Interpol had the lowest scores in its category (IGOs), coming in tenth with a score of 22% on overall accountability capabilities (p.&amp;nbsp;19).&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, R. Oatham, J. and Hammer, M. (2007) 2007 Global Accountability Report: London: One World Trust&lt;/ref&gt; As this report points out, and the existing academic literature on transnational policing seems to confirm, this is a secretive area and one not open to civil society involvement.

==Equipment==

===Weapons===
[[File:Blindado-CORE.JPG|thumb|right|Armored vehicle of [[CORE (Brazil)|CORE]], SWAT unit within the [[Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro State]].]]
In many jurisdictions, [[Police_firearm_use_by_country|police officers carry firearm]]s, primarily handguns, in the normal course of their duties. In the United Kingdom (except [[Northern Ireland]]), Iceland, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= NSW "gobsmacked" at NZ's unarmed force |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/nsw-gobsmacked-nz-s-unarmed-force-3747701 |publisher= Television New Zealand |date= 29 August 2010 |accessdate= 9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malta, with the exception of specialist units, officers do not carry firearms as a matter of course.

Police often have specialist units for handling armed offenders, and similar dangerous situations, and can (depending on local laws), in some extreme circumstances, call on the [[military]] (since [[Military Aid to the Civil Power]] is a role of many armed forces). Perhaps the most high-profile example of this was, in 1980 the [[Metropolitan Police]] handing control of the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]] to the [[Special Air Service]].

They can also be armed with [[non-lethal force|non-lethal]] (more accurately known as "less than lethal" or "less-lethal") weaponry, particularly for [[riot control]]. [[Non-lethal weapon]]s include [[club (weapon)|batons]], [[tear gas]], [[riot control agent]]s, [[rubber bullet]]s, [[riot shield]]s, [[water cannons]] and [[electroshock weapon]]s. Police officers often carry [[handcuffs]] to restrain suspects. The use of firearms or [[deadly force]] is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life, although some jurisdictions (such as Brazil) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts. A "shoot-to-kill" policy was recently introduced in [[South Africa]], which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Cops-must-shoot-to-kill-20100325 |title=Cops 'must shoot to kill' |accessdate=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime, president [[Jacob Zuma]] states that South Africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8357482.stm |title=SA minister defends shoot-to-kill |accessdate=July 2010 | work=BBC News | date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
Modern police forces make extensive use of two-way [[radio]] communications equipment, carried both on the person and installed in vehicles, to co-ordinate their work, share information, and get help quickly. In recent years, vehicle-installed [[mobile data terminal]]s have enhanced the ability of police communications, enabling easier dispatching of calls, criminal background checks on persons of interest to be completed in a matter of seconds, and updating officers' daily activity log and other, required reports on a real-time basis. Other common pieces of police equipment include [[flashlight]]s/torches, [[whistle]]s, [[police notebook]]s and "ticket books" or [[summons|citations]].

===Vehicles===
{{Main article|Police transport}}
[[File:US Capitol Police Cruiser Ford Crown Vic fr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|Ford Crown Victoria]], one of the most recognizable models of American police car. This unit belongs to US Capitol Police.]]

Police vehicles are used for detaining, patrolling and transporting. The average police patrol vehicle is a specially modified, four door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (saloon in British English). Police vehicles are usually marked with appropriate logos and are equipped with sirens and flashing light bars to aid in making others aware of police presence.

Unmarked vehicles are used primarily for sting operations or apprehending criminals without alerting them to their presence. Some police forces use unmarked or minimally marked cars for traffic law enforcement, since drivers slow down at the sight of marked police vehicles and unmarked vehicles make it easier for officers to catch speeders and traffic violators. This practice is controversial, with for example, New York State banning this practice in 1996 on the grounds that it endangered motorists who might be pulled over by people [[impersonating police officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dao |first=James |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DB1E39F93BA25757C0A960958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/R/Roads%20and%20Traffic |title=Pataki Curbs Unmarked Cars' Use - The |publisher=New York Times |date=1996-04-18 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motorcycle]]s are also commonly used, particularly in locations that a car may not be able to reach, to control potential public order situations involving meetings of motorcyclists and often in escort duties where motorcycle police officers can quickly clear a path for escorted vehicles. [[Bicycle]] patrols are used in some areas because they allow for more open interaction with the public. In addition, their quieter operation can facilitate approaching suspects unawares and can help in pursuing them attempting to escape on foot.

Police forces use an array of specialty vehicles such as helicopters, airplanes, watercraft, mobile command posts, vans, trucks, all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, and armored vehicles.

====Other safety equipment====
Police cars may also contain [[fire extinguisher]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visual.merriam-webster.com/society/safety/crime-prevention/police-car.php|title=Police car image}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/19/earlyshow/main955104.shtml|title=Car Fire Rescue, Caught On Tape|quote=My partner grabbed the fire extinguisher and I ran to the car.

==Strategies==
The advent of the police car, [[two-way radio]], and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to [[calls for service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reiss Jr |author2=Albert J. |title=Police Organization in the Twentieth Century |journal=Crime and Justice |year=1992 |volume= 15|pages= 51|id={{NCJ|138800}} |doi=10.1086/449193}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized.

In the United States, [[August Vollmer]] introduced other reforms, including education requirements for police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finest of the Finest |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=February 18, 1966 |url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899019,00.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014095649/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C899019%2C00.html |archivedate=October 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orlando Winfield Wilson|O.W. Wilson]], a student of Vollmer, helped reduce [[police corruption|corruption]] and introduce professionalism in [[Wichita, Kansas]], and later in the [[Chicago Police Department]].&lt;ref name="cdlib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf3v19n6s0&amp;doc.view=entire_text |title=Guide to the Orlando Winfield Wilson Papers, ca. 1928-1972 |publisher=Online Archive of California |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict [[merit system]] for promotions within the department, and an aggressive recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers.&lt;ref name="nytimes-1960"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chicago Chooses Criminologist to Head and Clean Up the Police |publisher=United Press International/The New York Times |date=February 22, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with [[felony|felonies]] and other serious crime and conducting visible car patrols in between, rather than broader focus on [[crime prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evolving Strategy of Policing: Case Studies of Strategic Change |author=Kelling, George L., Mary A. Wycoff |date=December 2002 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |id={{NCJ|198029}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kansas City preventive patrol experiment|Kansas City Preventive Patrol study]] in the early 1970s showed flaws in this strategy. It found that aimless car patrols did little to deter crime and often went unnoticed by the public. Patrol officers in cars had insufficient contact and interaction with the community, leading to a social rift between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/kcppe.pdf |title=The Kansas City Preventive Patrol Experiment - A Summary Report |publisher=Police Foundation |author=Kelling, George L., Tony Pate, Duane Dieckman, Charles E. Brown |year=1974 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010100509/http://policefoundation.org/pdf/kcppe.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt [[community policing]] strategies, and others adopted [[problem-oriented policing]].

[[Broken windows theory|'Broken windows' policing]] was another, related approach introduced in the 1980s by [[James Q. Wilson]] and [[George L. Kelling]], who suggested that police should pay greater attention to minor "quality of life" offenses and disorderly conduct. This method was popularised in the early 1990s by police chief [[William J. Bratton]] and New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]].

The concept behind this method is simple: broken windows, graffiti, and other physical destruction or degradation of property, greatly increases the chances of more criminal activities and destruction of property. When criminals see the abandoned vehicles, trash, and deplorable property, they assume that authorities do not care and do not take active approaches to correct problems in these areas. Therefore, correcting the small problems prevents more serious criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/198203/broken-windows |title=Broken Windows |publisher=Atlantic Monthly |date = March 1982|author=Kelling, George L., James Q. Wilson |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building upon these earlier models, [[intelligence-led policing]] has emerged as the dominant philosophy guiding police strategy. Intelligence-led policing and problem-oriented policing are complementary strategies, both of which involve systematic use of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tilley, Nick |title=Problem-Oriented Policing, Intelligence-Led Policing and the National Intelligence Model |publisher=Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, University College London |url=http://www.jdi.ucl.ac.uk/publications/short_reports/problem_oriented_policing.php |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it still lacks a universally accepted definition, the crux of intelligence-led policing is an emphasis on the collection and analysis of information to guide police operations, rather than the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligence-led policing: A Definition|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/crimint/intelligence_e.htm|accessdate=2007-06-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515144758/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/crimint/intelligence_e.htm |archivedate = May 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related development is [[evidence-based policing]]. In a similar vein to [[evidence-based policy]], evidence-based policing is the use of controlled experiments to find which methods of policing are more effective. Leading advocates of evidence-based policing include the criminologist [[Lawrence W. Sherman]] and philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]]. Findings from controlled experiments include the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]&lt;ref name="sherman1984-pf"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of experiments to assess the usefulness of strategies has been endorsed by many police services and institutions, including the US [[Police Foundation]] and the UK [[College of Policing]].

==Power restrictions==
{{Main article|Police misconduct}}
In many nations, [[criminal procedure]] law has been developed to regulate officers' discretion, so that they do not arbitrarily or unjustly exercise their powers of [[arrest]], [[search and seizure]], and [[use of force]]. In the United States, ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' led to the widespread use of [[Miranda warning]]s or constitutional warnings.

In ''Miranda'' the court created safeguards against self-incriminating statements made after an arrest. The court held that "The prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way, unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination"&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States, Terry v. Ohio (No. 67), Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Ohio. Retrieved 2010-05-12 from [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0392_0001_ZS.html law.cornell.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Police in the United States are also prohibited from holding criminal suspects for more than a reasonable amount of time (usually 24–48 hours) before [[arraignment]], using [[torture]], abuse or physical threats to extract [[Confession (law)|confessions]], using excessive force to effect an arrest, and searching suspects' bodies or their homes without a warrant obtained upon a showing of [[probable cause]]. The four exceptions to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant are:
* Consent
* Search incident to arrest
* Motor vehicle searches
* Exigent circumstances

In [[Terry v. Ohio]] (1968) the court divided seizure into two parts, the [[Terry stop|investigatory stop]] and arrest. The court further held that during an investigatory stop a police officer's search " [is] confined to what [is] minimally necessary to determine whether [a suspect] is armed, and the intrusion, which [is] made for the sole purpose of protecting himself and others nearby, [is] confined to ascertaining the presence of weapons" (U.S. Supreme Court). Before Terry, every police encounter constituted an arrest, giving the police officer the full range of search authority. Search authority during a Terry stop (investigatory stop) is limited to weapons only.&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt;

Using deception for confessions is permitted, but not coercion. There are exceptions or exigent circumstances such as an articulated need to disarm a suspect or searching a suspect who has already been arrested (Search Incident to an Arrest). The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] severely restricts the use of the military for police activity, giving added importance to police [[SWAT]] units.

British police officers are governed by similar rules, such as those introduced to England and Wales under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] (PACE), but generally have greater powers. They may, for example, legally search any suspect who has been arrested, or their vehicles, home or business premises, without a warrant, and may seize anything they find in a search as evidence.

All police officers in the United Kingdom, whatever their actual rank, are 'constables' in terms of their legal position. This means that a newly appointed constable has the same arrest powers as a Chief Constable or Commissioner. However, certain higher ranks have additional powers to authorize certain aspects of police operations, such as a power to authorize a search of a suspect's house (section 18 PACE in England and Wales) by an officer of the rank of Inspector, or the power to authorize a suspect's detention beyond 24 hours by a Superintendent.

==Conduct, accountability and public confidence==
{{Main article|Police misconduct}}
[[File:ftaapolice.png|thumb|right|April 21, 2001: Police fire [[CS gas]] at protesters during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]].&lt;br /&gt;The Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP later concluded the use of tear gas against demonstrators at the summit constituted "excessive and unjustified force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=RCMP used 'excessive force' at Quebec summit: report|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/11/13/rcmp_summit031113.html|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Police services commonly include units for investigating crimes committed by the police themselves. These units are typically called Inspectorate-General, or in the US, "[[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]]". In some countries separate organizations outside the police exist for such purposes, such as the British [[Independent Office for Police Conduct]].

Likewise, some state and local jurisdictions, for example, [[Springfield, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police review board gets started|author=Amanda Reavy|url=http://www.sj-r.com/sections/news/stories/112655.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124316/http://www.sj-r.com/sections/news/stories/112655.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|work=The State Journal-Register Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similar outside review organizations. The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] is investigated by the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]], an external agency set up as a result of the Patten report into policing the province. In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [[Garda Síochána]] is investigated by the [[Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission]], an independent commission that replaced the Garda Complaints Board in May 2007.

The [[Special Investigations Unit]] of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], is one of only a few civilian agencies around the world responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in a death, serious injury, or allegations of [[sexual assault]]. The agency has made allegations of insufficient cooperation from various police services hindering their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Exclusive: Police ignore SIU's probes|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/943363--star-exclusive-police-ignore-siu-s-probes|work=Toronto Star | date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], any allegations of corruption within the police will be investigated by the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], two agencies which are independent of the police force.

Due to a long-term decline in public confidence for law enforcement in the United States, body cameras worn by police officers are under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/10/22/should-police-wear-cameras/body-cameras-could-restore-trust-in-police | work=The New York Times | title=If Police Encounters Were Filmed | date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of force===
[[File:Police action during Gezi park protests in Istanbul. Events of June 15, 2013-6.jpg|thumb|A [[General Directorate of Security]] riot control officer uses force on a protester in [[Gezi Park protests]].]]
Police forces also find themselves under criticism for their use of force, particularly [[deadly force]]. Specifically, tension increases when a police officer of one ethnic group harms or kills a suspect of another one.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the United States, such events occasionally spark protests and accusations of [[racism]] against police and allegations that police departments practice [[racial profiling]].
  
In the United States since the 1960s, concern over such issues has increasingly weighed upon law enforcement agencies, courts and legislatures at every level of government. Incidents such as the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], the videotaped 1991 beating by [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles Police]] officers of [[Rodney King]], and the [[1992 Los Angeles Riot|riot]] following their acquittal have been suggested by some people to be evidence that U.S. police are dangerously lacking in appropriate controls.
  
The fact that this trend has occurred contemporaneously with the rise of the [[civil rights movement]], the "[[War on Drugs]]", and a precipitous rise in violent crime from the 1960s to the 1990s has made questions surrounding the role, administration and scope of police authority increasingly complicated.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Police departments and the local governments that oversee them in some jurisdictions have attempted to mitigate some of these issues through community [[outreach]] programs and [[community policing]] to make the police more accessible to the concerns of local communities, by working to increase hiring diversity, by updating training of police in their responsibilities to the community and under the law, and by increased oversight within the department or by civilian commissions.

In cases in which such measures have been lacking or absent, civil lawsuits have been brought by the [[United States Department of Justice]] against local law enforcement agencies, authorized under the 1994 [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]]. This has compelled local departments to make organizational changes, enter into [[consent decree]] settlements to adopt such measures, and submit to oversight by the Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New World of Police Accountability |author=Walker, Samuel |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |page=5 |isbn=0-534-58158-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Protection of individuals===
Since 1855, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has consistently ruled that law enforcement officers have no duty to protect any individual, despite the motto "protect and serve". Their duty is to enforce the law in general. The first such case was in 1855 (''{{cite court
  |litigants = South v. State of Maryland  |vol = |reporter =  |opinion = |pinpoint = |court = Supreme Court of the United States
  |date = 1855 |url= https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_case?case=15918309369607656613&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr}}'') and the most recent in 2005 (''[[Castle Rock v. Gonzales|Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-278.ZS.html|title=Castle Rock v. Gonzales |accessdate=2009-03-21 |publisher=[[Cornell University Law School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the police are entitled to protect private rights in some jurisdictions. To ensure that the police would not interfere in the regular competencies of the courts of law, some police acts require that the police may only interfere in such cases where protection from courts cannot be obtained in time, and where, without interference of the police, the realization of the private right would be impeded.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. § 1 section 2 of the Police Act of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: {{cite web|url=http://www1.polizei-nrw.de/im/Recht/Polizeigesetz/ |title=Police Act of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia |accessdate=2008-08-10 |work=polizei-nrw.de |publisher=Land Nordrhein-Westfalen |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210140019/http://www.polizei-nrw.de/im/Recht/Polizeigesetz/ |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, allow police to establish a restaurant guest's identity and forward it to the innkeeper in a case where the guest cannot pay the bill at nighttime because his wallet had just been stolen from the restaurant table.

In addition, there are [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal law enforcement agencies]] in the United States whose mission includes providing protection for executives such as the President and accompanying family members, visiting foreign dignitaries, and other high-ranking individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Park Police Webpage, [http://www.nps.gov/uspp NPS.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Such agencies include the [[United States Secret Service]] and the [[United States Park Police]].

==By country==
{{Main article|Law enforcement by country}}
Police forces are usually organized and funded by some level of government. The level of government responsible for policing varies from place to place, and may be at the national, regional or local level. Some countries have police forces that serve the same territory, with their [[jurisdiction]] depending on the type of crime or other circumstances. Other countries, such as [[Austria]], [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sweden]], have a single national police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Challenges of Policing Democracies: A World Perspective |author=Das, Dilip K., Otwin Marenin |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |page=17 |isbn=90-5700-558-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places with multiple national police forces, one common arrangement is to have a civilian police force and a paramilitary [[gendarmerie]], such as the [[Police Nationale]] and [[National Gendarmerie]] in [[France]].&lt;ref name="bayley-1979"/&gt; The French policing system spread to other countries through the [[Napoleonic Wars]]&lt;ref name="Emsley"&gt;{{cite book | first = Clive| last = Emsley| title = Gendarmes and the State in Nineteenth-Century Europe|edition= 1999|pages= 52–57 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn= 978-0198207986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[French colonial empire]].&lt;ref name="SyrGend1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deep |first1=Daniel |title=Occupying Syria Under the French Mandate: Insurgency, Space and State Formation |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-00006-3 |page=204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Congo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Republic of the Congo|last1=Clark|first1=John|last2=Decalo|first2=Samuel|location=Lanham|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=2012|isbn=978-0-8108-7989-8|pages=44–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[Policía Nacional (Spain)|Policía Nacional]] and [[Guardia Civil]] in [[Spain]]. In both France and Spain, the civilian force polices urban areas and the paramilitary force polices rural areas. Italy has a similar arrangement with the [[Polizia di Stato]] and [[Carabinieri]], though their jurisdictions overlap more. Some countries have separate agencies for uniformed police and detectives, such as the [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]] and [[Civil Police (Brazil)|Civil Police]] in [[Brazil]] and the [[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]] and [[Investigations Police of Chile|Investigations Police]] in [[Chile]].

Other countries have sub-national police forces, but for the most part their jurisdictions do not overlap. In many countries, especially [[Federalism|federations]], there may be two or more tiers of police force, each serving different levels of government and enforcing different subsets of the law. In [[Australia]] and [[Germany]], the majority of policing is carried out by state (i.e. provincial) police forces, which are supplemented by a federal police force. Though not a federation, the [[United Kingdom]] has a similar arrangement, where policing is primarily the responsibility of a regional police force and specialist units exist at the national level. In [[Canada]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) are the federal police, while municipalities can decide whether to run a local police service or to contract local policing duties to a larger one. Most urban areas have a local police service, while most rural areas contract it to the RCMP, or to the provincial police in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]].

The [[United States]] has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement, with over 17,000 state and local law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ojp.gov/bjs/lawenf.htm |title=Law Enforcement Statistics |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=2007-05-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061002175933/http://www.ojp.gov/bjs/lawenf.htm |archivedate = October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agencies include local police, [[County police#United States|county police]] (often in the form of a [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's office]]), [[State police (United States)|state police]] and [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agencies]]. Federal agencies, such as the [[FBI]], only have jurisdiction over federal crimes or those that involve more than one state. Other federal agencies have jurisdiction over a specific type of crime. Examples include the [[United States Federal Protective Service|Federal Protective Service]], which patrols and protects government buildings; the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|postal police]], which protect postal buildings, vehicles and items; the [[United States Park Police|Park Police]], which protect national parks; and [[Amtrak Police]], which patrol [[Amtrak]] stations and trains. There are also some government agencies that perform police functions in addition to other duties, such as the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main intergovernmental agreements, Brazil originally joined the programme as a bilateral partner of the United States by a contract with NASA to supply hardware.&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs International Space Station Agreement With Brazil|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1996_1998/h97-233.html|date=14 October 1997|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Brazil O Brasil na Estação Espacial Internacional|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.br/conteudo/made-brazil-o-brasil-na-estacao-espacial-internacional/|publisher=Gizmodo Brazil|accessdate=9 March 2011|author=Emerson Kimura|language=Portuguese|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has a similar contract with NASA to provide comparable services, although Italy also takes part in the programme directly via its membership in ESA.&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/en/flash_en/living/the_international_space_station_iss|title=International Space Station (ISS)|publisher=Italian Space Agency|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the partnership would require unanimous agreement of the existing partners.

The heads of both the South Korean and Indian space agency [[ISRO]] announced at the first plenary session of the 2009 [[International Astronautical Congress]] that their nations wished to join the ISS programme, with talks due to begin in 2010. The heads of agency also expressed support for extending ISS lifetime.&lt;ref name="ISRO and KARI to join ISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/10/14/333406/south-korea-india-to-begin-iss-partnership-talks-in.html|title=South Korea, India to begin ISS partnership talks in 2010|work=Flight International|accessdate=14 October 2009|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; European countries not part of the programme will be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period, [[ESA]] officials say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/EU_mulls_opening_ISS_to_more_countries_999.html|title=EU mulls opening ISS to more countries|publisher=Space-travel.com|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS)''' is a green building certification system developed for the State of [[Qatar]]. The primary objective of Qatar Sustainability Assessment System [QSAS] is to create a sustainable built environment that minimizes ecological impact while addressing the specific regional needs and environment of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taylorwessing.com/sustainability/indices-region.php Hitting the Green Wall | Taylor Wessing LLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
QSAS was developed by the [[T.C. Chan Center for Building Simulation and Energy Studies]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in collaboration with and on behalf of the Gulf Organization for Research and Development [GORD].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates247.com/eb247/companies-markets/construction/barwa-qatari-diar-tc-chan-sign-deal-2009-04-09-1.96653 Barwa, Qatari Diar, TC Chan sign deal - Emirates 24/7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20090408093740/ BARWA and Qatari Diar Develops the first Performance-Based Sustainability Rating System in the Middle East - Zawya]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatarisbooming.com/2011/04/27/gord-to-establish-qatar-as-middle-east-%E2%80%98capital-of-green-building%E2%80%99/ GORD to establish Qatar as Middle East ‘Capital of Green building’ | Qatar Business &amp; Corporate News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325181837/http://www.qatarisbooming.com/2011/04/27/gord-to-establish-qatar-as-middle-east-%E2%80%98capital-of-green-building%E2%80%99/ |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its deployment in 2009, over 128 buildings in Qatar have been certified through QSAS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-16524-hill-international-mep-expert-calls-qsas-a-success/1/print/ Hill International MEP expert calls QSAS a success]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, QSAS was adopted into the curriculum of the environmental design faculty at King Fahd University and [[Qatar University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emiratesweek.com/2010/12/5520 QSAS to be adopted in the curriculum of the Environment Design Faculty at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals | Emirates Week] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103185024/http://www.emiratesweek.com/2010/12/5520 |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2011 the State of Qatar integrated QSAS into the Qatar Construction Specifications [QCS] making the implementation of certain criteria mandatory for buildings developed in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-11256-qatar-to-impose-strict-green-standards-from-april/ Qatar to impose strict green standards from April | ConstructionWeekOnline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the rating system took advantage of a comprehensive review of combined best practices employed by a mix of established international and regional rating systems. This review has been performed while taking into consideration the needs that are specific to Qatar’s local environment, culture, and policies. This has led to adaptations and additions to sustainability criteria. Measurements for the rating system are designed to be performance-based and quantifiable. The result is a performance-based sustainable building rating system customized to the unique conditions and requirements of the State of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emiratesweek.com/2011/05/10560 Gulf Organisation for Research and Development and Qatar Olympic Committee Ink MOU | Emirates Week] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103185027/http://www.emiratesweek.com/2011/05/10560 |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating System==
QSAS consists of a series of sustainable categories and criteria, each with a direct impact on environmental stress mitigation. Each category measures a different aspect of the project’s environmental impact. The categories define these broad impacts and address ways in which a project can mitigate the negative environmental effects. These categories are then broken down into specific criteria that measure and define individual issues. These issues range from a thorough review of water consumption to an assessment of light quality. Each criterion specifies a process for measuring individual aspects of environmental impact and for documenting the degree to which the requirements have been met. A score is then awarded to each criterion based on the degree of compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=7&amp;cntnt01returnid=30 Privacy Policy | Green Building Solutions Doha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325181830/http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=7&amp;cntnt01returnid=30 |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight categories of QSAS are the following:

'''Urban Connectivity [UC]'''

The Urban Connectivity category consists of factors associated with the urban environment such as zoning, transportation networks and loadings. Loadings on the urban environment include traffic congestion and pollution.

'''Site [S]'''

The Site category consists of factors associated with land use such as land conservation or remediation and site selection, planning and development.

'''Energy [E]'''

The Energy category consists of factors associated with energy demand of buildings, the efficiency of energy delivery, and the use of fossil energy sources that result in harmful emissions.

'''Water [W]'''

The Water category consists of factors associated with water consumption and its associated burden on municipal supply and treatment systems.

'''Materials [M]'''

The Materials category consists of factors associated with material extraction, processing, manufacturing, distribution, use/re-use, and disposal.

'''Indoor Environment [IE]'''

The Indoor Environment category consists of factors associated with indoor environmental quality such as thermal comfort, air quality, acoustic quality, and light quality.

'''Cultural &amp; Economic Value [CE]'''

The Cultural and Economic Value category consists of factors associated with cultural conservation and support of the national economy.

'''Management &amp; Operations [MO]'''

The Management and Operations category consists of factors associated with building design management and operations.

==Rating System Resources==
QSAS consists of several resources used to facilitate the assessment of sustainability performance for buildings in Qatar. Target users for the resources are building planners, developers, owners, designers, engineers and environmentalists. The major resources available to QSAS members include the following:

*	RFP Preparation: A guide to facilitate the preparation of an RFP and Project Brief in the pre-design stages of development
*	Assessment Manuals: Outline the specific measurements, submittals, and scores for each criterion that is assessed for each building type.
*	Design Guidelines: Consist of recommendations to be used as guidance for realizing sustainable buildings in Qatar.
*	Training Manual: Covers the detailed instructions and examples for completing each criterion.
*	Energy Manuals: Documents the application and implementation of the CEN/ISO energy performance standard and all its related standards to all buildings in Qatar.
*	Toolkits: Computational systems provided to facilitate the evaluation of a project's performance under the assessment system. The toolkits compute the final project score and certification level for the project using each criterion score entered by the user.
*	Calculators: Normative measures provided for many criteria to evaluate the project's performance and compute a final criterion score.
*	Project Management System (PMS): Online tool used by project teams to document, upload, and certify their projects in the assessment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bqdri.org/doc/QSAS%20presentation%20june6%202010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911031926/http://www.bqdri.org/doc/QSAS%20presentation%20june6%202010.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==QSAS Schemes==
QSAS has been developed to rate different building types as well as projects on the Neighborhood scale for each phase of a building’s lifespan. The building schemes that can be rated with QSAS include:

*	Commercial
*	Core &amp; Shell
*	Schools
*	Residential
*	Mosques
*	Hotels
*	Light Industry
*	Sports
*	Neighborhoods

Phases that can be rated using QSAS include:

* Design
* Construction
*Operations: New/Existing Buildings

The various schemes use similar categories and criteria across each system to facilitate use. The measurements, calculations, simulations, scoring ranges, and weights change accordingly for each building type and project phase.

==QSAS Certification==
The aim for all QSAS criteria and their associated measurements is to be performance-based and quantifiable on the scoring scale of -1 to 3 (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) or 0 to 3, depending on the criterion’s level of impact. Each category and criterion has an associated weight based on its relative environmental, social, and economic impact. Once a score is assigned to each criterion in the assessment system, the values are multiplied by the weight and a cumulative final score is determined. 

QSAS consists of six certification levels to measure the project’s impact. A building that obtains a cumulative final score below 0 does not meet the baseline and will be denied certification. Certification can only be achieved when the final score is greater than or equal to 0, earning a rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stars. The highest score a building can achieve is 3.0 and the highest certification level is 6 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?page=sustainability-award Sustainability Award | Green Building Solutions Doha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006142005/http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?page=sustainability-award |date=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Accreditation==
Professional Accreditation is granted to those qualified individuals who demonstrate in‐depth knowledge of the Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS) and sustainable building practices. The role of the accredited professional or QSAS Certified Green Professional (CGP) is to facilitate the submittal of projects for assessment under QSAS. The candidate must meet the following requirements to receive a QSAS CGP certificate:

* Be a licensed or certified professional
* Attend a QSAS Training Workshop
* Meet or exceed the passing requirement for the QSAS CGP Exam &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menafn.com/menafn/1093258373/Barwa-Qatari-Diar-organise-workshop Barwa, Qatari Diar organise workshop - MENAFN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20090716005494/en QSAS – CERTIFIED GREEN PROFESSIONAL® 3days Training Workshop Ends]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabcommunications.com/pictures/magazine/f4a6c8ab-6e90-43fd-8eeb-ca7e5fb273ba.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411152806/http://www.arabcommunications.com/pictures/magazine/f4a6c8ab-6e90-43fd-8eeb-ca7e5fb273ba.pdf |archivedate=April 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future Development==
The T.C. Chan Center and GORD are currently working on further developing and expanding QSAS to other regions in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/06/qatar-green-rating-qsas/ Qatar’s GSAS Turns Other Rating Systems Green | Green Prophet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Adams''''' [1957] Crim LR 365 is an [[England|English]] case that allows a doctor to hasten death (as a secondary intention) using [[analgesic]] medications such as [[heroin]] and [[morphine]].

== Case Facts ==

The defendant, [[John Bodkin Adams]], was a doctor who was tried on one count of murder by "easing the passing" of an elderly patient, Mrs Alice Morrell. The police claimed that Adams had murdered a number of elderly patients, and suggested his [[modus operandi]] was to administer [[heroin]] and [[morphine]] with the intention making his patients addicted and under his influence, induced them to leave him legacies in cash or kind in their wills and finally giving them sufficiently large doses of drugs to cause their deaths. One patient's bequest included a Rolls-Royce, although Mrs Morrell did not in fact leave Adams anything in her final will.

== Judgment ==

It was said that a doctor has no special defence, but "he is entitled to do all that is proper and necessary to relieve pain even if the measures he takes may incidentally shorten life" (i.e. as a secondary intention). 
On these grounds, the defendant was acquitted.
This case was the first to formulate a "double effect" in respect of the "mens rea" of murder. Liability for murder can be avoided if medicine which is beneficial to the patient is given, despite the knowledge that death will occur as a side effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">The '''Review of Civil Litigation Costs''', or '''Jackson Review''' or '''Jackson Proposals''', is a review of civil litigation costs in [[England and Wales]] conducted by  [[Lord Justice]] [[Rupert Jackson|Jackson]] in 2009, the final report, known as the '''Jackson Report''', which was presented in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Judiciary 14 January 2010"/&gt;

==History==
The senior judiciary were concerned about the cost of civil justice in England and Wales, in particular because the costs were often disproportionate to the issues, and in late 2008 the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Anthony Clarke, Baron Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony|Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony]] asked Lord Justice Jackson to conduct a review into civil litigation costs.&lt;ref name="Final Report"/&gt;{{Rp|1}}
The review became known as the Jackson Review.

It commenced in January 2009 and took about a year to complete, a preliminary report being published on 8 May 2009. On 14 January 2010, Jackson published the final report to the new Master of the Rolls, [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]].&lt;ref name="Judiciary 2010 March 17"/&gt;

==Assessors==
Jackson was assisted in his work by a panel of assessors comprising:&lt;ref name="Final Report"/&gt; {{Rp|2}}
* [[Ross Cranston|Mr Justice Cranston]]
* [[Paul Fenn|Professor Paul Fenn]], Head of Industrial Economics at Nottingham University Business School
* Senior Costs Judge Master [[Peter Hurst]]
* [[Jeremy Morgan]] QC
* [[Michael Napier QC]]
* [[Andrew Parker (lawyer)|Andrew Parker]] (who replaced [[David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral|Lord Hunt]], who had to resign early in the review for health reasons&lt;ref name="Preliminary Report Vol 1"/&gt; {{Rp|2}})
* [[Colin Stutt]],  Head of Funding at the [[Legal Services Commission]]

==Findings==
The final report is 557 pages long.&lt;ref name="Judiciary 14 January 2010"/&gt;

The main findings and recommendations include:&lt;ref name=" Judiciary 14 January 2010"/&gt;
*The costs system should be based on legal expenses that reflect the nature/complexity of the case.
*Success fees and after the event insurance premiums should not be recoverable in no win, no fee cases.
* General damages awards for personal injuries and other civil wrongs should be increased by 10%.
* Referral fees should be scrapped.
* Claimants should only make a small contribution to defendant costs if a claim is unsuccessful (as long as they have behaved reasonably).
*There should be fixed costs for "fast track" cases (with a claim up to £25,000).
* A Costs Council should be established to annually review fixed costs and lawyers' hourly rates.
*Lawyers should be allowed to enter into Contingency Fee Agreements.
*"Before the event’ legal insurance should be promoted.

==Follow-up==
After the Jackson Report was published, the [[Judicial Executive Board]] agreed to support the recommendations of the final report and established a Judicial Steering Group with the following members:&lt;ref name=" Judiciary 2010 March 17" /&gt;
*[[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]], [[Master of the Rolls]]
*[[Maurice Kay|Lord Justice Kay]], Chairman of the [[Judicial Studies Board]]
*[[Martin Moore-Bick|Lord Justice Moore-Bick]], Deputy Head of Civil Justice

The '''''Schwabenspiegel''''' is a legal code, written in ca. 1275 by a [[Franciscan]] friar in [[Augsburg]]. It deals mainly with questions of land ownership and [[fiefdom]], and it is based on the [[Pentateuch]], [[Roman law]] as well as [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. It draws on the early 13th century 
''[[Sachsenspiegel]]'', and is immediately dependent on the ''[[Deutschenspiegel]]'' code.

The name "mirror of the [[Swabia]]ns" is also taken from the ''Sachsenspiegel'' ("mirror of the [[Saxon people|Saxons]]"). Since the code is not prescriptive but descriptive, i.e. it records current legal practice, it does not impose any new laws, it was metaphorically compared to a mirror in which to perceive right and wrong.

'''Secularization''' (or '''secularisation''')&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?q=Secularisation&amp;tbm=bks occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the transformation of a society from close identification and affiliation with religious values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The ''secularization thesis'' refers to the [[belief]] that as societies progress, particularly through [[modernization]] and [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], religion loses its authority in all aspects of social life and governance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208002707/http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~pnorris/ACROBAT/Sacred_and_Secular/Chapter%201.pdf "The Secularization Debate"], chapter 1 (pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dto-P2YfWJIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22The+Secularization+Debate%22 3]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=dto-P2YfWJIC&amp;pg=PA32 32]) of {{cite book|first1=Pippa |last1=Norris |authorlink1=Pippa Norris |first2=Ronald |last2=Inglehart |authorlink2=Ronald Inglehart |title=Sacred and Secular.

Secularization refers to the historical process in which religion loses social and cultural significance. As a result of secularization the role of religion in modern societies becomes restricted. In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority, and religious organizations have little social power.

Secularization has many levels of meaning, both as a [[theory]] and a historical process. Social theorists such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Émile Durkheim]], postulated that the modernization of society would include a decline in levels of [[religiosity]]. Study of this process seeks to determine the manner in which, or extent to which religious creeds, practices and institutions are losing social significance. Some theorists argue that the secularization of modern civilization partly results from our inability to adapt broad ethical and spiritual needs of mankind to the increasingly fast advance of the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615170139/http://religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=472 |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the “modernization” thesis, Christian Smith and others argue that secularization is promoted by intellectual and cultural elites to enhance their own status and influence. Smith believes intellectuals have an inherent tendency to be hostile to their native cultures, causing them to embrace secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also has additional meanings, primarily historical and religious.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Jose (1994).  ''Public Religions in the Modern World''.  University of Chicago Press, pg. 13. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Applied to [[Secularization (church property)|church property]], historically it refers to the seizure of monastic lands and buildings, such as [[Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in England and the later acts during the [[French Revolution]] as well as by various [[anti-clerical]] European governments during the 18th and 19th centuries, which resulted in the expulsion and suppression of the religious communities which occupied them. The 19th-century ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' in Germany and Switzerland and similar events in many other countries also were expressions of secularization.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Andrew in: ''Origins of Liberal Dominance: State, Church, and Party in Nineteenth-century Europe'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, p. 82, {{ISBN|978-0-472-11015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another form of Secularization refers to the act of [[Prince-Bishop]]s or holders of a position in a [[Monastic order|Monastic]] or [[Military order (society)|Military Order]] - holding a combined religious and secular authority under the Catholic Church - who broke away and made themselves into completely secular (typically, [[Protestant]]) hereditary rulers. For example, [[Gotthard Kettler]], the last Master of the [[Livonian Order]], converted to [[Lutheranism]],  secularised (and took to himself) the lands of [[Semigallia]] and [[Courland]] which he had held on behalf of the order - which enabled him to marry and leave to his descendants the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]].

In the 1960s there was a shift toward secularization in Western Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. This transformation was intertwined with major social factors: economic prosperity, youth rebelling against the rules and conventions of society, women's liberation, radical theology, and radical politics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Cox, "Secularization and other master narratives of religion in modern Europe." ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte'' (2001): 24-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Secularization is sometimes credited both to the cultural shifts in society following the emergence of [[rationality]] and the development of [[science]] as a substitute for [[superstition]]—[[Max Weber]] called this process the "disenchantment of the world"—and to the changes made by religious institutions to compensate. At the most basic stages, this begins with a slow transition from [[oral tradition]]s to a writing culture that diffuses knowledge. This first reduces the authority of clerics as the custodians of revealed knowledge. As the responsibility for [[education]] has moved from the family and community to the [[Sovereign state|state]], two consequences have arisen:
* ''Collective conscience'' as defined by [[Durkheim]] is diminished
* Fragmentation of communal activities leads to religion becoming more a matter of individual choice rather than an observed social obligation.
A major issue in the study of secularization is the extent to which certain trends such as decreased attendance at places of worship indicate a decrease in religiosity or simply a privatization of religious belief, where religious beliefs no longer play a dominant role in public life or in other aspects of decision making.

The issue of secularization is discussed in various religious traditions. The government of [[Turkey]] is an often cited{{By whom|date=July 2012}} example, following the abolition of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Caliphate]] and foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923. This established popular sovereignty in a secular republican framework, in opposition to a system whose authority is based on religion. As one of many examples of state modernization, this shows secularization and democratization as mutually reinforcing processes {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. USSR, North Korea, and Cuba could be counterexamples to the previous claim|date=November 2010}}, relying on a separation of religion and state. In expressly secular states like [[India]], it has been argued{{By whom|date=July 2012}} that the need was to legislate for toleration and respect between quite different religions, and likewise, the secularization of the West was a response to drastically violent intra-Christian feuds between [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Some{{Who|date=July 2012}} have therefore argued that Western and Indian secularization is radically different in that it deals with [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] from religious regulation and control. Considerations of both tolerance and autonomy are relevant to any secular state.{{Citation needed|reason=this is a generalised statement.  Are these considerations really relevant to *all* secular states?|date=July 2012}}

==Definitions==
[[C. John Sommerville]] (1998) outlined six uses of the term secularization in the scientific literature. The first five are more along the lines of 'definitions' while the sixth is more of a 'clarification of use':&lt;ref&gt;Somerville, C. J. "Secular Society Religious Population: Our Tacit Rules for Using the Term Secularization''. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (2):249-53. (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
# When discussing '''macro social structures''', secularization can refer to ''differentiation'': a process in which the various aspects of society, economic, political, legal, and moral, become increasingly specialized and distinct from one another.
# When discussing '''individual institutions''', secularization can denote the transformation of a religious into a secular institution. Examples would be the evolution of institutions such as [[Harvard University]] from a predominantly religious institution into a secular institution (with a divinity school now housing the religious element illustrating differentiation).
# When discussing '''activities''', secularization refers to the transfer of activities from religious to secular institutions, such as a shift in provision of social services from churches to the government.
# When discussing '''mentalities''', secularization refers to the transition from ''ultimate'' concerns to ''proximate'' concerns. E.g., individuals in the West are now more likely to moderate their behavior in response to more immediately applicable consequences rather than out of concern for ''post-mortem'' consequences. This is a personal religious decline or movement toward a secular lifestyle.
# When discussing '''populations''', secularization refers to broad patterns of societal decline in levels of religiosity as opposed to the individual-level secularization of (4) above. This understanding of secularization is also distinct from (1) above in that it refers specifically to religious decline rather than societal differentiation.
# When discussing '''religion''', secularization can only be used unambiguously to refer to religion in a generic sense. For example, a reference to Christianity is not clear unless one specifies exactly which denominations of Christianity are being discussed.

[[Abdel Wahab Elmessiri]] (2002) outlined two meanings of the term secularization:
# '''Partial Secularization''': which is the common meaning of the word, and expresses "The separation between religion and state".
# '''Complete Secularization''': this definition is not limited to the partial definition, but exceeds it to "The separation between all (religion, moral, and human) values, and (not just the state) but also to (the human nature in its public and private sides), so that the holiness is removed from the world, and this world is transformed into a usable matter that can be employed for the sake of the strong".

==Sociological use and differentiation==
As studied by sociologists, one of the major themes of secularization is that of "differentiation"—i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the tendency for areas of life to become more distinct and specialized as a society becomes modernized. European sociology, influenced by [[anthropology]], was interested in the process of change from the so-called primitive societies to increasingly advanced societies. In the United States, the emphasis was initially on change as an aspect of progress, but [[Talcott Parsons]] refocused on society as a system immersed in a constant process of increased differentiation, which he saw as a process in which new institutions take over the tasks necessary in a society to guarantee its survival as the original monolithic institutions break up. This is a devolution from single, less differentiated institutions to an increasingly differentiated subset of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, David (2005). ''On Secularization: Toward a Revised General Theory''. Ashgate Publishing Company, p. 20. ("Parsons saw differentiation as the separating out of each social sphere from ecclesiastical control: the state, science, and the market, but also law, welfare, and education etc.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Parsons, this concept of differentiation has been widely applied. As phrased by [[José Casanova (sociologist)|José Casanova]], this "core and the central thesis of the theory of secularization is the conceptualization of the process of societal modernization as a process of functional differentiation and emancipation of the secular spheres—primarily the state, the economy, and science—from the religious sphere and the concomitant differentiation and specialization of religion within its own newly found religious sphere". Casanova also describes this as the theory of "privatization" of religion, which he partially criticizes.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Jose (1994). ''Public Religions in the Modern World''. University of Chicago Press, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-226-09535-5}} ("Only in the 1980s, after the sudden eruption of religion into the public sphere, did it become obvious that differentiation and the loss of societal functions do not necessarily entail 'privatization.'")&lt;/ref&gt; While criticizing certain aspects of the traditional sociological theory of secularization, however, [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] argues that the concept of social differentiation has been its "most useful element".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues in secularization==
At present, secularization as understood in the West is being debated in the [[sociology of religion]]. In his works ''Legitimacy of the Modern Age'' (1966) and ''The Genesis of the Copernican World'' (1975), [[Hans Blumenberg]] has rejected the idea of a historical continuity – fundamental the so-called 'theorem of secularization'; the [[Modern history#Modern Age|Modern age]] in his view represents an independent epoch opposed to Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]] by a rehabilitation of human curiosity in reaction to theological absolutism. "Blumenberg targets [[Karl Löwith|Löwith]]'s argument that progress is the secularization of [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and [[Christian]] beliefs and argues to the contrary that the modern age, including its belief in progress, grew out of a new secular self-affirmation of culture against the [[Christian tradition]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cornelius A.|last= Buller|title=The Unity of Nature and History in Pannenberg's Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;printsec=frontcover|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EBwpiVj5skoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Hans+Blumenberg+targets+Lowith+'s+argument+that+progress+is+the+secularization+of+Hebrew+and+Christian+beliefs+and+argues+to+the+contrary+that+the+modern+age,+including+its+belief+in+progress,+grew+out+of+a+new+secular+self-affirmation+of+culture+against+the+Christian+tradition%22 95]|year=1996|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=[[Lanham, Maryland]]|id={{ISBN|0-822-63055-9}}; {{ISBN|978-08-2263-055-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfhart Pannenberg]], a student of Löwith, has continued the debate against Blumenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Wolfhart|last=Pannenberg|chapter=Christianity as the Legitimacy of the Modern Age (1968)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pannenberg+%22Christianity+as+the+Legitimacy+of+the+Modern+Age%22+%22The+Idea+of+God+and+Human+Freedom%22|title=The Idea of God and Human Freedom, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4mAQAAMAAJ|pages=178–191|year=1973|publisher=Westminster Press|location=London|id={{ISBN|0-664-20971-8}}; {{ISBN|978-06-6420-971-1}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] in "A Secular Age" challenges what he calls 'the subtraction thesis' – that science leads to religion being subtracted from more and more areas of life.

Proponents of "secularization theory" demonstrate widespread declines in the prevalence of religious belief throughout the West, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Steve. God is Dead: Secularization in the West. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Rodney Stark]], [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]]) have argued that levels of religiosity are not declining, while other scholars (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Mark Chaves]], [[N.&amp;nbsp;J. Demerath]]) have countered by introducing the idea of neo-secularization, which broadens the definition of secularization to include the decline of religious authority and its ability to influence society.

In other words, rather than using the proportion of irreligious apostates as the sole measure of secularity, neo-secularization argues that individuals increasingly look outside of religion for authoritative positions. Neo-secularizationists would argue that religion has diminishing authority on issues such as [[birth control]], and argue that religion's authority is declining and secularization is taking place even if religious affiliation may not be declining in the United States (a debate still taking place).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Finally, some claim that demographic forces offset the process of secularization, and may do so to such an extent that individuals can consistently drift away from religion even as society becomes more religious. This is especially the case in societies like [[Israel]] (with the [[Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] and religious [[Zionist]]s) where committed religious groups have several times the birth rate of seculars. The [[religious fertility effect]] operates to a greater or lesser extent in all countries, and is amplified in the West by religious immigration. For instance, even as native whites became more secular, [[London]], England, has become more religious in the past 25 years as religious immigrants and their descendants have increased their share of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

==Regional developments ==

===United States===

'''1870-1930'''. Christian Smith examined the secularization of American public life between 1870 and 1930. He noted that in 1870 a Protestant establishment thoroughly dominated American culture and its public institutions. By the turn of the 20th century, however, [[positivism]] had displaced the [[Baconian method]] (which had hitherto bolstered [[natural theology]]) and higher education had been thoroughly secularized. In the 1910s "legal realism" gained prominence, de-emphasizing the religious basis for [[law]]. That same decade publishing houses emerged that were independent of the Protestant establishment. During the 1920s secularization extended into popular culture and mass public education ceased to be under Protestant cultural influence. Although the general public was still highly religious during this time period, by 1930 the old Protestant establishment was in "shambles".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life''] (2012) pp.25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to understanding the secularization, Smith argues, was the rise of an elite intellectual class skeptical of religious orthodoxies and influenced by the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tradition. They consciously sought to displace a Protestant establishment they saw as standing in their way.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Christian. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=IbEwDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=info:paCf6RiVs7IJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;ots=F45PpKyvo0&amp;sig=Vn0tlVvnEiybdq2_KmevWlfig-c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Secular Revolution: Powers, Interests, and Conflicts in the Secularization of American Public Life] (2012) pp.32-43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2008-2017'''. Annual [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] polls from 2008 through 2015 showed that the fraction of American who did not identify with any particular religion steadily rose from 14.6% in 2008 to 19.6% in 2015. At the same time, the fraction of Americans identifying as [[Christianity in the United States|Christians]] sunk from 80.1% to 75% during the same time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/187955/percentage-christians-drifting-down-high.aspx|title=Percentage of Christians in U.S. Drifting Down, but Still High|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued until 2017 when 21.3% of Americans declared no religious identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/224642/2017-update-americans-religion.aspx|title=2017 Update on Americans and Religion|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that non-Christian religions stayed roughly the same (at about 5% from 2008 to 2015) secularization seems to have affected primarily Christians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Britain===
====History====

In Britain, secularization came much later than in most of Western Europe. It began in the 1960s as part of a much larger social and cultural revolution. Until then the postwar years had seen a revival of religiosity in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Callum G. Brown, ''The Death of Christian Britain: Understanding Secularisation, 1800-2000'' (2009) pp 170-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists and historians have engaged in vigorous debates over when it started, how fast it happened, and what caused it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Morris, "Secularization and religious experience: arguments in the historiography of modern British religion." ''Historical Journal'' 55#1 (2012): 195-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsorship by royalty, aristocracy, and influential local gentry provided an important support-system for organized religion. The sponsorship faded away in the 20th century, as the local élites were no longer so powerful or so financially able to subsidize their favourite activities. In coal-mining districts, local collieries typically funded local chapels, but that ended{{when|date=March 2016}} as the industry grew distressed and the unionized miners rejected élite interference in their local affairs. This allowed secularizing forces to gain strength.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bruce, "Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support Patronage and secularization: social obligation and church support," ''British Journal of Sociology'' (2012) 63#3 pp 533-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent developments====

Data from the annual [[British Social Attitudes Survey|British Social Attitudes survey]] and the biennial [[European Social Survey]] suggest that the proportion of Britons who identify as Christian fell from 55% (in 1983) to 43% (in 2015). While members of non-Christian religions – principally Muslims and Hindus – quadrupled, the  non-religious ("nones") now make up 53% of the British population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21728600-only-15-call-themselves-anglicans-dont-bet-church-losing-its-official-role-any-time|title=A majority of Britons now follow no religion|last=|first=|date=9 Sep 2017|website=The Economist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013065031/https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21728600-only-15-call-themselves-anglicans-dont-bet-church-losing-its-official-role-any-time|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than six in 10 “nones” were brought up as Christians, mainly Anglican or Catholic. Only 2% of “nones” were raised in religions other than Christian.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/uk-losing-faith-religion-young-reject-parents-beliefs|title=Nearly 50% are of no religion – but has UK hit ‘peak secular’?|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=2017-05-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-01|last2=correspondent|first2=religion|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831194722/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/13/uk-losing-faith-religion-young-reject-parents-beliefs|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who were brought up to practise a religion, but who now identifies as having no religion, so-called "non-verts", had different "non-version" rates, namely 14% for Jews, 10% for Muslims and Sikhs and 6% for Hindus. The proportions of the non-religious who convert to a faith are small: 3% now identify as Anglicans, less than 0.5% convert to Catholicism, 2% join other Christian denominations and 2% convert to non-Christian faiths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Hinduism]], which is the dominant way of life in [[India]], has been described as a 'culture and civilisation of ancient origin' that is 'intrinsically secular'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/hinduism-is-intrinsically-secular|title=Hinduism is intrinsically secular|website=www.sunday-guardian.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113224444/http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/hinduism-is-intrinsically-secular|archivedate=2014-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], post-independence, has seen the emergence of an assertive secular state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galanter|first=Marc|date=|title=Hinduism, Secularism, and the Indian Judiciary|url=|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===

One traditional view of Chinese culture sees the teachings of [[Confucianism]] - influential over many centuries - as basically secular.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Chang Pao-min]] summarises perceived historical consequences of very early secularization in China:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The early secularization of Chinese society, which must be recognized as a sign of modernity [...] has ironically left China for centuries without a powerful and stable source of morality and law. All this simply means that the pursuit of wealth or power or simply the competition for survival can be and often has been ruthless without any sense of restraint. [...] Along with the early secularization of Chinese society which was equally early, the concomitant demise of feudalism and hereditary aristocracy, another remarkable development, transformed China earlier than any other country into a unitary system politically, with one single power centre. It also rendered Chinese society much more egalitarian than Western Europe and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

In this arguably secular setting, the [[Chinese Communist Party]] régime of the [[People's Republic of China]] (in power on the Chinese mainland from 1949) promoted deliberate secularization.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Arab world ===
Many countries in the Arab world show signs of increasing secularization. For instance, in [[Egypt]], support for imposing [[sharia]] (Islamic law) fell from 84% in 2011 to 34% in 2016. Egyptians also pray less: among older Egyptians (55+) 90% prayed daily in 2011. Among the younger generation (age 18-24) that fraction was only 70%. By contrast, in 2016 these numbers had fallen to &lt;80% (55+) and &lt;40% (18-24).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The other age groups were in between these values. In [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]], the number of people listening to daily recitals of the quran fell by half from 2011 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 Nov 2017|title=The new Arab Cosmopolitans.|url=|journal=The Economist|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these developments seem to be driven by need, e.g. by stagnating incomes which force women to contribute to household income and therefore to work. High living costs delay marriage and, as a consequence, seem to encourage pre-marital sex.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, in other countries, such as [[Algeria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], support for sharia and islamist ideas seems to grow. Even in countries in which secularization is growing, there are backlashes. For instance, the president of Egypt, [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi]], has banned hundreds of newspapers and websites who may provoke opposition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8278">'''Seismic codes''' or '''earthquake codes''' are [[building codes]] designed to protect property and life in buildings in case of earthquakes. The need for such codes is reflected in the saying, "Earthquakes don't kill people&amp;mdash;buildings do." Or in expanded version, “Earthquakes do not injure or kill people. Poorly built manmade structures injure and kill people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitigation.eeri.org/files/resources-for-success/00022.pdf|title=Mitigation works: Earthquake|work=Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Seismic codes were created and developed as a response to major earthquakes which have caused devastation in highly populated regions. Often these are revised based on knowledge gained from recent earthquakes and research findings, and as such they are constantly evolving. There are many seismic codes used worldwide. Most codes at their root share common fundamental approaches regarding how to design buildings for earthquake effects, but will differ in their technical requirements and will have language addressing local geologic conditions, common construction types, historic issues, etc.

==Origin==
The [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] (Portugal) resulted in prescriptive rules for building certain kinds of buildings common in the area.{{cn|date=December 2017|reason=Need substantiation of this assertion. If true, what were the rules, who made them, how was it documented?}}

Following the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] (Italy) the Royal Government of Italy established Geological Committee and Engineering Committee in early 1909 to study the disaster and recommend earthquake disaster mitigation measures. The Engineering Committee, after studying the lateral load resistance of buildings which survived the earthquake motion, recommended that the seismic ratio (seismic acceleration divided by the gravity acceleration) equal to 1/12 for the first floor and 1/8 for the floors above should be used in seismic design of buildings. The Committee proposed equivalent vertical forces much larger than the horizontal forces because vertical motion acted as impacts. This is believed to be the first known quantitative recommendation of design seismic forces in the history of seismic codes. The recommendation was adopted in Royal Decree No. 573 of April 29, 1915. The height of the buildings was limited to two stories, and the first story should be designed for a horizontal force equal to 1/8 the second floor weight and the second story for 1/6 of the roof weight. &lt;ref name="Otani"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otani|first=Shunsuke|date=October 2008|title=The Dawn of Structural Engineering in Japan|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/14_S07-004.PDF|journal=14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] (Japan) and earlier events inspired Japanese engineer Toshikata Sano to develop a lateral force procedure that was officially implemented in the 1924 Japanese Urban Building Law, which directed engineers to design buildings for horizontal forces of about 10% of the weight of the building.&lt;ref name="Otani" /&gt;

In 1925, the city of Santa Barbara, California, added a building code requirement that structures be designed to withstand horizontal forces, but was nonspecific regarding design loads or procedure. This is considered to be the ﬁrst explicit policy and legal consideration of the seismic safety of structures in the U.S. The city of Palo Alto, California, led by professors at Stanford, also added similar language to its building code in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://quake06.stanford.edu/centennial/tour/stop10.html|title=Evolution of Codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1928, the first edition of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) was published, and included an appendix with non-mandatory matter with §2311 recommending a minimum lateral design force for earthquake resistance of V = 0.075W for buildings on foundations with allowable bearing pressures of 4,000 psf or more, and 0.10 W for all other buildings including those on pile foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uniform Building Code, 1927 Edition|last=|first=|publisher=International Conference of Building Officials|year=1928|isbn=|location=Long Beach, California|pages=213-214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building weight (seismic mass) was defined as: W = Dead load + Live load. These provisions were inspired by Japan's newly developed seismic code. The non-mandatory lateral design provisions are not known to have been explicitly adopted by any jurisdiction at the time, but may have been used voluntarily for the design of some buildings.&lt;ref name="SDG"&gt;{{Cite book|title=SEAOSC Design Guide Vol. 1 “City of Los Angeles Mandatory Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Non-Ductile Concrete Buildings”|last=|first=|publisher=International Code Council|year=2016|isbn=978-1-60983-697-9|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

In response to the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] (California) the city of Los Angeles adopted the first earthquake design provisions enforced in the U.S., enacted by City Council under Ordinance No. 72,968 published September 6, 1933.&lt;ref name="SDG" /&gt;{{rp|24}} The requirements included a design lateral base shear V = 0.08 W for regular use buildings, 0.10 W for school buildings and 0.04 W for the portion of a building above a flexible story. Building weight (seismic mass) was defined as W = Dead load + 0.5 Live load (except 1.0 Live for warehouses). Building frames were required to be designed to withstand at least 0.25V independent of any walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Los Angeles Annual Builders Guide, Vol. 10|last=|first=|publisher=Inter-State Educational Assn.|year=1933|isbn=|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=12 (amended insert from publisher)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]], careful analysis of structural failures in that quake by architect [[Louis John Gill]] formed the basis for much of the California seismic legislation ([[Field Act]] for schools and Riley Act for all buildings).&lt;ref&gt;[http://peer.berkeley.edu/tbi/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/performance_background.pdf PEER (Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley) Tall Buildings Initiative—Task 2 Workshop April 18, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kroll&gt;[https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/84summer/gill.htm Rev. C. Douglas Kroll, ''Journal of San Diego History'', "LOUIS JOHN GILL: Famous but Forgotten Architect", San Diego Historical Society Quarterly, Summer 1984, Volume 30, Number 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 Riley Act required all California local governments to have a building department and inspect new construction, mandating that all structures in the state be designed to withstand a horizontal acceleration of 0.02 times the acceleration due to gravity.

==Around the world==

===Mexico===
The first [[Mexico City]] building code was issued in 1942; since 1966, it contains a complete set of regulations for structural design and has served as a reference for municipalities across the country. In 1976, the code adopted a coherent format for all materials and structural systems, based on limit states design philosophy. In February 2004 a new set of seismic codes was issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/13_4000.pdf "SEISMIC DESIGN AND CODES IN MEXICO", Mario ORDAZ and Roberto MELIZ, 13th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering Vancouver, B.C., Canada, August 1-6, 2004, Paper No. 4000]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In Spain the seismic code is called the "Norma de Construcción Sismorresistente". (See the [[:es:Norma de Construcción Sismorresistente|article in Spanish Wikipedia]])

===United States===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
In the [[United States]] the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) publishes "Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/18152 "NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures. 2009 Edition", Federal Emergency Management Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SmartStax''' is a brand of [[Genetically modified plant|genetically modified]] seed made through a collaboration between [[Monsanto Company]] and [[Dow Chemical Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |accessdate=September 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525030040/http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/corporatenews/2007/20070914a.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2009 |title=Monsanto, Dow Agreement Paves the Way for Industry's First-Ever, Eight-Gene Stacked Offering in Corn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes advantage of multiple modes of insect protection and herbicide tolerance. SmartStax takes advantage of [[Yieldgard VT]] Triple (Monsanto), Herculex Xtra (Dow), RoundUp Ready 2 (Monsanto), and Liberty Link (Dow). The traits included protect against above-ground insects, below-ground insects, and provide broad herbicide tolerance.  It is currently available for [[maize|corn]], but [[cotton]], [[soybean]], and specialty crop variations are to be released. Previously, the most genes artificially added to a single plant was three, but Smartstax includes eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/smartstax-maize-germany-approval-428/|title=Monsanto’s SmartStax maize ‘to be approved for growth in October’ in EU|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smartstax also incorporates Monsanto's [[Acceleron Seed Treatment System]] which protects against insects at the earliest stages of development.  Smartstax is sold under the [[Genuity (Monsanto brand)|Genuity]] (Monsanto) and [[Mycogen Seeds|Mycogen]] (Dow) brands.

==Insect Spectrum==
SmartStax seeds control a broad spectrum of pests which includes larvae of above-ground insects such as European corn borer, black cutworm, southwestern corn borer, corn earworm, fall armyworm, western bean cutworm, and below-ground feeding larvae of western corn rootworm and northern corn rootworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowagro.com/en-us/usag/product-solution-finder/traits/smartstax|title=Dow AgroSciences SmartStax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuge acres==
To prevent or delay insect resistance, growers plant a refuge on their farm. This is an area of non-GM plants where insect can live. These insect will not evolve resistance to GM technology. These refuge acres ensure that rare resistant insects that feed on insect-protected varieties of corn will mate with susceptible insects and slow the development of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/corn-growers-reminded-follow-refuge-requirements-spring-planting-nears|title= Corn Growers Reminded to Follow Refuge Requirements as Spring Planting Nears|date=6 March 2009|author=Rob Korff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion and branding==
Smartstax corn has been advertised and promoted on television, at farm trade shows, and online as Monsanto has geared up for widespread commercial release. Smartstax is sold under the Genuity Brand by Monsanto and the Mycogen brand by Dow, but both companies have the right to sell it under as many names with as many additional technologies as they wish.

==Weed and insect resistance==
Recently, rapid emergence of weeds thought to be resistant to [[roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]] have been observed. [[Conyza|Horseweed]], [[giant ragweed]] and [[amaranth|pigweed]], among others have been found growing with crops across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/invasion-of-the-superweeds/?ref=energy-environment | work =New York Times | title = Invasion of the Superweeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12804 | publisher = The National Academies | title = GE Crops Benefit Farmers, But Management Needed to Maintain Effectiveness}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | title = Farmers Cope With Roundup-Resistant Weeds | publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Insects including [[western corn rootworm|corn rootworm]] and [[bollworm]] have also begun showing signs of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21829470 | year = 2011 | last1 = Gassmann | first1 = AJ | last2 = Petzold-Maxwell | first2 = JL | last3 = Keweshan | first3 = RS | last4 = Dunbar | first4 = MW | title = Field-evolved resistance to Bt maize by western corn rootworm | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e22629 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022629 | pmc = 3146474 | journal = PLOS ONE | editor1-last = Meyer | editor1-first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120605102846.htm | title = Bigger Refuges Needed to Delay Pest Resistance to Biotech Corn | publisher = Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080207140803.htm| publisher = Science Daily | title = First Documented Case Of Pest Resistance To Biotech Cotton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/12/05/143141300/insects-find-crack-in-biotech-corns-armor | title = Insects Find Crack In Biotech Corn's Armor | publisher = NPR Food Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Monsanto has continued to develop new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101118084429.htm | publisher = Science Daily | title = New Disease-Resistant Food Crops Under Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/monsanto-gm-super-insects | title = Attack of the Monsanto Superinsects | publisher = Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USDA]] approves use of [[Bacillus thuringiensis#Use of Bt genes in genetic engineering of plants for pest control|Bt crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |title=Adoption of Genetically Engineered Crops in the U.S.: Extent of Adoption |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610043433/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/biotechcrops/adoption.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto has denied there is a problem with their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/files/epa-hq-opp-2011-0922-0003.pdf| title = Memorandum | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerechtigkeit-1537.jpg|thumb|upright|A sword-wielding allegory of justice, painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in 1537]]
A '''sword of justice''' is a [[Ceremonial weapon|ceremonial]] [[sword]] used as insignia of a monarch's supreme [[judicial power]]. In some cases this may have been an [[executioner's sword]] that was no longer used for executions, becoming instead a ceremonial one.

The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] include two swords of justice: the sharply pointed Sword of Temporal Justice and the obliquely pointed Sword of Spiritual Justice, whose characteristics are said to indicate that only temporal courts have power over death. The current two swords, together with [[Curtana]], the Sword of Mercy, were made for coronation of [[Charles I of England]], which took place in 1626.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sword of Spiritual Justice |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/31729/the-sword-of-spiritual-justice |website=Royal Collection Trust |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sword of Temporal Justice |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/31731/the-sword-of-temporal-justice |website=Royal Collection Trust |accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Terrorism Act No 83 of 1967''' was a law of the [[South Africa]]n [[Apartheid]] regime until all except section 7 was repealed under the Internal Security and Intimidation Amendment Act 138 of 1991.

==Detention without trial==
Section 6 of the Act allowed someone suspected of involvement in [[terrorism]]—which was very broadly defined as anything that might "endanger the maintenance of law and order"—to be detained for a 60-day period (which could be renewed) without [[trial (law)|trial]] on the authority of a senior [[police]] officer. Since there was no requirement to release information on who was being held, people subject to the Act tended to [[Forced disappearance|disappear]].

The death of [[Steve Biko]] in police custody in 1977, while being detained under the Act, was a particular ''[[cause célèbre]]''. It is estimated that approximately 80 people died while being detained under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/1999/12/17/editoria/SNAPS.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other provisions==
Other provisions of the Act included the founding of the [[South African Bureau Of State Security|Bureau of State Security]].

[[File:Sugauli Treaty2.PNG|thumb|300px|The territorial effects of the Treaty of Sugauli.]]

[[File:Hindoostan map 1814.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Hindostan or India (1814) by [[Mathew Carey]].]]

The '''Treaty of Sugauli''' (also spelled '''Sugowlee''', '''Sagauli''' and '''Segqulee'''), the treaty that established the boundary line of Nepal, was signed on 2{{nbsp}}December 1815 and ratified by 4 March 1816 between the [[East India Company]] and King of [[Nepal]] following the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] of 1814-16. The signatory for Nepal was [[Raj Guru Gajraj Mishra]] aided by [[Chandra Sekher Upadhayaya]], the signatory for the Company was Lieutenant Colonel [[Paris Bradshaw]]. The treaty called for territorial concessions in which some of the territories controlled by Nepal would be given to British India, the establishment of a British representative in [[Kathmandu]], and allowed Britain to recruit [[Gurkha]]s for military service. Nepal also lost the right to employ any American or European employee in its service (earlier several French commanders had been deployed to train the Nepali army).

Under the treaty, some of the Nepalese controlled territory was lost including all the territories that the King of Nepal had won in wars in the last 25 years or so such as [[Sikkim]] in the east, [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]] (also known as Gadhwal) in the west. Some of the [[Terai]] lands were restored to Nepal in 1816 and more were restored in 1860 to thank for helping the British to suppress the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].

The British representative in Kathmandu was the first Westerner allowed to live in the post-Malla Era Nepal. (It is to be noted that few [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] operating were deported by the Gorkhas after conquering Nepal during the mid 18th century). The first representative was Edward Gardner, who was installed at a compound north of Kathmandu. That site is now called Lazimpat and is home to the Indian and British [[embassy|embassies]]. 

The Sugauli Treaty was superseded in December 1923 by a "treaty of perpetual peace and friendship," which upgraded the British [[Resident (title)|resident]] to an envoy. A separate treaty was signed with [[India]] (independent by now) in 1950 which established relations between the two countries.

== Background ==
The territories under Nepalese control included [[Darjeeling]] to the South-east, whole of [[Sikkim]] to the east, [[Nainital]] to the south-west and the [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]] to the west.

== Terms ==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
{{cleanup|reason=Verbatim quotes need to be clearly demarcated and sources cited|date=December 2014}} &lt;!-- Quotes and sources not clearly marked --&gt;
After the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]], a peace treaty was signed between the government of Nepal and the East India Company. It was agreed upon on 2 December 1815 by Raj Guru Gajaraj Mishra aided by Chandra Sekher Upadhyaya on behalf of the government of Nepal and Lt. Col. Paris Bradshaw on behalf of the Company. The signed copies of the treaty were exchanged on 4 March 1816 at [[Makwanpur District|Makawanpur]] by Chandra Sekhar Upadhayay and General [[David Ochterlony]]. The terms of the treaty were as follows:-

# There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the East India company and Nepal.
# The king of Nepal will renounce all claim to the lands which were the subject of discussion between the two States before the war; and will acknowledge the right of the company to the sovereignty of those lands.
# The king of Nepal will cede to the East India company in perpetuity all the under mentioned territories: i) The whole of low lands between the rivers Kali and Rapti. ii) The whole of low lands between Rapti and Gandaki, except Butwal. iii) The whole of low lands between Gandaki and Koshi in which the authority of the East India company has been established. iv) The whole of low lands between the rivers Mechi and Burma. v) The whole of territories within the hills eastward of the [[Mechi River|Mechi river]]. The aforesaid territory shall be evacuated by the Gorkha troops within forty days from this date.
# With a view to indemnify the chiefs and Bhardars of Nepal, whose interest will suffer by the alienation of the lands ceded by the foregoing Article (No. 3 above), the East India company agrees to settle pensions to the aggregate amount of two lakhs of rupees per annum on such chiefs as may be decided by the king of Nepal.
# The king of Nepal renounces for himself, his heirs, and successors, all claim to the territories lying to the West of the River Kali, and engaged never to have any concern with the appointed rulers of those territories or the inhabitants thereof.
# The king of Nepal engages never to molest or disturb the king of Sikkim in the possession of his territories. If any difference shall arise between Nepal and Sikkim, it shall be referred to the arbitration of the East India company.
# The king of Nepal hereby engages never to take or retain in his service any British subject, nor the subject of any European or American State, without the consent of the British Government.
# In order to secure and improve the relations of amity and peace hereby established between Nepal and Britain (East India company), it is agreed that [[List of British Resident Ministers in Nepal|accredited Ministers]] from each shall reside at the court of the other.
# This treaty shall be ratified by the King of Nepal within 15 days from this date, and the ratification shall be delivered to Lt. Col. Bradshaw, who engages to obtain and deliver to the king the ratification of the Governor-General within 20 days, or sooner, if practicable.

DONE at Sugauli, on the 2nd day of December 1815. 
PARIS BRADSHAW, LT.-COL., P.A.

Received this treaty from Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya, Agent on the part of the Raja of Nepal, in the valley of Makwanpoor, at half-past two o'clock p.m. on 4 March 1816, and delivered to them the Counterpart Treaty on behalf of the British Government.

[[David Ochterlony | DD. OCHTERLONY]], 
Agent, Governor-General 
Memorandum for the approval and acceptance of the Raja of Nepal, presented on 8 December 1816 
ADVERTING to the amity and confidence subsisting with the Raja of Nepal, the British Government proposes to suppress as much as possible, the execution of certain Articles in the Treaty of Sugauli, which bear hard upon the Rajah as follows:

With a view to gratify the Rajah in a point which he has much at heart, the British Government is willing to return the territories of Terai ceded to it by the Rajah in the Treaty, to wit, the whole Terai lands lying between the Rivers Kushwaha and Gandak, such as appertained to the Rajah before the late disagreement; excepting the disputed lands in the Jillas of Tirhoot and Sarun, and excepting such portions of territory as may occur on both sides for the purpose of settling a frontier, upon investigation by the respective Commissioners; and excepting such lands as may have been given in possession to any one by the British Government upon ascertainment of his rights subsequent to the cession of Terai to the Government. In case the Rajah is desirous of retaining the lands of such ascertained proprietors, they may be exchanged for others, and let it be clearly understood that, notwithstanding the considerable extent of the lands in the Jilla of Tirhoot, which have for a long time been a subject of dispute, the settlement made in the year 1812 of Christ, corresponding with year 1869 of Bikram Sambat, shall be taken, and everything else relinquished, that is to say, that the settlement and negotiations, such as occurred at that period, shall in the present case hold good and be established.

The British Government is willing likewise to return the territories of Terai lying between the Rivers Gandak and Rapti, that is to say, from the River Gandak to the western limits of the Jilla of Gorakhpur, together with Butwal and Sheeraj, such as appertained to Nepal previous to the disagreements, complete, with the exception of the disputed places in the Terai, and such quantity of ground as may be considered mutually to be requisite for the new boundary.

As it is impossible to establish desirable limits between the two States without survey, it will be expedient that Commissioners be appointed on both sides for the purpose of arranging in concert a well defined boundary on the basis of the preceding terms, and of establishing a straight line of frontier, with a view to the distinct separation of the respective territories of the British Government to the south and of Nepal to the north; and in case any indentations occur to destroy the even tenor of the line, the Commissioners should effect an exchange of lands so interfering on principles of clear reciprocity.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

And should it occur that the proprietors of lands situated on the mutual frontier, as it may be rectified, whether holding of the British Government of the Raja of Nepal, should be placed in the condition of subjects to both Governments, with a view to prevent continual dispute and discussion between the two Governments, the respective Commissioners should effect in mutual concurrence and co-operation the exchange of such lands, so as to render them subject to one dominion alone. 

In the event of the Rajah's approving the foregoing terms, the proposed arrangement for the survey and establishment of boundary marks shall be carried into execution, and after the determination in concert, of the boundary line, Sunnuds conformable to the foregoing stipulations, drawn out and sealed by the two States, shall be delivered and accepted on both sides.

EDWARD GARDNER 
Resident 
Substance of a Letter under the Seal of the Raja of Nepal, 
received on 11 December 1816

After compliments : 
I have comprehended the document under date 8 December 1816, or 4th of Push, 1873 Sambat, which you transmitted relative to the restoration, with a view to my friendship and satisfaction, of the Terai between the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the southern boundary complete, such as appertained to my estate previous to the war. It mentioned that in the event of my accepting the terms contained in that document, the southern boundary of the Terai should be established as it was held by this Government.

I have accordingly agreed to the terms laid down by you, and herewith enclose an instrument of 
agreement, which may be satisfactory to you. Moreover, it was written in the document transmitted by you, that it should be restored, with the exception of the disputed lands and such portion of land as should, in the opinion of the Commissioners on both sides, occur for the purpose of settling a boundary; and excepting the lands which, after the cessions of the Terai to the Honourable Company, may have been transferred by it to the ascertained proprietors. My friend, all these matters rest with you, and since it was also written that a view was had to my friendship and satisfactions with respect to certain Articles of the Treaty of Sugauli, which bore hard upon me, and which could be remitted, I am well assured that you have at heart the removal of whatever may tend to my distress, and that you will act in a manner corresponding to the advantage of this State and the increase of the friendly relations subsisting between the two Governments.

Moreover I have to acknowledge the receipt of the orders under the red seal of this State, addressed to the officers of Terai between the Rivers Gandak and Rapti, for the surrender of that Terai, and their retiring from thence, which was given to you at Thankote, according to your request, and which you have now returned for my satisfaction.

Substance of a Document under the Red Seal, received from the 
Durbar, on 11 December 1816 
With regard to friendship and amity, the Government of Nepal agrees to the tenor of the document under date 8 December 1816 or 4th Poos 1873 Sambat which was received by the Durbar from the Honourable Edward Gardner on the part of the Honorable Company, respecting the revertance of the Terai between the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the former southern boundary, such as appertained to Nepal previous to the war, with exception of the disputed lands.

Dated the 7th of Push 1873 Sambat

A subsequent agreement was made in December 1816 according to which Nepal got all the low lands (Terai) from Mechi, in the east, to Mahakali, in the west. Therefore, the indemnity of two lakhs of rupees ceased to continue. A land survey was also proposed to fix the boundary between the two States.

== Validity of the treaty ==
1. Article 9 of the treaty says that the treaty shall be approved by the King of Nepal, but records of the treaty being approved by [[Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah Deva|King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah]] have not been conclusively traced.

2. The British had feared that Nepal might not implement the treaty signed on 4 March 1816 by Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya. Therefore, General [[David Ochterlony]], on behalf of the British Government, ratified the treaty the same day and the counterpart treaty was handed over to Upadhyaya.

3. Some Nepalese [[nationalist]]s have argued that the treaty was signed between the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese Kingdom]] and the [[East India Company|British]] and thus "lacks the force to be implemented" between [[Republic of Nepal]] and [[Republic of India]].  However, the [[Republic of Nepal]] has assumed the duties and responsibilities of essentially all other treaties signed by the predecessor [[Kingdom of Nepal]], including membership in the [[United Nations]] and other comparable relationships.
But there exists no treaty or any other legal and formal conclusion that this Sugauli Treaty will be followed by these two independent nations [[Nepal]] and [[India]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13064">The '''Trenton Six''' is the group name for six [[African-American]] defendants tried for murder of an elderly white shopkeeper in January 1948 in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]]. The six young men were convicted in August 1948 by an [[all-white jury]] of the murder and sentenced to death.

Their case was taken up as a major civil rights case, because of injustices after their arrests and questions about the trial. The [[Civil Rights Congress]] and the [[NAACP]] had legal teams that represented three men each in appeals to the State Supreme Court. It found fault with the court's instruction to the jury, and remanded the case to a lower court for retrial, which took place in 1951. That resulted in a mistrial, requiring a third trial. Four of the defendants were acquitted. Ralph Cooper pleaded guilty, implicating the other five in the crime. Collis English was convicted of murder, but the jury recommended mercy - life in prison rather than execution.

The civil rights groups appealed again to the State Supreme Court, which found fault with the court, and remanded the case to the lower court for retrial of the two defendants who were sentenced to life. One was convicted in 1952 and the other pleaded guilty; both were sentenced to life. Collis English died in late December that year in prison. Ralph Cooper was paroled in 1954 and disappeared from the records.

==Crime==
On the morning of January 27, 1948, the elderly William Horner (1875–1948) opened his second-hand furniture store as usual, at 213 North Broad Street in Trenton. His common-law wife worked with him there. A while later, several young African-American men entered the store. One or more killed Horner by hitting him in the head with a soda bottle; some also assaulted his wife. She could not say for sure how many men were involved with the attack, saying two to four light-skinned [[African-American]] males in their teens had assaulted them.

==Arrests==
The Trenton police, pressured to solve the case, arrested the following men: Ralph Cooper, 24; Collis English, 23; McKinley Forrest, 35; John McKenzie, 24; James Thorpe, 24; and Horace Wilson, 37, on February 11, 1948. All were arrested without warrants, were held without being given access to attorneys, and were questioned for as long as four days before being brought before a judge. Five of the six men charged with the murder signed confessions written by the police.

==Trial==
The trial began on June 7, 1948, when the State of New Jersey opened its case against the six based on the five signed confessions obtained by the Trenton police. There was no other forensic evidence, and Horner's widow could not identify the men as the ones in her store.

The defendants were assigned four attorneys, one of whom was [[African American]]. On August 6, 1948 all six men were convicted and sentenced to death. All six had provided alibis for that day and had repudiated their confessions, signed under duress. An appeal was filed and an automatic stay of execution granted.

==Appeal==
In the process of appeal, the [[Communist Party USA]] took on the legal defense of half the defendants, with [[Emanuel Hirsch Bloch]] acting as their attorney.&lt;ref name=umkc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_BBLO.HTM |title=Emanuel Hirsch Bloch |quote=Emanuel "Manny" Bloch, along with his father Alexander, was the defense attorney for the Rosenbergs. He was known in the legal community as a defender of leftist sympathizers, most recently having defended the leader of the Communist party of Pittsburgh and the Trenton Six. |publisher=[[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] School of Law |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513154402/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_BBLO.HTM |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) defended the other three men, seeking to get their convictions overturned.  Among the NAACP attorneys were [[Thurgood Marshall]], who led many legal efforts by the organization; he later was appointed as the first African American to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]; [[Clifford Roscoe Moore, Sr.]], later appointed as U.S. Commissioner for [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the first [[African American]] appointed to such a position since post-Civil War Reconstruction; and [[Raymond Pace Alexander]], later to be appointed as a judge in Pennsylvania.

In 1949 the State Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court for retrial, ruling that the jury had been improperly charged in the first case.&lt;ref name="ssupreme"/&gt; In the course of the trial, the defense teams revealed that evidence had been manufactured. The medical examiner in Trenton was found guilty of [[perjury]].

==Outcome==
After a mistrial, four of the men were acquitted in a third trial.

Collis English was convicted. Ralph Cooper pleaded guilty, implicating the other five in the crime. The jury recommended mercy for these two men, with prison sentences rather than capital punishment. These two convictions were also appealed; the State Supreme Court said the court had erred again. It remanded the case to the lower court for a fourth trial in 1952.&lt;ref name="4th"/&gt;

English suffered a heart attack (myocardial infarction) soon after the trial and died in December 1952 in prison. Cooper served a portion of his prison sentence and was released on parole in 1954 for good behavior.&lt;ref name="cry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackwell|first1=John|title=1948: A cry for justice|url=http://www.capitalcentury.com/1948.html|publisher=The Trentonian|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Because of legal abuses in the treatment of suspects after the arrests, the case attracted considerable attention. The Civil Rights Congress and the NAACP generated publicity to highlight the racial inequities in the railroading of the suspects, their lack of access to counsel, the chief witness' inability to identify them, and other issues. Figures such as [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] to [[Pete Seeger]], then active in leftist movements, joined the campaign for publicity about obtaining justice in the trials of these men. [[Albert Einstein]] also protested the injustice. Commentary and protests were issued from many nations.

==The accused==
*Ralph Cooper (1924-?), pleaded guilty in the 4th trial and was sentenced to life. After being paroled in 1954, he disappeared from records.
*Collis English (1925–1952). Shortly after the fourth trial, he died in prison on December 31, 1952 of a heart attack. 
*McKinley Forrest (1913–1982). He was the brother-in-law of Collis English. Acquitted in the third trial in 1951.
*John McKenzie (1925-?), acquitted in 1951.
*James Henry Thorpe, Jr. (1913–1955), acquitted in 1951. He died in a car crash on March 25, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Trenton Six Man Dies.

*Horace Wilson (1911–2000), acquitted in 1951.

==Timeline==
* 1948 William Horner, a seventy-two-year-old junk shop dealer, was killed and his common-law wife beaten in Trenton, New Jersey on January 27. Although police alleged the motive was robbery, they recovered more than $1,500 from Horner's body. 
* 1948 The Trenton police arrested six African-American men, questioning them without access to attorneys. Five of the six men charged with the murder signed confessions on February 11.
*1948 The State of New Jersey opened its case against the six based on the five signed confessions. The defendants were assigned four attorneys on June 7.
*1948 All were convicted at trial in August and sentenced to death. All six had provided alibis for the time of the crime and repudiated their confessions. The defense raised serious doubts about the legality of the confessions. An appeal was filed with the State Supreme Court and an automatic stay of execution granted on August 6.
*1948 Bessie Mitchell, sister of Collis English, started a public speaking campaign questioning the trial. The [[Civil Rights Congress]], the legal arm of the communist party, hired O. John Rogge, [[William L. Patterson|William Patterson]] and Solomon Golat to serve as defense for three of the men, seeking to overturn the convictions. The NAACP represented the other three men, seeking the same goal.
*1949 [[Communist Party USA]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and [[NAACP]] supported the appeal. The State Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court for retrial.&lt;ref name="ssupreme"&gt;''[[Time (magazine)]];'' 11 July  1949; "The Trenton Six." Quote: "The State of New Jersey had no reason to feel proud of its solution of the murder of aged William Hormer, Trenton junkman. For five days in February 1948, the Trenton police turned the heat on six young Negro suspects, finally got all but one to sign confessions that they were parties to robbing old man Horner in his shop, and to beating him to death with a pop bottle. During the 55-day trial the prosecution refused to say whose fingerprints were found on the murder bottle (apparently the evidence would have helped the defense), and was upheld by the trial court. The six were found guilty, sentenced to die in the electric chair. The [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and the party-line [[Civil Rights Congress]] went to their rescue with rallies, demonstrations and screaming ''[[Daily Worker]]'' headlines calling it "a northern [[Scottsboro Boys|Scottsboro]] case." Non-Communist liberal groups joined in, and the case was carried to New Jersey's highest court. Last week Jersey justice redeemed itself. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that the Trenton Six had been convicted without getting their due rights under the law, set aside their sentence and ordered a new trial. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*1951 Prosecutor Mario Volpe's attack of appendicitis causes delay in the second trial on February 5.
*1951 Second trial resumed on March 5. 	
*1951 Four of the defendants were acquitted. Collis English and Ralph Cooper found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on June 14 	
*1951 A second appeal was made to the State Supreme Court for the two remaining defendants on September 11.
*1952 In November, the court ordered a new trial for English and Cooper.&lt;ref name="4th"&gt;"The Trenton Six," ''[[Time (magazine)]],'' 8 December 1952; Quote: "More than four years after the murder of William Horner, an elderly Trenton junkman, the case of the "Trenton Six" (TIME, July 11, 1949) was still dragging through New Jersey courts. The six Negroes convicted of the crime got a new trial in February 1951, after the state supreme court decided that they had been denied their due rights under law (e.g., the jury was improperly charged). After a mistrial, four of the defendants were finally acquitted, two were sent to prison for life. Last week, the New Jersey supreme court ruled that the lower court had erred again, ordered a fourth trial for the last two defendants. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
*1952 English died in prison on December 31.
*1953 Ralph Cooper pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison. 
*1954 Cooper was paroled for good behavior.
*1955 Former defendant James Henry Thorpe, Jr. died in a car crash on March 25.

== Background ==
Between 1980 and 2000, Peru experienced an era of political violence characterized by extensive human rights violations. Several regimes of military dictatorship resulted in political and economic instability that increased social tensions within Peru. The [[internal conflict in Peru]] was ignited by the 1980 Presidential election that led to [[guerrilla warfare]] by several political revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://modernlatinamericanart.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/civil-war-in-peru-1980-2000/|title=Civil War in Peru (1980-2000)|date=2013-05-08|work=modernlatinamericanart|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal armed conflict resulted in the deaths of approximately 700 000 people and the internal displacement of 600 000 people, as well as extensive damage to both public and private infrastructures. Both state and non-state actors carried out assassinations, kidnapping, [[forced disappearance]], tortures, unfair detentions, serious crimes and other human rights violations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cverdad.org.pe/ingles/lacomision/nlabor/antecedentes.php|title=Comisión de la verdad|website=www.cverdad.org.pe|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rebel groups remain lightly active, the government ended its engagement in the conflict after President Alberto Fujimori was forced to resign in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Shining Path ===
[[File:Flag of Sendero Luminoso.svg|thumb|239x239px|Flag of the Shining Path Revolutionary Group]]
{{Main|Shining Path}}The Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) is of the major Peruvian rebel groups involved in the internal conflict of Peru and was found to be largely responsible for the human rights violations during the 1980s and 1990s. The revolutionary group was organized as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] political group in 1970 after the dissolution of the [[Communist Party of Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shining-Path|title=Shining Path {{!}} Peruvian revolutionary organization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shining Path employed guerrilla tactics and violent acts of terrorism in an attempt to overthrow the military governments. The Shining Path ignited the internal conflict in 1980 when it began its revolutionary campaign with its first act of violence in [[Chuschi]], [[Ayacucho]] by storming the polling station and burning the ballot boxes on the eve of the first national elections in approximately 10 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://perureports.com/shining-path/|title=Profile of Shining Path {{!}} Peru Reports|work=Perú Reports|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the acts of violence by the Shining Path were carried out in the [[Ayacucho Region|Ayacucho]] region of Peru, where many [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous]] populations live in extreme poverty. The group established a presence throughout the country, but mainly operated out of the rural highlands with limited government presence. Their campaign consisted of bombings, assassinations, public executions and other guerrilla attacks against the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Alberto Fujimori ===
{{Main|Alberto Fujimori}}Alberto Fujimori served as President of Peru from 1990 to 2000 and was known for his corruption and crimes against humanity under international law. He was head of the [[Cambio 90]] political party, a new right-wing party.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Fujimori|title=Alberto Fujimori {{!}} Biography, Presidency, &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori carried out neo-liberal policies and implemented an austerity policy, known as Fujishock, to eliminate inflation but increase poverty.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The failure of the policy led to a military supported [[Self-coup|autogolpe]] (self-coup), declaring a state of emergency, dissolving Congress, and calling for a new constitution, in which Fujimori ran unopposed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Fujimori increased the government's influence over military operations, using it as primary means against the rebel groups. The government implemented an anti-insurgency campaign, including arming villagers and conducting secretive military trials of suspected members of rebel groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Fujimori was responsible for the [[Barrios Altos massacre]], where six members of the [[Military of Peru|Peruvian armed forces]] executed 15 people allegedly involved with the Shining Path, including one child, and left five injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cejil.org/en/barrios-altos|title=Barrios Altos {{!}} CEJIL|website=cejil.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corruption within the government further developed under Fujimori, as he used the  secret police to infiltrate opposing political parties, bribed legislators and electoral officials, censored the media, embezzled and redirected government funds, as well as carrying out human rights abuses, such as illegal arrests and torture.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Mandate ==
In December 2000, interim President [[Valentín Paniagua|Valentin Paniagua]] approved the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission, which ratified by President-elect Alejandro Toledo in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The commission was created to investigate a wide variety of human rights abuses, including assassinations, torture, disappearances, displacement, employment of terrorist methods and other violations executed by the state and rebel groups between May 1980 and November 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mandate was to analyze the causes of violence that had occurred, determine the scale of victimization, assess responsibility, and propose [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] and recommendations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heilman |first1=Jaymie |title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Peru |journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Latin American History |date=June 2018 |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.013.495|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of the mandate comprised an open list of acts of crime, allowing the commission to include all crimes deemed relevant.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The primary purpose of the commission was to establish the truth about crimes and events, providing a historical explanation by determining individual and group culpability for crimes and abuses. Despite the main purpose of exposing the truth, it was important to restore personal dignity, as victims became stigmatized by the public or local communities who assumed they were associated with rebel groups.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Eduardo|date=June 2013|title=Drafting a Truth Commission Mandate|url=https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Report-DraftingMandate-Truth-Commission-2013_0.pdf|journal=International Center for Transitional Justice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TRC organized its work into specialized units to conduct research in specific areas.

=== Objectives  ===
The TRC described 5 main objectives:

# Analyze the political, social and cultural conditions and behaviours that contributed to the violent conflicts in both State and societal context.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# Contribute to the administration of justice, and to clarify the crimes and violations to human rights committed by both terrorist organizations and the State.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# Determine the situation and identification of the victim, as well corresponding responsibilities when possible.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# Make moral and material proposals for victims or their relatives.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# Recommend necessary reforms for preventive measures to ensure no experiences are repeated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Areas of work ===
====National process of political violence====

The purpose of the area of study was to analyze political, social and cultural conditions that contributed to the situation of violence in Peru, including societal and state institutions as contributing factors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Violence influenced social, economic and political conditions of society, therefore the unit was devoted to the impact of national violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The analysis presented to the TRC focused on national level research and a historical interpretation of political violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Clarification of facts====

To clarify historical events, research was conducted to reconstruct the explanations of crimes and human rights violations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The tasks of the unit was to investigate specific cases of local experiences.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Testimonies of crimes and human rights violations were registered to provide in-depth studies of communities affected by the internal conflict.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Consequences, reparations and reconciliation====

The unit's objective was to determine the effects of political violence in various areas of Peru and on the lives of people living in those areas, group identified victims of political violence and ensure that victims were dignified in the process.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; From the conclusions, the group developed proposals for mechanisms that ensure reparation, prevention and reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Communications and education====

The unit designed and constructed social communication programs, citizen participation and education.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The group proposed several platforms, including mass and broadcast campaigns, seminars and forums, cultural and artistic activities, and volunteer programs.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Public hearings====

Public hearings were a mechanism to gather information of atrocities and relay it to the public. Peru was the first Latin American TRC to hold public hearings, a method popularized by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African TRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unspeakable Truths: Transitional Justice and the Challenge of Truth Commissions|last=Hayner|first=Priscilla B.|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TRC held hearings with testimonies that the commissioners heard directly, as well as being open to the public and broadcast on radio and television.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The objectives of public hearings were to incorporate the personal truth of the victims into the commission and convert the information into an instructional instrument, while recognizing the dignity of victims.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Public hearings validated the victims by providing them a public forum to share their experiences.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thematic hearings were held to examine critical aspects, such as anti-subversive legislation, displaced persons, universities, women, and teachers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

====Gender analysis====

The TRC's mandate did not include a specific obligation to a gender perspective or a special analysis of gender-based crimes, but it became concerned with incorporating a gender perspective in its work.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; A gender perspective widens the scope of victimization and introduces new crimes that are subject to investigation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The commission held a public forum to establish the importance of the role of women in the internal conflict, as well as provided training workshops for TRC teams and volunteers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It investigated how the violence affected men and women differently, the participation of women in the Shining Path and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and it considered a broad spectrum of sexual abuse and violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The TRC's final report included a chapter on [[Violence against women in Peru|sexual violence]] and gender analysis, as well as proposing several recommendations.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Authority ===
The mandate authorized specific framework for the TRC to work within. All relevant state information and documentation was made accessible to the commission.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission was authorized to conduct interviews to collect relevant information, including interviews of authorities and public officials.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Visits and inspections of affected areas were permitted with the assistance of experts. When necessary, the commission could request security measures for those who required them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission was authorized to develop public hearings and reserved procedures, establish communication channels, and promote participation of the population of those affected by political violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission did not have any jurisdictional functions, however it provided assistance in the prosecutions that developed as a result of the final report.

== Structure ==

=== Commissioners ===
The commission was composed of twelve Peruvian commissioners, ten men and two women. Initially it consisted of seven commissioners, however President Alejandro Toledo increased the number of commissioners, as well adding an observer position.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Commissioners were appointed by the President with the approval of the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To qualify for the position of commissioner, one had to be a Peruvian national with prestige and legitimacy, defending democratic and constitutional values.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2006|title=Gender, Justice, and Truth Commissions|url=|journal=The World Bank|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Offices ===
The commission opened five regional offices to cover all the national territory and carry out its work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Regional offices were located in [[Lima]], [[Huánuco|Huanuco]], [[Huancayo]], [[Huamanga|Hummanga]], and [[Abancay]], each focusing on specific provinces of Peru.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission had approximately five hundred people in their staff working within the regional offices.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Regional offices managed decentralized offices, known as Zone Offices, organized by a zone coordinator, as well as fixed and mobile teams.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The fixed and mobile teams collected testimonies, filled out records, made reports, investigated cases, and promoted dissemination and education initiatives.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Short-term teams and research groups have also been established to perform tasks for a fixed period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Mental Health Team ===
The Mental Health Team was to design and develop a psychosocial proposal that addressed the possible emotional impact of the TRC's process.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The team sought to understand the affects of crimes and human rights violations on individuals and their social relations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The team addresses subjective aspects and interrelated dimensions of individual and group dynamics to identify difficulties and resources for the commission.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; With results of the [[psychosocial]] analysis, the team presented alternative proposals and recommendations that offer strategies to address problems and create conditions that promote comprehensive development.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Documentation centre ===
The documentation centre provided information services to all teams and areas of the TRC.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Centre facilitated access to information on the commission's work by organizing and storing all documents into an official archive, including case, video, audio, photography and other files.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The internal service of the Centre terminated at the end of the commission's mandate, and all the documents were transferred to the [[ombudsman]]’s office.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Funding ===
The budget for the commission was approximately $13 million US for the 2 years of operation, and nearly half of the funding came from international donors.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[United Nations]] supported the Peruvian Government because of its commitment to truth and reconciliation. The UN argued that international funding must supplement the Government's effort, including a cancellation of debt to reallocate finances in support of social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2003/peruviancommissionPC.doc.htm|title=PRESS CONFERENCE ON PERU’S TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government signed an agreement with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) for the commission to receive funding.  The agreement transfers government resources to the UNDP, gives them authority over the allocation of funds, and commits the UNDP to provide management and auditing services&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Functions ==
The TRC's main objective was to investigate human rights violations, and was achieved through various research strategies that led to the commission's conclusions and recommendations. The commission's work was oriented towards investigating the truth, understanding the causes of violence, and ultimately proposing government reparations and reforms.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The research conducted by the commission covered nearly all national territories affected by the internal conflict, with an emphasis on remote communities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Collection of testimonies ===
Testimonies was considered to be an intrinsic aspect of the TRC's research because it allowed the voices of the victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission traveled throughout the entire country to gather testimonies from people from 129 provinces and 509 districts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Testimonies collected necessary data about the victims and events in which they were involved, in order to understand the complexity of the violence that the country experienced.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The TRC collected approximately 17 000 testimonies about the violence experienced in Peru between 1980 and 2000.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The collection of testimonies demonstrated how violence was experiences differently between groups of people throughout the country. Overall, 54% of testimonies were given by women; within the Ayacucho region, women gave 64% of the testimonies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Public hearings were used as a platform to publish testimonies. Those who provided private testimonies where invited to share them again at a public hearing. The TRC held 27 public hearings, featuring testimonies from 422 people on 318 separate allegations of human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Analysis of crimes and human rights violations ===
The commission used a systematization of the gathered information to analyze human rights violations in the period 1980 and 2000. An analysis of crimes committed by rebel groups or state agents, systematic or widespread practice of violations of human rights, and political strategies allows for the commission to determine responsibility for the violence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission focused on, but was not limited to, massacres, disappearances, torture, internal displacement, terrorist attacks, and violence against women.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The analysis of crimes and human rights violations provided a framework for recommendations of institutional reform policies necessary to consolidate a democratic and peaceful society.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Exhumations ===
The commission requested to observe [[exhumation]]s in order to address the numerous massacres committed by both state agents and rebel groups.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The remains of the victims were permitted to be claimed by their relatives to allow for dignified burials.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The TRC signed an agreement with the Attorney General's Office to assist in the exhumation of clandestine graves and the forensic examination of the remains.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The exhumations provided information on circumstances of death, identity of missing people, and used as evidence in prosecutions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The TRC oversaw three major exhumation projects, however official exhumations continued after the end of the TRC's mandate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 2,556 bodies have been found, of which 1,525 have been identified, and 1,366 have been claimed by their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/subsites/perus-painful-mirror/|title=ICTJ - Peru’s Painful Mirror|website=www.ictj.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missing persons initiative ===
The commission argued that forced disappearances is not only a violation of the individual's human right, but is also cruelty towards the family that lives in permanent uncertainty, and thus the missing persons committee was created to assist friends and families of the victims of disappearances.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; An estimated 15,000 people disappeared within the timeframe of the TRC's mandate.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icmp.int/the-missing/where-are-the-missing/peru/|title=ICMP  Peru|website=www.icmp.int|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final report of the TRC, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] published a provisional list of the missing people as a joint effort with TRC, Public Prosecutor's Office, and the National Coordinator for Human Rights.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== In-depth case studies ===
The commission gathered information through in-depth case studies to understand the nature of the human rights violations. The cases demonstrate the complexity of violence and reveal patterns, such as rape, violence by regions, behaviours of the conflict actors, and political strategies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Case studies provided information of the circumstances of specific situation, and simultaneously allows the commission to recompose the order of events.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The commission conducted interviews with actors and witnesses of violence to gain regional stories and clarify historical events.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Photographic project ===

The photography project was a means of reconciliation intended to understand various aspects and effects of the internal conflict through a visual narrative to impact the future and ensure that the situation is not repeated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The TRC commissioned a transmedia photography project, Yuyanapaq, to build a collective memory of the internal conflict.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artreconciliation.org/arts-and-reconciliation/case-studies/yuyanapaq/|title=Yuyanapaq – Art &amp; Reconciliation|website=artreconciliation.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuyanapaq means 'to remember' in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], Peru's predominant indigenous language.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The photography exhibition was established based on the assertion that truth is expressed in many forms and to recount and visual representations are invaluable to reconcile with the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milton|first=Cynthia|date=2007|title=At the edge of the peruvian truth commission: Alternative paths to recounting the past|url=|journal=Radical History Review|volume=|pages=3–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was led by Mayu Mohanna and Nancy Chappell, selecting images from over 90 archives, including photos from personal albums, the press and news agencies, the Armed Forces and Police, human rights organizations, community photography projects, and the Church.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Yuyanapaq became available through an online photographic archive, photography book, photo exhibition, and multiple travelling exhibitions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Conclusions ==
The TRC's two years of investigations and research led to several conclusions that were presented in the final report, released on August 28, 2003.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Based on evidence discovered during the investigations of deaths and disappearances, the TRC was able to provide an accurate estimation of the number deaths that were the result of the internal conflict. It was originally estimated that only 24,000 people died or disappeared, however the TRC concluded that approximately 69,280 died or disappeared as a result of the internal conflict in Peru between 1980 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last1=Ball|first1=Patrick|last2=Asher|first2=Jana|last3=Sulmont|first3=David|last4=Manrique|first4= Daniel|date=August 28, 2003|title=How many Peruvians have died?|url=https://hrdag.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aaas_peru_5.pdf|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRC assessed responsibility for the crimes and human rights violations and determined key the perpetrators. The Shining Path was the principle perpetrator, being responsible for 54% of the deaths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Shining Path targeted unarmed civilians as part of their strategy to devastate communities as a whole.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/92000/amr460032004en.pdf|journal=Amnesty International|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was responsible for 1.5% of the deaths and 1.8% of the total number of human rights violations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Rebel groups were largely responsible for the recruitment of minors who were apprehended and forced to participate in acts of war.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Peruvian state was responsible for 37% of the deaths and disappearances, including agents of the military, police, other security forces, and political parties.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Various human rights violations were carried out by State officials to obtain information, confessions, or incriminate others, as well as to punish individuals and communities.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; State agents systematically inflicted torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, mainly in military detention centres, police stations, and counter-terrorism units.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 83% of sexual violence against women and girls were attributed to state officials.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The TRC also discovered that rural areas were disproportionately affected by violence, especially those of indigenous communities. Indigenous peoples have historically been the country's most marginalized population, and they became the groups most affected by violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Although only 29% of the national population lives in rural regions, they represented 79% of the victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  75% of those who died as a result of the conflict spoke Quechua or another Indigenous language as their first language, when only 16% of the national population's first language is an Indigenous language.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Violence was most concentrated in rural, Indigenous, and impoverished regions of the country, in which 45% of reported deaths and disappearances were from the Ayacucho region.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall, 85% of victims were from the departments of Ayacucho, Junín, Huánuco, Huancavelica, Apurímac and San Martín.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Although the internal conflict was not caused by ethnic tensions, the TRC argues that the results represent veiled racism that exists in Peruvian society.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Recommendations ==

=== Reconciliation with justice ===
The TRC understood reconciliation as a foundational pact between the State and society to build a better country, therefore reconciliation must use the justice system to provide reparations and punish the perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The TRC recommended that all those accused of crimes and human rights abuses must assume responsibility before the courts, and no one should be given amnesty.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 43 cases including killings, extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, and sexual violence and massacres in communities and prisons were forwarded to the Ombudsman's Office and the Public Prosecutor's Office, identifying both State agents and opposition groups as perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Institutional reforms ===
The TRC recommended institutional reforms as a preventative measure to ensure that an internal conflict will not reoccur.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2009|title=What lessons have been learnt|url=http://www.perusupportgroup.org.uk/files/fckUserFiles/file/Resourses/Update%20Extras/Update%20Extra%20-%20Truth%20&amp;%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20Five%20Year%20Anniversary.pdf|journal=Peru Support Group|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State presence====

The results of investigations demonstrated that the extent of conflict depended on State presence or institutional mechanisms of regions.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The TRC recommended that the rights of indigenous peoples should be recognized and protected in national legislation to reaffirm diversity and plurality in Peru.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Mechanisms should be implemented to prevent abuses by establishing policies and standards for law enforcement that facilitate collaboration between the National Police, municipal authorities, and citizens.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Security forces====

The TRC recommended that the government should create new regulations to limit the powers of armed forces during a [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Recommendations for the development of a national security policy and establishment of civilian authority over military intelligence services were issued, as well as to determine respective jurisdictions between the Armed Forces and the Police.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Administration of justice====

The TRC recommended that military jurisdiction be limited to service-related offences to strengthen the independence of the justice system.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The commission stated that International human rights law and international humanitarian law should be incorporated into domestic legislations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The TRC also recommended reforms to the prison system to guarantee rights for detainees, as wells as introducing rehabilitation and social reintegration programs.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Education system====

The TRC recommended that the education system promote and respect for ethnic and cultural differences by integrating children from the poorest areas that were most affected by the violence.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Basic literacy should be taught to teenage and adult women in rural areas with high literacy rates, as well as an improvement to infrastructure and staffing in rural schools.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Reparations ===
The TRC recommended the creation of an Integral Reparations Plan to provide reparations to victims &amp; victims' families.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The Integral Reparations Plan was a comprehensive plan to help victims of the internal armed conflict to regain their personal dignity and ensure they are given back their rights as citizens, as well as providing compensation for the social and material damage caused to their community.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Beneficiaries of the Plan are any individual who suffered abuses of international human rights law, including those who were subject to forced disappearance, kidnapping, extrajudicial execution, murder, displacement, arbitrary detention, forced recruitment, torture and rape, as well as those who were injured or killed as a result of attacks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The TRC also recommended several different types of reparations:

====Symbolic reparations====

The TRC recommended that places associated with human rights violations be shut down or renovated, including certain detention centres such as Challapalca Prison and El Callao Naval Base.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Events should also be held to recognize the importance and seriousness of the human rights violation that occurred.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Reparations in health====

Free health care programs should be implemented to provide mental and physical treatment, including specialists for women.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Reparations in education====

Grant programs should be created to exempt those who were forced to give up education from paying tuition fees.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Adult education program programs should be implemented in areas most affected by violence.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Reparations in society====

The commission recommended reparations related to the restoration of full citizen status and elimination of social stigma.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The legal status of the "disappeared" should be changed to "absent due to disappearance" to allow relatives to settle succession, property and ownership of goods matters.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The legal situation of citizens who were wrongly accused of terrorism should be regularized, as well as expunging records of innocent prisoners who have been acquitted.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The TRC recommended a general program that issues new documentation to those without identity documents as a result of the internal conflict.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

====Financial reparations====

Individual compensation should be offered to the relatives of those who died or disappeared, people left with physical or mental disabilities, people who were unjustly imprisoned, and the victims of sexual violence and children born as a result of rape.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Collective compensation should be offered to rebuild institutions in indigenous communities and other regions in which social and physical infrastructure were lost as a result of the internal conflict.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Forensic program ===
The TRC recommended for the continuation of exhumations and investigations into the disappeared. The development of the National Anthropological-Forensic Research Plan is intended to authenticate burial sites and reveal more accurate number of deaths from the internal conflict.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The TRC argued that progress can be made in investigations, legal proceedings, and the reparation process by returning remains of victims.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Impact ==
The High Level Multi-Sectoral Commission was established to supervise collective reparations to communities affected by the violence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This Commission followed up on the recommendations of the TRC and oversaw State action and policy on matters relating to peace, reparations and reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Its goal was to implement reparations programs to re-build social links between State and Community, however only 65% of projects were carried out by 2007.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

By 2004, 3 of the 43 cases submitted to the Public Prosecutor's Office by the TRC have been brought to trial: the alleged arrest and extrajudicial execution of residents of the district of Totos in Ayacucho in April 1983; extrajudicial executions of the Quispillaccta peasant community, in the district of [[Chuschi District|Chuschi]], in March 1991; and the murder of 34 inhabitants of Lucmahuaycco in November 1984.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 81 cases were completed at the National Criminal Division between 2005 and 2011, which resulted in 58 convictions and 195 acquittals.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Cristián|date=June 2013|title=Reparations in Peru From Recommendations to Implementation|url=|journal=International Center for Transitional Justice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a Comprehensive Reparations Plan was approved and issued by executive decree 2006, comprising six programs: Restitution of Civil Rights, Education, Health Care, Collective Reparations, Symbolic Reparations, Promotion and Access to Housing, and Economic Reparations or Compensation.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Since 2005, The [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] has found the state of Peru liable for 16 violations of human rights committed during the internal armed conflict, including for massacres, summary executions, enforced disappearances, torture, and violations of judicial guarantees.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; On October 13, 2006, a civil anti-terrorism sentenced the Shining Path's leader and his deputy to life in prison, as well as delivering lesser sentences to ten other rebel leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2008, The National Council for Reparation began began registering victims in order to provide individual reparations according to the TRC recommendations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2013, the council had registered 160,429 individual victims and 7,678 communities, including 32 organizations of displaced people.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In 2012, the High Level Multi-Sectoral Commission proposed the Comprehensive Reparations Plan, a 5 year financial compensation program.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  By December 2012, 17,652 victims were beneficiaries of compensation, a total investment of 96 million soles ($36.7 millions US).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Prosecution of Fujimori ==
{{Main|Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial}}
On 27 August 2001, the Peruvian Congress lifted Alberto Fujimori's immunity and declared that he was responsible for crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/alberto-fujimori/|title=Alberto Fujimori - TRIAL International|work=TRIAL International|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Toledo requested the Japanese authorities to extradite Fujimori to Peru, but was rejected. On 7 November 2005, Fujimori was arrested in Chile at the request of the Peruvian government, and later transported to Peru to be put on trial on 22 September 2007.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Fujimori was on trial for human rights abuses from December 2007 until April 2009.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The charges against him in regards to major incidences of crimes and violations:  The 1991 Barrios Altos massacre, the killings of nine students and a professor at [[La Cantuta University]] in 1992, and the kidnappings of journalist [[Gustavo Gorriti]] and businessman Samuel Dyer.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other charges against Fujimori included abuse of authority, illegal wiretapping, bribery, and corruption.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Peru]] found Fujimori guilty, and he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; He was also ordered to pay reparations to survivors and victims’ relatives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; An appeal was filed, however the verdict was sustained.

On 10 October 2012, Fujimori submitted a petition for presidential pardon on humanitarian grounds, due to tongue cancer.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; On 24 December 2017, President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] granted Fujimori medical pardon, after he had served 12 years of his sentence.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The victims of [[Pativilca]] requested the National Criminal Court to deny the pardon. On 19 February 2018, the National Criminal Court ruled that the former president must stand trial for his responsibility crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Reactions ==
The TRC generated controversies throughout the mandate and with its final report. Some argue that the TRC's mandate was too focused and did not adequately address certain communities' experiences. Approximately 200 000 impoverished Indigenous women were sterilized without proper consent by the Fujimori government, and the final report was insufficient in acknowledging the impact on their communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Many of the controversies are related to the Shining Path. Many argue that the TRC's final report is biased against the Peruvian military and biased toward the Shining Path and other rebel groups.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Commissioner Sofia Macher referred to the Shining Path as a “political party”, and many Peruvians felt that was suggesting that the commission was sympathetic to terrorism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite the report's conclusions that the majority of human rights violations were carried out by rebel groups, the TRC still received criticisms for its "anti-military" bias.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many members of Peruvian society argue that Shining Path members were terrorists, and are therefore undeserving to be labelled a victim, as well as arguing that state forces were doing their constitutional duty during the years of violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;
[[File:Memorial El ojo que llora (panorámica).jpg|thumb|337x337px|El Ojo que Llora. The monument to commemorate the victims killed during the internal conflict of Peru.]]
Social stigma exists within Peruvian society that associates former rebel group members with terrorism, and that they are not truly victims of the internal conflict. A monument called El Ojo que Llora (The Eye that Cries) was built in 2005 to commemorate the victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The fountain is surrounded by rocks with inscriptions of the victims of violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In November 2006, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered that the names of the forty-one victims of the 1992 massacre in Castro Castro prison be added to the monument.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many of these victims were members of the Shining Path, causing outrage by some members of society. The monument was vandalized in 2007.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Despite the criticisms and controversies of the TRC, the commission is often regarded as one of the most successful truth and reconciliation commission. [[Priscilla Hayner]] argues that Peru's TRC is one of the strongest commissions for its thorough investigations within a wide scope of human rights abuses. The TRC is recognized for the successful execution of a wide and complex mandate, and is studied by different countries engaged in truth-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ictj.org/news/ten-years-after-peru-truth-commission|title=Ten Years After Peru’s Truth Commission {{!}} ICTJ|date=2013-08-19|work=International Center for Transitional Justice|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TRC was a success when analyzed by its mandate and final report.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Within the 2 years of work, the TRC established the truth about two decades of violence, provided comprehensive recommendations for reforms, prosecutions, and reparations that could begin the process of reconciliation, as well as completing the final report that was disseminated to the public.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In 2006, the [[United States Department of Justice]] alleged in '''''United States v. Ike Brown''''' that the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, in [[Noxubee County, Mississippi]], headed by Ike Brown, had violated the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] (VRA) with regards to the county's white minority. The suit alleged that Brown, the chairman of the Committee, had conspired to orchestrate "relentless racial discrimination" against white voters.&lt;ref name="nossiter"&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam|last=Nossiter|title=U.S. Says Blacks in Mississippi Suppress White Vote|work=The New York Times|date=2006-10-11|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/us/politics/11voting.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ari|last=Shapiro|title=White Voters in Mississippi Allege Voting Discrimination|work=National Public Radio|date=2005-11-14|format=audio|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5011333|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time the VRA had been used to allege discrimination against whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United States of America v. Ike Brown Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee |url=https://mscivilrightsproject.org/noxubee/event-noxubee/united-states-of-america-v-ike-brown-noxubee-county-democratic-executive-committee/ |website=Mississippi Civil Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2007, United States District Judge [[Tom S. Lee]] ruled that Brown (a twice-convicted felon), in conjunction with the Noxubee Democratic Executive Committee, had ''"manipulated the political process in ways specifically intended and designed to impair and impede participation of white voters and to dilute their votes."'' The 104-page opinion held that the Voting Rights Act is a colorblind statute and protects all voters from racial discrimination, regardless of the race of the voter. The Court ruled that the Noxubee County Democratic Party had an illegal intent to discriminate against white voters in violation of Section 2 of the VRA. 

The United States entered in a consent decree with the Noxubee County superintendent of general elections, administrator of absentee ballots, registrar, and the county government. The consent decree prohibited a wide range of discriminatory and illegal voting practices, and required these officials to report such incidents if they received information that they were continuing. This consent decree was approved by the district court and filed simultaneously with the filing of the complaint. Brown told ''The New York Times'' that he had not signed any such papers.&lt;ref name="nossiter"/&gt;

'''''Walker v. Armco Steel Corp.''''', 446 U.S. 740 (1980), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which the Court further refined the test for determining whether federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state law as opposed to federal law.  The question in Walker is whether in a diversity action the federal court should follow state law or, alternatively, Rule 3 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in determining when an action is commenced for the purpose of tolling the state [[statute of limitations]] (SOL). The Court found no such conflict because a court’s refusal to apply the federal rule at issue would not in fact thwart some purpose the federal rule was intended to achieve. Favored treatment for federal procedural rules under the [[Rules Enabling Act]] is only appropriate when a rule is in fact applicable.

== Background information ==
The case dealt with a [[negligence]] claim brought by an [[Oklahoma]] plaintiff in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]] against the defendant, a foreign corporation having its principal place of business in a state other than Oklahoma. Plaintiff was injured August 22, 1975. The [[complaint]] was filed on August 19, 1977, and the summons was issued that day. However, service of process was not made on the respondent until December 1, 1977. On January 5, 1978, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it was barred by the applicable Oklahoma Statute of Limitations. Though the action was filed within the two-year SOL, the action is only deemed commenced when the service of the summons is made on the respondent, which in this case occurred after the SOL. Okla. Stat., Tit. 12 § 95 (1971) does not deem the action "commenced" for the purposes of the statute of limitations until [[Service of process|service]] of the summons on the defendant. However, if the complaint is filed within the limitations period, the action is deemed to have commenced from the date of filing if the plaintiff serves the defendant within 60 days, even though that service may occur outside the limitations period.

The District Court dismissed the complaint as being barred by the statute of limitations under the state law of Oklahoma on the grounds that state law applied.  The [[Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] affirmed.

== Court's decision ==
The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, holding that the action was barred by the Oklahoma statute of limitations because the scope of Rule 3 was not sufficiently broad to control the issue before the District Court. There was no indication that the Rule was intended to toll a state statute of limitations, much less that it purported to displace state tolling rules for purposes of state statutes of limitations. In diversity actions, Rule 3 governs the date from which various timing requirements of the Federal Rules begin to run, but does not affect state statutes of limitations.

In contrast to Rule 3,  the Oklahoma statute is a statement of a substantive decision by that [[U.S. state|State]] that actual service on, and accordingly actual notice to,  the defendant is an integral part of the policies.   The establishment of a deadline gives the defendant legitimate peace of mind,  and recognizes that after a certain period of time,  it is unfair to require the defendant to piece together his defense to an old claim.   Rule 3 does not replace such policy determinations found in state law, and that Rule and § 97 can exist side by side, each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict.   The analysis regarding whether state or federal procedural law applies is not applicable because there is no direct conflict.   In this case, both the applicable federal and state rules, Rule 3 and Okla. Stat., Tit. 12 § 97 (1971),  "can exist side by side...each controlling its own intended sphere of coverage without conflict."
