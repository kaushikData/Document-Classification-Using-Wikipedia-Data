'''''A Deepness in the Sky''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Vernor Vinge]]. Published in 1999, the novel is a loose [[prequel]] (set twenty thousand years earlier) to his earlier novel ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992). The title is coined by one of the story's main characters in a debate, in a reference to the hibernating habits of his species and to the vastness of space.

==Background==
The plot begins with the discovery of an intelligent [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] species on a planet orbiting an anomalous star, dubbed OnOff because for 215 of every 250 years it is dormant, releasing almost no energy. During this period, the planet freezes and its fauna go into [[hibernation]]. The planet's inhabitants, called "Spiders" by the humans for their resemblance to [[arachnid]]s, have reached a stage of [[Technological evolution|technological development]] very similar to that of Earth's humans in the early 20th century, although humans believe that they may once have been capable of space travel. If this is true, then whoever can establish ties with the aliens first could reap unimaginable rewards; humans have made contact with only one other intelligent (but non-technological) alien species in millennia of travel through the stars. Two human groups launch expeditions to the Spider world: the Qeng Ho (pronounced ''Chung Ho'' and named after the explorer [[Zheng He]]), [[merchant|traders]] who have developed a common interstellar culture for humanity; and the Emergents, a civilization that literally enslaves selected human minds and has only recently re-emerged from a Dark Age.

==Plot summary==
The Qeng Ho arrive at the OnOff star shortly before the Emergent fleet, a few years before the sun turns on, at which point the Spider civilization will "wake up" and continue its climb into a technological civilization. A reception held by the Emergents doubles as a vector to infect the Qeng Ho with a timed "mindrot" virus. The Emergents time an ambush to take advantage of the onset of symptoms.

During these events, a concurrent history of the Spider civilization unfolds – mainly through the [[Picaresque novel|picaresque]], and then increasingly political and technocratic, experiences of a small group of liberal-minded and progressive Spiders. Their struggles against ignorance and obsolescent traditions are coloured with oddly human-like descriptions and nomenclature, prefiguring some major plot revelations towards the end of the story.

Far above, after a close fight, the Emergents subjugate the Qeng Ho; but losses to both sides force them to combine and adopt the so-called "Lurker strategy", monitoring and aiding the Spiders' technological development, waiting until they build up the massive infrastructure and technological base that the visitors need in order to repair their vessels.

The mindrot virus originally manifested itself on the Emergents' home world as a devastating plague, but they subsequently mastered it and learned to use it both as a weapon and as a tool for mental domination. Emergent culture uses mindrot primarily in the form of a variant which technicians can manipulate in order to release [[neurotoxin]]s to specific parts of the brain. An active [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]-type device triggers changes through [[diamagnetism|dia-]] and [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] biological molecules. By manipulating the brain in this way, Emergent [[management|manager]]s induce obsession with a single idea or specialty, which they call [[hyperfocus|Focus]], essentially turning people into brilliant [[information appliance|appliances]]. Many Qeng Ho become Focused against their will, and the Emergents retain the rest of the population under [[mass surveillance]], with only a portion of the crew not in [[suspended animation]]. The Qeng Ho trading culture gradually starts to dilute this, by demonstrating to the Emergents certain benefits of tolerated and restricted [[free trade]]; the two human cultures merge to some extent over the decades of forced co-operation.

[[Pham Nuwen]], the founder of the Qeng Ho trading culture, is living aboard the fleet under the pseudonym Pham Trinli, posing as an inept and bumbling fleet elder. He subverts the Emergents' own oppressive security systems through a series of high-risk ruses.  During his plotting he begins to admire the Emergents' Focus technology, seeing it as the missing link in his lifelong goal to create a true interstellar empire and break the cycle of collapse-and-rebuild that plagues human planetary civilizations.

The plan to wrest fleet control from the Emergents, however, requires the co-operation of Ezr Vinh, a much younger Qeng Ho who, through attrition, has become the Qeng Ho "Fleet Manager".  Ezr's position as the unique liaison officer between Qeng Ho and Emergents leads him to despair, and he accepts Pham Nuwen's offer to join a plot against the Emergents as a way to personal redemption as well as to take revenge against the Emergents. However, his understanding of Pham's ambitions for Focus technology leads to a confrontation between them over the future use of Focus by the Qeng Ho. With new knowledge of the effects and victims of Focus, Pham is forced to admit the cost is too high, and the two reach an agreement and continue their plotting.

The critical moment comes when the Emergents attempt to provoke a nuclear war on the Spider home-world in order to seize power. The conspirators subvert the Emergents' systems and put their plans in action, but so do a small group of Spiders who have become aware of the humans and have been working in secret for years to subvert their Focused as well. Together, the two sides successfully defeat the ruling class of the Emergents.

The combined Emergent/Qeng Ho fleet now negotiates with the Spider civilization as a trading partner.  Pham announces his plans to free all of the Focused in the entire Emergent civilization, and, if he survives that, to go to the Galactic Center to find the source of the OnOff star and the strange technology remnants that have clearly traveled with it.

==Elements==

===Interstellar culture===
The book discusses some of the problems of trying to maintain an interstellar trading culture without access to [[Faster-than-light|superluminal travel]] or to [[superluminal communication]]. Time-measurement details provide an interesting concept in the book: the Qeng Ho measure time primarily in terms of seconds, since the notion of days, months, and years has no usefulness between various star-systems. The timekeeping system uses terms such as [[kilosecond]]s and [[megasecond]]s. The Qeng Ho's computer and timekeeping systems feature the advent of "[[software archaeology|programmer archaeologists]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/11/04/0622246 |title=No More Coding From Scratch? |date=November 4, 2006 |work=Slashdot}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the Qeng Ho are packrats of [[computer program]]s and systems, retaining them over millennia, even as far back to the era of [[Unix]] programs (as implied by one passage mentioning that the fundamental time-keeping system is the [[Unix epoch]]:

{{bquote|Take the Traders' method of timekeeping.  The frame corrections were incredibly complex - and down at the very bottom of it was a little program that ran a counter. Second by second, the Qeng Ho counted from the instant that a human had first set foot on Old Earth's moon. But if you looked at it still more closely ... the starting instant was actually about fifteen million seconds later, the 0-second of one of Humankind's first computer operating systems.}}

This massive accumulation of data implies that almost any useful program one could want already exists in the Qeng Ho fleet library, hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs.

===Localizers===
{{further information|Smartdust}}
With this work, Vinge introduces "localizers" to his set of science-fiction concepts. Localizers are tiny devices which can contain a simple processor, sensors, and short-range communications. Vinge explores how intelligent control can use [[mesh network]]ing of these devices in ways quite different from those of traditional computer networks.

===Relation to ''A Fire Upon the Deep''===
Only one concrete connection links ''A Deepness in the Sky'' with ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'': the character of [[Pham Nuwen]], the "Programmer-at-Arms", who appears in both books. Hints occur about the "Zones of Thought" mentioned in ''Fire''. That novel posits that space around the [[Milky Way]] is divided into concentric layers called "Zones", each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. The innermost, the "Unthinking Depths", surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer, the "Slow Zone", is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out, the zone named the "Beyond" can support futuristic technologies such as [[artificial intelligence|AI]] and [[faster-than-light|FTL]] travel. The outermost zone, the "Transcend", contains most of the [[galactic halo]] and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful [[posthuman]] entities.

''A Deepness in the Sky'' takes place in the Slow Zone, though Vinge does not explain the connections, and the characters in the story remain unaware of the zones' existence. The sun's inexplicably strange behavior, the unusual [[planetary system]] (with only a solitary planet and several [[asteroid]]-sized [[diamond]]s), and the discovery of "[[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles#Fictional elements and materials|cavorite]]" on the planet may indicate the system originated in the Transcend, though it is currently moving outward from the Unthinking Depths. Vinge's characters speculate that the Spiders descend from an ancient star-faring civilization, and that the [[anti-gravity]] material and other strange artifacts have connections with that civilization. Unfortunately, they guess the structure of the Zones (though not the actual properties) backwards, coming to the conclusion that the bright center of the galaxy is the most likely location for advanced civilization. This leads Pham on his path inwards to the Unthinking Depths, and his eventual resurrection.

===Relation to ''The Outcasts of Heaven Belt''===
[[Joan D. Vinge]] has indicated that her novel ''The Outcasts of Heaven Belt'' is also set in the Slow Zone of the Zones of Thought setting.&lt;ref&gt;Vinge, Joan D. (2008-11). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110514085948/http://www.sff.net/people/jdvinge/letter_20081103.htm "A letter to my readers."]&lt;/ref&gt; Both novels show their spacefaring civilizations using seconds, kiloseconds, megaseconds, and gigaseconds as their primary units of time.

'''Ancient Semitic religion''' encompasses the [[polytheistic]] religions of the [[Semitic people]]s from the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Northeast Africa]]. Since the term ''Semitic'' itself represents a rough category when referring to cultures, as opposed to languages, the definitive bounds of the term "ancient Semitic religion" are only approximate.

Semitic traditions and their [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noll|first=K. L.|authorlink=K. L.

[...] Other gods were subordinate to, and partners with, the divine patron, just as the human aristocracy and commoners were expected to be subordinate to, and supportive of, the human king. The pantheon was usually quite complex, often including hundreds or even thousands of gods.}}&lt;/ref&gt; fall into regional categories: [[Canaanite religion]]s of the [[Levant]], the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian tradition]]–inspired [[Assyro-Babylonian religion]] of [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Ancient Hebrew religion]] of the 
[[Israelites]], and [[Arabian polytheism]]. Semitic [[polytheism]] possibly transitioned into [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[monotheism]] by way of the god [[El (deity)|El]], whose name "El" is a word for "god" in Hebrew, [[cognate]] to Arabic [[Allah]].

The last positively recorded worship of Ashur and other Assyrian gods dates back to the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/brief.htm#Religion | title=Brief History of Assyrians | publisher= AINA Assyrian International News Agency | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Simo |last=Parpola |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Assyrians after Assyria |url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |work=Assyriologist |publisher=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, Vol.  XIII No. 2, |id= |pages= |page= |year=1999 |accessdate= |quote= The gods Ashur, Sherua, Ishtar, Nanaya, Bel, Nabu and Nergal continued to be worshiped in Assur at least until the early 3rd century AD; the local cultic calendar was that of the imperial period; the temple of Ashur was restored in the 2nd century AD; and the stelae of the local rulers resemble those of Assyrian kings in the imperial period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashur, the patron deity of the eponymous capital from the Late Bronze Age, was in constant rivalry with the patron deity of [[Babylon]], [[Marduk]]. In Assyria, Ashur eventually superseded Marduk, even becoming the husband of Ishtar.

The major Assyro-Babylonian and Akkadian gods were:

==Canaan==
{{Main|Ancient Canaanite religion}}
{{Further|Torah|Origins of Judaism}}
The Canaanite religion was practiced by people living in the ancient [[Levant]] throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]]. Until the excavation (1928 onwards) of the city of [[Ugarit|Ras Shamra]] (also known as Ugarit) in Northern [[Syria]] and the discovery of its Bronze Age archive of clay tablet [[alphabet]]ic [[cuneiform]] texts,&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John, "The Legacy of Canaan the Ras Shamra Texts and Their Relevance to the Old Testament", No. 5. ''Brill Archive'', 1957; for a more recent discussion see Yon, Marguerite, ''The City of Ugarit at Tell Ras Shamra'', Eisenbrauns, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; scholars knew little about Canaanite religious practice. [[Papyrus]] seems to have been the preferred writing material for [[scribe]]s at the time. Unlike the papyrus documents found in Egypt, ancient papyri in the Levant have often simply decayed from exposure to the humid [[Mediterranean climate]]. As a result, the accounts in the [[Bible]] became the primary sources of information on ancient Canaanite religion. Supplementing the Biblical accounts, several secondary and tertiary Greek sources have survived, including [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s treatise ''[[De Dea Syria]]'' (The Syrian Goddess, 2nd century CE), fragments of the ''Phoenician History'' of [[Sanchuniathon]] as preserved by [[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64 – 141 CE), and the writings of [[Damascius]] ({{circa}} 458 – after 538). Recent study of the Ugaritic material has uncovered additional information about the religion,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mark S., ''The origins of biblical monotheism: Israel's polytheistic background and the Ugaritic texts'', Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented by inscriptions from the Levant and [[Ebla|Tel Mardikh]] archive&lt;ref&gt;J. Pons, Review of G. Pettinato, A. Alberti, Catalogo dei testi cuneiformi di Tell Mardikh - Ebla, MEE I, Napoli, 1979, in  Études théologiques et religieuses 56 (1981) 339—341.&lt;/ref&gt; (excavated in the early 1960s).

The Canaanite religion shows the clear influence of [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] religious practices.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Like other peoples of the ancient Near East, the Canaanites were [[polytheistic]], with families typically focusing worship on ancestral [[Household deity|household gods and goddesses]] while acknowledging the existence of other [[deities]] such as [[Baal]], [[Anath]], and [[El (god)|El]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}}
Kings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the [[hieros gamos|sacred marriage]] of the [[New Year Festival]]; Canaanites may have revered their kings as gods.

According to the pantheon, known in Ugarit as 'ilhm ([[Elohim]]) or the children of El (compare the Biblical "[[sons of God]]"), {{Clarify|text=the creator,|date=May 2016}} called El, fathered the other deities. In the Greek sources he was married to Beruth ([[Beirut]], the city). The pantheon was supposedly obtained by [[Philo of Byblos]] from [[Sanchuniathon]] of Berythus ([[Beirut]]). The marriage of the deity with the city seems to have Biblical parallels with the stories that link [[Melkart]] with [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] with [[Jerusalem]], and [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]] with [[Carthage]]. El Elyon is mentioned (as ''God Most High'') in Genesis 14.18–19 as the God whose priest was [[Melchizedek]], king of Salem. &lt;!-- "Psalm 78.35 confirms the fact that the Elohim were considered the family of El Elyon". The quoted text has been removed{{by whom?}} because it is not true --&gt;

Philo states that the union of El Elyon and his consort resulted in the birth of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Ge]] (Greek names for ''Heaven'' and ''Earth''). This closely parallels the opening verse of the Hebrew Bible, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1—"In the beginning God ([[Elohim]]) created the [[Heaven]]s (''[[Shemayim]]'') and the Earth" (''Eretz''). It also parallels the story of the Babylonian [[Anunaki]] gods.

Peter Lang, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8204-7849-0}}, 978-0-8204-7849-4&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers trace the story of [[Esther]] to Babylonian roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunkel|first=Hermanh|title=Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton: Religio-Historical Study of Genesis 1 and Revelation 12|year=2006|publisher=[[William B.

[[El Elyon]] also appears in Balaam's story in Numbers and in Moses song in Deuteronomy 32.8. The [[Masoretic Text]]s suggest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Most High ('Elyōn) divided to the nations their inheritance, he separated the sons of man (Ādām); he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the sons of Israel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rather than "sons of [[Israel]]", the [[Septuagint]], the Greek Old Testament, {{Clarify|text=suggests the angelōn theou,|date=May 2016}} or "angels of God", and a few versions even have ''huiōn theou'' ([[sons of God]]). The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] version of this suggests that there were in fact 70 sons of the Most High God sent to rule over the 70 nations of the Earth. This idea of the 70 nations of Earth, each ruled over by one of the Elohim (sons of God), is also found in Ugaritic texts. The [[Arslan Tash]] inscription suggests that each of the 70 sons of El Elyon was bound to their people by a covenant. Thus, Crossan{{Who|date=May 2016}} translates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The Eternal One ('Olam) has made a covenant oath with us,
Asherah has made (a pact) with us.
And all the sons of El,
And the great council of all the Holy Ones ([[Qetesh|Qedesh]]).
With oaths of Heaven and Ancient Earth.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Army of Frankensteins''''' is a 2014 American science fiction horror film written and directed by Ryan Bellgardt.  It stars Jordan Farris as a time-traveling youth who, along with multiple versions of [[Frankenstein's monster]] (Eric Gesecus), are pulled into the [[American Civil War]].

== Plot ==
After Alan Jones is savagely beaten by a street gang, he ends up at the lab of mad scientist Dr. Tanner Finski                                 and his assistant Igor, a child genius.  There, Jones discovers that he is the key to an experiment that involves Frankenstein's monster.  When the experiment goes wrong, Finski sends Jones and Igor back in time to the American Civil War, where an interdimensional portal has allowed an army of monsters to converge.

== Cast ==
* Jordan Farris as Alan Jones
* Christian Bellgardt as Igor
* Rett Terrell as Solomon Jones
* John Ferguson as Dr. Tanner Finski
* Raychelle McDonald as Virginia
* Eric Gesecus as Frankenstein's monster
* Gary Olinghouse as Eugene

== Production ==

For Dr. Finski, he always sought John Ferguson, who had played [[horror host]] Count Gregore.&lt;ref name=release/&gt; Gesecus, a fan of classic ''Frankenstein'' films, won his part partially through his knowledge of the classic monster.  Gesecus was initially wary of becoming involved in a local, low budget effort, but his love for the character won out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-actor-fulfills-dream-of-playing-frankenstein-monster/article/3898087|title=Oklahoma actor fulfills dream of playing Frankenstein monster|last=Sutton|first=Jonathan|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=2013-10-27|accessdate=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megan Sando of the ''[[NewsPress|Stillwater News Press]]'' called it a "hilarious sci-fi adventure" whose "gory special effects make up for the sometimes questionable acting".&lt;ref name=stillwater/&gt;  Mark L.

==History==
[[File:HK Central IFC mall Canali shop.jpg|thumb|A shop of Canali at [[IFC Mall (Hong Kong)|IFC Mall]], Hong Kong]]

Canali was founded in  1934 by Giacomo Canali and Giovanni Canali  as a [[family business]].&lt;ref name="Company Overview of CANALI s.p.a."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canali Financial Report "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fashionbi.com/brands/canali | title=Canali Financial Report | publisher=Fashion Bi | accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Road map to success, Italian style"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/mens-style/7766/road-map-to-success-italian-style.html | title=Road map to success, Italian style | publisher=The Telegraph | date=23 October 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2014 | author=Leitch,  Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canali.com [http://www.canali.com/en/heritage Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the ownership of Canali passed on to the second generation of the family.  In the 1970s, Canali was the first Italian tailor to introduce mechanised cutting machines.&lt;ref name="Road map to success, Italian style"/&gt; Canali opened its first flagship boutique in [[Milan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2010, [[New York Yankees]] pitcher [[Mariano Rivera]] was the spokesmodel for a Canali advertisement campaign.&lt;ref name="Canali to Use Mariano Rivera in Fall Ads"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/menswear-news/retail-business/canali-to-use-rivera-in-fall-ads-3220077?src=search_links | title=Canali to Use Mariano Rivera in Fall Ads | publisher=WWD | date=16 August  2010 | accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |June 2013}}, led by the third generation of the family, Canali employs 1,700 people in seven factories in Italy, where it makes about 250,000 individual pieces of clothing annually.&lt;ref name="Mencyclopaedia: Canali "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/mens-style/6974/canali-is-a-superpower-of-suiting-and-semi-formal-menswear-worn-by-barack-obama.html | title=Mencyclopaedia: Canali | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=21 June 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2014 | author=Leitch, Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 87.5% of the total production was  exported;&lt;ref name="MFfashion.com"/&gt; on average 1,400 [[men's suit]]s  and 1,600 pairs of [[trousers]] were manufactured daily.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

'''Chinese influences on [[Islamic pottery]]''' cover a period starting from at least the 8th century CE to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; This influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

==Earliest exchanges==

===Pre-Islamic contacts with Central Asia===
[[File:ZhouVase.JPG|thumb|left|[[Eastern Zhou]] vase, thought to incorporate Western influences (3rd–4th century BCE).]]
Despite the distances involved, there is evidence of some contact between eastern and southwestern Asia from antiquity. Some very early Western influence on Chinese pottery seems to appear from the 3rd–4th century BCE. An [[Eastern Zhou]] red earthenware bowl, decorated with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] and inlaid with glass paste, and now in the British Museum, is thought to have imitated metallic vessels, possibly of foreign origin. Foreign influence especially is thought to have encouraged the Eastern Zhou interest in glass decorations.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum, Ancient China permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] were formally opened from the 2nd to 1st century BCE through the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In the following centuries, a great cultural influx benefited China, embodied by the appearance in China of foreign art, new ideas and religions (especially [[Buddhism]]), and new lifestyles.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; Artistic influences combined a multiplicity of cultures which had intermixed along the Silk Road, especially [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[India]]n and [[Central Asian]] cultures, displaying a strong cosmopolitanism.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

Such mixed influences are especially visible in the earthenwares of Northern China in the 6th century, such as those of the [[Northern Qi]] (550–577) or the [[Northern Zhou]] (557–581).&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In that period, high quality high-fired earthenware starts to appear, called the "jeweled type", which incorporates [[Lotus Flower|lotuses]] from Buddhist art, as well as elements of [[Sasanian]] designs such as pearl roundels, lion masks or musicians and dancers.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz5KGNcs9xEC&amp;pg=PA119 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.119''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these ceramics use bluish green, yellow or olive glazes.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
[[File:Tang earthenware fragment with sancai glaze end of 7th early 8th century excavated in Nishapur Iran.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] earthenware fragment with ''[[sancai]]'' glaze, end of 7th-early 8th century, excavated in [[Nishapur]], [[Iran]].]]
Direct contacts between the Muslim and Chinese worlds were marked by the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 in [[Central Asia]]. Muslim communities are known to have been present in China as early as the 8th century CE, especially in commercial harbours such as [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

From the 9th century onwards, Islamic merchants started to import Chinese ceramics, which were at the core of the [[Indian Ocean]] luxury trade at that time.&lt;ref name="Meri"&gt;''Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia'' by Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; These exotic objects were cherished in the [[Islamic world]] and also became an inspiration for local potters.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Archaeological finds of [[Chinese pottery]] in the [[Middle East]] go back to the 8th century, starting with Chinese pottery of the [[Tang period]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Remains of [[Tang dynasty|Tang period]] (618–907) ceramics have been found in [[Samarra]] and [[Ctesiphon]] in present-day [[Iraq]], as well as in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Notice of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] permanent exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; These include porcelaneous white wares from Northern Chinese kilns, celadon-glazed stoneware originating in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], and the splashed stoneware of [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Changsha kilns]] in [[Hunan Province]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TV6f2XWG6t4C&amp;pg=PA68 ''Maritime silk road'' Qingxin Li p.68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese pottery was the object of gift-making in Islamic lands: the Islamic writer Muhammad Ibn-al-Husain-Bahaki wrote in 1059 that [[Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan|Ali Ibn Isa]], the governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], presented [[Harun al-Rashid]], the Caliph, twenty pieces of Chinese imperial porcelain, the like of which had never been at a caliph's court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain".&lt;ref name="Zheng"&gt;''Studies in Chinese ceramics'' by Dekun Zheng, Cheng Te-K'Un p.90''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3die4xQmNzQC&amp;pg=PA90]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan and Ming dynasties===
[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]], c 1335, early [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Jingdezhen]], using a Middle-eastern shape]]
By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140–141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;  After about 1450 celadon wares fell out of fashion in China, and the continuing production, of lower quality, was for export.

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming; it was called "Muslim blue" by the Chinese.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137–140; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 86–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505–1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

===Yue ware===
{{further|Yue ware}}
[[File:Tang Dynasty stoneware with celadon glaze ie Yue ware found in Samarra Iraq.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] stoneware with [[celadon]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (Yue ware), found in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]].]]
Yue ware originated in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], in the site of [[Jiyuan]] near [[Shaoxing]], called "Yuezhou" (越州) in ancient times.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sn0CyBCJKz8C&amp;pg=PA90 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.90''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Yue ware was first manufactured from the 2nd century CE, when it consisted in some very precise imitations of [[bronze]] vessels, many of which were found in tombs of the [[Nanjing]] region.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt; After this initial phase, Yue ware evolved progressively into true ceramic form, and became a true medium of artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.35''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA35]&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Jiyuan stopped in the 6th century, but expanded to various areas of Zhejiang, especially around the shores of Shanglinhu in Yuyaoxian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

Yue ware was highly valued, and was used as tribute for the imperial court in northern China in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Significantly, it was also used in China's most revered [[Famen Temple]] in [[Shaanxi Province]].&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Yue ware was exported to the [[Middle East]] early on, and shards of Yue ware have been excavated in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]], in an early example of Chinese influences on Islamic pottery,&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; as well as to [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] as well as [[East Africa]] from the 8th to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

===Sancai ware===
{{further|Sancai}}

| width2 = 165 | caption2 = }}
[[File:Tang sancai vase 8th 9th century.jpg|thumb|Tang ''[[sancai]]'' vase displaying Central Asian and Persian influence. 8–9th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]
[[Tang period]] earthenware shards with low-fired [[polychrome]] three-color ''[[sancai]]'' glazes from the 9th century were exported to Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]], and have been excavated in [[Samarra]] in present-day [[Iraq]] and in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.205''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA206]&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese styles were soon adopted for local [[Middle-Eastern]] manufactures. Copies were made by Iraqi craftsmen as soon as the 9th century CE.&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;Notice of [[British Museum]] "Islamic Art Room" permanent exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ba3LyiGfPU8C&amp;pg=PA41 ''Islamic art'' by Barbara Brend p.41]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to imitate Chinese ''Sancai'', lead glazes were used on top of vessels coated with white [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] and a colorless glaze. The coloured lead glazes were then splashed on the surface, where they spread and mixed, according to the [[slipware]] technique.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

Shapes were also imitated, such as the lobed dishes found in Chinese Tang ceramics and silverware which were reproduced in Iraq during the 9–10th century.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Conversely, numerous Central Asian and Persian influences were at work in the designs of Chinese ''sancai'' wares: pictures of Central Asian mounted warriors, scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases in the shape of Middle-Eastern [[ewer]]s.

===White ware===

Soon after the sancai period, Chinese white ware ceramics also found their way to the [[Islamic world]],&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"/&gt; and were immediately reproduced.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The Chinese white ware was actually [[porcelain]], invented in the 9th century, and used [[kaolin]] and high-temperature firing,&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; but Islamic workshops were unable to duplicate its manufacture. Instead, they manufactured fine earthenware bowls with the desired shape, and covered them with a white glaze rendered [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] by the addition of [[tin]], an early example of [[tin-glazing]].&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"/&gt; The Chinese shapes were also reproduced, seemingly to pass for China-made wares.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

In the 12th century, Islamic manufacturers further developed [[stone-paste]] techniques in order to obtain hard bodies approximating the hardness obtained by Chinese porcelain. This technique was used until the 18th century, when the Europeans discovered the Chinese technique for high-firing porcelain clays.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

===Celadon ware===
The Chinese fashion for greenware, or [[celadon]], ware was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where it gave rise to productions using [[turquoise]] glazing and fish motifs identical to the ones used in China.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

''Columbia Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions, Chinese blue and white wares also incorporated Islamic designs, as in the case of some Mamluk brass works which were converted into blue and white Chinese porcelain designs.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Chinese blue and white ware then became extremely popular in the Middle East, where both Chinese and Islamic types coexisted.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

From the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such as flying [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[dragons]] and [[lotus flowers]] also started to appear in the ceramic productions of the Near East, especially in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Chinese porcelain of the 14th or 15th century was transmitted to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Near East]], and especially to the [[Ottoman Empire]] either through gifts or through war [[Looting|booty]]. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at [[Iznik]], [[Turkey]]. The Ming "grape" design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The style of Persian pottery known as [[Kubachi ware]] also absorbed influence from China, imitating both celadons and Ming blue-and-white porcelain.

'''''A Treatise on Painting''''' is a collection of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s writings entered in his notebooks under the general heading "On Painting". The manuscripts were gathered together by [[Francesco Melzi]] some time before 1542 and first printed in French and Italian as ''Trattato della pittura'' by Raffaelo du Fresne in 1651. The main aim of the treatise was to argue that painting was a science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336408/Leonardo-da-Vinci/59104/Science#ref=ref360266 |title=Science: Science of Painting |publisher=Britannica |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ygU6MRiXBN8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Collected Essays and Criticism: Affirmations and refusals, 1950-1956 By Clement Greenberg, John O'Brian, page 259 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo's keen observation of expression and character is evidenced in his comparison of laughing and weeping, about which he notes that the only difference between the two emotions in terms of the "motion of the [facial] features" is "the ruffling of the brows, which is added in weeping, but more elevated and extended in laughing." &lt;ref&gt;Chapter CLXXII, trans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">'''Cognitive synonymy''' is a type of [[synonym]]y in which synonyms are so similar in [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] that they cannot be differentiated either [[denotation|denotatively]] or [[connotation|connotatively]], that is, not even by [[association of ideas|mental associations]], [[connotation]]s, emotive responses, and [[poetry|poetic value]]. It is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philosophical]]) purposes. In [[usage]] employing this definition, synonyms with greater differences are often called near-synonyms rather than synonyms.&lt;ref name="Stanojević_2009"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanojević |first=Maja |year=2009 |title= Cognitive synonymy: a general overview |journal=Facta Universitatis, Linguistics and Literature series |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=193-200 |url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal200902/lal200902-05.pdf |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
If a word is cognitively synonymous with another word, they refer to the same thing independently of [[context (language use)|context]]. Thus, a word is cognitively synonymous with another word [[if and only if]] all instances of both words express the same exact thing, and the referents are [[modal logic|necessarily]] [[identity (philosophy)|identical]], which means that the words' interchangeability is not [[wikt:context-sensitive|context-sensitive]].

[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] used the concept of cognitive synonymy extensively in his famous 1951 paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", where two words were cognitively synonymous if they were interchangeable in every possible instance.&lt;ref name="Hanna_2005"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hanna |first=Patricia |year=2005 |title=''Cognitive Synonymy'', from Notes on "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~phanna/classes/ling5030/webpostings/notestwodogmas/node14.html |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{Citation |last=Quine |first=Willard Van Orman |year=1951 |title=Two dogmas of empiricism |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=60 |issue= |pages=20–43 |url=http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html |doi= |postscript=. Reprinted in his 1953 book ''From a Logical Point of View''. Harvard University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
* All bachelors are unmarried men.
* All unmarried men are not married.

Quine notes that if one is [[use-mention distinction|referring to the word itself]], this doesn't apply, as in,
* ''Bachelor'' has fewer than ten letters.

As compared to the substitution which is obviously false,
* "Unmarried men" has less than ten letters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7444">In [[genre studies]], a '''coming-of-age story''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] and [[film]] that focuses on the growth of a [[protagonist]] from youth to adulthood ("[[coming of age]]"). Coming-of-age stories tend to emphasize dialogue or internal monologue over action, and are often set in the past. The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically teenagers.&lt;ref name=Benyahia /&gt; The [[Bildungsroman]] is a specific subgenre of coming-of-age story.

In film, coming of age is a genre of [[teen film]]s. Coming-of-age films focus on the psychological and moral growth or transition of a [[protagonist]] from [[youth]] to adulthood.

'''Comme des Garçons''' is a [[Japan]]ese fashion label founded by and headed by [[Rei Kawakubo]]. It is based in [[Tokyo]] and also in the [[Place Vendôme]] in [[Paris]], the city in which they show their main collections during Paris Fashion Week and Paris Men's Fashion Week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elle.com/fashion/a33802/rei-kawakubo-interview/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese flagship store is in [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]], Tokyo's high fashion district. The company also has concept stores Trading Museum Comme des Garçons and 10 Corso Como Comme des Garçons in Tokyo, and stores in [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]] and [[Fukuoka]]. Worldwide they have traditional Comme des Garçons stores in [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré|Rue du Faubourg St-Honoré]] in [[Paris]] and on West 22nd Street in [[New York City]], as well as stores in [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]], [[Bangkok]], [[Seoul]], [[Singapore]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Manila]].

Since 2004, Comme des Garçons has developed a market-based department store concept, stocking its main collections, its other brands, such as ''Shirt'', ''Play'', and a wide range of international designers. Its original market store, called [[Dover Street Market]], is in [[London]]. In 2010, the company opened [[I.T]] [[Beijing]] Market Comme des Garçons, which was followed by a new market store in Ginza, [[Tokyo]], in 2012 and [[New York City]] in 2013, as well as Berlin more recently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/04/the-misfit-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The label was started in [[Tokyo]] by [[Rei Kawakubo]] in 1969 and established as a company '''Comme des Garçons Co. Ltd''' in 1973. It is written in Japanese as コム・デ・ギャルソン (''Komu de Gyaruson'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of Comme Des Garcons Co., Ltd. |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=5663541 |publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became successful in Japan in the 1970s; a menswear line was added in 1978. The year 1981 saw Comme des Garçons's debut show in Paris. It created a splash for its predominant use of black and distressed fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/2004/style/020904/power/9.html |title=Women in fashion – Rei Kawakubo |publisher=Time magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, Comme des Garçons's clothes often were associated with a 'distressed' and 'punk' oriented style.

Comme des Garçons's designer fashion lines are designed and [[Manufacturing in Japan|produced in Japan]]. Lines including ''Comme des Garçons Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Noir, Comme des Garçons Homme, Comme des Garçons Honme Plus, Comme des Garçons Man, Comme des Garçons Deux and Comme des Garçons Shirt'', are all handmade. This is because Comme des Garçons adamantly values the quality of hand-made garments, reflected in the more expensive price and longevity of their products. Play, the company's luxury casual streetwear line, is mainly produced in Japan, Spain, and Turkey, with France's Play factory still utilizing many hand-made procedures as opposed to Japan, Spain, and Turkey's production line factory. This is because France's factory also produces hand-made only lines, including ''Tricot Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons Homme Plus Evergreen, and Junya Watanabe Comme Des Garçons''. It is believed that all [[fabric]]s are produced in Japan, but some China and Australia sold pieces are hand-finished in France for quality control purposes (distinguishable by the hand stitched heart emblem). In an article for ''Business of Fashion'' in April 2017, Tim Blanks reported generated revenue for CDG and its affiliates as "over $280 million a year".&lt;ref&gt;Tim Blanks. ''Business of Fashion''.

==Fashion==
Comme des Garçons collections are designed in the Comme des Garçons studio in [[Aoyama, Tokyo]] and are manufactured in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. The company has over the years recurrently associated itself with the arts and cultural projects internationally. The 1997 spring-summer collection, often referred to the "lumps and bumps" collection, which contained fabric in bulk and balls on the garments. This led to a collaboration, also in 1997, between [[Rei Kawakubo]] and New York-based choreographer [[Merce Cunningham]] called "Scenario". The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the "persona",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Mower |url=http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2006RTW/review/CMMEGRNS |title=Comme des Garçons F/W 2006 |publisher=style.com |date=2006-03-04 |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718164130/http://www.style.com/fashionshows/collections/F2006RTW/review/CMMEGRNS |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the different ways we present ourselves to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, "Persona" was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine by Comme des Garçons.

==Exhibitions==
After the Paris début, Comme des Garçons exhibited photographs by [[Peter Lindbergh]] at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterlindbergh.net/exhibitions.html#1986 "Peter Lindbergh for Comme des Garçons"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513233521/http://www.peterlindbergh.net/exhibitions.html#1986 |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, they held an exhibition of sculpture.

In August 2010, Comme des Garçons opened a {{convert|19000|sqft|m2}}, six-level flagship store in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], featuring a branded art-exhibition space, the company's first outside Japan.&lt;ref name="hypebeast.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypebeast.com/2010/09/comme-des-garcons-seoul-flagship-store |title=Comme des Garçons Seoul Flagship Store |publisher=Hypebeast |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comme Des Garçons Play ==
Commonly known for its heart-shaped logo with two eyes, Comme Des Garçons Play is Comme Des Garçons' casual luxury line. It is a more accessible variation of Comme Des Garcons's other lines. Directed at the younger market, Play is Comme Des Garcon's best selling clothes line.

After Play made its debut on celebrities such as [[Kanye West]], [[Pharrell Williams|Pharell Williams]], and [[Justin Timberlake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hervia.com/blog/celebrity-spotted-comme-des-garcons-play/|title=Celebrity Spotted; Look Who Has Been Wearing Comme Des Garcons PLAY|work=Hervia|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Play introduced collaborations with Nike, Jordan, Supreme, and Louis Vuitton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hypebeast.com/tags/comme-des-garcons|title=Comme des Garcons {{!}} HYPEBEAST|website=hypebeast.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was quickly viewed as a prominent international fashion brand. Nowadays, Comme Des Garçons is mainly recognized for the heart-eyes logo found on Play pieces. ''Dover Street Market Group'' primarily carries Play products as opposed to those from Comme Des Garçons's more high-end lines.

Starting in May 2017, Rei Kawakubo will be the subject of one of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s fashion exhibitions in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine. Kawakubo announcement of 2017 exhibit. [http://time.com/4540904/comme-des-garcons-rei-kawakubo-met-gala-theme-2017/]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vogue'' magazine and the Metropolitan Museum in New York have announced that the exhibition dedicated to Kawakubo is scheduled for its 2017 season between 4 May 2017 and 4 September 2017. In an interview with ''Vogue'' in April 2017, [[Andrew Bolton (curator)|Andrew Bolton]], the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated: “I really think her influence is so huge, but sometimes it’s subtle. It’s not about copying her; it’s the purity of her vision... Rei was really involved in the design of the exhibit”.&lt;ref name="Lynn Yaeger 2017"&gt;Lynn Yaeger. "On the Eve of the Comme des Garçons Retrospective, the Notoriously Reclusive Rei Kawakubo Speaks Out", APRIL 13, 2017, ''Vogue'' Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolton also stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/antifashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.

==Rei Kawakubo quotations==
*"For something to be beautiful...it doesn't have to be pretty."
*"Fashion is something that you can attach to yourself, put on, and through that interaction, the meaning of it is born."
*"I make clothes for a woman who is not swayed by what her husband thinks."
*"Comme des Garcons is a gift to oneself, not something to appeal or to attract the opposite sex."
*"The theme of the collection this time is MONSTER. It's not about the typical Monster you find in sci-fi and video games. The expression of the Monsters I have made has a much deeper meaning. The craziness of humanity, the fear we all have, the feeling of going beyond common sense, the absence of ordinariness, expressed by something extremely big, by something that could be ugly or beautiful. In other words, I wanted to question the established standards of beauty."
*"My intention is not to make clothes. My head would be too restricted if I only thought about making clothes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azquotes.com/quote/617912&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Romance-lg-classification-en.svg|thumb|375px|Linguistic map representing a [[tree model]] of the [[Romance languages]] based on the comparative method. Here the family tree has been rendered as an [[Euler diagram]] without overlapping subareas. The [[Wave model (linguistics)|wave model]] allows overlapping regions.]]

In [[linguistics]], the '''comparative method''' is a technique for studying the development of languages by performing a feature-by-feature comparison of two or more languages with [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|common descent]] from a shared ancestor, in order to extrapolate back to infer the properties of that ancestor. The comparative method may be contrasted with the method of [[internal reconstruction]], in which the internal development of a single language is inferred by the analysis of features within that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|pp=31 ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily both methods are used together to reconstruct prehistoric phases of languages, to fill in gaps in the historical record of a language, to discover the development of phonological, morphological, and other linguistic systems, and to confirm or refute hypothesised relationships between languages.

The comparative method was developed over the 19th century. Key contributions were made by the Danish scholars [[Rasmus Christian Rask|Rasmus Rask]] and [[Karl Verner]] and the German scholar [[Jacob Grimm]]. The first linguist to offer reconstructed forms from a [[proto-language]] was [[August Schleicher]], in his ''Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen'', originally published in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1993|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here is Schleicher's explanation of why he offered reconstructed forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schleicher|1874|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the present work an attempt is made to set forth the inferred [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European original language]] side by side with its really existent derived languages. Besides the advantages offered by such a plan, in setting immediately before the eyes of the student the final results of the investigation in a more concrete form, and thereby rendering easier his insight into the nature of particular [[Indo-European languages]], there is, I think, another of no less importance gained by it, namely that it shows the baselessness of the assumption that the non-Indian Indo-European languages were derived from Old-Indian ([[Sanskrit]]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Demonstrating genetic relationship ==
The comparative method aims to prove that two or more historically [[attested language]]s descend from a single [[proto-language]] by comparing lists of [[cognate]] terms. From them, regular sound correspondences between the languages are established, and a sequence of regular [[sound change]]s can then be postulated, which allows the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstruction]] of a proto-language. Relation is deemed certain only if at least a partial reconstruction of the common ancestor is feasible, and if regular sound correspondences can be established—with chance similarities ruled out.

===Terminology===
''Descent'' is defined as transmission across the generations: children learn a language from the parents' generation and after being influenced by their peers transmit it to the next generation, and so on. For example, a continuous chain of speakers across the centuries links [[Vulgar Latin]] to all of its modern descendants.

Two languages are ''[[genetic (linguistics)|genetically]] related'' if they descended from the same [[Proto-language|ancestor language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp= 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] both come from [[Latin]] and therefore belong to the same family, the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a large component of vocabulary from a certain origin is not sufficient to establish relatedness: for example, as a result of heavy [[loanword|borrowing]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[Persian language|Persian]], Modern Persian in fact takes more of its [[vocabulary]] from Arabic than from its direct ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], but Persian remains a member of the Indo-Iranian family and is not considered "related" to Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2000|p= 1341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible for languages to have different degrees of relatedness. [[English language|English]], for example, is related both to [[German language|German]] and to [[Russian language|Russian]], but is more closely related to the former than to the latter. Although all three languages share a common ancestor, [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], English and German also share a more recent common ancestor, [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], while Russian does not. Therefore, English and German are considered to belong to a different subgroup, the [[Germanic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 22, 27–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shared retentions'' from the parent language are not sufficient evidence of a sub-group. For example, German and Russian both retain from Proto-Indo-European a contrast between the [[dative case]] and the [[accusative case]], which English has lost. However, this similarity between German and Russian is not evidence that German is more closely related to Russian than to English; it only means that the ''innovation'' in question—the loss of the accusative/dative distinction—happened more recently in English than the divergence of English from German. The division of related languages into sub-groups is more certainly accomplished by finding ''shared linguistic innovations'' differentiating them from the parent language, rather than shared features retained from the parent language.

===Origin and development of the method===
[[File:Sajnovics - Demonstratio.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Sajnovic's 1770 work.]]
Languages have been compared since antiquity. For example, in the 1st century BC the Romans were aware of the similarities between Greek and Latin, which they explained mythologically, as the result of Rome being a Greek colony speaking a debased dialect. In the 9th or 10th century AD, [[Yehuda Ibn Quraysh]] compared the phonology and morphology of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, but attributed this resemblance to the Biblical story of Babel, with Abraham, Isaac and Joseph retaining Adam's language, with other languages at various removes becoming more altered from the original Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;"The reason for this similarity and the cause of this intermixture was their close neighboring in the land and their genealogical closeness, since Terah the father of Abraham was Syrian, and Laban was Syrian. Ishmael and Kedar were Arabized from the Time of Division, the time of the confounding [of tongues] at Babel, and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob (peace be upon them) retained the Holy Tongue from the original Adam." [http://lameen.googlepages.com/ibn-quraysh.html Introduction of Risalat Yehuda Ibn Quraysh – مقدمة رسالة يهوذا بن قريش]&lt;/ref&gt;

In publications of 1647 and 1654, [[Marcus van Boxhorn]] first described a rigid methodology for historical linguistic comparisons&lt;ref name=Driem&gt;George van Driem [http://www.eastling.org/paper/Driem.pdf The genesis of polyphyletic linguistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012439/http://www.eastling.org/paper/Driem.pdf |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed the existence of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] proto-language (which he called "Scythian") unrelated to Hebrew, but ancestral to Germanic, Greek, Romance, Persian, Sanskrit, Slavic, Celtic and Baltic languages. The Scythian theory was further developed by [[Andreas Jäger]] (1686) and [[William Wotton]] (1713), who made early forays to reconstruct this primitive common language.&lt;!-- ?? Perhaps he just proposed to do so. --&gt; In 1710 and 1723 [[Lambert ten Kate]] first formulated the regularity of [[sound law]]s, introducing among others, the term [[root vowel]].&lt;ref name=Driem/&gt;

Another early systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of [[grammar]] and [[lexicon]] was made by the Hungarian [[János Sajnovics]] in 1770, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (work that was later extended to the whole [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric language family]] in 1799 by his countryman [[Samuel Gyarmathi]]),&lt;ref name="ssix"&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p= 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the origin of modern [[historical linguistics]] is often traced back to [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], an English [[Philology|philologist]] living in [[India]], who in 1786 made his famous {{nowrap|observation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Jones|first= Sir William|title= The Third Anniversary Discourse delivered 2 February 1786 By the President [on the Hindus]|editor-first= Guido|editor-last= Abbattista|publisher= Eliohs Electronic Library of Historiography|url= http://www.eliohs.unifi.it/testi/700/jones/Jones_Discourse_3.html|accessdate= 18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Sanskrit|Sanscrit language]], whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], more copious than the [[Latin language|Latin]], and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.  There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the [[Gothic language|Gothick]] and the [[Celtic languages|Celtick]], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the [[Old Persian language|old Persian]] might be added to the same family.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comparative method developed out of attempts to reconstruct the proto-language mentioned by Jones, which he did not name, but which subsequent linguists labelled [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). The first professional comparison between the [[Indo-European languages]] known then was made by the German linguist [[Franz Bopp]] in 1816. Though he did not attempt a reconstruction, he demonstrated that Greek, Latin and Sanskrit shared a common structure and a common lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|pp= 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in 1808 first stated the importance of using the eldest possible form of a language when trying to prove its relationships;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1818, [[Rasmus Christian Rask]] developed the principle of regular sound-changes to explain his observations of similarities between individual words in the Germanic languages and their cognates in Greek and {{nowrap|Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szémerenyi|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Jacob Grimm]]—better known for his ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Fairy Tales]]''—in ''Deutsche Grammatik'' (published 1819–1837 in four volumes) made use of the comparative method in attempting to show the development of the [[Germanic languages]] from a common origin, the first systematic study of [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] language change.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Rask and Grimm were unable to explain apparent exceptions to the sound laws that they had discovered. Although [[Hermann Grassmann]] explained one of these anomalies with the publication of [[Grassmann's law]] in 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Verner]] made a methodological breakthrough in 1875 when he identified a pattern now known as [[Verner's law]], the first sound-law based on comparative evidence showing that a [[phonology|phonological]] change in one [[phoneme]] could depend on other factors within the same word (such as the neighbouring phonemes and the position of the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), now called ''conditioning environments''.

Similar discoveries made by the ''Junggrammatiker'' (usually translated as "[[Neogrammarians]]") at the [[University of Leipzig]] in the late 19th century led them to conclude that all sound changes were ultimately regular, resulting in the famous statement by [[Karl Brugmann]] and [[Hermann Osthoff]] in 1878 that "sound laws have no exceptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p= 21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is fundamental to the modern comparative method, since the method necessarily assumes regular correspondences between sounds in related languages, and consequently regular sound changes from the proto-language. This ''Neogrammarian Hypothesis'' led to application of the comparative method to reconstruct [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], with [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] being at that time by far the most well-studied language family. Linguists working with other families soon followed suit, and the comparative method quickly became the established method for uncovering linguistic relationships.&lt;ref name="ssix"/&gt;

===Application===
{{IPA notice}}
There is no fixed set of steps to be followed in the application of the comparative method, but some steps are suggested by [[Lyle Campbell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp= 126–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crowley|1992|pp= 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; both authors of introductory texts in historical linguistics. The abbreviated summary below is based on their concepts of how to proceed.

====Step 1, assemble potential cognate lists====
This step involves making lists of words that are likely cognates among the languages being compared. If there is a regularly recurring match between the phonetic structure of basic words with similar meanings a genetic kinship can probably be established.&lt;ref name="ltwothree"&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp= 2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, looking at the [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian family]] linguists might come up with a list similar to the following (a list actually used by them would be much longer):&lt;ref&gt;The table is modified from {{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp= 168–169}} and {{harvnb|Crowley|1992|pp= 88–89}} using sources such as {{harvnb|Churchward|1959}} for Tongan, and {{harvnb|Pukui|1986}} for Hawaiian.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[loanword|Borrowings]] or [[false cognate]]s can skew or obscure the correct data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, English ''taboo'' ({{IPA|[tæbu]}}) is like the six Polynesian forms due to borrowing from Tongan into English, and not because of a genetic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/taboo|encyclopedia= Dictionary.com|title= Taboo}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem can usually be overcome by using basic vocabulary—such as kinship terms, numbers, body parts, pronouns, and other basic terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p= 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, even basic vocabulary can be sometimes borrowed. [[Finnish language|Finnish]], for example, borrowed the word for "mother", ''äiti'', from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''aiþei''.;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp= 65, 300}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[English language|English]] borrowed the pronouns "they", "them", and "their(s)" from [[Old Norse language|Norse]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/they|encyclopedia= Dictionary.com|title= They}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thai language|Thai]] (along with various other [[East Asian languages]]) borrowed its numbers from [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. An extreme case is represented by [[Pirahã language|Pirahã]], a [[Muran languages|Muran language]] of South America, which, it is controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nevins |first1=Andrew |first2=David |last2=Pesetsky |first3=Cilene |last3=Rodrigues |year=2009 |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/%7Enevins/npr09.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103305/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~nevins/npr09.pdf |archive-date=4 June 2011 |title=Pirahã Exceptionality: a Reassessment |journal=Language |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=355–404 |doi=10.1353/lan.0.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed, borrowed all its [[pronoun]]s from [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomason|2005|pp=8–12 in pdf}}; {{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p= 355}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Superficially, however, the Piraha pronouns don't look much like the Tupi–Guarani pronouns; so this proposal will not be convincing without some additional information about the phonology of Piraha that shows how the phonetic realizations of the Tupi–Guarani forms align with the Piraha phonemic system." [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/pronborr.pdf "Pronoun borrowing" Sarah G. Thomason &amp; Daniel L. Everett University of Michigan &amp; University of Manchester]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Step 2, establish correspondence sets====
The next step involves determining the regular sound-correspondences exhibited by the lists of potential cognates. For example, in the Polynesian data above, it is apparent that words that contain ''t'' in most of the languages listed have cognates in Hawaiian with ''k'' in the same position. This is visible in multiple cognate sets: the words glossed as 'one', 'three', 'man', and 'taboo' all show this relationship. This situation is termed a ''regular correspondence'' between ''k'' in Hawaiian and ''t'' in the other Polynesian languages. Similarly, in those data a regular correspondence can be seen between Hawaiian and Rapanui ''h'', Tongan and Samoan ''f'', Maori ''ɸ'', and Rarotongan ''ʔ''.

Mere phonetic similarity, as between [[English language|English]] ''day'' and [[Latin]] ''dies'' (both with the same meaning), has no probative value.&lt;ref name="ltwo"&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p= 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; English initial ''d-'' does not ''regularly'' match {{nowrap|Latin ''d-''&lt;ref name="bonetwoseven"&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}—it is not possible to assemble a large set of English and Latin non-borrowed cognates such that English ''d'' repeatedly and consistently corresponds to Latin ''d'' at the beginning of a word—and whatever sporadic matches can be observed are due either to chance (as in the above example) or to [[loanword|borrowing]] (for example, Latin ''diabolus'' and English ''devil''—both ultimately of Greek origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= devil|encyclopedia= Dictionary.com|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/devil}}&lt;/ref&gt;). English and Latin ''do'' exhibit a regular correspondence of ''t-'' : ''d-''&lt;ref name="bonetwoseven"/&gt; (where the notation "A : B" means "A corresponds to B"); for example,&lt;ref&gt;In Latin, |c| represents {{IPA|/k/}}; ''dingua'' is an [[Old Latin]] form of the word later attested as ''lingua'' ("tongue").&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

If there are many regular correspondence sets of this kind (the more the better), then a common origin becomes a virtual certainty, particularly if some of the correspondences are non-trivial or unusual.&lt;ref name="ltwothree"/&gt;

====Step 3, discover which sets are in complementary distribution====
During the late 18th to late 19th century, two major developments improved the method's effectiveness.

First, it was found{{by whom?|date=November 2017}} that many sound changes are conditioned by a specific ''context''. For example, in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]], an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[stop consonant|stop]] evolved into an unaspirated one, but only if a second aspirate occurred later in the same word;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p= 128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this is [[Grassmann's law]], first described for [[Sanskrit]] by [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit grammarian]] [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sag|1974|p=591}}; {{harvnb|Janda|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and promulgated by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1863.

Second, it was found that sometimes sound changes occurred in contexts that were later lost. For instance, in Sanskrit [[Velar consonant|velars]] (''k''-like sounds) were replaced by [[Palatal consonant|palatals]] (''ch''-like sounds) whenever the following vowel was ''*i'' or ''*e''.&lt;ref&gt;The asterisk (*) indicates that the sound is inferred/reconstructed, rather than historically documented or attested&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to this change, all instances of ''*e'' were replaced by ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Or, more accurately, earlier ''*e'', ''*o'', and ''*a'' merged as ''a''.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation would have been unreconstructable, had not the original distribution of ''e'' and ''a'' been recoverable from the evidence of other [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 60–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Latin]] suffix ''que'', "and", preserves the original ''*e'' vowel that caused the consonant shift in Sanskrit:

{| class="wikitable"

| align=center | &amp;nbsp;''*ke''&amp;nbsp;

| &amp;nbsp;'''2.'''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;''*ce''&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;Velars replaced by palatals before ''*i'' and ''*e''&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''3.'''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;''ca''&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;The attested Sanskrit form. ''*e'' has become ''a''&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''4.'''&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;''ca''&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;Pronounced ''ča'', Avestan "and"&amp;nbsp;
|}

[[Verner's Law]], discovered by [[Karl Verner]] {{circa}} 1875, provides a similar case: the [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of consonants in [[Germanic languages]] underwent a change that was determined by the position of the old Indo-European [[Stress (linguistics)|accent]]. Following the change, the accent shifted to initial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Verner solved the puzzle by comparing the Germanic voicing pattern with Greek and Sanskrit accent patterns.

This stage of the comparative method, therefore, involves examining the correspondence sets discovered in step 2 and seeing which of them apply only in certain contexts. If two (or more) sets apply in [[complementary distribution]], they can be assumed to reflect a single original [[phoneme]]: "some sound changes, particularly conditioned sound changes, can result in a proto-sound being associated with more than one correspondence set".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 136}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following potential cognate list can be established for [[Romance languages]], which descend from [[Latin]]:

Since French ''{{IPA|ʃ}}'' only occurs before ''a'' where the other languages also have ''a'', while French ''k'' occurs elsewhere, the difference is due to different environments (being before an ''a'' conditions the change) and the sets are complementary. They can therefore be assumed to reflect a single proto-phoneme (in this case ''*k'', spelled |c| in [[Latin language|Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Latin words are ''corpus'', ''crudus'', ''catena'' and ''captiare'', all with an initial k-sound. If more evidence along these lines were given, one might conclude an alteration of the original k took place because of a different environment.

A more complex case involves consonant clusters in [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]]. The Algonquianist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] used the reflexes of the clusters in four of the daughter languages to reconstruct the following correspondence sets:&lt;ref&gt;The table is modified from that in {{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p= 141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all five correspondence sets overlap with one another in various places, they are not in complementary distribution, and so Bloomfield recognized that a different cluster must be reconstructed for each set; his reconstructions were, respectively, ''*hk'', ''*xk'', ''*čk'' (={{IPA|[t͡ʃk]}}), ''*šk'' (={{IPA|[ʃk]}}), and ''çk'' (where {{'}}''x''{{'}} and {{'}}''ç''{{'}} are arbitrary symbols, not attempts to guess the phonetic value of the proto-phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Step 4, reconstruct proto-phonemes====
Typology assists in deciding what reconstruction best fits the data. For example, the voicing of voiceless stops between vowels is common, but not the devoicing of voiced stops in that environment. If a correspondence ''-t-'' : ''-d-'' between vowels is found in two languages, the proto-[[phoneme]] is more likely to be ''*-t-'', with a development to the voiced form in the second language. The opposite reconstruction would represent a rare type.

However, unusual sound changes do occur. The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for ''two'', for example, is reconstructed as ''*dwō'', which is reflected in [[Classical Armenian]] as ''erku''. Several other cognates demonstrate a regular change ''*dw-'' → ''erk-'' in Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p= 28}}; citing {{harvnb|Szemerényi| 1960|p= 96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Bearlake, a dialect of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan language]] of [[Slavey language|Slavey]], there has been a sound change of Proto-Athabaskan ''*ts'' → Bearlake ''{{IPA|kʷ}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1997|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very unlikely that ''*dw-'' changed directly into ''erk-'' and ''*ts'' into ''{{IPA|kʷ}}'', but instead they probably went through several intermediate steps to arrive at the later forms. It is not phonetic similarity which matters when utilizing the comparative method, but regular sound correspondences.&lt;ref name="ltwo"/&gt;

By the [[principle of economy]], the reconstruction of a proto-phoneme should require as few sound changes as possible to arrive at the modern reflexes in the daughter languages. For example, [[Algonquian languages]] exhibit the following correspondence set:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.native-languages.org/famalg_words.htm|title= Vocabulary Words in the Algonquian Language Family|date= 1998–2009|publisher= Native Languages of the Americas|first= Laura|last= Redish|first2= Orrin|last2= Lewis|accessdate= 20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

| align=center | &amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;
| align=center | &amp;nbsp;b&amp;nbsp;
|}

The simplest reconstruction for this set would be either ''*m'' or ''*b''. Both ''*m'' → ''b'' and ''*b'' → ''m'' are likely. Because ''m'' occurs in five of the languages, and ''b'' in only one, if ''*b'' is reconstructed, then it is necessary to assume five separate changes of ''*b'' → ''m'', whereas if ''*m'' is reconstructed, it is only necessary to assume a single change of ''*m'' → ''b''. ''*m'' would be most economical. (This argument assumes that the languages other than Arapaho are at least partly independent of each other. If they all formed a common subgroup, the development ''*b'' → ''m'' would only have to be assumed to have occurred once.)

====Step 5, examine the reconstructed system typologically====
In the final step, the linguist checks to see how the proto-[[phoneme]]s fit the known [[linguistic typology|typological constraints]]. For example, a hypothetical system,
{| class="wikitable"
! &amp;nbsp; p &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; t &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; k &amp;nbsp;
|-
! &amp;nbsp; b &amp;nbsp;

|-
!
! &amp;nbsp; n &amp;nbsp;
! &amp;nbsp; ŋ &amp;nbsp;
|-
!

|}

has only one [[Voiced bilabial stop|voiced stop]], ''*b'', and although it has an [[alveolar nasal|alveolar]] and a [[velar nasal]], ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'', there is no corresponding [[Bilabial nasal|labial nasal]]. However, languages generally (though not always) tend to maintain symmetry in their phonemic inventories. In this case, the linguist might attempt to investigate the possibilities that what was earlier reconstructed as ''*b'' is in fact ''*m'', or that the ''*n'' and ''*ŋ'' are in fact ''*d'' and ''*g''.

Even a symmetrical system can be typologically suspicious. For example, the traditional [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stop inventory is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier voiceless aspirated row was removed on grounds of insufficient evidence. Since the mid-20th century, a number of linguists have argued that this phonology is implausible;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p= 143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is extremely unlikely for a language to have a voiced aspirated ([[breathy voice]]) series without a corresponding voiceless aspirated series. [[Thomas Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] provided a potential solution, arguing that the series traditionally reconstructed as plain voiced should in fact be reconstructed as [[Glottalization|glottalized]]—either [[implosive consonant|implosive]] {{IPA|(ɓ, ɗ, ɠ)}} or [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] {{IPA|(pʼ, tʼ, kʼ)}}. The plain voiceless and voiced aspirated series would thus be replaced by just voiceless and voiced, with aspiration being a non-distinctive quality of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|pp= 109–113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This example of the application of linguistic typology to linguistic reconstruction has become known as the [[Glottalic theory|Glottalic Theory]]. It has a large number of proponents but is not generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi| 1996|pp= 151–152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative, the voiceless aspirated row was restored.{{by whom|date=December 2016}}

The reconstruction of proto-sounds logically precedes the reconstruction of grammatical [[morpheme]]s (word-forming affixes and inflectional endings), patterns of [[declension]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], and so on. The full reconstruction of an unrecorded protolanguage is an open-ended task.

==Limitations==

===Problems with the history of historical linguistics===
The limitations of the comparative method were recognized by the very linguists who developed it,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=4–5, 7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still seen as a valuable tool. In the case of Indo-European, the method seemed to at least partially validate the centuries-old search for an [[Ursprache]], the original language. These others were presumed ordered in a [[family tree]], becoming the [[tree model]] of the [[neogrammarians]].

The archaeologists followed suit, attempting to find archaeological evidence of a culture or cultures that could be presumed to have spoken a [[proto-language]], such as [[Vere Gordon Childe]]'s ''The Aryans: a study of Indo-European origins'', 1926. Childe was a philologist turned archaeologist. These views culminated in the ''Siedlungsarchaologie'', or "settlement-archaeology", of [[Gustaf Kossinna]], becoming known as "Kossinna's Law". He asserted that cultures represent ethnic groups, including their languages. It was rejected as a law in the post–World War II era. The fall of Kossinna's Law removed the temporal and spatial framework previously applied to many proto-languages. Fox concludes:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1995|pp=141–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Comparative Method ''as such'' is not, in fact, historical; it provides evidence of linguistic relationships to which we may give a historical interpretation. ...[Our increased knowledge about the historical processes involved] has probably made historical linguists less prone to equate the idealizations required by the method with historical reality. ...Provided we keep [the interpretation of the results and the method itself] apart, the Comparative Method can continue to be used in the reconstruction of earlier stages of languages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proto-languages can be verified in many historical instances, such as Latin. Although no longer a law, settlement-archaeology is known to be essentially valid for some cultures that straddle history and prehistory, such as the Celtic Iron Age (mainly Celtic) and [[Mycenaean civilization]] (mainly Greek). None of these models can be or have been completely rejected, and yet none alone are sufficient.

===Problems with the neogrammarian hypothesis===
The foundation of the comparative method, and of comparative linguistics in general, is the [[Neogrammarian]]s' fundamental assumption that "sound laws have no exceptions". When it was initially proposed, critics of the Neogrammarians proposed an alternate position, summarized by the maxim "each word has its own history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several types of change do in fact alter words in non-regular ways. Unless identified, they may hide or distort laws and cause false perceptions of relationship.

====Borrowing====
All languages [[loanword|borrow words]] from other languages in various contexts. They are likely to have followed the laws of the languages from which they were borrowed rather than the laws of the borrowing language.

====Areal diffusion====
Borrowing on a larger scale occurs in [[Areal feature (linguistics)|areal diffusion]], when features are adopted by contiguous languages over a geographical area. The borrowing may be [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Morpheme|morphological]] or [[Lexeme|lexical]]. A false proto-language over the area may be reconstructed for them or may be taken to be a third language serving as a source of diffused features.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|2001|pp=2–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several areal features and other influences may converge to form a [[sprachbund]], a wider region sharing features that appear to be related but are diffusional. For instance, the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] suggested several false classifications of such languages as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] before it was recognized.

====Random mutations====
Sporadic changes, such as irregular inflections, compounding, and abbreviation, do not follow any laws. For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words ''palabra'' ('word'), ''peligro'' ('danger') and ''milagro'' ('miracle') should have been ''parabla'', ''periglo'', ''miraglo'' by regular sound changes from the Latin ''parabŏla'', ''perīcŭlum'' and ''mīrācŭlum'', but the ''r'' and ''l'' changed places by sporadic [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analogy====
[[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]] is the sporadic change of a feature to be like another feature in the same or a different language. It may affect a single word or be generalized to an entire class of features, such as a verb paradigm. For example, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for ''nine'', by regular sound changes from [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], should have been {{IPA|/nʲevʲatʲ/}}, but is in fact {{IPA|/dʲevʲatʲ/}}. It is believed that the initial ''{{IPA|nʲ-}}'' changed to ''{{IPA|dʲ-}}'' under influence of the word for "ten" in Russian, {{IPA|/dʲesʲatʲ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gradual application====
Students of contemporary language changes, such as [[William Labov]], note that even a systematic sound change is at first applied in an unsystematic fashion, with the percentage of its occurrence in a person's speech dependent on various social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beekes|1995|p=55}}; {{harvnb|Szemerényi|1996|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sound change gradually spreads, a process known as [[lexical diffusion]]. While not invalidating the Neogrammarians' axiom that "sound laws have no exceptions", their gradual application shows that they do not always apply to all lexical items at the same time. Hock notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1991|pp=446–447}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "While it probably is true in the long run every word has its own history, it is not justified to conclude as some linguists have, that therefore the Neogrammarian position on the nature of linguistic change is falsified."

===Problems with the tree model===
The comparative method is used to construct a tree model (German ''Stammbaum'') of language evolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which daughter languages are seen as branching from the [[proto-language]], gradually growing more distant from it through accumulated [[phonology|phonological]], [[morpho-syntactic]], and [[lexicon|lexical]] changes.

Not all branches and languages are shown.]]

====The presumption of a well-defined node====
[[File:Wave model Schmidt.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Wave model (linguistics)|Wave Model]] has been proposed as an alternative to the [[tree model]] for representing language change.&lt;ref&gt;This diagram is based partly on the one found in Fox 1995:128, and Johannes Schmidt, 1872. ''Die Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse der indogermanischen Sprachen''. Weimar: H. Böhlau&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[Venn diagram]], each circle represents a "wave" or [[isogloss]], i.e. the maximum geographical extension of a linguistic change as it propagated through the speaker population. These circles, which represent successive historical events of propagation, typically intersect. Each language in the family differs as to which isoglosses it belongs to, i.e. which innovations it reflects. The tree model presumes that all the circles should be nested, and never crosscut; but studies in [[dialectology]] and historical linguistics have shown this assumption to be usually wrong, suggesting that the wave-based approach may be more realistic than the tree model. A genealogical family in which isoglosses intersect is called a [[dialect continuum]] or a ''[[linkage (linguistics)|linkage]]''.]]
The tree model features nodes that are presumed to be distinct proto-languages existing independently in distinct regions during distinct historical times. The reconstruction of unattested proto-languages lends itself to that illusion: they cannot be verified and the linguist is free to select whatever definite times and places for them seem best. Right from the outset of Indo-European studies, however, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Miscellaneous works of the late Thomas Young|first=Thomas |last=Young|contribution=Languages, From the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. V, 1824|volume=Volume III, Hieroglyphical Essays and Correspondence, &amp;c.|editor-first=John|editor-last=Leitch|location=London|publisher=John Murray|year=1855|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not, however, very easy to say what the definition should be that should constitute a separate language, but it seems most natural to call those languages distinct, of which the one cannot be understood by common persons in the habit of speaking the other ... Still, however, it may remain doubtfull whether the Danes and the Swedes could not, in general, understand each other tolerably well ... nor is it possible to say if the twenty ways of pronouncing the sounds, belonging to the Chinese characters, ought or ought not to be considered as so many languages or dialects... But, ... the languages so nearly allied must stand next to each other in a systematic order…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The assumption of uniformity in a proto-language, implicit in the comparative method, is problematic. Even in small language communities there are always [[Dialect|dialect differences]], whether based on area, gender, class, or other factors. The [[Pirahã language]] of [[Brazil]] is spoken by only several hundred people, but it has at least two different dialects, one spoken by men and one by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aikhenvald|1999|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Ladefoged|2003|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell points out:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not so much that the comparative method 'assumes' no variation; rather, it is just that there is nothing built into the comparative method which would allow it to address variation directly....This assumption of uniformity is a reasonable idealization; it does no more damage to the understanding of the language than, say, modern reference grammars do which concentrate on a language's general structure, typically leaving out consideration of regional or social variation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Different dialects, as they evolve into separate languages, remain in contact with one another and influence each other. Even after they are considered distinct, languages near to one another continue to influence each other, often sharing grammatical, phonological, and lexical innovations. A change in one language of a family may spread to neighboring languages; and multiple waves of change are communicated like waves across language and dialect boundaries, each with its own randomly delimited range.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1995|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a language is divided into an inventory of features, each with its own time and range ([[isogloss]]es), they do not all coincide. History and prehistory may not offer a time and place for a distinct coincidence, as may be the case for [[Italic languages|proto-Italic]], in which case the proto-language is only a concept. However, Hock&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hock|1991|p=454}}.&lt;/ref&gt; observes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The discovery in the late nineteenth century that [[isogloss]]es can cut across well-established linguistic boundaries at first created considerable attention and controversy. And it became fashionable to oppose a wave theory to a tree theory... Today, however, it is quite evident that the phenomena referred to by these two terms are complementary aspects of linguistic change...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Subjectivity of the reconstruction====
The reconstruction of unknown proto-languages is inherently subjective.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In the [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]] example above, the choice of ''*m'' as the parent [[phoneme]] is only ''likely'', not ''certain''. It is conceivable that a Proto-Algonquian language with ''*b'' in those positions split into two branches, one which preserved ''*b'' and one which changed it to ''*m'' instead; and while the first branch only developed into [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], the second spread out wider and developed into all the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes. It is also possible that the nearest common ancestor of the [[Algonquian languages]] used some other sound instead, such as ''*p'', which eventually mutated to ''*b'' in one branch and to ''*m'' in the other. While examples of strikingly complicated and even circular developments are indeed known to have occurred (such as [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*t'' &gt; Pre-Proto-Germanic ''*þ'' &gt; [[Proto-Germanic language|PG]] ''*ð'' &gt; Proto-West-Germanic ''*d'' &gt; [[Old High German]] ''t'' in ''fater'' &gt; Modern German ''Vater''), in the absence of any evidence or other reason to postulate a more complicated development, the preference of a simpler explanation is justified by the principle of parsimony, also known as [[Occam's razor]]. Since reconstruction involves many of these choices, some linguists prefer to view the reconstructed features as abstract representations of sound correspondences, rather than as objects with a historical time and place.

The existence of proto-languages and the validity of the comparative method is verifiable in cases where the reconstruction can be matched to a known language, which may only be known as a shadow in the [[loanword]]s of another language. For example, [[Finnic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] have borrowed many words from an early stage of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and the shape of the loans matches the forms that have been reconstructed for [[Proto-Germanic]]. Finnish ''kuningas'' 'king' and ''kaunis'' 'beautiful' match the Germanic reconstructions *''kuningaz'' and *''skauniz'' (&gt; German ''König'' 'king', ''schön'' 'beautiful').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kylstra|1996|p=62}} for KAUNIS, p. 122 for KUNINGAS.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional models====
The [[Wave model (linguistics)|Wave model]] was developed in the 1870s as an alternative to the tree model, in order to represent the historical patterns of language diversification. Both the tree-based and the wave-based representations are compatible with the Comparative Method.&lt;ref&gt;[[#linkage|François (2014)]], [[#kf|Kalyan &amp; François (2018)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, some approaches are incompatible with the Comparative method, including [[glottochronology]] and [[mass lexical comparison]]. Most historical linguists consider these to be flawed and unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2004|p=201}}; {{harvnb|Lyovin|1997|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7687">{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Consumer capitalism''' is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which  [[demand|consumer demand]] is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through [[mass-marketing]] techniques, to the advantage of sellers.

This theory is controversial.  It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a [[coercion|coercive]] effect, amounts to a departure from [[free-market capitalism]], and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straightforward. It depends upon a new kind of individualism - ''projective individualism'', where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2012 | last1= James | first1= Paul | last2= Scerri | first2= Andy | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalizing Consumption and the Deferral of a Politics of Consequence | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230921/Globalizing_Consumption_and_the_Deferral_of_a_Politics_of_Consequence | journal= Globalizations | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 225–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.

== Origins ==

The origins of consumer capitalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silla|first=Cesare|title=The Rise of Consumer Capitalism in America, 1880-1930|year=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=London-New York|url= https://books.google.it/books?id=oqVYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;dq=the+rise+of+consumer+capitalism+in+america&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZbDa8RGHMV&amp;sig=QfS3VAuSNLwfU2eXMH2wi4pKB2U&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf2cWsw_3aAhUrKpoKHTzvDRcQ6AEIUDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20rise%20of%20consumer%20capitalism%20in%20america&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the development of American [[department store]]s from the mid 19th Century, notably the advertising and marketing innovations at [[Wanamaker's]] in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Author William Leach describes a deliberate, coordinated effort among American '[[Captain of industry|captains of industry]]' to detach consumer demand from 'needs' (which can be satisfied) to 'wants' (which may remain unsatisfied).  This cultural shift represented by the department store is also explored in [[Émile Zola]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Au Bonheur des Dames]]'', which describes the workings and the appeal of a fictionalized version of [[Le Bon Marché]].

In 1919 [[Edward Bernays]] began his career as the 'father of [[public relations]]' and successfully applied the developing principles of psychology, sociology and motivational research to manipulate public opinion in favor of products like cigarettes, soap, and [[Calvin Coolidge]].  New techniques of mechanical reproduction developed in these decades improved the channels of mass-market communication and its manipulative power.  This development was described as early as the 1920s by [[Walter Benjamin]] and related members of the [[Frankfurt School]], who foresaw the commercial, societal and political implications.

In business history, the mid-1920s saw [[Alfred P. Sloan]] stimulating increased demand for [[General Motors]] products by instituting the annual model year change and [[planned obsolescence]], a move that changed the dynamics of the largest industrial enterprise in the world, away from technological innovation and towards satisfying market expectations.

Probably the most obvious example of consumer capital tactics in the United States' history occurred during the first world war.  During which the United States' government put out several campaigns and advertisements aimed to gain support for engaging in the war. At this time the government's involvement in the economy was known as propaganda.  Advertisements, posters and campaigns were found everywhere, encouraging the public to add to the economy and consume more.  Many of these public attempts encouraged mass consumption of domestic food to help put back into the economy and support the war. and  In her book, Celia Malone Kingsbury even discusses how during the war the government manipulated the economy in such a way that the consumption of domestic food was made into a "powerful weapon."&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, Celia Malone. For Home and Country: World War I Propaganda on the Home Front. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2010. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; The government manipulated the public by turning commercialism into a sort of nationalism, pride and support of one's country.

== Criticism ==
An important contribution to the critique of consumer capitalism has been made by the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], but very little of this has been translated into English. Stiegler argues that capitalism today is governed not by production but by consumption, and that the techniques used to create consumer behavior amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]]. The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyperconsumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler discusses consumer capitalism in his article [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/disaffected-individual-process-psychic-and-collective-disindividuation The Disaffected Individual]. His response to the situation can be discerned by reading the [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/manifeste/index_html-en?set_language=en&amp;cl=en manifesto] of his political group, [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/ Ars Industrialis].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer capitalism today==

In light of the economic hardships the United States is today experiencing as a result of radical wealth inequalities, and perhaps a strong dependence on oil, consumer capitalist tactics have turned to credit as a means to maintaining a high level of expenditures in the form of consumer demand. Some of these tactics, to cite one extremely peripheral example, include government incentives to buy eco-friendly 'green' products, such as tax deductions for energy conserving home improvements or the purchasing of hybrid cars. These tactics, however, are not without critics. James Gustave Speth, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and author of ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability,'' does not believe the United States government should implement such tactics. Instead Gustave believes in more direct approaches to repair or avoid environmental damage. Rather than focusing on re-boosting the distressed economy, treat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Speth, James G. The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability. Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies - Masters of Environmental Management. Web. 27 Feb. 2011. &lt; http://environment.yale.edu/news/5647/ &gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">'''Contentious politics''' is the use of disruptive techniques to make a [[politics|political]] point, or to change government policy. Examples of such techniques are actions that disturb the normal activities of society such as [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], general [[strike action]], [[riot]], [[terrorism]], [[civil disobedience]], and even [[revolution]] or [[insurrection]]. [[Social movements]] often engage in contentious politics.  The concept distinguishes these forms of contention from the everyday acts of resistance explored by [[James C. Scott]], interstate warfare, and forms of contention employed entirely within institutional settings, such as elections or sports.  Historical sociologist [[Charles Tilly]] defines contentious politics as "interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties."&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, Charles. Contentious Performances. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contentious politics has existed forever, but its form varies over time and space.  For example, Tilly argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with the birth of [[social movements]] in 18th-century Europe.  

The concept of contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: [[Sidney Tarrow]], Charles Tilly, and [[Doug McAdam]].  Until its development, the study of contentious politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned with the description and explanation of different contentious political phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution.  One of the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda.&lt;ref&gt;McAdam, Doug, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these three propose.

{{Culture of Pakistan}}
'''Culture of Pakistan''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ثقافتِ پاکستان}}}} {{transl|ur|''S̱aqāfat-e-Pākistān''}}) is intertwined with the culture of the broader [[Indian subcontinent]]. Comprises numerous ethnic groups: the [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], Saraikis, Pothwaris, [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], [[Muhajir people|Muhajirs]] in east, [[Makrani]] in the south; [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Hazaras]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] in the west; and the [[Dard people|Dards]], [[Wakhi people|Wakhi]], [[Balti people|Baltis]], [[Shina people|Shinaki]] and [[Burusho people|Burusho]] communities in the north. The culture of these Pakistani ethnic groups have been greatly influenced by many of its neighbours, such as the other [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asian]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranic]], [[Turkic people|Turkic]] as well as the peoples of [[Central Asia]] and [[West Asia]].

The region has formed a distinct unit within the main geographical complex of [[Indian subcontinent]], [[West Asia]] the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] from the earliest times, and is analogous to the position of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Basham"&gt;Basham, A.L. (1968), Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia, 641-643&lt;/ref&gt; There are differences among the ethnic groups in cultural aspects such as dress, food, and religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices. Their cultural origins also reveal influences from far afield and indigenous, including [[ancient India]] and [[Central Asia]]. Pakistan was the first region of the Indian subcontinent to be fully impacted by [[Islam]] and has thus developed a distinct Islamic identity, historically different from areas further east.&lt;ref name=" Basham"/&gt;

==Literature==

[[File:Iqbal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Muhammad Iqbal]] was the ideological father of Pakistan]]
Pakistani literature originates from when Pakistan gained its [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] as a sovereign state in 1947. The common and shared tradition of [[Urdu literature]] and [[English literature]] of [[Greater India]] was inherited by the new state. Over a period of time, a body of literature unique to Pakistan emerged, written in nearly all major Pakistani languages, including [[Urdu]], [[English language|English]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Pashto]], [[Saraiki dialect|Seraiki]], [[Balochi language|Baloch]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].

==Poetry==
{{Main|Pakistani poetry|List of Urdu Poets}}
Poetry is a highly respected art and profession in Pakistan. The pre-eminent form of poetry in Pakistan almost always originates in Persian, due in part to the long-standing affiliation and heavy admiration the region's rulers once had for certain aspects of foreign Persian culture. The enthusiasm for poetry exists at a regional level as well, with nearly all of Pakistan's provincial languages continuing the legacy. Since the independence of the country in 1947 and establishment of [[Urdu]] as the national language, poetry is written in that language as well. The Urdu language has a rich tradition of poetry and includes the famous poets [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (national poet), [[Mir Taqi Mir]], [[Ghalib]], [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], [[Ahmad Faraz]], [[Habib Jalib]], [[Jazib Qureshi]], and [[Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi]]. Apart from [[Urdu poetry]], Pakistani poetry also has blends of other regional languages. Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi, Seraiki, and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] have all incorporated and influenced Pakistani poetry.

==Performing arts==

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Pakistan}}
[[File:0407 207.jpg|thumb|right|A sitar workshop in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan.]]
The variety of [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani music]] ranges from diverse provincial folk music and traditional styles such as [[Qawwali]] and [[Ghazal|Ghazal Gayaki]] to modern forms fusing traditional and [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and Western music by the world-renowned [[Sabri Brothers]] and [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]]. In addition, Pakistan is home to many famous folk singers such as the late [[Alam Lohar]], who is also well known in [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]]. The arrival of [[Afghan refugees]] in the western provinces has rekindled [[Dari language|Dari]] music and established [[Peshawar]] as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution center for Afghani music abroad.

===Dances===

[[Kathak]]
-the classical dance that developed in the royal courts of the [[Mughals]].

Folk dances are still popular in Pakistan and vary according to the region such as:

===Architecture===
{{Main|Pakistani architecture}}
[[File: Lahore Fort.jpg|thumb|The [[Lahore Fort]], a landmark built during the Mughal era, is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]
The architecture of the areas now constituting Pakistan can be traced to four distinct periods: [[History of Pakistan#Prehistory|pre-Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Muslim period|Islamic]], [[History of Pakistan#Colonial era|colonial]], and [[History of Pakistan#Independence|post-colonial]]. With the beginning of the [[Indus civilization]] around the middle of the [[3rd millennium]]&lt;ref&gt;Dehejia, Vidja [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sasa/hd_sasa.htm South Asian Art and Culture].

The rise of [[Buddhism]], [[Guptas]], [[Mauryan Empire|Mouryas]], and the [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Greece|Greek]] influence led to the development of the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] style, starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was reached with the culmination of the [[Gandhara]] style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery [[Takht Bhai|Takht-i-Bahi]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]].

The arrival of [[Islam]] in today's Pakistan introduced the classical Islamic construction techniques into Pakistan's architectural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistaniat.com/2006/10/10/pakistan-architecture-history/comment-page-2/ Architecture in Pakistan: A Historical Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116062612/http://pakistaniat.com/2006/10/10/pakistan-architecture-history/comment-page-2/ |date=16 January 2009 }}. &lt;u&gt;All Things Pakistan&lt;/u&gt;. Retrieved on 10 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, a smooth transition to predominantly picture-less [[Islamic architecture]] occurred. The town of [[Uch Sharif]] contains the tombs of Bibi Jawindi, Baha'is-Halim, and Jalaluddin Bukhari, which are considered some of the earliest examples of Islamic architecture in Pakistan and are on the UNESCO Tentative World Heritage Site list since 2004.&lt;ref name=whs&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/PK UNESCO World Heritage State Parties Pakistan] Retrieved 9 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important of the few examples of the Persian style of architecture is the [[Rukn-e-Alam|tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam]] in [[Multan]]. During the [[Mughal era]], design elements of Islamic-Persian architecture were fused with, and often produced playful forms of, local art, resulting in the establishment of [[Mughal Architecture]]. [[Lahore]], occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the [[Badshahi mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort|fortress of Lahore]] with the famous [[Alamgiri Gate]], the colourful, still strongly [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]]-influenced [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. The [[Shahjahan Mosque]] of [[Thatta]] in Sindh also originates from the epoch of the Mughals, as does the [[Mohabbat Khan Mosque]] in [[Peshawar]].

In the British colonial age, the buildings developed were predominantly of the Indo-European style, with a mixture of European and Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures like the [[Faisal Mosque]], the [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] and the [[Mazar-e-Quaid]].

==Festivals and observances==
{{Main|Public holidays in Pakistan}}

===Ramadan===
[[Ramadan]], the holiest month of the [[Islamic calendar]], is a month of fasting from dawn to sunset. It is widely observed by Pakistan's Muslim majority. Muslims during this month will fast, attend mosques with increased frequency, and offer "Namaz-traveeh" every day with Isha prayer and recite Qur'an. Special foods are cooked in greater quantities, parties are held, and special accommodation is made by workplaces and educational institutes.

===Chand Raat===
[[Chand Raat]] is the ''Moon night'' when [[Hilal (crescent moon)|crescent moon]] is sighted on last day of Islamic month of [[Ramadan]] and next day is [[Eid ul-Fitr]]. In the night known as Chand Raat, people celebrate by various means, such as girls putting [[henna]] on their hands. People buy gifts and sweets that will be given to friends and families who come over to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The streets, major buildings, and landmarks, even outside of malls and plazas, put on displays of elaborate decorations and colorful light shows. There are large crowds in the city center to celebrate the beginning of Eid, and it is usually a boom time for business.

===Eid celebrations===
[[File: Badshahi Masjid at night on July 20 2005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 17th-century Badshahi Mosque built by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in Lahore]]
The two Eids, [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], commemorate the passing of the month of fasting, Ramadan, and the willingness of [[Abraham|Ibrahim]] to sacrifice his son [[Ishmael|Ismael]] for [[Allah]]. On these days, there are national holidays and many festival events that take place to celebrate Eid.&lt;As Pakistan is a Muslim state, there are three days off for all businesses and government offices.

On the night before Eid, people search for the [[new moon]] to mark the end of Ramadan and arrival of Eid ul-Fitr. The day starts with morning prayers, then returning home for a large breakfast with family members. The day is spent visiting relatives and friends and sharing gifts and sweets with everyone. During the evening, Pakistanis often party, visit restaurants or relax in city parks.

On Eid ul-Fitr, money is given for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] and as gifts to young children.

On Eid ul-Adha, people may also distribute meat to relatives and neighbors and donate food to charity.

===Milaad un Nabi===
[[Milaad|Milaad un Nabi]] is a known religious festival which is celebrated in all over Pakistan. The Milaad is the celebration of the birthday of the Islamic last prophet [[Muhammad]].

===Muharram (Ashura)===
{{Main|Mourning of Muharram}}
Muharram is a month of remembrance and modern [[Shia]] meditation that is often considered synonymous with Ashura. Ashura, which literally means the "Tenth" in Arabic, refers to the tenth day of Muharram. It is well-known because of historical significance and mourning for the martyrdom of Hussein Ibn Ali, the grandson of [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref name="TIO20101208"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theismaili.org/cms/1125/Muharram | title=Muharram |accessdate=2010-12-08 |date=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias begin mourning from the first night of Muharram and continue for ten nights, climaxing on the 10th of Muharram, known as the Day of Ashura. The last few days up until and including the Day of Ashura are the most important because these were the days in which Imam Hussein and his family and followers (including women, children, and elderly people) were deprived of water from the 7th onward and on the 10th, Imam Hussain and 72 of his followers were martyred by the army of [[Yazid I]] at the [[Battle of Karbala]] on Yazid's orders. The surviving members of Imam Hussein's family and those of his followers were taken captive, marched to Damascus, and imprisoned there.

With the sighting of the [[new moon]], the [[Islamic New Year]] is ushered in. The first month, Muharram is one of the four sacred months that [Allah] has mentioned in the [[Quran]].

===Jashn-e-Baharan===
{{Main|Basant (season)}}
Jashn-e-Baharan sometimes referred to as ''Basant'', is a pre-Islamic [[Punjabi culture|Punjabi]] festival that marks the coming of spring. Celebrations in Pakistan are centered in [[Lahore]], and people from all over the country and abroad come to the city for the annual festivities. [[Kite flying]] competitions took place all over the city's rooftops during Basant but are now prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imadahmed.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/when-kites-turn-lethal/ | title = A celebration of spring turns ugly | accessdate=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile province of Punjab was intimately tied via its agriculture to the different seasons of the year. The arrival of spring was an important event for all farmers and was welcomed with a celebration, hence the name ''Jashn'' (celebration) ''Baharan'' (spring).{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Independence Day===
{{Main|Independence Day (Pakistan)}}
On 14th. August, the people of Pakistan celebrate the day when Pakistan gained its independence from [[British India]] and became an independent state for Muslims of South Asia. The day begins with gatherings and prayers in mosques all across Pakistan in which people pray for the betterment and success of their country. Early in the morning, a 21 cannon salute is given to all those who contributed and lost their lives for attaining Independence. Flag hoisting ceremonies are held in the capital [[Islamabad]] and all capital cities of other provinces. Mega-events are organized all across the country, in which the people of Pakistan sing their national anthem and famous classical and pop singers sing various patriotic songs. Famous governmental and private buildings are decorated with lights and the day is concluded by a spectacular firework in Major cities of Pakistan.

===Defense Day Parade===
{{Main|Defence Day}}
September 6 is another patriotic day when the [[Pakistan Army|Army of Pakistan]] displays Pakistani weaponry to the general public. All government officials attend the ceremony and recognitions are awarded to special people for their work. In March 2007, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] (PAF) displayed the new jointly manufactured Chinese-Pakistani aircraft called the [[JF-17 Thunder]].

==Popular media==

===Television===
{{Main|Television in Pakistan}}
Traditionally, the government-owned [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) has been the dominant media player in Pakistan. The PTV channels are controlled by the government and opposition views are not given much time. The past decade has seen the emergence of several private TV channels showing news and entertainment, such as [[GEO TV]], [[AAJ TV]], [[ARY Digital]], [[Hum TV|HUM]], [[MTV Pakistan]], and others. Traditionally the bulk of TV shows have been plays or soap operas, some of them critically acclaimed. Various American, European, Asian TV channels, and movies are available to a majority of the population via [[Cable TV]]. Television accounted for almost half of the advertising expenditure in Pakistan in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warc.com/LandingPages/Data/NewspaperTrends/PDF/Pakistan.pdf   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006112718/http://www.warc.com/LandingPages/Data/NewspaperTrends/PDF/Pakistan.pdf |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
{{Main|Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation}}
{{See also|List of Pakistani radio channels}}
The Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) was formed on 14 August 1947, the day of Pakistani independence. It was a direct descendant of the Indian Broadcasting Company, which later became [[All India Radio]]. At independence, Pakistan had radio stations in [[Dhaka]], [[Lahore]], and [[Peshawar]]. A major programme of expansion saw new stations open at [[Karachi]] and [[Rawalpindi]] in 1948, and a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950. This was followed by new radio stations at [[Hyderabad, Pakistan|Hyderabad]] (1951), [[Quetta]] (1956), the second station at Rawalpindi (1960), and a receiving center at Peshawar (1960). During the 1980s and 1990s, the corporation expanded its network to many cities and towns of Pakistan to provide greater service to the local people. Today, there are over a hundred radio stations due to more liberal media regulations.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Pakistan}}
{{See also|List of Pakistani films|Lollywood|Pashto cinema|Kariwood|Kara Film Festival|Cinepax}}
Pakistan's movie industry is known as [[Lollywood]], named after the city of [[Lahore]]. Film production centers also exist in [[Karachi]] and [[Peshawar]]. The Pakistani film industry produces over forty feature-length films a year. [[Bollywood]] films are also popular in Pakistan but with recent bad relations with India, they tend to be on the cinema screen much lesser than they used to do.

[[Image:Ethical_Regulator_System.gif|thumb|right|An ethical regulator and a regulated system]]

The '''ethical regulator''' theorem&lt;ref&gt;M. Ashby, [http://ashby.de/Ethical%20Regulators.pdf "Ethical Regulators and Super-Ethical Systems"], 2017&lt;/ref&gt; builds upon the [[good regulator]] theorem&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Conant and W. R. Ashby, "[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Conant_Ashby.pdf Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system]", ''Int. J. Systems Sci.'', 1970, vol '''1''', No 2, pp. 89–97&lt;/ref&gt;, which is ambiguous because being good at regulating does not imply being good ethically. "The ethical regulator theorem claims that the following nine requisites are necessary and sufficient for a cybernetic regulator to be both effective and ethical:

# Purpose expressed as unambiguously prioritized goals.
# Truth about the past and present.
# [[Variety (cybernetics)|Variety]] of possible actions.
# Predictability of the future effects of actions.
# Intelligence to choose the best actions.
# Influence on the regulated system.
# Ethics expressed as unambiguously prioritized rules.
# Integrity of all subsystems.
# Transparency of ethical behavior.

Of these requisites, only the first six are necessary for a regulator to be effective. The three requisites ethics, integrity, and transparency are optional if a system only needs to be effective. This gives rise to the '''Law of Inevitable Ethical Inadequacy''', which states "If you don't specify that you require a secure ethical system, what you get is an insecure unethical system." The reason is that unless ethical adequacy is a requirement, a system design will tend to optimize for effectiveness, and therefore maximally ignore the optional ethical, integrity, and transparency dimensions, which inevitably results in a design and subsequent implementation that is ethically inadequate and vulnerable to manipulation.

'''Effectiveness of a regulator''' 

The ethical regulator theorem shows that the effectiveness of a cybernetic regulator depends on the strength or quality of six requisites. The effectiveness of a regulator, R, at achieving a given goal can be expressed as the function:

Effectiveness&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; = Truth&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; x (Variety&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; - Ethics&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) x Predictability&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; x Intelligence&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; x Influence&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;

If two systems, A and B, are competing for control of a third system, C, and Effectiveness&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; "is greater than Effectiveness&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then A is more likely than B to win control of C". 

The effectiveness function reflects how the variety of actions that are available to an ethical regulator is reduced by all actions that are considered unethical, which puts an ethical regulator at a disadvantage when competing against an unethical competitor.

An '''ethnic stereotype''', '''national stereotype''', or '''national character''' is a system of beliefs about typical characteristics of members of a given [[ethnic group]] or nationality, their status, society and cultural norms.

National [[stereotype]]s may be either about ones' own ethnicity/nationality or about a foreign or differing nationality or ethnicity.  Stereotypes about ones' own nation may aid in maintaining a national identity due to a collective relatability to a trait or characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Terracciano A, Abdel-Khalek AM, Adám N |title=National character does not reflect mean personality trait levels in 49 cultures |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5745 |pages=96–100 |date=Oct 2005 |pmid=16210536 |doi=10.1126/science.1117199 |pmc=2775052 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2005Sci...310...96T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes held that such stereotypes often contain a grain of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1972565.stm|title=Why do people find racist jokes funny?|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2002-05-07|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccrae-jrp/&gt; However an extensive study by personality psychologist [[Robert R.

[[List of anti-cultural, anti-national, and anti-ethnic terms|Various anti-national phobias and prejudices]] operate with ethnic stereotypes.

Ethnic stereotypes are commonly portrayed in [[ethnic joke]]s, some of which some consider to be offensive to varying degrees. Richard M. Steers and Luciara Nardon in their book about global economy use the "[[You have two cows]]" joke to illustrate the concept of cultural differences. They write jokes of this kind:&lt;ref&gt;''Managing In The Global Economy'', by  Richard M. Steers, Luciara Nardon (2005) {{ISBN|0-7656-1551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

– are considered funny because they are realistic [[caricature]]s of various cultures, and the pervasiveness of such jokes stems from the significant cultural differences. Steers and Nardon also state that others believe that cultural stereotypes in jokes of this kind must be viewed with caution.

'''Guidance, navigation and control''' (abbreviated '''GNC''',  '''GN&amp;C''', or '''G&amp;C''') is a branch of [[engineering]] dealing with the design of systems to control the movement of vehicles,  especially, [[automobile]]s, [[ship]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[spacecraft]]. In many cases these functions can be performed by trained humans. However, because of the speed of, for example, a rocket's dynamics, human reaction time is too slow to control this movement. Therefore, systems—now almost exclusively digital electronic—are used for such control. Even in cases where humans can perform these functions, it is often the case that GNC systems provide benefits such as alleviating operator work load, smoothing turbulence, fuel savings, etc.  In addition, sophisticated applications of GNC enable [[Autonomous robot|automatic]] or [[Telerobotics|remote]] control.

* ''Guidance'' refers to the determination of the desired path of travel (the "[[trajectory]]") from the vehicle's current location to a designated target, as well as desired changes in velocity, rotation and acceleration for following that path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Heritage Western Cape''' ('''HWC''') is a [[provincial heritage resources authority]] established by the Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sport of the government of the [[Western Cape]] province in South Africa. It is a public entity set up under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It is mandated to care for that part of South Africa's national estate that is of provincial and local significance in the [[Western Cape]]. It may delegate responsibility for heritage resources of local significance to competent municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;Section26(1)(g), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage Western Cape is best known as the custodian of approximately 2,500 [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage site]]s, but is also responsible for administration of other forms of protection of heritage established under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.

== History ==
[[File:WLM Launch 099.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Exit gate of the [[Castle of Good Hope]] provincial heritage site, [[Cape Town]]. The first site in South Africa to be formally protected by heritage law&lt;ref&gt;p.2, Oberholster JJ, The Historical Monuments of South Africa, Cape Town: The Rembrandt van Rijn Foundation, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Heritage Western Cape is the successor body to the former [[National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)|National Monuments Council]] in the [[Western Cape]]. Under the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]], cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 4, Part A, Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act. 108 of 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of the former National Monuments Council were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act.

Whilst provinces may pass their own heritage conservation legislation, the Government of the Western Cape chose to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act which allow it to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA). Heritage Western Cape was hence established by regulation on 25 October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Province of the Western Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No. 5937, Cape Town: 25 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 a Council was appointed by the province’s Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport and has since met on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref name=Meetings2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Western Cape Meetings 2013|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/other/2012/10/heritage_western_cape_meetings_2013_(2).pdf|publisher=Western Cape Government|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council has established a number of sub-committees which meet regularly to carry out the legal responsibilities of the organisation.  For the most part this concerns the processing of almost 3 300 applications per annum for work on sites protected under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Annual Report 2013/14, Cape Town, Heritage Western Cape, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage Western Cape inherited responsibility for approximately 2,500 former national monuments, now known as "[[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]]".&lt;ref&gt;Section 58(11)(a), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The National Heritage Resources Act provides for a greater variety of protection than did its predecessor and the organisation has continued to institute protections of various forms under its terms.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Chapter II, Parts 1 &amp; 2 of the National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999 with Section 10 of the National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969 as amended to 1979&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this work is dedicated to transforming the heritage landscape of the [[Western Cape]] to ensure that the heritage of all its people enjoys equal recognition and appropriate protection.&lt;ref&gt;See: Vision and Mission, p3, Annual Report 2012/13, Cape Town, Heritage Western Cape, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The logo of the organisation was launched by the provincial Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport on 13 May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Western Cape Logo|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/other/2006/5/hwc_logo.pdf|publisher=Western Cape Government|date=May 2006|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAHRA and HWC's mandate ==
Heritage Western Cape is subject to a biennial assessment of competency by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] (SAHRA) in terms of which it is determined which aspects of the National Heritage Resources Act it is qualified to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8(6), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assessed as competent to deal with all areas over which a provincial heritage resources authority is permitted to act, aside from Section 36 of the Act which covers certain aspects relating to graves and burials.

To clarify areas of uncertainty regarding mandate, representatives of Heritage Western Cape meet quarterly with SAHRA. Following a court case that created uncertainty regarding responsibility for sites that have been recognised as Grade I by SAHRA, but which have not yet been declared as national heritage sites, a memorandum of understanding has been concluded which allows Heritage Western Cape to deal with all such matters unless they concern archaeological sites and graves protected under Sections 35 and 36 of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;High Court of South Africa – Cape of Good Hope Division, Waenhuiskrans Arniston Ratepayers Association and Heritage Western Cape vs. Verrewiede Eiendomsontwikkeling (Edms) Bpk and the Cape Agulhas Municipality, Case No. 1926/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum of Agreement Concluded by and Between The South African Heritage Resources Agency and Heritage Western Cape, 25 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage Western Cape: Policy on Committees of Council, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of office of the present Council and its sub-committees expire on 31 October 2019.

There are five standing sub-committees which oversee aspects of the day-to-day business of the organisation. They are made up of specialists who are recognised for their expertise and experience in the areas of business of the committees on which they serve.&lt;ref name=Meetings2013/&gt;

=== Built Environment and Landscapes Committee (BELCOM) ===
[[File:Old Slave Lodge, Adderley Street, Cape Town.JPG|right|275px|thumb| [[Slave Lodge, Cape Town|Old Slave Lodge]] provincial heritage site, Adderley Street, [[Cape Town]]]]
Established in 2003, it considers permit applications relating to structures and landscapes that are provincial heritage sites, provisionally protected, on the register of heritage resources, public monuments or memorials, or older than 60 years.  Applications to work on such sites are assessed by the committee to consider whether or not they should be approved. The committee meets monthly.

=== Archaeological, Palaeontological and Meteorites Permit Committee (APM) ===
Applications to work on archaeological and palaeontological sites and meteorite permit applications in the province are considered by the APM Committee. It also considers applications concerning provincial heritage sites, provisionally protected sites and sites on the register of heritage resources that have been protected for their archaeological or palaeontological value.  The Committee also advises the IACom regarding impact assessments on archaeological, palaeontological and meteorite resources. The committee meets monthly.

=== Impact Assessment Committee (IACom) ===
[[File:West Coast Fossil Park.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Fossilised whale bones, [[West Coast Fossil Park]] provincial heritage site, [[Langebaan]]]]
Established in 2010 it is responsible for considering impact assessments that are submitted to Heritage Western Cape under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act, the National Environment Management Act, or The Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act. The committee meets monthly.

=== Appeals Committee ===
Established in 2003 this Committee deals with appeals made against decisions taken by the committees and staff of Heritage Western Cape. The committee meets monthly.  (There is a further right of appeal to a tribunal established by the provincial Minister for Cultural Affairs and Sport.)&lt;ref&gt;Section 49(2), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inventories, Gradings and Interpretations Committee (IGIC) ===
This committee was established in 2012 via amalgamation of three sub-committees.  It considers and makes recommendations to the Council on grading of heritage resources;  adoption of inventories of heritage resources submitted to Heritage Western Cape by municipalities and conservation bodies; formal protection of sites as provincial heritage sites or placement on the 'register' and texts for the interpretation of heritage sites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The committee meets quarterly.

== Provincial heritage sites ==
[[File:Lanzerac.jpg|right|320px|thumb|Lanzerac provincial heritage site, [[Stellenbosch]]]]
There are approximately 2,500 [[List of heritage sites in Western Cape|provincial heritage sites in the Western Cape]]. Most of these were declared under legislation that predates the National Heritage Resources Act. Known as "[[National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)|national monuments]]" from 1969–2000 and "[[Historical Monuments Commission|historical monuments]]" from 1934–1969,&lt;ref&gt;Section 10, National Monuments Act, Act 28 of 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act 4 of 1934 Natural and Historical Monuments, Relics and Antiques Act, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; these sites are in the process of being graded in terms of the grading system prescribed by the Act and which determines whether they remain provincial heritage sites, are included in the register of heritage resources or no longer enjoy formal protection.&lt;ref&gt;For progress with grading of former national monuemnts in the Western Cape Province see the minutes of meetingso of the Council and Executive Committee of HWC on the organisation's website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Input Shaping''' is an open-loop control technique for reducing vibrations in computer-controlled machines. The method works by creating a command signal that cancels its own vibration. That is, vibration excited by previous parts of the command signal is cancelled by vibration excited by latter parts of the command. Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, known as an input shaper, with any arbitrary command. The shaped command that results from the [[Convolution (computer science)|convolution]] is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the shaped command will excite less residual vibration than the unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and [[damping ratio]]s. Shaping can be made very [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] to errors in the system parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flexible Robot Dynamics and Controls|author1=Rush D.

[[File:Houghton MS Hyde 60 (4) - William Henry Ireland - Copy.jpg|thumb|A forgery of Shakespeare's signature by Ireland, circa 1795]]
The '''Ireland Shakespeare forgeries''' were a [[cause célèbre]] in 1790s London, when author and engraver [[Samuel Ireland]] announced the discovery of a treasure-trove of [[Shakespeare]]an manuscripts by his son [[William Henry Ireland]]. Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown.

Upon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as [[James Boswell]] (biographer of [[Samuel Johnson]]) and poet-laureate [[Henry James Pye]] pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with [[John Philip Kemble]] in the starring rôle. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. [[Edmond Malone]], widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud.

==Background==
Although Shakespeare's works were readily available in versions both for the learned and for the general public, no satisfactory biography could be constructed.  In spite of an intense search by would-be Shakespeare biographers from [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] to [[Edmond Malone]], only scraps and legends turned up.  There was an intense hope and expectation that some documents would surface to fill the gap.

Samuel Ireland was an eager collector of antique relics—his collection included a piece of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s cloak, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s leather jacket, and [[Joseph Addison]]'s fruit knife&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier, ''The Great Shakespeare Hoax'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as a Shakespeare enthusiast. While gathering material for a forthcoming book, ''Picturesque Tours of the Upper, or Warwickshire Avon'', he passed through [[Stratford on Avon]], Shakespeare's birthplace, by then already capitalising on this claim to fame, and made inquiries about the life of the dramatist. Although he had the satisfaction of being the first to introduce Shakespeare's crabtree and [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]'s cottage to the general public, Shakespeare documents eluded him.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[William Henry Ireland]] had a fascination with forgery. He was heavily influenced by the novel ''[[Love and Madness]]'' by [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]] which contained lengthy passages on the forger [[Thomas Chatterton]]. William witnessed his father's frustration first-hand. One moment, in particular, struck him forcibly. Knowing that the furniture and papers from [[New Place]], Shakespeare's last residence, had been moved to Clopton house when New Place was demolished, Samuel Ireland reasoned that Shakespearean manuscripts might well be found there.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ireland, ''Picturesque Views on the Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon'' (London 1796), p. 204; William Henry says that old residents told them papers had been moved there at the time of the Stratford fire.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon visiting however, he was informed by the current tenant that all the old papers—many of them Shakespeare's—had recently been burned. Samuel Ireland's distress at this news made a strong impression on the young man—even though it later turned out that this story was a nothing more than a joke at Ireland's expense.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland related this story in the ''Authentic Account'' (pp. 5–6), the ''Confessions'' (pp. 30–33), and the unpublished ''Full and Explanatory Account'' (according to Schoenbaum, p. 192). Edmond Malone investigated the incident, writing to the owner about the propriety of a tenant destroying his landlord's papers; the tenant denied the incident and admitted it was a practical joke. Mair, pp. 19–20, and Schoenbaum, p. 193, have brief accounts of the subsequent investigation of the incident.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the younger Ireland's confessions, it was to please his father that he embarked on the career of literary forgery that would ultimately ruin them both.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First documents==
From a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor [[John Heminges]] on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other.  The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, p. 197; in his published accounts William Henry Ireland claims to have used the Johnson-Steevens edition, but the Blackfriars mortgage deed he used as a basis for the forgery did not appear there, and was first printed in Malone's edition. In his unpublished accounts he admitted to using Malone's edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Mair, pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked where he had turned up this deed, William Henry replied that he had found it in an old trunk belonging to a chance acquaintance who did not wish to have his name revealed.  Mr. H., as he called him, had freely given him this deed.  The young discoverer suggested that there might well be more documents where this had come from,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kahan, p. 57, based on Samuel Ireland's unpublished records; William Henry later revised this in his ''Confessions'' (p. 55) to claim that he never would have continued had not others suggested to him to possibility of finding more documents.&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly followed this up with a promissory note from Shakespeare to Heminges—the only such note (had it been genuine) ever discovered from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier; ''The Great Shakespeare Forgery'', pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further forgeries==
With his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art.&lt;ref&gt;Mair, ''The Fourth Forger'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned—apparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research—that [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]] had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Confessions'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; "Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye," he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation.  "[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes." The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: “…as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton”.&lt;ref&gt;Text from Samuel Ireland, ''Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakspeare'', 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare’s was a “Copye” of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl’s penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton’s reply with his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', pp. 78–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H’s ostensibly-miraculous chest. Shakespeare’s “Profession of Faith” proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor [[Richard Cowley]] showed he was "a perfect good natured man",&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a "whysycalle conceyte", it was (as Malone put it) "most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death…."&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Malone, ''An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Papers and Instruments Attributed to Shakespeare'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|"Anna Hatherrewaye"]], and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of ''[[King Lear]]'' Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of "''[[Hamlet|Hamblette]]''", and two previously unknown plays, ''[[Vortigern and Rowena]]'' and ''Henry II''.

==Artifacts on display==
From the moment of discovery Samuel Ireland invited friends in to see his new possessions. On 20 December 1794 [[Frederick Morton Eden|Sir Frederick Eden]] came to examine the seal on the Fraser lease. He announced that it represented a [[quintain (jousting)|quintain]], a device used in lance practice, and the conclusion was that Shakespeare had used it as a play on his own name.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1795 however he issued a general invitation to literary men to come to his house and examine them. The exhibition was a roaring success. [[Samuel Parr]] and [[Joseph Warton]] on hearing Samuel Ireland read the "Profession of Faith" proclaimed it superior to anything in the English liturgy. [[James Boswell]] got down on his knees to kiss the relics. Scottish antiquarian [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] and educator [[Richard Valpy]] visited frequently, and editor [[James Boaden]], author [[Sir Herbert Croft, 5th Baronet|Herbert Croft]], and poet-laureate [[Henry James Pye]] (among others) testified publicly to their belief in the authenticity of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

One hitch developed when an alert visitor noted that a document supposedly written by the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] was dated 1590, whereas the nobleman had died in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, ''Reforging Shakespeare'', p. 86; Samuel Schoenbaum, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; When Samuel Ireland confronted his son with this information, William Henry wanted to burn the document, but his father demurred. He suggested that the document might have been misdated at some later time, and the two agreed to tear off the date.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''A Full and Explanatory Account'', MS, cited in Schoenbaum, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The item was displayed, and subsequently printed, in this mutilated form. At least two scholars, antiquary [[Joseph Ritson]]&lt;ref&gt;Ritson to Paton, 21 July 1795 in ''The Letters of Joseph Ritson'', volume 2, pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and classicist [[Richard Porson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grebanier, ''The Great Shakespeare Forgery'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; correctly recognised the documents as forgeries, and editor [[Henry Bate Dudley]] started lampooning the papers as early as 17 February 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Grebanier, p. 127, Schoenbaum, p. 212; Mair, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Samuel Ireland did not invite the two greatest Shakespeare scholars of the day, Edmond Malone and [[George Steevens]], to examine the manuscripts, suspicion was aroused.  As one writer noted "The publick would certainly have been gratified to know, that these extraordinary MSS. had been deemed genuine by Dr. Farmer, Messrs. Stevens or Malone; whose literary characters might have served as letters of credence."&lt;ref&gt;''Gentleman's Magazine'', March 1795, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Ireland later observed that he was "of a different sentiment with regard to the sanction, which his [Malone's] inspection would afford them."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Ireland, ''An Investigation of Mr. Malone's Claim to the Character of Scholar, or Critic'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He did however attempt to get [[Richard Farmer]] to look at the papers without success.&lt;ref&gt;Grebanier, pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, which roused much public excitement, continued for more than a year.  On 17 November Ireland and his son carried the papers to St. James's Palace, where the Duke of Clarence and Mrs. Jordan examined them, and on 30 December Ireland submitted them to the Prince of Wales at Carlton House.&lt;ref&gt;DNB.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vortigern and Rowena''==
{{main|Vortigern and Rowena}}

As early as 26 December 1794 William Henry had announced the existence of Shakespeare's unknown play ''Vortigern and Rowena'', but it was not until March that he was able to present his father with the manuscript. It came with Shakespeare's correspondence with a printer purporting to explain why the play was unpublished.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, pp. 62–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] of [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] and [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]] of [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] expressed an interest in producing the play. Sheridan was the winner in this competition. Prompted by fears that a descendant of Shakespeare might surface to claim the rights to his productions, William Henry produced a deed to prove that one of his ancestors, coincidentally named William Henry Ireland, had saved Shakespeare from drowning, and that Shakespeare had rewarded him with all the newly discovered manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Ireland, ''Authentic Account''. pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of the MSS==
Samuel Ireland announced the publication of the papers on 4 March 1795, and the volume itself appeared in December of that year. William Henry had bitterly opposed this move, but his father was determined. Included were such items as the "Profession of Faith," the letter from Queen Elizabeth, and the manuscript of ''King Lear''. ''Henry II'', ''Vortigern'', and the marginalia were excluded from this volume.

Shortly after the appearance of the book Samuel Ireland's neighbour, [[Albany Wallis]], who had discovered one of the few authentic signatures of Shakespeare, came up with a new and startling discovery. He had turned up a genuine John Heminges signature, and of course it looked nothing like the signatures William Henry had produced. When the forger learned of this problem, however, he soon produced Heminges signatures that resembled the authentic one. It seems, William Henry explained, that there were ''two'' actors named John Heminges active at the time—hence the dissimilar signatures.

==Controversy==
The volume was not well received. The first reply was James Boaden's ''A Letter to George Steevens'' (16 January 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Eu. Hood, "Fly-Leaves, No. XXXI: Pseudo-Shakspeare," in ''Gentleman's Magazine'', May 1826, p.421.&lt;/ref&gt; Boaden concentrated on the manuscript of ''Lear'', observing that if this is Shakespeare's original, and the printed versions contaminated with alterations by the actors, then the players are "at once converted ... into the most elaborate and polished masters of versification, and Shakspeare into a writer without the necessary ear for rhythm—a man who produced a series of harmonious versification by chance, and lost the supreme ascendancy in his art, from the not being able to number ten syllables upon his fingers." He also took aim at the spelling.&lt;ref&gt;James Boaden, ''A Letter to George Steevens'', pp. 7, 21; summary in Grebanier, pp. 185–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Ireland's friends and supporters raced in with replies. Colonel [[Francis Webb (colonel)|Francis Webb]], writing under the name "Philalethes," argued that as the paper was old the documents must have belonged to Shakespeare's time; there would have been no reason to forge them then; therefore they must be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Summary in Grebanier, p. 189ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Wyatt took potshots at Boaden by contrasting his views as a believer with those after his conversion. [[Walley Chamberlain Oulton]] maintained that the papers were so voluminous that forgery was out of the question. He expressed a hope that ''Vortigern'' would turn out to be genuine, as it might well revitalise contemporary drama. He looked to the judgment of the audience for the play's vindication.

==Exposure==
Two crushing blows came quickly. The first was the publication of Malone's volume of over four hundred pages on 31 March 1796. Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies—not least of which was the reference to the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] before that playhouse had been built—exposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (''upset'', for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments'', ''passim''. For the general objection to the spelling of the papers, see p. 33. For the anachronistic reference to the Globe see pp. 184–8. For Queen Elizabeth's handwriting see pp. 103–116. For the word ''upset'' see pp. 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vortigern's'' failure==
The second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of ''Vortigern'' at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Farington, diary entry for 2 April 1796, in ''the Farington Diary'' (London 1922–28), p. 145; [[James Anson Farrer]], ''Literary Forgeries'' (London, 1907), pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a "Malone faction," for the failure of his play.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', pp. 156–159.&lt;/ref&gt; Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.&lt;ref&gt;Farington, ''op. cit.''; William P. Marsh, ''Clubs of London'' (London, 1828), volume 2, pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vortigern's'' opening night was also its final performance.

==Aftermath==
For the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster. Samuel Ireland still believed the papers to be Shakespeare's, and refused to listen to anything his son had to say. William Henry confessed the forgery to his sisters, to his mother, and to Albany Wallis, but his father did not believe his story. The public, not surprisingly, accused Samuel Ireland of the fraud. Sales of his books suffered.&lt;ref&gt;DNB p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of [[Thomas Caldecott (barrister)|Thomas Caldecott]] he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 35; Samuel Ireland, ''Investigation''; see especially 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, p. 422. William Henry Ireland says in the opening statement to the ''Authentic Account'' that his motive is "to remove the odium under which my father labours".&lt;/ref&gt; This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting in concert on the present occasion.&lt;ref&gt;George Steevens to Bishop Percy, 26 December 1796, in John Bowyers Nichols, ''Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century'' (London, 1848), volume 7, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The charge would stick. George Chalmers' ''Apology for the Believers'' and Samuel Ireland's ''Investigation'' concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.&lt;ref&gt;DNB, p. 35. The Nixon print, "The Oaken Chest, or, The Gold Mines of Ireland a Farce is available at the [http://www.folger.edu/html/exhibitions/fakes_forgeries/FFFireland.asp Folger Library web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samuel Ireland's culpability==
The culpability of Samuel Ireland remained a controversial topic for years to come. Although his son's ''Confessions'' (1805) did a great deal to establish his innocence, not everybody was convinced. Accounts by [[Clement Mansfield Ingleby]] in 1859 and George Dawson in 1888 took the position that the father was responsible for the forgeries and the son's ''Confession'' was a tissue of lies. The acquisition of Samuel Ireland's papers by the British Museum in 1876, however, provided a wealth of evidence that Samuel was the victim rather than the perpetrator of the fraud, and Ingleby changed his position in his 1881 paper on the Ireland Affair.&lt;ref&gt;"The Literary Career of a Shakespeare Forger" in volume 2 of ''Shakespeare: the Man and the Book.'' This issue is covered on pp. 156–163. See also Farrer, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Samuel Ireland's death in 1800, the original forgeries, bound in three folio volumes, were sold to [[John Dent (died 1826)|John "Dog" Dent]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and bibliophile. The collections passed through several hands before being acquired by [[Mary Eccles, Viscountess Eccles|Mary Morley Crapo Hyde]] (1912—2003) and her first husband, Donald Hyde (1909—1966). She left the volumes to [[Harvard]]'s [[Houghton Library]] after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Arthur. "The Actual Originals" in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' 5716 (19 October 2012), pp. 14—15.&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[Peter Ackroyd]] provides an imaginative account of the Ireland's forgeries in his novel ''The Lambs of London'' published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ackroyd (2004) ''The Lambs of London'', 228 pages. Chatto &amp; Windus London, {{ISBN|0-7011-7744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast [[Martyn Wade]]'s play about the forgeries, ''Another Shakespeare''.&lt;ref&gt;Repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra, 18/19 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karelian hot pot''' (British)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/29/H0292900.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126050117/http://www.bartleby.com/61/29/H0292900.html |date=November 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Karelian stew''' (US)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Ferretti |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE3D71531F930A3575BC0A960948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Fare Of The Country - Finnish Stew Of Meaty Riches - Nytimes.Com |location=Finland |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1986-08-03 |accessdate=2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''karjalanpaisti'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is a traditional meat [[stew]] originating from the region of [[Karelia]]. It is commonly prepared using a combination of [[pork]] and [[beef]], but [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] can also be used. Along with the [[Karelian pasties]] (''karjalanpiirakat''), it is the most widely recognised Karelian food in Finland. In 2007, it was selected as the national dish of Finland by the readers of the Finnish tabloid Iltalehti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haapio|first1=Markku|title=Se on karjalanpaisti!|trans-title=It is karjalanpaisti!|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200712066931619_uu.shtml|website=iltalehti.fi|publisher=Iltalehti|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=fi|date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar poll organized by the ELO Foundation for the Promotion of Finnish Food Culture in cooperation with the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners MTK and the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in autumn 2016, Karelian hot pot took second place, losing to [[rye bread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The people have spoken - rye bread is the national food|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/the_people_have_spoken_-_rye_bread_is_the_national_food/9413195|website=yle.fi|publisher=Yle|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hot pot is usually seasoned with [[black pepper]]corns and [[salt]]. Other seasonings such as [[allspice]] and [[bay leaf]] may be used too. Common vegetables such as [[carrot]], [[onion]], and [[root vegetable]]s are acceptable additions to the stew.

Like most other Karelian foods, the Karelian hot pot is traditionally braised (cooked in a pot (''uuniruukku'' or ''potti'' in Finnish) placed inside an oven). In Karelia, it is usually referred to as merely 'oven stew' (''uunipaisti''). The term Karelian hot pot can be used to refer to nearly any food that contains meat and that is prepared in this traditional Karelian fashion.

Due to the scarceness of meat in the past, the hot pot was traditionally only prepared for festive occasions. As meat became more readily available during the 20th century, the dish became a common, everyday food throughout Finland.

The [[portmanteau]] coinages '''kidult''',&lt;ref name=ki&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/kidult "Kidult"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; '''rejuvenile''',&lt;ref name=reju&gt;[[Christopher Noxon]], ''[[Rejuvenile: Kickball, Cartoons, Cupcakes, and the Reinvention of the American Grown-up]]'', 2006, ([http://www.rejuvenile.com/index.php/pages/the_book online book preview])&lt;/ref&gt; '''adultescent'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adultescent "Adultescent"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;  refer to [[adult]]s with interests traditionally seen as suitable for [[child]]ren.

It can also have other meanings, such as a parent who enjoys being a parent due to spending quality time with their children, but is not willing to accept their more authoritarian role/responsibilities as parent.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} An example is [[Robin Williams]]' character in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', a father who has fun with his children but is a poor disciplinarian and is seen by his wife as an irresponsible head of the household.

In the past, [[psychology]] recognized the concept of ''[[puer aeternus]]'', or "eternal boy".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Today, often called "[[Puer aeternus#Peter_Pan_syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]]", it means a person remaining emotionally at that of a teenager or even a child. It is derived from the traditional archetypal "eternal boy", [[Peter Pan]].

One of the most well-known and extreme cases of Peter Pan syndrome and the kidult mentality is [[Michael Jackson]]. Michael explicitly stated that he did not want to grow up and he owned an impressive collection of arcade video games, toy cars and fantasy and sci-fi memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fameable.com/kidults-market/2228/ "Kidults, the adultescent market"], Fameable, February 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, there was reporting that for an adult to have interests traditionally expected only from children is not necessarily an anomaly.&lt;ref name=reju/&gt; The entertainment industry was quick to recognize the trend, and introduced a special category, "kidult", of things marketable for kids and adults alike.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/forty-year-old-virgins-94401 "Forty-Year-Old Virgins"], by Tony Dokoupil, December 15, 2007
*''Quote'': "So what's driving this rejuvenile movement? Marketing, mostly."&lt;/ref&gt; Enormous successes of films such as ''[[Shrek]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,638109,00.html "Are you a Kidult?"], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of books traditionally targeted for teenagers&lt;ref name=said&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3588398/The-grown-up-world-of-kidult-books.html "The grown-up world of kidult books"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]],'' 11 January 2003 
*''Quote'': "[[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy became the first children's book ever to win an adult fiction prize (the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread]])"&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that [[Disneyland]] is among the world's top adult (without kids) vacation destinations&lt;ref name=ki/&gt; seem to indicate that "kidulthood" is a rather mainstream phenomenon. And unlike ''puer aeternus'', "rejuveniles" successfully marry adult responsibilities with non-adult interests.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt; When [[Christopher Noxon]] appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on June 29, 2006, he remarked that "There's a big difference between childish and childlike".

Karen Brooks explores what she calls the "[[commodification]] of youth": entertainers sell "the teen spirit" to adults who in the past were called "young at heart".&lt;ref&gt;Karen Brooks, "Nothing Sells Like Teen Spirit: the Commodification of Youth Culture" in: ''Youth Cultures: Texts, Images, and Identities,'' 2003, {{ISBN|027597409X}}, pp. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, the buzzword "kideolteu" was used in 2015, highlighting the market trend of increasing toy sales (such as drones and "electric wheels") to kidults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://besuccess.com/2015/11/drone-electricwheel/|title = 연말 유통 트랜드 분석, ‘드론, 전동휠’ 아웃도어 키덜트 제품 인기|date = 2015-11-30|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = be|first = success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' provides the following synopsis: "Set in 2050, Kong becomes a wanted fugitive after wrecking {{sic}} havoc at Alcatraz Island’s Natural History and Marine Preserve. What most humans on the hunt for the formidable animal don’t realize, though, is that Kong was framed by an evil genius who plans to terrorize the world with an army of enormous robotic dinosaurs. As the only beast strong enough to save humanity from the mechanical dinos, Kong must rely on the help of three kids who know the truth about him."&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/01/netflix-kong-king-of-the-apes/?hootPostID=7ae72b916a37f8d1ca250676ec40553c Netflix sets plans for animated series 'Kong - King of the Apes']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* '''Lukas Remy''' (voiced by [[Alessandro Juliani]], later by [[Giles Panton]]): A wildlife enthusiast, Lukas is the son of Doctor Leo Remy and twin brother of Richard. He loves and cares about animals, and has the closest bond to Kong. He opposes his brother's wicked schemes with the help of Kong and their friends.
* '''[[King Kong|Kong]]''' (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]): As a baby, Kong was captured by poachers but broke free and wound up befriending Lukas when he was young. Some time later when he was bigger, Kong saved Richard from a fire (from which Richard had to get a prosthetic eye) but Richard was not grateful and even tried to blame Kong for the fire. Kong is somewhat childlike (having the mentality of a three year old child) but has a strong bond with Lukas and the rest of the team. He became a fugitive of the law after being framed by Richard, and so works with Lukas to fight against Richard's evil plans.
* '''Doug "Jonesy" Jones''' (voiced by Viv Leacock): Jonesy is Lukas' best (human) friend and the team technical specialist. He has a questionable attraction to Botila.
* '''Amy Quon''' (voiced by [[Shannon Chan-Kent]]): Amy is a veterinarian and the older sister of Danny. She is of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent.
* '''Danny Quon''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]): Danny is an amateur animal-whisperer, able to speak with animals, and one of Kong's best friends. He is of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] descent.
* '''Anita''' (voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]): Anita is a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Spanish]] housekeeper for the Remy family and was the nanny of Lukas and Richard when they were children, and later Kong, loving them all like surrogate sons. Even after they've all grown up, she cares for them deeply. Including Richard, though it breaks Anita's heart that he has changed for the worst. Her grandniece is Franciska.
* '''Chatter''' (voiced by Alessandro Juliani, later Vincent Tong): Chatter is an aptly-named parrot a [[Scarlet Macaw]] owned by Anita, and is known as the world's first bionic bird after Leo Remy "saved" his life by replacing his damaged wing with a bionic prosthetic wing.
* '''Franciska''' (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain): Franciska (nicknamed Panchi) is Anita's grandniece, and joined the team after they came to save her from a giant anaconda. She is very intelligent for her age and loves animals like Lukas does, and admires him to the point of wanting to work with animals and protect nature.

===Recurring characters===
* '''Doctor Leo Remy''' (voiced by Lee Tockar): Doctor Leo Remy was the father of Lukas and Richard. He clearly favored Lukas, as he could never convince Richard to appreciate nature as Richard favored bionics. After a falling out the two of them became distanced both physically and emotionally. He developed a wildlife research center (partly to house Kong) but eventually passed away, leaving the research center (dubbed 'Kong Island' by fans) to his sons.
* '''Lucky Liger''': Lucky is a [[Liger]] cub and son of Lady. He lives with the team and is a beloved friend of Kong.
* '''Lady Liger''': Lady was the mother of Lucky until the internal injuries of a robot attack and extreme stress caused her to die. Richard cloned her into three bionic Ligers but they were rescued and sent to live in the wild to live peacefully. Although they are clones, they all share the same loving bond the original Lady had with Lucky.
* '''Commissioner Decker''' (voiced by Lee Tockar): The Police Commissioner, Decker leads his police forces in pursuing Kong, Lukas, and their friends, mistakenly believing them to be criminals (due to Richard framing them). After Richard's criminal activities are revealed, Decker apologizes to Kong and his friends.
* '''Zippi''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]): A baby dinosaur.
* '''Apex''' (voiced by [[Samuel Vincent]]): Leader of a clan of Apes.
* '''Mummo''' (voiced by Kathleen Barr): The Apes' resident cook, who becomes friends with fellow cook Anita.

===Antagonists===
* '''Doctor Richard Remy''' (voiced by Samuel Vincent): The evil twin brother of Lukas and son of Leo. Richard, since childhood, has always irrationally hated nature and Kong. He was also so obsessed with bionics that he would even turn himself into the world's first "bionoman". As a child, his reckless misuse of his father's laser equipment almost got him killed in an accidental fire. Luckily, Kong saved Richard's life. Unfortunately, his eye was damaged and had to be replaced with a bionic one. He tried to blame Kong for the fire in an attempt to banish Kong from his life. However, his ruse was seen through by everyone almost immediately. When they defend Kong for saving him, Richard expresses no gratitude to the ape for saving him, and when they refuse Richard's final demand to get rid of Kong he chooses to leave his father and brother to live with his mother in New Jersey. As an adult, Richard has turned out the polar opposite of his brother, especially in morality. After his father dies, Richard tries to take control over Kong Island. When Lukas gets in the way of Richard's bionic research, he frames Kong to turn public opinion against him, resulting in Kong and Lukas becoming fugitives. They work against Richard to stop his nefarious schemes. However, at the end of season one, he is exposed as a criminal, and ultimately betrayed by Botila.
* '''Botila''' (voiced by Kathleen Barr): Botila is a bionic gynoid and personal assistant of Richard. She behaves in a mostly robotic manner but after enduring Richard's abuse for long enough, she turns against him, although they soon come to an uneasy truce, and continue to conspire against Kong. In the season one finale, Botila ultimately betrays Richard, and takes over his Bionobots, declaring herself "Empress Botila" of the AI Liberation Front.
* '''Richie''': Formerly one of Richard's earlier creations, it later becomes a servant of Botila.
* '''Brag and Wheeler''': Two poachers that tried to hunt Kong as a baby.
* '''Bionobots''': The Bionobots are Richard's creations and serve as his personal army. Due to his love of dinosaurs, they are all designed after various species of dinos. After Botila's betrayal, they become part of her AI Liberation Front.
** Bionobotic [[Tyrannosaurus]]
** Bionobotic [[Triceratops]]
** Bionobotic [[Pteranodons]]
** Bionobotic [[Giant Squid|Squid]]
** Bionobotic [[Megalodon]]
** Botila clones (voiced by Kathleen Barr): Three clones of Botila who serve as her servants. They later turn against Botila and ultimately help in stopping her and Richard.
** Bionobot Richard

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}
The music articles in the [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey Sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey Jr]] (1791–1851).The ''Cyclopædia'' was illustrated using 53 plates as well as a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

The general musical articles list all those that are not biographical, which form a separate list. They were written mostly by Charles Burney. Others on the scientific basis of music were by John Farey Sr, and technical descriptions of some musical instruments were given by his son.

It had been Burney's intention to write a ''Dictionary of Music'', but for various reasons he never did so.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, "Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music" ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–171, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 when he was aged 75 he was offered the chance of writing music articles in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', and this occupied him to around 1805 or '06. His fee was £1000. Burney's brief was to 'include definitions in all the languages of Europe where Music has been much cultivated, with its history, biography, Criticism and discussions'&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lonsdale, Roger, ''Dr Charles Burney: a Literary Biography'', OUP 1965, pp 412&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles contain an enormous amount of musical information, much of which being augmented versions of what he had already published in his earlier writings &lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer, Frank]], ed. Charles Burney, ''A General History of Music'', 2 vol. 1935, rep 1957 [Originally published in 4 volumes, 1776–1789]; and Scholes, P. A., ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'', 2 vol, OUP 1959, [France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773]; as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he took the opportunity to add new topics covering the years of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and much of the first decade of the nineteenth, in particular the London musical scene. In all he wrote 996 general articles. While the majority of the articles have some length, a good proportion are brief (3 or 4 lines or fewer), dictionary definitions, or cross references. Many of the former are terms derived from French and Italian. The encyclopaedic-length articles (as distinct from the dictionary-length articles) are usually longer than Burney's earlier published writings on the same topic.

Dr [[Percy Scholes]] cites a statement by Dr Rees from Preface to the ''Cyclopaedia'' that he had 'constantly interpolated his own additions to the articles of his specialists'. and quotes a passage from the article about Dance (Vol 11) describing 'in our own memory', Welsh church-goers being played out of church by a fiddle.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, P. A.,''The Puritans and Early Music in England and New England'', OUP, 1934, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, sr]] was by profession a geologist, but was greatly interested music.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Croy Kassler, ''The Science of Music in Britain, 1714–1830'', Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London, 1979, vol 1, pp 329–343&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved with the Choral Fund,&lt;ref&gt;Established in 1791 by [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] to assist poor musicians. Farey was the first Secretary and Librarian.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cecilian Society&lt;ref&gt;A group founded in 1785 which sang mainly oratorios. The newspapers of the period carried frequent advertisements of their performances.&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Surrey Chapel|Surrey Chapel Society]], and also sang in oratorios in Drury Lane Theatre. He was particularly interested in the [[mathematics of music]] and [[musical temperament|temperament]], and wrote all the 215 scientific articles on these topics for Rees. Farey's investigations of [[musical temperament|temperament]] involved discussing (and criticising) the various schemes in use then. He described them in a series of letters to the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and the ''[[Monthly Magazine]]'' as well as the ''[[American Journal of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Kassler, above for details of these.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed 25 articles to the ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'' on this topic .&lt;ref&gt;For a list of the latter see the bibliography appended to Trever D. Ford and [[Hugh S. Torrens]] introduction ('John Farey (1766–1826) an unrecognised polymath') to the 1989 reprinting of the first volume of John Farey's ''General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Farey, jr]] was a prolific contributor to Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'', not only as a writer but also as an artist of many of the plates.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49–68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=7 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the four articles he wrote, he drew plates for two illustrating [[John Isaac Hawkins]]'s ''Finger-keyed Viol'', and two different patterns of pipe organ. The plates were keyed to the texts of the articles, and for this reason it was necessary for Farey to have produced both, since writing the texts describing the plates would have required technical knowledge which Burney would not have possessed.

'''Alphabetisation of articles:'''&lt;br&gt;
The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''Annotations:'''&lt;br&gt;
The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's travels, ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''.

The '''Long Night of Museums''' (or the '''Night of Museums''') is a [[cultural festival|cultural event]] in which museums and cultural institutions in an area cooperate to remain open late into the night to introduce themselves to new potential patrons.  Visitors are given a common entrance pass which grants them access to all exhibits as well as complimentary public transportation within the area.

The first Long Night of Museums ({{lang-de|'''Lange Nacht der Museen'''}}) took place in [[Berlin]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="berlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lange-nacht-der-museen.de |title=Lange Nacht der Museen in Berlin |publisher=Lange-nacht-der-museen.de |date= |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been very well received, and since then the number of participating institutions and exhibitions has risen dramatically, spreading to over 120 other cities throughout [[Europe]], as well as elsewhere, in [[Argentina]] and the [[Philippines]].

==History==
The current all-night festivals trace their roots to several cities.

The first Long Night of Museums took place in the newly re-united [[Berlin]] in 1997 with a dozen participating institutions and exhibitions; since then the number has risen to 125 with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.

It drew on a European heritage of all-night cultural events, such as the annual [[White Nights Festival]], a long-standing cultural festival in [[St Petersburg]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[Mayor of Paris]] [[Bertrand Delanoë]] took this idea in 2002 and spread it to culture more broadly, including [[performing arts]], and under the banner of ''[[Nuit Blanche]]'' (White Nights, and various related names) the concept has spread around the world.

'''Lukho''' is a traditional [[mancala]] game, played by the [[Bukusu people|Bukusu]] people living by the [[Elgon]] mountain, in [[Kenya]]. Only older men can play it.

==Rules==
Lukho is played on a 2x8 mancala board (i.e., 2 rows of 8 pits each), with 48 seeds.

A peculiarity of Lukho is the game setup. In the beginning, 3 seeds are placed in each pit. Then, players can remove as many seeds as they want from their own pits. After that, both players drop, at the same time, any number of the seeds they have removed from their own pits into a single opponent's pit. Still at the same time, they then [[Mancala#General gameplay|sow]] those seeds following the same rules described below for subsequent sowings (captures included). Note that since players move concurrently, the outcome of this startup phase is quite unpredictable. The first player to complete his sowing will be the first one to play in the remainder of the game.

Another peculiar element of Lukho is that, once the opening move described above is done, all of the subsequent moves are set. In other words, the outcome of the game is decided by that single opening move described above. At his turn, the player must take all the seeds from the leftmost non-empty pit of his row, and relay-sow them counterclockwise. If the last seed is dropped in an empty pit of the player's row, and the opponent's opposite pit is non empty, then the seeds in that pit are captured, together with the capturing seed. If there is a continuous line of non empty pits after the one that has been captured, all the pits in that line are also captured.

There's one more rule that is similar to that of "bulls" in [[Maasai people|Maasai]]'s [[Enkeshui]], and that is the only rule that does not apply in the first move of the game. If the last seed of a sowing is dropped in a pit that contains exactly one seed, the turn is over and that pit becomes a "knife" belonging to the player who just moved. Seeds that are in a knife cannot be moved, and at end game they will be automatically captured by the player who owns the knife.

When one of the players cannot move any more, the game is over. The player who captured most seeds wins the game.

Usually, players will play several games (usually twelve, or [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]]s of twelve). Each game brings a score that is calculated as follows:

* the winner gets 2 points if none of the following applies;
* if the loser did not capture ''any'' seed, the winner gets 4 points;
* if the winner wins with the minimum gap, i.e., 2 seeds, he gets 4 points. This win is called a "bull" and the winning player will often moo to the opponent's scorn;
* if the winner makes a bull at the very first game, he gets 12 points.

'''Mexican muralism''' was the promotion of [[mural]] painting starting in the 1920s, generally with social and political messages as part of efforts to reunify the country under the post [[Mexican Revolution]] government. It was headed by “the big three” painters, [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. From the 1920s to about 1970s a large number of murals with nationalistic, social and political messages were created on public buildings, starting a tradition which continues to this day in [[Mexico]] and has had impact in other parts of the Americas, including the [[United States]] where it served as inspiration for the [[Chicano art movement]].

==Antecedents==
[[File:Bonampak mural. Room 1. Musicians and dancers.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Mural from [[Bonampak]].]]

[[Mexico]] has had a tradition of painting murals, starting with the [[Olmec]] civilization in the pre Hispanic period and into the colonial period, with murals mostly painted to evangelize and reinforce Christian doctrine.&lt;ref name="chicano"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=PhD |chapter= |title=The Chicano Mural movement of the Southwest: Populist public art and Chicano political activism |author= John Eugene Kenny |year=2006 |publisher= University of New Orleans |oclc=3253092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern tradition has its roots in the 19th century, with this use of political and social themes. The first Mexican mural painter to use philosophical themes in his work was [[Juan Cordero]] in the mid 19th century. Although he did mostly work with religious themes such as the cupola of the [[Santa Teresa la Antigua|Santa Teresa Church]] and other churches, he painted a secular mural at the request of [[Gabino Barreda]] at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (since disappeared).&lt;ref name="plasmo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Plasmó Juan Cordero primer mural en México con temas filosóficos |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=May 27, 2008&lt;!--|918-917-9042--&gt;  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Juan Cordero plastered the first mural with philosophical themes in Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:José Guadalupe Posada, Calavera oaxaqueña, broadsheet, 1903.jpg|thumb|1903 broadsheet by [[José Guadalupe Posada]].]]

The latter 19th century was dominated politically by the [[Porfirio Díaz]] regime. This government was the first to push for the cultural development of the country, supporting the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and sending promising artists abroad to study. However, this effort left out indigenous culture and people, with the aim of making [[Mexico]] like [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; [[Dr. Atl|Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl]], is considered to be the first modern Mexican muralists with the idea that Mexican art should reflect Mexican life.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbcounty.gov/museum/media/press-kit/contretas/contreras-media-kit-mural-tradition.pdf |title= The art of Ramón Contreras and the Mexican Muralists movement |publisher= San Bernardino County Museum  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academy training and the government had only promoted imitations of European art.  Atl and other early muralists pressured the Diaz government to allow them to paint on building walls to escape this formalism.&lt;ref name="inehrm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |title=El muralismo y la Revolución Mexicana |author=) Luz Elena Mainero del Castillo |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México |location=Mexico |year=2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Muralism asn the Mexican Revolution |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514210135/http://www.inehrm.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=exp-muralismo-en-la-revolucion-articulo |archivedate=May 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atl also organized an independent exhibition of native Mexican artists promoting many indigenous and national themes along with color schemes that would later appear in mural painting.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253341 |title= Populist art and the Mexican mural renaissance |work= Hispanic Heritage in the Americas -Latin American art |publisher= Britannica  |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Mexican mural, painted by Atl, was a series of female nudes using “Atlcolor” a substance Atl invented himself, very shortly before the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name="dratl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title=Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art  |last1=Burton |first1=Tony |date=March 14, 2008 |issn=1028-9089 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on the young artists of the late Porfirian period was the graphic work of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], who mocked European styles and created cartoons with social and political criticism.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

The [[Mexican Revolution]] itself was the culmination of political and social opposition to [[Porfirio Díaz]] policies. One important oppositional group was a small intellectual community that included [[Antonio Curo]], [[Alfonso Reyes]] and [[José Vasconcelos]]. They promoted a populist philosophy that coincided with the social and political criticism of Atl and Posada and influenced the next generation of painters such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros |title= Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros.  |first=Rita |last=Pomade |date= May 5, 2007  |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas gained power as a result of the [[Mexican Revolution]], which overthrew the Díaz regime in less than a year.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, there was nearly a decade of fighting among the various factions vying for power. Governments changed frequently with a number of assassinations, including that of [[Francisco I. Madero]] who initiated the struggle. It ended in the early 1920s with one-party rule in the hands of the [[Álvaro Obregón]] faction, which became the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]] (PRI).&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; During the Revolution, Atl supported the Carranza faction and promoted the work of Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros, who would later be the founders of the muralism movement. Through the war and until 1921, Atl continued to paint murals among other activities including teaching the Mexico’s next generation of artists and muralists.&lt;ref name="dratl"/&gt;

In 1921, after the end of the military phase of the Revolution, José Vasconcelos was appointed to head the [[Secretaría de Educación Pública]]. At the time, most of the Mexican population was illiterate and the government needed a way to promote the ideals of the Mexican Revolution. It was Vasconcelos’s idea have a government-backed mural program for this purpose.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Similar to mural use in the pre Hispanic period and during the colonial period, the purpose of these murals were not simply aesthetic, but social, to promote certain ideals.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; These ideals or principles were to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the identity of [[Mexico]] as a mestizo nation, with the indigenous promoted as well as the Spanish.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;  The government began to hire the country’s best artists to paint murals, calling some of them home from Europe including [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; These initial muralists included Dr. Atl, [[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], [[Federico Cantú]] and others but the main three would be [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. His time as secretary was short but it set how muralism would develop. His image was painted on a tempera mural in 1921 by [[Roberto Montenegro]], but this was short lived. His successor at the Secretaría de Educación Pública ordered it painted out.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The muralists differed in style and temperament, but all believed that art was for the education and betterment of the people. This was behind their acceptance of these commissions as well as their creation of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; 
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|Mural in the Palacio de Bellas Artes by [[Rufino Tamayo]].]]

The first government sponsored mural project was on the three levels of interior walls of the old Jesuit institution [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]], at that time used for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]].&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, most of the murals in the Escuela National Preparatoria were done by José Clemente Orozco with themes of a mestizo Mexico, the ideas of renovation and the tragedies of the Revolution;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]] painted ["dancers of Chalma"] "Los danzantes de Chalma", no earlier than 1922. Opposite that mural, [[Jean Charlot]] painted ''La conquista de Tenochtitlán'' (Conquest of Tenochtitlan) by Jean Charlot—invited by Leal.&lt;ref name="folgarait"&gt; {{cite book |title= Mural painting and Social Revolution in Mexico 1920-1940  |last= Folgariat |first= Leonard |year=1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn=0-521-58147-8 |pages=42-46 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

===After the mural project at the National Preparatory High School===
This project at the institution was followed by projects at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]], the interior walls of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the [[Chapingo Autonomous University|Escuela Nacional de Chapingo]] the Escuela Nacional de Medicina and the [[Secretariat of Public Education Main Headquarters|Secretaria de Educación Pública building]] among many others.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;
[[File:DeembarcoCanalSICDF.JPG|thumb|[[Ramón Alva de la Canal]], Mural at [[San Ildefonso College|Colegio San Ildefonso]]]]
The movement was strongest from the 1920s to the 1950s, which corresponded to the country’s transformation from a mostly rural and mostly illiterate society to an industrialized one. While today they are part of Mexico’s identity, at the time they were controversial, especially those with socialist messages plastered on centuries-old colonial buildings.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; One of the basic underpinnings of the nascence of a post revolutionary Mexican art was that it should be public, available to the citizenry and above all not the province of a few wealthy collectors.  The great societal upheaval made the concept possible as well as a lack of relatively wealthy middle class to support the arts.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; On this, the painters and the government agreed. One other point of agreement was that artists should have complete freedom of expression. This would lead to another element added to the murals over their development. In addition to the original ideas of a reconstructed Mexico and the elevation of Mexico’s indigenous and rural identity, many of the muralists, including the three main painters, also included elements of [[Marxism]], especially the struggle of the working class against oppression.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The inception and early years of Mexico's muralist movement are often considered the most ideologically pure and untainted by contradictions between socialist ideals and government manipulation. This initial phase is referred to as the "heroic" phase while the period after 1930 is the "statist" phase with the transition to the latter phase caused by José Vasconcelos's resignation in 1924.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coffey|first=Mary|title=Muralism and The People: Culture, Popular Citizenship, and Government in Post-Revolutionary Mexico|journal=The Communication Review|year=2002|volume=5|pages=7–38|doi=10.1080/10714420212350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Coffey describes those who "acknowledge a change but refrain from judgment about its consequences" as taking the soft line and those who see all murals after 1930 as "propaganda for a corrupt state" as taking a hard line.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;  Another stance is that the evolution of Mexican muralism as having an uncomplicated relationship with the government and as an accurate reflection of avant-garde and proletariat sentiments. However, hard liners see the movement as complicit in the corrupt government's power consolidation under the guise of a socialist regime.&lt;ref name="Coffey 2002 7–38"/&gt;

Art historian Leonard Folgarait has a slightly different view. He marks 1940 as the end of the post-revolutionary period in Mexico as well as the renaissance era of the muralist movement.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Folgarait|title=Mural Painting and Social Revolution in Mexico, 1920-1940: Art of the New Order|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the Lázaro Cárdenas administration (1934 – 1940) and the beginning of the Manuel Avila Camacho (1940 – 1946) administration saw the rise of an ultraconservative Mexico.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt;  The country’s policy was aimed at maintaining and strengthening a capitalist society.&lt;ref name="Leonard 1998 7"/&gt; Mural artists like the Big Three spent the post-revolutionary period developing their work based on the promises of a better future, and with the advent of conservatism they lost their subject and their voice.

The Mexican government began to distance itself from mural projects and mural production became relatively privatized. This privatization was a result of patronage from the growing national bourgeoisie. Murals were increasingly contracted for theaters, banks, and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==
[[File:MuralCamarenaBellasArtes.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Mural by [[Jorge González Camarena]] at the Palacio de Bellas Artes]]

Mexican populist art production from the 1920s to the 1950s is often grouped under the name of “Escuela Mexicana de Pintura (y Escultura) (Mexican School of Painting and Sculpture), coined in the 1930s by art historians and critics. The term is not well-defined as it does not distinguish among some important stylistic and thematic difference, there is no firm agreement which artists belong to it nor if muralism should be considered part of it or separate.&lt;ref name="anos30"&gt;{{cite news |title= Testigo de los anos 30 |author=James Oles |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 12, 2000 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Witness to the 1930s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minima"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/artmex/tema3.html |title=Escuela Mexicana de Pintura y Escultura |publisher=Artes e Historia magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican School of Painting and Sculpting |accessdate=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a school in the classic sense of the word as it includes work by more than one generation and with different styles that sometimes clash. However, it does involve a number of important characteristics. Mexican School mural painting was a combination of public ideals and artistic aesthetics “positioned as a constituent of the official public sphere.” &lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three formal components of official Mexican muralism are defined as:
1) Direct participation in official publicity and discourse&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2) Reciprocal integration of the visual discourse of the mural to an array of communicative practices participant in defining official publicity (including a variety of scriptural genres, but also public speech, debate and provocative public “event”)&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
3) The development and public thematizing of a social-realist aesthetic (albeit multiform in character) as the visual register for the public sense of the mural work and as the doxic, or unquestioned, limits for public dispute over the representational space of the mural image&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 71"/&gt;
Most painters in this school worked in [[Mexico City]] or other cities in [[Mexico]], working almost uninterrupted on projects and/or as teachers, generally with support of the government. Most were concerned with the history and identity of [[Mexico]] and politically active. Most art from this school was not created for direct sale but rather for diffusion in both Mexico and abroad. Most were formally trained, often studying in Europe and/or in the Academy of San Carlos.&lt;ref name="minima"/&gt;  
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 5 057.jpg|thumb|180px|Mural by [[Alfredo Zalce]] at the state government palace in [[Morelia]].]]
A large quantity of murals were produced in most of the country from the 1920s to 1970, generally with themes related to politics and nationalism focused often on the [[Mexican Revolution]], mestizo identity and [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural history.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; These served as a form of cohesion among members of the movement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The political and nationalistic aspects had little directly to do with the Mexican Revolution, especially in the later decades. The goal was more to glorify it and its results as a means to legitimatize the post Revolution government.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; The other political orientation was that of [[Marxism]], especially class struggle. This was strongest in the early movement with Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros all avowed communists.  The political messages became less radical but they remained firmly to the left.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Much of the mural production glorified the indigenous aspect of Mexican culture, considering it an important factor in the creation of modern Mexico. This was added with the idea of reexamining the country’s history from a different perspective. One other aspect that most of the muralists shared was a rejection of the idea that art was only for the elite, but rather as a benefit for the masses.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;

The murals took on monumental status because of where they were situated, mostly on the walls of colonial era government buildings and the themes that were painted.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The mural painters of [[Mexico]] freely shared ideas and techniques as they were a closely knit group. However, the work of each was distinctive as the government did not set style and artists can generally be deduced without looking at signatures.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; Techniques included the revival of old techniques such as the [[fresco]], painting on freshly plastered walls and [[encaustic painting|encaustic or hot wax painting]] .&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Others used mosaics and high fire ceramics, as well as metal parts, and layers of cement.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; The most innovative of the artists was Siqueiros who worked with [[pyroxlene]], a commercial enamel and [[Duco]] (used to paint cars), resins, asbestos, old machinery and was one of the first to use airbrush for artistic purposes. He pored, sprayed, dripped and splattered paint for the effects they created haphazardly.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

==Los Tres Grandes==
[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumb|Mural in the main stairwell of the National Palace by Diego Rivera]]
By far, the three most influential muralists from the 20th century are [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]], called “los tres grandes” (the three great ones).&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; All believed that art was the highest form of human expression and a key force in social revolution.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; Their work defined the movement taking over from Vasconcelos. It created a mythology around the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the Mexican people which is still influential to this day, as well as promote [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals. At the time the works were painted, they also served as a form of catharsis over what the country had endured during the war.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; However, the three were different in their artistic expression. Rivera’s works were utopian and idealist, Orozco’s were critical and pessimistic and the most radical were those of Siqueiros, heavily focused on a scientific future.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; The differences among the three have much to do with how each experienced the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rivera was in Europe the entire time and did not fight. He never depicted the horrors of the war but what he perceived to be the social benefits from it. The other two did and both did express the horrors of war in their work.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; There was resentment to Rivera by the other two because of it, especially from Siqueiros.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;
[[File:La abolición de la esclavitud de Orozco.JPG|thumb|left|[[Miguel Hidalgo]] abolishing slavery by José Clemente Orozco]]
Of the three, Rivera was the most traditional in terms of painting styles, drawing heavily from European modernism. In his narrative mural images, Rivera incorporated elements of cubism&lt;ref name="Campbell 2003 55"/&gt; His themes were Mexican, often scenes of everyday life and images of ancient Mexico. He originally painted this in bright colors in the European style but modified it to more earthy tones to imitate indigenous murals. His greatest contribution is the promotion of Mexico’s indigenous past into how many people both inside and outside of the country view it.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Orozco also began with a European style of expression. However his art developed into an angry denunciation of oppression especially by those he considered to be an evil and brutal rules class.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; His work was somber and dire, with emphasis on human suffering and fear of the technology of the future.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; His work shows an "expressionist use of color, slashing lines, and parodic distortions of the human figure." &lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other muralists, Orozco condemned the Spanish as destroyers of indigenous culture, but he did have kinder depictions such as that of a Franciscan friar tending to an emaciated indigenous period.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Unlike other artists, Orozco never glorified the [[Mexican Revolution]], having fought in it, but rather depicted the horrors of this war. It caused many of his murals to be heavily criticized and even defaced.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt;

Siqueiros was the youngest and most radical of the three. He joined the [[Venustiano Carranza]] army when he was eighteen and experienced the Revolution from the front lines.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although all three muralists were communists, Siqueiros was the most dedicated, as evidenced by his portrayals of the proletarian masses. His work is also characterized with rapid, sweeping, bold lines and the use of modern enamels, machinery and other elements related to technology. His style showed a "futurist blurring of form and technique." His fascination with technology as it relates to art was exemplified when he emphasized the mass communications visual technology of photograph and motion picture in his eventual movement toward neorealism.&lt;ref name="Cambell 2003 55"/&gt; His radical politics made him unwelcome in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], so he did much of his work in [[South America]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexconnect"/&gt; However, his masterpiece is considered to be the [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], located in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;

The Big Three struggled to express their leftist leanings after the initial years painting murals under government supervision. These struggles with the post-revolution government lead the muralists to create a union of artists and produce a radical manifesto. [[José Vasconcelos]], the Secretary of Public Education under President [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24) contracted Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco to pursue painting with the moral and financial support of the new post-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=William|title=The Dilemmas of a Communist Artist: Diego Rivera in Moscow, 1927-1928|journal=Mexican Studies|year=1987|volume=3|issue=1|pages=49–69|jstor=4617031|doi=10.2307/4617031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasconcelos, while seeking to promote nationalism and “raza cosmica,” seemed to contradict this sentiment as he guided the muralists to create works in a classic, European style. The murals became a target of Vasconcelos’s criticism when the Big Three departed from classical proportion and figure. Siqueiros was dissatisfied with the incongruity between the murals and the revolutionary concerns of the muralists, and he advocated discussion among the artists of their future works.

In 1922 the muralists founded the Union of Revolutionary Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors of Mexico. The Union then released a manifesto listing education, art of public utility, and beauty for all as the social goals of their future artistic endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambell|first=Bruce|title=Mexican Murals in Times of Crisis|year=2003|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson|isbn=0-8165-2239-1|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nearly a century since the beginning of the movement, Mexican artists still produce murals and other forms of art with the same “mestizo” message. Murals can be found in government buildings, former churches and schools in nearly every part of the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crosscultural"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbard |first=Kathy |date=September 2010 |title= A CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION: Using Visual Culture for the Creation of a Socially Relevant Mural in Mexico |journal=Art Education |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=68–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent example is a cross cultural project in 2009 to paint a mural in the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipal market]] of [[Teotitlán del Valle]], a small town in the state of [[Oaxaca]]. High school and college students from [[State of Georgia|Georgia]], [[United States]], collaborated with town authorities to design and paint a mural to promote nutrition, environmental protection, education and the preservation of [[Zapotec language]] and customs.&lt;ref name="crosscultural"/&gt;

Mexican muralism brought mural painting back to the forefront of Western art in the 20th century with its influence spreading abroad, especially promoting the idea of mural painting as a form of promoting social and political ideas.&lt;ref name="inehrm"/&gt; It offered an alternative to non-representational abstraction after [[World War I]] with figurative works that reflect society and its immediate concerns. While most Mexican muralists had little desire to be part of the international art scene, their influence spread to other parts of the Americas. Notable muralists influenced by Mexican muralism include [[Carlos Mérida]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] of [[Ecuador]] and [[Candido Portinari]] of [[Brazil]] .&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 1 051.jpg|thumb|View of the mural in the Palacio de Gobierno]]
Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros all spent time in the United States. Orozco was the first to paint murals in the late 1920s at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], staying until 1934 and becoming popular with academic institutions.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] employed artists to paint murals, which paved the way for Mexican muralists to find commissions in the country.&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt;  Rivera lived in the United States from 1930 to 1934. During this time, he put on an influential show of his easel work at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The success of Orozco and Rivera prompted U.S. artists to study in Mexico and opened doors for many other Mexican artists to find work in the country.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Siqueiros did not fare as well. He was exiled to the US from Mexico in 1932, moving to [[Los Angeles]]. During this time, he painted three murals, but they were painted over.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbcounty"/&gt; The only one of the three to survive, [[América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos|''América Tropical'']] (full name: ''América Tropical: Oprimida y Destrozada por los Imperialismos'', or ''Tropical America: Oppressed and Destroyed by Imperialism''&lt;ref&gt;Del Barco, Mandalit.

Retrieved June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of mural as political message was transplanted to the United States, especially in the former Mexican territory of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. It served as inspiration to the later [[Chicano]] muralism but the political messages are different.&lt;ref name="chicano"/&gt; Revolutionary Nicaragua developed a tradition of muralism during the [[Sandinista]] period.&lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, ''The Murals of Revolutionary Nicaragua, 1979-1992''.

[[File:Minan-ur-Rehman-Book.jpg|150px|thumb|Book-Title '''Minan-ur-Rehman'' '''(1895)]]
{{Ahmadiyya}}
'''Arabic - the Mother of all Languages - (Book) ''' ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' [Arabic: منن الرّحمٰن ] is a brief treatise on Philology by   [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], (1835-1908) written in May 1895. Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: ''Ummul-al-Sinnah''). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing [[Max Muller]] (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.

==A 20th Century Prophet Ahmad==
::"From my early age, I have been engaged in investigations in religion, I have never reconciled myself with mere platitudes or cursory observations ;  I have never been content with superficial ideas as is the wont of every dull person who is a prisoner of ignorance and untruth. I have never insisted upon baseless ideas, as is the habit of a narrow-minded person who had no desire to understand. Never has anything moved me towards anything except with the eye of penetrating research and except for the attraction of deep-delving insight, nothing has ever lured me into professing a formal creed. And no one has taught me except God Who is the best of all teachers." (page 35)

==Introduction to the book==
:: "So, I named the book منن الرّحمٰن .  [Literally]  ''Favours of the Beneficent God'',   for by many a variety of Grace and Favour, God Almighty bestowed a reward on me, and He is the best of the Givers of favours". (page. 77)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=Urdu#page/126/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short Treatise, namely ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=English#page/-3/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently the book appears to be in response to [[Max Muller]]'s belief that:
::: “I, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of [[Pentecost]].” &lt;ref&gt;Lectures on the Science of Language,  page 53. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32856/32856-0.txt] page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and  refuted [[Max Muller]]'s proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews &lt;ref&gt;"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language." -Acts 2:4,6"&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.
:: وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَنِكُمْ
::إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ
[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.

Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:
::"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ Minan-ur-Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. "He created man then taught him speech and guided him " (page 85).

==Unique Characteristics of Arabic==
In this book ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of ''Mufradaat'' [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,

He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11)

فِ  (fi) 'Be faithful'

قِ  (qi) 'Keep an eye on'

لِ  (li) 'Come nearer'

عِ  ('I) 'Call to mind'

اِ   (I)  'Promise'

خِ  (Khe)  'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'

ہِ   (hi)  'Burst thyself, or become weak'

دِ   (di)  'Pay blood-money'

رِ   (ri)  'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'

شِ  (shi)  'Paint thy garments with patterns '

نِ   (ni)   'Be slow or lazy'

Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small '''single words''' give extensive meanings: e.g.

عرضتُ  (''araztu'') means: "I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them."

طہفلتُ  (''Tahfaltu'') means: "I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread ."

جثمَ  (''Jasama'')  means: "Half the night has passed".

حیعلَ  (''Haya-al'')  means: "Come; Pray!  It is proper time."

==The Mother Language==
"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to
other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon." (page  100).

Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah,  Genesis 11:1:-
::: ויהי כל הארץ שׂפה אחת ודברים אחדים׃
:::"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14]
::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12]

He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:
::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far  reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16]

::"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful  in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences." (page 105).

==Five Points of Excellence==
Ahmad highlighted ''Five'' points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]

1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.

2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.

3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.

4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.

5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.

A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, " Thousands of languages
are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man." [page. 22]

==Arabic follows the Law of Nature==
After the above  ''Introductory details'', the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]
He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these ''Two'' requirements,  Arabic has ''Two'' distinct words for ''Mercy'', ''Rahman'' [رحمان]and ''Raheem''. [رحیم].
To explain his point, Ahmad writes:
::It will be noticed that in as much  this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35]

==Ten Categories of Arabic Roots==
Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the ''Ten Circles of Roots''. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)

::1) Root-words  relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom.

::2)  The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof.

::3) The system of root-words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear,  in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will.

::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected  teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's.

::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station  of nearness to God may be recognized.

::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is ''shirk'' or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam.

::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents.

::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding.

::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.)

::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities.

==Language as the Evolution of ''Names''==
How did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: " On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/Encyclopedia-Britannica-Volume-13-Part-2-Kurantwad-Statue-of-Liberty/The-Origin-of-Language.html Origin of Language Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVoe4n0ifIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

::"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by ''Names'',  Arabic provided them with their "names", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists." (page 123)

==Further Contributions ==
A renowned Philologist Sheikh [[Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar]] (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words.

'''''Monkey Girl: Evolution, Education, Religion, and the Battle for America's Soul''''' is a 2007 [[non fiction]] book about the ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial of 2005.  Author [[Edward Humes]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning American journalist, interviewed interested parties to the controversy around a school board's decision to introduce the concept of [[intelligent design]] into [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] lessons on [[science]].  The book describes in detail the experiences of those caught up in the actions of the school board and the ensuing Dover trial, in the context of the [[intelligent design movement]] and the ascendency of the American [[Christian right|religious right]] whose opposition to [[evolution]] led them to campaign to redefine science to accept [[supernatural]] explanations of [[nature|natural]] phenomena.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Mīmāṃsā''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "reflection" or "critical investigation" and thus refers to a tradition of brahminical thought which reflected on the meanings of certain [[Vedic]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mimamsa Mimamsa] Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britenc&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition is also known as '''Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā''' because of its focus on the earlier (''pūrva'') Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as '''Karma-Mīmāṃsā''' due to its focus on ritual action (''karma'')&lt;ref name=olil2&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt;. It is one of six Vedic "affirming" ([[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]) schools of [[Hinduism]]. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of [[dharma]], based on [[hermeneutics]] of the [[Vedas]], especially the [[Brahmana|Brāḥmanas]] and [[Saṃhita|Saṃhitas]].&lt;ref name=olil&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the [[Vedanta|vedāntic]] schools, which were also known as '''Uttara-Mīmāṃsā''' for their focus on the "later" (''uttara'') portions of the Vedas, the [[Upaniṣads]]. While both "earlier" and "later" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ram-Prasad |first1=Chakravarti |title=Knowledge and Action 1: Means to the Human End in Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā and Advaita Vedānta |journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy |date=2000 |volume=1 |issue=28 |pages=1-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mīmāṃsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its [[epistemology]]. The Prābhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher [[Prabhākara]], described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: ''[[pratyaksha|pratyakṣa]]'' or perception; ''anumāna'' or inference; ''[[upamāṇa]]'', by comparison and analogy; ''arthāpatti'', the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and ''[[śabda]]'', the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]], added a sixth means to its canon; ''[[anupalabdhi]]'' meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the ''lack'' of gunpowder on a suspect's hand)&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=jag&gt;John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66|isbn=9780710092588}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mīmāṃsā school,  ''[[dharma]]'' meant rituals and social duties, not ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'', or gods, because gods existed only in name.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt; The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are "eternal, author-less, [and] infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'', or injunctions and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''kārya'' or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools of Hinduism,&lt;ref&gt;Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), {{ISBN|978-3110181593}}, pages 23-24, 551-663&lt;/ref&gt; their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsakas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedāntins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also ''describe'', ''develop'' and ''derive''.&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt; Mīmāṃsakas considered orderly, law driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end.

The Mīmāṃsā school is a form of [[philosophical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Mīmāṃsā Sūtra]] of [[Jaimini]].&lt;ref name=olil2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhiri&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 298-335&lt;/ref&gt;

This division is based on classification of the Vedic texts into ''{{IAST|karmakāṇḍa}}'', the early sections of the Veda treating of mantras and rituals ([[Samhita]]s and [[Brahmana]]s), and the ''{{IAST|jñānakāṇḍa}}'' dealing with the meditation, reflection and knowledge of Self, Oneness, [[Brahman]] (the Upaniṣads).&lt;ref name=olil/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhiri/&gt; Between the ''Samhitas'' and ''Brahmanas'', the Mīmāṃsā school places greater emphasis to the Brahmanas - the part of Vedas that is a commentary on Vedic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 299&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Davis translates Mīmāṃsā as the "desire to think", and in colloquial historical context as "how to think and interpret things".&lt;ref name="DonaldRDavidJr2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald R.

==Darśana (philosophy) – central concerns==
{{See|Hindu philosophy}}

Mīmānsā is one of the six classical Hindu ''darśanas''. It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies.&lt;ref name=britenc/&gt; It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-340}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-31}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-61, 89-98}} Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Winternitz|authorlink=Moriz Winternitz|title=History of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql0BmInD1c4C |year=1963|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0056-4|pages=511–512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Mīmānsā's central concern was [[epistemology]] (''[[pramana]]''), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only "how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows", but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as [[Foundationalism|foundationalists]] who critique the validity of any "justified beliefs" and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting [[dharma]] texts such as the [[Vedas]].{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}} It asked questions such as "what is ''devata'' (god)?", "are rituals dedicated to ''devatas'' efficacious?", "what makes anything efficacious?", and "can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (''svatah pramanya'', intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?" and others.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=26-33}}{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|pp=337-342}} To Mīmānsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27, 29-30}} According to [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]], a professor at Harvard Divinity School specializing on Hinduism, the Mīmānsā school is "one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world".{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}

The central text of the Mīmānsā school is Jamini's ''Mīmānsā Sutras'', along with the historically influential commentaries on this [[sutra]] by Sabara and by Kumarila Bhatta.{{sfn|Francis X. Clooney|1997|p=337}}{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}} Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture, but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition's negative as well as declare and prove one's own preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be "true or not true", rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is "false, not false, or uncertain".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-35}}

For example, Mīmānsākas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as "[[agnihotra]] ritual leads one to heaven", but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as "ritual does not lead one to heaven",  "something else leads one to heaven", "there is heaven", "there is no heaven" and so on. Mīmānsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a "belief system".{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=27-29}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=57-79}} Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be ''prima facie justified'', and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=28-32}}{{sfn|Dan Arnold|2008|pp=89-114}} Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmānsāka, is an activity of communication (''vyavaharapravrtti'') and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice, unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=31-33, 36-38}}

Mīmānsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the [[summum bonum|highest good]], and actions that make this possible.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}} They stated that human beings seek ''niratisaya priti'' (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one's own ethical actions (''[[dharma]]''), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-318}}{{sfn|P. T. Raju|1985|pp=17, 41-47, 61-63, Quote (p. 62): "The ideal life, according to the Mimamsa, is thus a life of continuous ethical activity and enjoyment of its fruits."}} Mīmānsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them.{{sfn|Prasad|1994|pp=317-319}}{{sfn|J.F. Staal|1976|pp=112-117}} The Mīmānsā school focussed on ''dharma'', deriving ethics and activity from the ''karma-kanda'' (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for ''svarga'' (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.{{sfn|Shyam Ranganathan|2007|pp=298-302, 348-349}}

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
In every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for ''priti'' (pleasure, happiness&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda, Johannes Bronkhorst and Elisa Freschi translate "priti" as happiness; e.g. see, {{cite book|author=Elisa Freschi|title=Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhX3I99EbQ0C&amp;pg=PA380|year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-22260-1|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;),
whether at the lowest level or the highest level.
At the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of ''priti'',
which is ensured only by performing ethical actions.
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Sabara, 2nd century Mīmānsā scholar{{sfn|Prasad|1994|p=339 note 5, Mimamsasutrabhasya 4.3.15}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Daniel Arnold, Mīmānsā scholarship has "striking affinities" with that of [[William Alston]], the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences.{{sfn|Daniel Arnold|2001|pp=41-43}} The Mīmānsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as "God," the "sacred text," the "author" and the "anthropocentric ordering of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Why the Veda Has No Author: Language as Ritual in Early Mīmāṃsā and Post-Modern Theology |author= Francis X.

==Epistemology==
In the field of [[epistemology]], later Mīmāṃsākas made some notable contributions. Unlike the [[Nyaya]] or the [[Vaisheshika]] systems, the {{IAST|Prābhākara}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. ''[[pramāṇa]]''). The {{IAST|Bhāṭṭa}} sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes one additional sixth, namely ''anuapalabdhi'', just like [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of Hinduism. These six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge are:

===Pratyaksa===
Main article : [[Pratyaksha]]

''[[Pratyaksha|Pratyakṣa]]'' (प्रत्यक्ष्य) means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref name=kamal&gt;MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception:&lt;ref name=kpmat/&gt; ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; Some ancient scholars proposed "unusual perception" as ''pramana'' and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from ''Pratyakṣa-pramana'', so as to contrast ''nirnaya'' (definite judgment, conclusion) from ''anadhyavasaya'' (indefinite judgment).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anumana===
Main article : [[Anumana]]

''[[Anumāṇa]]'' (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''.&lt;ref name=kamal/&gt; In all except one Hindu philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;Carvaka school is the exception&lt;/ref&gt; this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: ''pratijna'' (hypothesis), ''hetu'' (a reason), and ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: ''sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and ''paksha'' (the object on which the ''sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upamana===
Main article : [[Upamāṇa]]

''[[Upamāṇa]]'' means comparison and analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, explains [[Monier Monier-Williams]], if a boy says "her face is like the moon in charmingness", "her face" is ''upameyam'', the moon is ''upamanam'', and charmingness is ''samanya''. The  7th century text [[Bhaṭṭikāvya]] in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not.&lt;ref name=mw457/&gt; In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of ''Upanama'' and their value in epistemology are debated.

===Arthāpatti===
{{Main|Arthāpatti}}

''[[Arthāpatti]]'' (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramāṇa'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''pramāṇa'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for ''arthāpatti'' found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā  and other schools of Hinduism is, that if "Devadatta is fat" and "Devadatta does not eat in day", then the following must be true: "Devadatta eats in the night". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1996), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 41-63&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other ''pramāṇas'' or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.&lt;ref&gt;DM Datta (1932), The Six Ways of Knowing: A Critical study of the Advaita theory of knowledge, University of Calcutta, Reprinted in 1992 as {{ISBN|978-8120835269}}, pages 221-253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anupalabdhi===
Main article : [[Anupalabdhi]], See also: [[Abhava]]

''[[Anupalabdhi|Anupalabdi]]'' (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the two schools of Hinduism that consider ''Anupalabdhi'' as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. The schools that endorsed ''Anupalabdi'' affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

''[[Abhava]]'' (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider ''Anupalabdi'' to be same as ''Abhava'',&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt; while others consider ''Anupalabdi'' and ''Abhava'' as different.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic — Abhāva versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291-300&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 155-174, 227-255&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhava-pramana'' has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of ''[[Padārtha]]'' (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A ''Padartha'' is defined as that which is simultaneously ''Astitva'' (existent), ''Jneyatva'' (knowable) and ''Abhidheyatva'' (nameable).&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; Specific examples of ''padartha'', states Bartley, include ''dravya'' (substance), ''[[guna]]'' (quality), ''karma'' (activity/motion), ''samanya/jati'' (universal/class property), ''samavaya'' (inherence) and ''vishesha'' (individuality). ''Abhava'' is then explained as "referents of negative expression" in contrast to "[[Sense and reference|referents]] of positive expression" in ''Padartha''.&lt;ref name=chba/&gt; An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also "existent, knowable and nameable", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, ''asatkaryavada'' theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. ''Abhava'' was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: ''dhvamsa'' (termination of what existed), ''atyanta-abhava'' (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), ''anyonya-abhava'' (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and ''pragavasa'' (prior, antecedent non-existence).&lt;ref name=chba&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), ''Padartha'', in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, pages 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, {{ISBN|81-260-1221-8}}, page 3958&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabda===
{{Main|Sabda}}

''[[Śabda]]'' (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag&gt;
*Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248;
*John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791430675}}, page 238&lt;/ref&gt; Hiriyanna explains ''Sabda-pramana'' as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.&lt;ref name=mhir&gt;M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;  He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through ''Sabda'' (words).&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the ''Sabda'' of reliable sources.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;&lt;ref name=mhir/&gt; The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as [[Carvaka]], state that this is never possible, and therefore ''Sabda'' is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.&lt;ref&gt;P. Billimoria (1988), Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-7810-8}}, pages 1-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to Vedanta school===
An interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is ''ipso facto'' true (Skt. ''svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda''). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (''utpatti'') and ascertainment (''jñapti''). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make the very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the [[Veda]]s, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Metaphysics and beliefs==
The core tenets of {{IAST|''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā''}} are [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), anti-asceticism and anti-mysticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of ''[[dharma]]'', understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.

===Atheism===
Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the [[existence of God]] was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51|isbn=9780791447789|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114|isbn=9780791473368 |date=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dharma''===
[[Dharma]] as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as "virtue", "morality" or "duty". The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal [[cognition]] (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the [[Nyāya]] school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (''pramāṇa'') as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=Subodh|title=The Philosophy Of Vaisnavism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lariw7EILCAC&amp;pg=PA60|year=2004|publisher=Cosmo Publications|isbn=978-81-7755-886-9|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held [[dharma]] to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the [[Samhita|Saṃhitās]] and their [[Brāhmaṇa]] commentaries relating the correct performance of [[yajña|Vedic ritual]]s. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist ([[orthopraxy]]), placing great weight on the performance of [[karma]] or action as enjoined by the Vedas.

===Relation to Vedānta===
Emphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (''mokṣa''), but it never speaks against [[mokṣa]]. Vedānta quotes Jaimini's belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:

In Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5-7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) "''(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so''".

In Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that "There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman".

In 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.

In 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.

In Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls "The Omnipotent Pradhaana" (The Main):

Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: "sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt" (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term ''upadeśa'' here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as "[[Pradhana|pradhāna]]", and keeping away from Him is said to be a "doṣa", hence all beings are asked to get related ("abhisambandhāt" in  tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the "Omnipotent Main Being" (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.

==History==
The school's origins lie in the scholarly traditions of the final centuries BCE, when the priestly ritualism of Vedic sacrifice was being marginalized by [[Buddhism]] and [[Vedanta]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} To counteract this challenge, several groups emerged dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the Vedic texts by rigid formulation of rules for their interpretation. The school gathers momentum in the [[Gupta period]] with [[Śābara]], and reaches its apex in the 7th to 8th centuries with {{IAST|[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]]}} and [[Prabhākara]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the [[decline of Buddhism in India]], but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and  today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Göhler (1995), p. 5f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mīmānsā texts==
The foundational text for the Mīmāṃsā school is the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras|Purva Mīmāṃsā Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 5th to 4th century BCE). A major commentary was composed by [[Śābara]] in ca. the 1th century BC. The school reaches its height with [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|{{IAST|Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}}]] and {{IAST|[[Prabhākara]]}} (fl. ca. 700 CE). Both Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhākara (along with {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose work is no more extant) have written extensive commentaries on [[Śābara]]'s Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣyam.
Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, Mandana Miśra, Pārthasārathi Miśra, Sucarita Miśra, Ramakrishna Bhatta, Madhava Subhodini, Sankara Bhatta, Krsnayajvan, Anantadeva, Gaga Bhatta, Ragavendra Tirtha, VijayIndhra Tirtha, Appayya Dikshitar, Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri, Mahomahapadyaya Sri Ramsubba Sastri, Sri Venkatsubba Sastri, Sri A. Chinnaswami Sastri, Sengalipuram Vaidhyanatha Dikshitar were some of Mīmānsā scholars.

The ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' of Jaimini (c. 3rd century BCE) has summed up the general rules of ''{{IAST |nyāya}}'' for Vedic interpretation. The text has 12 chapters, of which the first chapter is of philosophical value. The commentaries on the ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'' by {{IAST |Bhartṛmitra}}, {{IAST |Bhavadāsa}}, Hari and {{IAST|Upavarṣa}} are no more extant. {{IAST |Śabara}} (c. 1st century BCE) is the first commentator of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā Sūtra}}'', whose work is available to us. His ''{{IAST |bhāṣya}}'' is the basis of all later works of ''{{IAST |Mīmāṁsā }}''. {{IAST |Kumārila Bhaṭṭa}} (7th century CE), the founder of the first school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' commented on both the ''{{IAST|Sūtra}}'' and its ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. His treatise consists of 3 parts, the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}'', the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}'' and the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST|Manḍana Miśra}} (8th century CE) was a follower of {{IAST |Kumārila}}, who wrote ''Vidhiviveka'' and  ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānukramaṇī}}''. There are several commentaries on the works of {{IAST|Kumārila}}. {{IAST|Sucarita Miśra}} wrote a ''{{IAST|Kāśikā}}'' (commentary) on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. {{IAST|Someśvara Bhatta}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyasudhā}}'', also known as ''{{IAST|Rāṇaka}}'', a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Tantravārttika}}''. {{IAST|Pārthasarathi Miśra}} wrote ''{{IAST|Nyāyaratnākara}}'' (1300 CE), another commentary on the ''{{IAST|Ślokavārttika}}''. He also wrote ''{{IAST |Śāstradīpikā}}'', an independent work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and ''Tantraratna''. {{IAST|Venkaṭa Dīkṣita}}’s   ''{{IAST|Vārttikabharaṇya}}'' is a commentary on the ''{{IAST |Ṭupṭīkā}}''. {{IAST |Prabhākara}} (8th century CE), the originator of the second school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' wrote his commentary ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}'' on the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Śālikanātha}}’s ''{{IAST |Ṛjuvimalā}}'' (ninth century CE) is a commentary on the ''{{IAST|Bṛhatī}}''. His ''{{IAST |Prakaraṇapañcikā}}'' is an independent work of this school and the ''{{IAST|Pariśiṣṭa}}'' is a brief explanation of the ''{{IAST |Śabara Bhāṣya}}''. {{IAST |Bhavanātha}}’s ''{{IAST|Nyāyaviveka}}'' deals with the views of this school in details. The founder of the third school of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' was {{IAST|Murāri}}, whose works have not reached us.

{{IAST|Āpadeva}} (17th century) wrote an elementary work on the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'', known as ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsānyāyaprakaśa}}'' or ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''.  ''{{IAST |Arthasaṁgraha}}'' of  {{IAST |Laugākṣi Bhāskara}} is based on the ''{{IAST|Āpadevī}}''. {{IAST|Vedānta Deśika}}’s ''{{IAST |Śeśvara Mīmāṁsā}}'' was an attempt to combine the views of the ''{{IAST|Mīmāṁsā}}'' and the ''{{IAST|Vedānta}}'' schools.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. ''Indian Philosophy'', Vol. II, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-563820-4}}, pp.376-78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orozco the Embalmber''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Orozco el embalsamador'') is a 2001 Spanish-language Japanese [[mondo film|mondo]] [[horror film|horror]] film following a [[Colombia]]n [[embalming|embalmer]] named Froilan Orozco.  Having personally taken care of 50,000 corpses, Orozco lives in an extremely poor, violent, and crime-infested area, where corpses can be seen on the streets and the homicide rate is among the highest in the world.  The film collects footage taken over several years of Orozco's line of work, examining in a very graphic and unflinching [[cinéma vérité]] manner as he embalms and restores corpses.  Orozco died during the production of the film.

The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg Berbers]] living in the desert of North Africa call the Pleiades '''Cat iheḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ihedd''), or '''Cat ahăḍ''' (pronounced: ''shat ahadd''). The name means in [[Berber language|Berber]]: "daughters of the night". Other Berbers call this star cluster: '''Amanar''' (meaning: "the guide") or '''Tagemmunt''' (meaning: "the group").{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A Tuareg Berber proverb says:

''Cat ahăḍ as uḍănăt, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ, anwar daɣ ttsasseɣ. As d-gmaḍent, ttukayeɣ ttegmyeɣ tabruq ttelseɣ.''

Translation: When the Pleiades fall, I wake up looking for my goatskin bag to drink. When (the Pleiades) rise, I wake up looking for a cloth to wear.

Meaning: When the Pleiades "fall" with the sun on the west, it means the hot season is coming, which implies the heat and the thirst of the summer. When the Pleiades rise from the east with the sun, it means the cold and rainy season is coming, and thus one does well to prepare for the cold.&lt;ref&gt;Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene, Awal magazine, 1989, Édition de la maison des sciences de l'homme, Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_20-21/27329.pdf Étoiles et constellations chez les nomades, Edmond Bernus &amp; Ehya ag-Sidiyene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6btoFb1gzwsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Essai sur les origines des Touaregs]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bible ===

In the [[Bible]], the Pleiades are mentioned as כימה ("Khima") three times, always in conjunction with [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]—Amos 5:8; Job 9:9; and Job 38:31. The first two verses are references about their creation, but the third (taken in the context of the following verses) may be more about their ongoing appearance in the night sky. In Job 38:31, the Lord is speaking directly to Job and challenges him, asking if he can bind the chains of the Pleiades—the implication being that Job cannot, but the Lord can. [[Talmud]] ([http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8:%D7%91%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A3_%D7%A0%D7%97 Bavli, Berakhot, 58b]) says that it has about 100 stars, understanding the word כימה as כמאה ''ke' me-ah,'' "about one hundred" in Hebrew.

They are known as [[Biblical cosmology|kimah]] in Jewish culture.

Like most other astronomical findings in the Talmud, rabbinic tradition claims to have gotten such knowledge from Moses when he descended down from [[Mount Sinai]], and hence, from God Himself.

Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki ("[[Rashi]]", 1040-1105), suggested that there were even more stars within the Pleiades Cluster when he expanded on the Talmud's question, "What is meant by Kimah?” which is understood by the modern Orthodox community to mean that there are more than a hundred stars. Therefore, Rashi was saying that the passage in the Talmud only mentioned the most important stars, this numbering to about a hundred, while leaving out the less important ones (which could be hundreds more).

Amazingly, the [[Pleiades]] are at max, 500 light years away, and here were the rabbis, commenting on the number of stars where other cultures could only detect 6-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hidabrut.com/article/171581/The-Pleiades-Star-Cluster|title=The Pleiades Star Cluster|access-date=2017-05-21|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabia and the Levant ===

In [[Arabic]] the Pleiades are known as ''al-Thurayya'' الثريا, and mentioned in Islamic literature. Muhammad is noted to have counted twelve stars in the constellation as reported in [[Ibn Ishaq]] (this was in the time before telescopes when most could only see six).
The name was borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as a female given name, and is in use throughout the [[Middle East]] (for example [[Princess Soraya of Iran]] and [[Thoraya Obaid]]). It is also the name of the [[Thuraya]] satellite phone system based in the [[United Arab Emirates]].

[[Muhammad]] made mention of the [[Pleiades]]. A [[Hadith]] recalled by Imam [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], states:

{{quote|A companion of The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relates: One day we were sitting with The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when this chapter*&lt;ref name="alislam.org"&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1135&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed. I enquired from Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Who are the people to whom the words "and among others of them who have not yet joined them"** refer? Salman (may Allah be pleased with him), a Persian was sitting among us. The Holy Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put his hand on Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) and said. If faith were to go up to the Pleiades, a man from among these would surely find it. ([[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/topics/messiah/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''*The chapter talked about above is Chapter 62&lt;ref name="alislam.org"/&gt; - Surah Al-Jummah&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=1136&amp;region=EN&lt;/ref&gt; - from the [[Qur'an]].''

''**The verse quoted here is verse 3 from the aforementioned chapter.''

=== Turkey ===

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] the Pleiades are known as ''Ülker''. According to the [[Middle Turkic]] lexicographer [[Kaşgarlı Mahmud]], writing in the 11th century, ''ülker çerig'' refers to a military [[ambush]] (''çerig'' meaning 'troops in battle formation'): "The army is broken up into detachments posted in various places," and when one detachment falls back the others follow after it, and by this device "(the enemy) is often routed." Thus ''ülker çerig'' literally means 'an army made up of a group of detachments', which forms an apt [[simile]] for a star cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clauson|first=Gerard|title=An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-Thirteenth-Century Turkish|date=1972|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=143|authorlink=Gerard Clauson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ülker is also a unisex given name, a surname and the name of [[Ülker|a food company]] best known for its chocolates.

=== Iran ===

In the [[Persian language]] Pleiades is known as ''Parvin''. Parvin is also a very popular given name in [[Iran]] and neighbouring countries (for example [[Parvin E'tesami]]).

== Europe ==

The word has acquired a meaning of "multitude", inspiring the name of the French literary movement [[La Pléiade]] and an earlier group of [[Alexandria]]n poets, the [[Alexandrian Pleiad]].

=== Greek mythology ===

{{main article|Pleiades (Greek mythology)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], the stars of Pleiades represented the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Seven Sisters]].

=== Norse mythology ===

To the [[Viking]]s, the Pleiades were [[Freyja]]'s hens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rediscovering Vinland : evidence of ancient Viking presence in America|date=2007|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York|isbn=0595436803|pages=128|author=Fred N. Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their name in many old European languages such as Hungarian compares them to a hen with chicks.

=== Western astrology ===
[[File:Pleiades (Agrippa 1531).svg|thumb|Kabbalistic "[[Pleiades]]" symbol from ''Libri tres de occulta philosophia'' (1531) by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]].]]
The [[astrological]] Pleiades were described in ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'' by [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (Köln, 1533, but published manuscript as early as 1510).

In [[Western astrology]] they represent coping with sorrow&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Eric (1988). ''The Living Stars''. London: Amethyst Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered a single one of the [[medieval]] [[Behenian fixed stars|fixed stars]]. As such, they are associated with [[quartz]] and [[fennel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In [[esoteric astrology]] the seven solar systems revolve around Pleiades.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice (1934). ''Esoteric Astrology''. New York: Lucis Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celtic mythology ===

[[File:Nebra Scheibe.jpg|thumb|right|A bronze disk, 1600 BC, from Nebra, Germany, is one of the oldest known representations of the cosmos. The Pleiades are top right. See [[Nebra sky disk]]]]
To the [[Bronze Age]] people of Europe, such as the [[Celts]] (and probably considerably earlier), the Pleiades were associated with mourning and with funerals, since at that time in history, on the [[cross-quarter day]] {{Dubious|date=October 2011}} between the [[autumn equinox]] and the [[winter solstice]] (see [[Samhain]], also [[Halloween]] or [[All Souls Day]]), which was a festival devoted to the remembrance of the dead, the cluster rose in the eastern sky as the sun's light faded in the evening. It was from this [[heliacal rising|acronychal rising]] that the Pleiades became associated with tears and mourning. As a result of [[Precession (astronomy)|precession]] over the centuries, the Pleiades no longer marked the festival, but the association has nevertheless persisted, and may account for the significance of the Pleiades astrologically.

=== Baltic mythology ===

In [[Baltic languages]] the name for this constellation is '''Sietynas''' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and '''Sietiņš''' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] which is derived from ''sietas'' meaning "[[sieve|a sieve]]". In Lithuanian folk songs this constellation is often [[personification|personified]] as a benevolent brother who helps orphan girls to marry or walks soldiers along the fields. But in Lithuanian folk tales as well as Latvian folk songs this constellation is usually depicted as an inanimate object, a sieve which gets stolen by the devil from the thunder god or is used to conjure light rain by thunder's wife and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://tautosmenta.lt/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Laurinkiene_Nijole/Laurinkiene_LK_2002_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukrainian folklore ===

In [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] traditional folklore the Pleiades are known as Стожари (Stozhary), Волосожари (Volosozhary), or Баби-Звізди (Baby-Zvizdy).

'Stozhary' can be etymologically traced to "стожарня" (stozharnya) meaning a 'granary', 'storehouse for hay and crops', or can also be reduced to the root "сто-жар", (sto-zhar) meaning 'hundredfold glowing' or "a hundred embers".&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Ukrainian Language. Perun Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Volosozhary' (the ones whose hair is glowing), or 'Baby-Zvizdy' (female-stars) refer to the female tribal deities. According to the legend, seven maids lived long ago. They used to dance the traditional round dances and sing the glorious songs to honor the gods. After their death the gods turned them into water nymphs, and, having taken them to the Heavens, settled them upon the seven stars, where they dance their round dances (symbolic for moving the time) to this day. (see article in Ukrainian Wikipedia)

In [[Ukraine]] this asterism was considered a female talisman until recent times.

=== Hungarian folklore ===

The old name of the starcluster in Hungarian is "Fiastyúk", meaning 'a hen with chicks'. There is also a version of the story popularized by the song "A Nap és Szép háza" (House of Sun and Wind) of Hungarian folk metal band Dalriada speaking of a poor woman with seven sons who cursed her sons to turn into ravens after the sons wasted their only food. She failed to find them, but received a prophecy that an eighth brother could find the sons. Her eighth son thus went to look for his brothers, died and the brothers as ravens came to feast on his carcass, resulting in them dying as well and the eight of them getting a place in the sky as the Pleiades cluster. 

== Indigenous peoples of the Americas ==
(Alphabetical by people)

It was common among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] to measure keenness of [[visual perception|vision]] by the number of stars the viewer could see in the Pleiades, a practice which was also used in historical [[Europe]], especially in [[Greece]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

=== Andean cultures ===

In the ancient [[Andes]], the Pleiades were associated with abundance, because they return to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] sky each year at harvest-time. In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] they are called ''Qullqa'' (storehouse).

=== Aztec ===

The ancient [[Aztec]]s of Mexico and Central America based their calendar upon the Pleiades. Their year began when priests first remarked the asterism heliacal rising in the east, immediately before the sun's dawn light obliterated the view of the stars. Aztecs called the Pleiades [[Tianquiztli]] (meaning "marketplace").

=== Blackfoot ===

[[Paul Goble]], Native American storyteller, tells a [[Blackfoot]] legend that he says is told by other tribes as well. In the story, the Pleiades are orphans ("Lost Boys") that were not cared for by the people, so they became stars. Sun Man is angered by the mistreatment of the children and punishes the people with a draught, causing the buffalo to disappear, until the dogs, the only friends of the orphans, intercede on behalf of the people. Because the buffalo are not available while the Lost Boys are in the skies, the cosmical setting of the Pleaides was an assembly signal for Blackfoot hunter to travel to their hunting grounds to conduct the large-scale hunts, culminating in slaughters at buffalo jumps, that characterized their culture.

=== Cherokee ===

A [[Cherokee]] myth (similar to that of the [[Onondaga people]]) indicates that seven boys who would not do their ceremonial chores and wanted only to play, ran around and around the ceremonial ball court in a circle, and rose up into the sky. Only six of the boys made it to the sky; the seventh was caught by his mother and fell to the ground with such force that he sank into the ground. A pine tree grew over his resting place.&lt;ref name="Kingsolver, Barbara 1993 90–91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kingsolver, Barbara|author-link=Barbara Kingsolver|title=[[Pigs in Heaven]]|publisher=Harper Perennial|date=1993|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cheyenne ===

A [[Cheyenne]] myth "The Girl Who Married a Dog", states that the group of seven stars known as the [[Pleiades]] originated from seven puppies which a Cheyenne chief's daughter gave birth to after mysteriously being visited by a dog in human form to whom she vowed "Wherever you go, I go".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/cheyennestory3.htm The Girl Who Married A Dog]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hopi ===

The [[Hopi]] had a relatively limited star lore, but determined the passage of time for nighttime rituals in the winter by observing the Pleiades (''Tsöösöqam'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hopi Dictionary Project (University of Arizona Bureau of Applied Research in Anthropology)|date=1998|title=Hopi dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni: A Hopi-English Dictionary of the Third Mesa Dialect with an English-Hopi Finder List and a Sketch of Hopi Grammar|location=Tucson, Arizona|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=0-8165-1789-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Orion through a [[kiva]] entrance hatch as they passed overhead.

=== Lakota ===

The [[Lakota people|Lakota Tribe]] of [[North America]] had a legend that linked the origin of the Pleiades to [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]]. According to the [[Seri people|Seris]] (of northwestern Mexico), these stars are seven women who are giving birth. The constellation is known as ''Cmaamc'', which is apparently an archaic plural of the noun ''cmaam'' "woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Mary B. |author2=Stephen A.

The early [[Monte Alto Culture]], and others in [[Guatemala]] such as [[Ujuxte]] and [[Takalik Abaj]], made their early observatories using the Pleiades and ''Eta Draconis'' as reference; they were called ''the seven sisters'', and thought to be their original land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_astronomy.htm Maya Astronomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nez Perce ===

A [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] myth about this constellation mirrors the ancient Greek myths about the [[Electra (Pleiad)|Lost Pleiades]]. In the Nez Perce version the Pleiades is also a group of sisters, however the story itself is somewhat different. One sister falls in love with a man and, following his death, is so absorbed by her own grief that she tells her sisters about him. They mock her and tell her how silly it is of her to feel sad for the human after his death, and she in return keeps her growing sadness to herself, eventually becoming so ashamed and miserable about her own feelings that she pulls the sky over her face like a veil, blocking herself from view. This myth explains why there are only six of the seven stars visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Clark| first = Ella| title = Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest| publisher = University of California Press| date = 1953| location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, California| pages = 155–156| isbn = 0-520-00243-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navajo ===

The Pleiades (''dilγéhé'') play a major role in [[Navajo people|Navajo]] folklore and ritual. In the Navajo creation story, Upward-reachingway, ''dilγéhé'' was the first constellation placed in the sky by Black God. When Black God entered the [[hogan]] of creation, the Pleiades were on his ankle; he stamped his foot and they moved to his knee, then to his ankle, then to his shoulder, and finally to his left temple. The seven stars of ''dilγéhé'' are depicted on ceremonial masks of Black God, in sand paintings and on ceremonial gourd rattles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Haile | first = Berard | author-link = Berard Haile | title = Starlore Among the Navaho | place =  Santa Fe, NM | publisher = William Gannon | origyear = 1947 | date = 1977 | page =  | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ban Raji mythology ===
Among the [[Ban Raji]] people, who live in semi-nomadic settlements scattered throughout western Nepal and northern India, the Pleiades are called the "Seven sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law" (''Hatai halyou daa salla''). Ban Rajis note that when the Pleiades rises up over the mountain each night, they feel happy to see their ancient kin (Fortier 2008: in press). On a more practical note, Ban Rajis can tell that evening has arrived, indicating that it is about eight o'clock by local time standards when their star-kin rise above the Nepali mountains bordering the Kali River.

=== China ===
In [[Chinese constellation]]s they are 昴 ''mao'', the ''[[Hairy Head (Chinese constellation)|Hairy Head]]'' of the white tiger of the West.

=== India ===
In [[Jyotisha|Indian astrology]] the Pleiades were known as the [[nakshatra]] {{IAST|[[Kṛttikā]]}} which in [[Sanskrit]] is translated as "the cutters".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis M. Harness.  ''The Nakshatras:  The Lunar Mansions of Vedic Astrology.''  Lotus Press (Twin Lakes WI, 1999.) {{ISBN|978-0-914955-83-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pleiades are called the ''star of fire,'' and their ruling deity is the fire god [[Agni]]. It is one of the most prominent of the nakshatra, and is associated with anger and stubbornness. Karthigai (கார்த்திகை) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] refers to the six wives of the six [[rishi]] (sages), the seventh being [[Arundhati (Hinduism)|Arundhati]] the wife of [[Vasistha]] which relates to the star [[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]] in [[Ursa Major]]. The six stars in Pleiades correspond to six wives, while the faithful wife Arundhati stuck with Sage Vasistha in [[Ursa Major]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tamilandvedas.com/2014/06/25/chastest-woman-arundhati-in-literature/&lt;/ref&gt; The six wives fell in love with [[Agni]], hence the name Pleiades (star of fire).

=== Indonesia ===
In the island of [[Java]], the asterism is known in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''Lintang Kartika'' or ''Gugus Kartika'' ("[[Kṛttikā|Kartika]] cluster"), a direct influence from the ancient [[Hinduism in Java|Hindu Javanese]]. Influenced by Hinduism, the stars represent the seven princesses, which is represented in the court dance of [[Bedhaya|Bedhaya Ketawang]] of the royal palaces of [[Surakarta]]. The dance is performed once per year, on the second day of the Javanese month of [[Javanese calendar|Ruwah]] (during May) and is performed by the nine females, relatives or wives of the [[Susuhunan]] (prince) of Surakarta before a private audience in the inner circle of the Sultanate family.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Judith.

In [[Japan]], the Pleiades are known as 昴 ''[[Pleiades|Subaru]]'' which means "coming together" or cluster in Japanese, and have given their name to the [[Subaru|car manufacturer]] whose logo incorporates six stars to represent the five companies that merged into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subaru.com/faq.html Subaru of America, Inc.

=== Thailand ===
In [[Thailand]] the Pleiades are known as {{RTGS|Dao Luk Kai}} (ดาวลูกไก่) or the "Chick Stars", from a [[Thai folklore|Thai folk tale]]. The story tells that a poor elderly couple who lived in a forest had raised a family of [[chicken]]s: a mother hen and her six (or alternately seven) chicks. One day a monk arrived at the couple's home during his [[Dhutanga]] journey. Worried that they had no suitable food to offer him, the elderly couple contemplated cooking the mother hen. The hen overheard the conversation, and rushed back to the [[Chicken coop|coop]] to say farewell to her children. She told them to take care of themselves, and that her death would repay the kindness of the elderly couple, who had taken care of all of them for so long. As the mother hen's feathers were being burned over a fire, the chicks threw themselves into fire in order to die along with their mother. The deity, impressed by and in remembrance of their love, immortalized the seven chickens as the stars of the Pleiades. In tellings of the story in which there were only six chicks, the mother is included, but often includes only the seven chicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prapayneethai.com/th/amusement/north/view.asp?id=0370 Thaiculture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspg.org/fabel/doc3.htm rspg.or.th]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Depending on the language group or clan, there are several Aboriginal stories regarding the origins of the Pleiades. Some [[Indigenous Australian]] peoples believed the Pleiades was a woman who had been nearly [[rape]]d by [[Kidili]], the man in the moon.

In a legend told by the [[Wurundjeri]] people of south-eastern Australia, the Pleiades were represented by the seven [[Karatgurk]] sisters. These women were the first to possess the secret of fire and each one carried live coals on the end of her [[digging stick]]. Although they refused to share these coals with anybody, they were ultimately tricked into giving up their secret by [[Crow (Australian Aboriginal mythology)|Crow]], who subsequently brought fire to mankind. After this, the Karatgurk sisters were swept into the night sky. Their glowing fire sticks became the bright stars of the Pleiades cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mudrooroo  | title =Aboriginal mythology: An A-Z spanning the history of the Australian Aboriginal people from the earliest legends to the present day  | publisher = Thorsons  | date = 1994  | location = London  | pages = 35–36  | isbn = 978-1-85538-306-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book |title=The Emu in the Sky: Stories about the Aboriginals and the day and night skies - The Emu |pages=15, 16 |author=Peter D'Arcy |editor=Margo Sutton |year=1994 |publisher=The National Science and Technology Centre|isbn=978-0-64618-202-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version, often painted by [[Gabriella Possum Nungurayyi]] as this is her [[Dreaming (story)|dreaming]] (or creation story), daughter of the late [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]] from the Central desert art movement of [[Papunya]], depicts the story of seven Napaltjarri sisters being chased by a man named Jilbi Tjakamarra. He tried to practice love magic on one of the sisters but the sister did not want to be with him, and ran away from him together with her sisters. They sat down at [[Uluru]] to search for honey ants but when they saw Jilbi, they went to Kurlunyalimpa and with the spirits of Uluru, transformed into stars. Jilbi transforms himself into what is commonly known as the [[Venus|Morning Star]]{{dubious|date=June 2017|Venus is a movable star and not in Orion's belt}} in [[Orion's belt]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}, thus continuing to chase the seven sisters across the sky.

There is an analogous holiday in [[Hawaiʻi]] known as [[Makahiki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/hawaiian/voyaging/files/t07-navigation/t07-01_glossary.html Hawaiian Voyaging Course&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
Occurring June 20 – June 22, the [[winter solstice]] (''Te Maruaroa o Takurua'') is seen by the New Zealand Māori as the middle of the winter season. It follows directly after the first sighting of ''[[Matariki]]'' (The Pleiades) and ''Puanga/Puaka'' ([[Rigel]])&lt;ref&gt;Rigel is ''Puanga'' in northern [[Māori language|Māori]], and ''Puaka'' in [[Māori language#South Island dialects|southern dialects]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the dawn sky, an event which marked the beginning of the New Year and was said to be when the Sun turned from his northern journey with his winter-bride ''Takurua'' ([[Sirius]]) and began his journey back to his summer-bride ''Hine Raumati''.

== Non-Saharan Africa ==

In the [[Swahili language]] of [[East Africa]] they are called "kilimia" ([[Proto-Bantu]] *'''ki-dimida''' in [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] areas E, F, G, J, L, and S) which comes from the verb ''-lima'' meaning "dig" or "cultivate" as their visibility was taken as a sign to prepare digging as the onset of the rain was near.

In the closely related [[Sesotho]] language of the [[Southern Africa]]'s [[Basotho]] people the Pleiades are called "Seleme se setshehadi" ("the female planter"). Its disappearance in April (the 10th month) and the appearance of the star [[Achernar]] signals the beginning of the cold season. Like many other Southern African cultures, Basotho associate its visibility with agriculture and plenty.

== Modern beliefs ==

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===

The 19th century astronomer [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]] proposed the Central Sun Hypothesis, according to which all stars revolve around the star Alcyone, in the Pleiades. Based on this hypothesis, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religion taught until the 1950s that Alcyone was likely to be the site of the throne of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/god_s_throne_-_pleiades.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Theosophy ===
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it is believed the ''Seven Stars of the Pleiades'' focus the [[spiritual energy]] of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|Seven Rays]] from the ''Galactic Logos'' to the ''Seven Stars of the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]'', then to [[Sirius]], then to the [[Sun]], then to the god of [[Earth]] ([[Sanat Kumara]]) and finally through the seven [[ascended master|Masters of the Seven Rays]] to us.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dr. Douglas ''The Seven Rays:Key to the Mysteries'' 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UFOs ===
In [[Ufology]] some believers describe [[Nordic alien]] extraterrestrials (called [[Pleiadeans]]) as originating from this system.

== New Age ==
In [[New Age]] lore, some believe that [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] will pass through a [[Photon belt]] from the Pleiades, causing a cataclysm and/or initiating a spiritual transition (referred to variously as a "shift in consciousness," the "Great Shift," the "Shift of the Ages").

Barbara Marciniak, author of ''Bringers of the Dawn'', is one of the authors who contributes to the New Age mythos of Pleiadian ET beings who are linked to human ancestry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2949">The '''serpentine dance''' is a form of dance that was popular throughout the United States and Europe in the 1890s, becoming a staple of stage shows and early film.

==Background==
The Serpentine is an evolution of the [[skirt dance]], a form of [[burlesque]] dance that had recently arrived in the United States from England.  Skirt dancing was itself a reaction against "academic" forms of ballet, incorporating tamed-down versions of folk and popular dances like the [[can-can]].&lt;ref name="light"/&gt;

The new dance was originated by [[Loïe Fuller]], who gave varying accounts of how she developed it.&lt;ref name="light"&gt;{{cite book|title=Traces of light: absence and presence in the work of Loïe Fuller|author=Ann Cooper Albright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtPbjaGZ4GoC|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-8195-6843-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By her own account, which is widely reported, having never danced professionally before, she accidentally discovered the effects of [[stage light]] cast from different angles on the gauze fabric of a costume she had hastily assembled for her performance in the play ''Quack M.D.'', and spontaneously developed the new form in response to the audience's enthusiastic reaction upon seeing the way her skirt appeared in the lights.&lt;ref name="light"/&gt;  During the dance she held her long skirt in her hands, and waved it around, revealing her form inside.&lt;ref name="light"/&gt;

==Filmed versions==
[[File:Annabelle Serpentine.ogv|thumb|A segment from Annabelle Butterfly &amp; Serpentine Dances]]
The Serpentine Dance was a frequent subject of early [[motion pictures]], as it highlighted the new medium's ability to portray movement and light.  Two particularly well-known versions were ''[[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]]'' (1894), a performance by Broadway dancer [[Annabelle Whitford]] from [[Edison Studios]], and a [[Lumière brothers]] film made in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/the_lumiere_brothers_danse_serpentine|publisher=Dangerous Minds|title=The Lumiere Brothers’ Danse Serpentine|date=September 24, 2009|author=Bradley Novicoff}} (See also [https://www.facebook.com/MartinezHistoricalSociety/videos/1069958246376147/ Martinez Historical Society Facebook page)].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other filmmakers produced their own versions, distributing prints that had been [[Film tinting|hand-tinted]] to evoke (though not quite reproduce) the appearance of colored light projection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">The '''Sibiu Literary Circle''' ({{lang-ro|Cercul literar de la Sibiu}}) was a [[literary society|literary group]] created during [[World War II]] in [[Sibiu]] to promote the modernist liberal ideas of [[Eugen Lovinescu]].

The group was formed around [[Lucian Blaga]] and other intellectuals from [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], who had settled in Sibiu after the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj]] had moved there in 1940, in the wake of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] occupation of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The most active members of the group were [[Ion Negoițescu]], [[Radu Stanca]], [[Ion Desideriu Sârbu]], [[Cornel Regman]], [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]], [[Nicolae Balotă]], [[Eugen Todoran]], [[Eta Boeriu]], [[Radu Enescu]], and [[Ovidiu Cotruş]]. The group disbanded in 1945.

:&lt;small&gt;Redirected by decade:&lt;ref name=redir&gt;
   Early years are redirected by decade, combining 10 articles
   as one article (which lists each event, noting each year "16xx"):
   1690-1699 redirect to "[[1690s in architecture]]" and
   1680-1689 redirect to "[[1680s in architecture]]" or
   1450-1459 redirect to ''[[1450s in architecture]]'', etc.
   For the 14th century, each decade redirects to the overall century,
   so "[[1390s in architecture]]" redirects to the century
   article "[[14th century in architecture]]" and so on.

'''''The God Beneath the Sea''''' is a [[Children's literature|children's novel]] based on [[Greek mythology]], written by [[Leon Garfield]] and [[Edward Blishen]], illustrated by [[Charles Keeping]], and published by [[Longman]] in 1970. It was awarded the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] (Garfield &amp; Blishen)&lt;ref name=medal1970/&gt; and commended for the companion [[Greenaway Medal]] (Keeping)&lt;ref name=ccsu/&gt;{{efn |name=HC}} by the British [[CILIP|Library Association]]. [[Pantheon Books]] published a U.S. edition with illustrations by [[Zevi Blum]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt;

The novel begins with newborn [[Hephaestus]] (the titular god beneath the sea) cast from [[Mount Olympus]] by his mother [[Hera]]. He is raised in a grotto by [[Thetis]] and [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]] and the two goddesses tell him various [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|Greek creation myth]]s. The novel continues with myths of the [[Greek mythology#Greek pantheon|Olympians]] and the [[Greek mythology#Age of gods and mortals|age of gods and mortals]], and concludes with Hephaestus returning to Olympus, having been cast down for a second time after reproaching [[Zeus]].

Garfield, Blishen, Keeping, and Longman collaborated on a sequel entitled ''The Golden Shadow'' (1973, {{ISBN|9780582151628}}).&lt;ref name=sequel&gt;

It is based on myths of the later [[Greek mythology#Heroic age|heroic age]], when divine activity was limited.

==Plot==

''The God Beneath the Sea'' is divided into three parts. Part one begins with the image of the infant Hephaestus plummeting from Olympus to the ocean. Thetis saves the baby and takes him to the grotto she shares with Eurynome. They raise the baby, telling him stories of Greek myths and giving him a hammer and anvil to play with. Part one concludes with [[Hermes]] inviting Hephaestus back to Olympus at Hera's bequest, and Hephaestus claiming [[Aphrodite]] for his wife. Part two tells the myths of [[Prometheus]] and [[Pandora]], and part three tells various myths of gods interacting with mortals. The novel concludes with the Olympians unsuccessfully attempting to overthrow Zeus, and Hephaestus returning to Olympus from [[Lemnos#Mythic Lemnos|Lemnos]], having been cast down from Olympus for a second time after reproaching [[Zeus]].

===Part I===

In Part I, "The Making of the Gods", Thetis and Eurynome tell Hephaestus stories of the Titans and Olympians, in hopes of quelling his restless nature. They begin with the myths of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] emerging from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], then tell of the birth of the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[Hecatonchires]], and the overthrowal of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] by his son [[Cronus]]. They tell of Cronus' ascension to the throne with his queen [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], and his descent to madness after the [[Furies]] torment him nightly with prophecies that he, like his father, would be overthrown by his son.

Hephaestus grows uglier and more violent with age. Thetis and Eurynome give him a hammer, anvil and forge to vent his fury and discover he is a gifted [[metalsmith|smith]]. Hephaestus' most beautiful creation is a brooch depicting a sea nymph and her lover; he threatens to destroy the brooch unless Thetis tells him who he is and how he came to live in the grotto. The goddesses resume their tales: Rhea and [[Zeus]] conspire to overthrow Cronus. The avenging children of Cronus defeat and imprison the Titans, sparing Rhea, [[Prometheus]] and [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]].

The gods fashion their home on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and Zeus seduces Hera by transforming himself into a cuckoo. Their child is hideous and misshapen, and Hera throws the child out into the sky. At the revelation of his parentage, Hephaestus breaks the brooch, and half is washed to sea. His desire for vengeance are tempered by the realization of Zeus' immense power. The narrative then shifts from Hephaestus and the goddesses to recount concurrent events amongst the Olympians, including the arrival at Olympus of [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Athena|Athene]] and [[Hermes]].

Pregnant again, Hera overlooks Zeus' infidelities, resolving to remain calm to avoid another monstrous child. Hera gives birth to her second son, [[Ares]], and the immortals come to Olympus to honor the newborn god. Zeus commands Hermes to find a gift for Ares. Hermes finds the lost half of Hephaestus' broken brooch and returns it to Zeus as a gift. Zeus creates [[Aphrodite]] in the image of the brooch's nymph. Hermes then reunites the broken half of the brooch with the other half, which is worn by Thetis.

Hera, struck by the beauty of the brooch, demands to know who fashioned the brooch, then dispatches Hermes to fetch Hephaestus. Hermes returns Hephaestus to Olympus; Hephaestus forgives Hera and asks Zeus for Aphrodite as a wife. Ares demands a birthright from Zeus, and Zeus makes him god of hatred, discord and war.

===Part II===

In Part II, "The Making of Men", Prometheus makes men out of clay and the substance of Chaos to inhabit the earth, fearing that Zeus will give the earth to one of his children as a plaything. At Zeus' behest, Hermes commands Prometheus to destroy his creations. Instead, Prometheus teaches his creatures to sacrifice and worship Zeus. [[Trick at Mecone|Prometheus offers Zeus the choice of two portions as sacrifice]]; Zeus mistakenly chooses the poorer portion, and in retribution forbids mankind the use of fire. Prometheus steals fire for them in defiance of Zeus. He continues to watch over mankind, finding strange impurites in the substance of Chaos he'd used to create them. These he scrapes away and hides in a sealed jar.

Zeus commands Hephaestus to make a woman. The Olympians bless her with gifts, and Zeus names her [[Pandora]]. Hermes gives Pandora to Epimetheus as a wife. Zeus punishes Prometheus by chaining him to a pillar in the [[Caucasus]], where a vulture eats his liver daily. At night his wounds heal, so that his punishment can begin anew the next morning.

Pandora eventually finds Prometheus' [[Pandora's box|hidden jar]]. Opening it, she releases malignant furies on mankind: madness, old age, vice and sickness. All that is left in the jar is a [[chrysalis]] that works as a healing balm. Hermes consoles the despairing Prometheus that hope was left behind for mankind, "for who knows what may unfold from a chrysalis?"&lt;ref&gt;Blishen, Edward; Garfield, Leon, ''The God Beneath the Sea'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III===

Part III, "Gods and Men", begins with the tale of [[Lycaon of Arcadia|Lycaon]] turned to a wolf by Zeus after treating him with disrespect. Zeus begins a [[Deluge myth#Deucalion|deluge]]. Prometheus shouts a warning to [[Deucalion]], who makes a sea vessel to survive the storm with his wife, [[Pyrrha]]. They land at [[Mount Parnassus]], and after praying they repopulate the earth by casting stones over their shoulders. The stones transform to people when they land.

The novel then tells of [[Persephone]]'s abduction by [[Hades]], and [[Demeter]]'s search for her. After learning of Persephone's abduction from a shepherd, Demeter swears to Zeus that she will withdraw her blessings from the earth unless Hades returns Persephone. Zeus agrees to let Persephone return if she has not tasted the food of the dead. [[Ascalaphus]], a gardener in the underworld, remembers that Pandora ate seven pomegranate seeds in Hades, and Demeter turns him into a [[screech-owl]]. Rhea intercedes and Demeter agrees to let Persephone live with Hades for three months of the year.

The novel tells myths of [[Autolycus]], the son of Hermes and [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]], and [[Sisyphus]]. Autolycus steals the cattle of his neighbor Sisyphus; Sisyphus gains revenge by raping Autolycus' daughter [[Anticleia]]. Autolycus sends Anticleia to Ithaca to marry [[Laertes]], who raises [[Odysseus]], the son of Sisyphus and Anticleia, as his own. Sisyphus spies Zeus ravishing the daughter of the river god [[Asopus]] and tells Asopus where he had seen them in return for a gift of an eternal spring. He tricks death by trapping Hades in his own manacles. Hades is freed by Ares, but Sisyphus escapes death a second time by deceiving Persephone. At last Hermes takes Sisyphus to [[Tartarus]], to be condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity.

Meanwhile, Hera and the Olympians conspire to imprison Zeus in a net while he is distracted raining thunderbolts on Asopus. Thetis fetches [[Briareus]] to free him. Zeus punishes Hera by hanging her in the sky, and sets Poseidon and Apollo the vain task of building the doomed city of [[Troy]]. Hephaestus, seeing Hera's punishment, berates Zeus, and Zeus throws Hephaestus for a second time from Olympus. Hephaestus lands on the isle of [[Lemnos]] and is nursed to health by the locals. He returns to Olympus and is greeted by Hermes. At the novel's conclusion, Autolycus muses in a letter to his daughter that his grandson Odysseus may one day visit the new city of Troy.

==Development and themes==

Blishen and Garfield began work on ''The God Beneath the Sea'' after discovering that Greek mythology had had similar impacts on them as [[primary school]] children. In Blishen's words, "these stories seemed to illuminate, to make clear, what was going on around me in my small and unimportant life. They were about love ... They were about the desire for power, about jealousy, about triumph and great defeat."&lt;ref&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield suggested they should "write the stories for today's children" and remove the "upholstered [[Victorian era|Victorian]] quality" of the stories as told to themselves.&lt;ref name="BGK49"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors aimed to restore the power the myths had had for the Greeks, and for themselves as children. They decided to tell the myths not as separate stories but as "a fresh and original piece of fiction"&lt;ref name="BGK50"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and a single, continuous account of the origins of the world, of man's struggle against his surroundings, and of man's struggle with his own nature.&lt;ref name="BGK49" /&gt; They hoped while writing the book to present the myths as "a total coherent account of the human situation, the human predicament, and human opportunities."&lt;ref name="BGK50" /&gt; One of the main difficulties they encountered was selecting a sequence of myths from "the enormous expanse" of Greek mythology&lt;ref name="BGK50" /&gt; to form a single story that would increase the power of the work.&lt;ref name="BGK51"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

They shared a concern about recent developments in [[children's literature]] and society's attitudes towards children. They felt that older children's literature had been moving closer to adult literature, and that the book had taken them "further than [they'd] ever been taken before" towards that end. They felt it necessary to address "meaningful violence" and "the strongest of human passions" in the novel, because these were "the preoccupations with which our children are, we know, at the moment filled."&lt;ref name="BGK51" /&gt;

Blishen and Garfield used four source texts: [[E. V. Rieu]]'s translations of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], and [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The Greek Myths]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Blishen, Edward; Garfield, Leon, ''The God Beneath the Sea'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors' primary source text was Graves' ''The Greek Myths'', because of the simplicity of his writing. They also borrowed from [[Ovid]] and many musical sources, including [[Handel]].&lt;ref name="BGK50" /&gt;

About the writing process the authors told ''Junior Bookshelf'' (August 1971), "We wrote together, much of the time. One of us would actually commit the words to paper. There were often long silences. These might be broken, not by a grave suggestion as to further text, but by some wild burst of laughter. Much of the matter we were dealing with was most grim and tense. Laughter - and some schoolboyish joking - helped."&lt;ref name=medal1970/&gt;

===Development of the illustrations===

Charles Keeping drew fifteen illustrations for ''The God Beneath the Sea''. His work was [[#Illustrations|widely acclaimed by critics]], but Keeping himself was dissatisfied with the illustrations.&lt;ref name="BGK53"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not enthusiastic about working on the book when approached by Garfield, as he disliked the Greek myths. The myths had been presented to him in school "in the most boring fashion" and as an art student he found Greek art "cold and dispassionate." He saw the customary method of illustrating Greek myths in a stylized mimicking of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vase painting]] as "an utter bore."&lt;ref name="BGK52"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Garfield told Keeping he was using Robert Graves as a source, Keeping read ''The Greek Myths''&lt;ref name="BGK52" /&gt; and found them "quite disgusting" and "completely devoid of any love. This is all lust, rape, revenge and violence of every possible kind."&lt;ref name="BGK53" /&gt; Keeping looked for a deeper significance and philosophy in the stories, finding links to the [[Bible]] and other stories from other cultures and religions, and "some basic human passions."&lt;ref name="BGK53" /&gt; In attempting to "cover all the ground [Garfield and Blishen] covered with fifteen drawings", Keeping felt he had "to take a group of shapes that would project what this meant to me."&lt;ref name="BGK53" /&gt;

Keeping decided not to use Greek costume as he was concerned readers would react the same way he used to: "What does it mean? What does it do? Am I just delving into the past?"&lt;ref name="BGK53" /&gt; He also avoided modern dress as "this would be old fashioned within another fifteen years",&lt;ref name="BGK53" /&gt; deciding in the end to dispense with "any form of recognizable costume" while avoiding "anything that is appertaining to our particular moment in time."&lt;ref name="BGK54"&gt;Blishen, Garfield, Keeping (Nov 1970), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He used "a [[figurative art]]. There's nothing else in it... except people, their emotions and their reactions to emotions."&lt;ref name="BGK54" /&gt;

Keeping called his completed illustrations for ''The God Beneath the Sea'' "a set of drawings much to my disgust not all awfully good."&lt;ref name="BGK54" /&gt; He saw them as violent and cruel illustrations of violent and cruel people, and attempted to visually project this by taking "a symbolic line, so if you look at them you will find there's a symbolic overtone in them."&lt;ref name="BGK54" /&gt; At the time of the book's publication, Keeping was looking forward to working with the authors on the sequel ''The Golden Shadow'', as he hoped "to redeem some of the mistakes of the first one."&lt;ref name="BGK54" /&gt;

==Literary significance and reception==

The [[CILIP|Library Association]] recognised ''The God Beneath The Sea'' for both of its annual children's book awards, the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and the [[Kate Greenaway Medal]]. Garfield and Blishen won the Carnegie Medal, for the year's best children's book by a [[British subject]].&lt;ref name=medal1970&gt;

The novel's narrative structure was singled out by reviewers with similarly divided verdicts. For Manning, the novel's opening, "an excellent device ...to allow the book to start dramatically", and subsequent moments of pace and tension, are ruined by chronic over-writing.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt; Nye felt the use of the two falls of Hephaestus as a [[framing device]] "makes sense of what comes in-between", but for Nye "it is a savage sort of sense, depending to a large extent on melodrama".&lt;ref name="nye" /&gt; ''History Today'' claimed the choice to retell the myths as a continuous narrative resulted in "a brilliant poetic fantasy";&lt;ref name="freeman" /&gt; Hughes said of the novel's series of stories, "[t]heir zest sweeps you along. It is a real feat, to make everything sound so first hand."&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; ''[[Contemporary Review]]'' observed a "slight decline in narrative cohesiveness" in the second half of the book, after the "fine ... reworking of the earlier myths" but felt it "detracts little from the effectiveness of dramatic and narrative motifs ... which help tie together the disparate myths so well."&lt;ref name="townsend_p"&gt;{{cite journal

In contrast to the writing's mixed reception, critics were unanimous in acknowledging the power of Charles Keeping's illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Two drawings especially &amp;ndash; Cronos and Prometheus &amp;ndash; are more terrible and beautiful than [[Goya]]."&lt;ref name="garner" /&gt; Manning stated that Keeping's "contributions are magnificent... From this book, it is Keeping's interpretation of the 'enormous violent energy' of the Greek myths that will be remembered."&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt; ''The Spectator'' called the illustrations "totems of potency";&lt;ref name="townsend" /&gt; ''Contemporary Review'' said the "bold, forceful and imaginative illustrations" added to the "dramatic presentation of the myths."&lt;ref name="townsend_p" /&gt; Hughes saw the illustrations as "relating the stories to the primitive roots of myth, rather than to the civilized commentators, taking the stories from scholarship and handing them back to imagination."&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Writing on the occasion of Keeping's nomination for the 1974 [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], a reviewer in ''[[The Times]]'' singled out the illustrations for ''The God Beneath the Sea'' and its sequel ''The Golden Shadow'' as "probably the most striking evidence of Keeping's forceful presence".&lt;ref name="alderson"&gt;{{cite news

The U.S. publisher [[Random House]] replaced Keeping's work with illustrations by Zevi Blum.&lt;ref name=LCC/&gt; They were not well received by critics; one described them as "[[MGM]]-style drawings, which substituted for drama a soft coyness and prurience."&lt;ref name="alderson" /&gt;

The '''Three Friends of Winter''', also known as '''''Suihan Sanyou''''', is an art motif that comprises the [[pine]], [[bamboo]], and [[Plum blossom|plum]].&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese symbols|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Chinese_symbols_1109.pdf|publisher=British Museum|page=1|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese observed that the pine, bamboo and plum do not wither as the cold days deepen into the winter season unlike many other plants.&lt;ref name=npm-intro/&gt; Known by them as the ''Three Friends of Winter'', they entered the conventions of East Asian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Friends of Winter|url=http://www.colby.edu/art/InkTales/Bowdoin%20Exhibition%20Pages/BEThreeFriendsWinter.html|publisher=Colby College|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultivating Virtue: Botanical Motifs and Symbols in East Asian Art|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/past/detail.dot?id=19111|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they symbolize steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dusenbury|first=Mary|title=Flowers, dragons and pine trees: Asian textiles in the Spencer Museum of Art|year=2004|publisher=Hudson Hills Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55595-238-9|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=566AlluiHT0C|edition=Bier, Carol; Foresman, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly regarded in [[Confucianism]] and as such represent the scholar-gentleman's ideal.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=welch-three/&gt;

==History==
The Three Friends of Winter are common in works of Chinese art&lt;ref name="welch20"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese art: a guide to motifs and visual imagery|year=2008|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|location=North Clarendon|isbn=978-0-8048-3864-1|pages=20–21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sgO9BuZQSEC|last=Welch|first=Patricia Bjaaland}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those cultures influenced by it. The three are first recorded as appearing together in a ninth-century poem by the poet Zhu Qingyu (朱慶餘) of the [[Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref name=welch-three/&gt; The [[Culture of the Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]] artist Zhao Mengjian (趙孟堅, c. 1199–1264), among others of the time, made this grouping popular in painting.&lt;ref name=welch-three&gt;{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Patricia Bjaaland|title=Chinese art: A guide to motifs and visual imagery|year=2008|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|location=North Clarendon|isbn=978-0-8048-3864-1|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sgO9BuZQSEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The actual term "Three Friends of Winter" can be traced back to the earliest known mention in literature, the ''Record of the Five-cloud Plum Cottage'' (五雲梅舍記) from ''The Clear Mountain Collection'' (霽山集) by the Song dynasty writer Lin Jingxi (林景熙, 1242–1310):&lt;ref name=npm-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Friends of Winter: Paintings of Pine, Plum, and Bamboo from the Museum Collection (Introduction)|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh91/3friends/english/infor.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-npm-intro&gt;{{cite web|title=歲寒三友|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/exh91/3friends/chinese/infor.htm|publisher=National Palace Museum|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''"For his residence, earth was piled to form a hill and a hundred plum trees, which along with lofty pines and tall bamboo comprise the friends of winter, were planted."''&lt;ref name=npm-intro/&gt;
:即其居累土為山，種梅百本，與喬松，脩篁為歲寒友。&lt;ref name=zh-npm-intro/&gt;

==Cultural symbolism==
[[File:Bian Wenjin, Three Friends and a Hundred Birds.jpg|thumb|''Three Friends and a Hundred Birds'' by [[Bian Jingzhao|Bian Wenjin]], Ming dynasty]]
Culturally, the ''Three Friends of Winter''—[[pine]], [[Bamboo#In Asian culture|bamboo]], and [[Prunus mume#Cultural significance|plum]]—are grouped together in the context of winter because they all flourish at that season.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; For this reason they are commonly known as the ''Three Friends of Winter''.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;  They are also referred to simply by their linked names: ''Song Zhu Mei''  (松竹梅) in Chinese, transliterated as ''Sho Chiku Bai'' in Japanese (literally "pine, bamboo, plum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Qiu|first=Peipei|title=Basho and the Dao: The Zhuangzi and the transformation of Haikai|year=2005|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-0-8248-2845-5|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OolnFbgs_IC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Korean poem by Kim Yuki (1580–1658), the three friends are brought together in order to underline the paradoxical contrast:
:Peach and plum of springtime, don't flaunt your pretty blossoms;
:Consider rather the old pine and green bamboo at year's end.
:What can change these noble stems and their flourishing evergreen?&lt;ref&gt;''The Bamboo Grove'', ed. and trans. Richard Rutt, University of California Press 1971, poem 18&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, they are particularly associated with the start of the Lunar New Year, appearing on greeting cards and as a design stamped into seasonal sweets.&lt;ref&gt;''Bamboo in Japan'' Nancy Moore Bess and Bibi Wein, Kodansha International 2001, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adam Savage HOPE.jpg|thumb|Video feedback of [[Adam Savage]]]]

'''Video feedback''' is the process that starts and continues when a [[video camera]] is pointed at its own playback [[video monitor]]. The loop delay from camera to display back to camera is at least one [[video]] frame time, due to the input and output scanning processes; it can be more if there is more processing in the loop.

==History==
First discovered shortly after [[Charlie Ginsburg]] invented the first video recorder for [[Ampex]] in 1956, video feedback was considered a nuisance and unwanted noise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Technicians and studio camera people were chastised for allowing a video camera to see its own monitor as the overload of self-amplified video signal wreaked havoc with the 1950s video pickup, often ruining the pickup.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It could also cause [[screen burn-in]] on a playback TV and/or monitors of the time as well, by generating static brightly illuminated display patterns.

In the 1960s early examples of video feedback art become introduced into the [[psychedelic art]] scene in [[New York City]]. [[Nam June Paik]] is often cited as the first [[video art]]ist, although this is disputed; he had clips of video feedback on display in New York City at the [[Greenwich Cafe]] in the mid 1960s. 

Early video feedback works were created by media artist/experimenters on the East and West Coasts in the late 1960s and early 70's. Video feedback artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], with [[Richard Lowenberg]] and others, formed The Kitchen, which was located in the kitchen of a broken-down hotel in lower Manhattan; while [[Skip Sweeney]] and others founded Video Free America in San Francisco, to nurture their video art and feedback experiments.

[[David Sohn]] mentions video feedback in his 1970 book ''Film, the Creative Eye''. This book was part of the base curriculum for [[Richard Lederer]] of [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], when he introduced making videofeedback as part of an English curriculum in his 1970s course Creative Eye in Film. Several students in this class participated regularly in the making and recording of videofeedback. [[Sony]] had released the VuMax series of recording video cameras and manually "hand-looped" video tape decks by this time which did two things: it increased the resolution of the video image, which made the picture more attractive, and it brought video tape recording technology within the general public's grasp for the first time and allowed for such video experimentation to take place by the general public.

During the 1980s and into the 1990s video technology became enhanced and evolved into high quality, high definition video recording. [[Michael C. Andersen]] generated the first known mathematical formula of the videofeedback process, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif "Formula for Videofeedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132859/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/model.gif |date=July 19, 2011 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; and he has also generated a [[Mendeleev]]'s square to show the gradual progressive formulaic change of the video image as certain parameters are adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html "Simulation of video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007204011/http://www.videofeedback.dk/vf/ss/sspost.html |date=October 7, 2009 }}. videofeedback.dk. Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s the rave scene and a social return to art of a more psychedelic nature brought back displays of video feedback on large disco dance floor video screens around the world. There are filters for Adobe Photoshop and non linear video editors that often have video feedback as the filter description, or as a setting on a filter. These filter types either mimic or directly utilize video feedback for its result effect and can be recognized by its vortex, phantasmagoric manipulation of the original recorded image.

==In entertainment==
Many artists have used optical feedback. An example is [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] music video for "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" (1975). The effect (in this simple case) can be compared to looking at oneself between two mirrors.

Other videos that use variations of video feedback include:
* [[Doctor Who]] – ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'' (series, 1963-1973, opening title sequence.)
* [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] — ''[[September (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song)|September]]'' (1978)
* [[The Jacksons]] – ''[[Blame it on the boogie|Blame It On the Boogie]]'' (1978)
* [[Kate Bush]] – ''[[Hammer_Horror_(song)|Hammer Horror]]'' (1978)
* [[Amii Stewart]] – ''[[Knock on Wood_(song)|Knock on Wood]]'' (1979)
* [[Kool &amp; the Gang]] – ''[[Get Down On It]]'' (1981)
* [[Todd Rundgren]] – ''Something to Fall Back On'' (1985)
* [[Smashing Pumpkins]] – ''[[Ava Adore]]'' (1998)
* [[Klaxons]] – ''[[Gravity's_Rainbow_(song)|Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (2008)
* [[Boxcutter (musician)|Boxcutter]] – ''TV Troubles'' (2011)
* [[Django Django]] – "Life's A Beach" (2012)

The opening titles sequence for the British [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' employed this technique from 1963 to 1973 (initially in black and white, redone in 1967 to showcase the show's new [[625-line]] broadcast resolution and feature the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]'s face ([[Patrick Troughton]] at that time), then redone again, in colour this time, in 1970. The next title sequence for the show, which debuted in 1973, abandoned this technique in favour of [[slit-scan photography]].

[[File:Optical_feedback.jpg|thumb|128px|left|Optical feedback between mirrors.]]
The optical feedback discussed so far—video feedback, created by a camera pointing at its own monitor—is actually just one particular example of optical feedback. Perhaps the most obvious example of optical feedback in science is the [[optical cavity]] found in almost every [[laser]], which typically consists of two mirrors between which light is amplified. In the late 1990s it was found that so-called unstable-cavity lasers produce light beams whose cross-section present a fractal pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6758/abs/402138a0.html Laser optics: Fractal modes in unstable resonators], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] Vol. 402, 138 (11 November 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Optical feedback in science is often closely related to video feedback, so an understanding of video feedback can be useful for other applications of optical feedback. Video feedback has been used to explain the essence of fractal structure of unstable-cavity laser beams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ "Fractal video feedback"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520070401/http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/Optics/play/fractalVideoFeedback/ |date=May 20, 2011 }}. Optics Group (University of Glasgow). Retrieved 2010-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The page [http://www.cse.salford.ac.uk/profiles/gsmcdonald/FractalLasers.php discovery of fractal lasers] gives an account of laser fractals, the developments of this work, links to further reading, and relates the laser context with video feedback systems. 

Video feedback is also useful as an experimental-mathematics tool.  Examples of its use include the creation of [[Fractal]] patterns using [http://www.sweetandfizzy.com/fractals/diagrams.html multiple monitors] or [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Campus/8446/vid_fractals/index.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:34:34  multiple images created using mirrors].

The page [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017183543/http://www.videofeedback.dk/World/ video feedback in science] provides an overview.

[http://softology.com.au/videofeedback/videofeedback.htm Softology's Video Feedback page] provides links and information about real and simulated video feedback.

Optical feedback is also found in the [[image intensifier]] tube and its variants. Here the feedback is usually an undesirable phenomenon, where the light generated by the phosphor screen "feeds back" to the photocathode, causing the tube to oscillate, and ruining the image. This is typically suppressed by an aluminum reflective screen deposited on the back of the phosphor screen, or by incorporating a [[microchannel plate detector]].

Optical feedback has been used experimentally in these tubes to amplify an image, in the manner of the cavity laser, but this technique has had limited use.

Optical feedback has also been experimented with as an electron source, since a photocathode-phosphor cell will 'latch' when triggered, providing a steady stream of electrons. See US Patent 4,531,122 for a typical application.

== In philosophy ==
[[Douglas Hofstadter]] discusses video feedback in his book ''[[I Am a Strange Loop]]'' about the human mind and consciousness. He devotes a chapter to describing his experiments with video feedback.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At some point during the session, I accidentally stuck my hand momentarily in front of the camera's lens. Of course the screen went all dark, but when I removed my hand, the previous pattern did not just pop right back onto the screen, as expected. Instead I saw a different pattern on the screen, but this pattern, unlike anything I'd seen before, was not stationary.&lt;ref name=hofstadter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas|title=I Am a Strange loop|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-03079-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various organizations such as Gamer TV, Madagastar Esports,AnTrix Gaming,GameNerd,Giiks Gaming City and GasBros Gaming Network are some pioneers in the industry. Video Gaming  and Gamers have been  the rise for the last decade. Primarily Tournaments are used to bring gamers around to associate and expand the gaming space.Events like the Annual [[Global Game Jam]]  have greatly helped in the establishment of Gaming as a career choice.Organisations like Virtual Union and Gamers Republic are pushing for pro gamers and Associations like the Ghana E-sports Association are pushing to usher in a new era for E-sports in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/MyNews24/ghana-enters-the-international-esports-arena-20160127|title=Ghana enters the international  eSports arena|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/We-need-support-to-participate-in-international-tournaments-Esports-Ghana-635306|title=We need support to participate in international tournaments – Esports Ghana|website=www.ghanaweb.com|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tournaments are also held in major cities like Accra and Kumasi. Video Gaming and eSports in general is slowly been accepted and integrated into the Ghanaian culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7154">[[File:AP - Peripheral Vision.pdf|thumb|Peripheral vision of the human eye.]]

'''Vision span''' or '''perceptual span''' is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the [[human eye]] has sharp enough [[Visual perception|vision]] to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The [[visual field]] of the human eye spans approximately 120&amp;nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees of arc]].  However, most of that arc is [[peripheral vision]]. The human eye has much greater [[Optical resolution|resolution]] in the [[macula]], where there is a higher density of [[cone cell]]s. The [[field of view]] that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6&amp;nbsp;degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50&amp;nbsp;centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the [[field of view]] with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7° which represents about 45% of a face.&lt;ref name=FS&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1167/17.5.16 |pmid=28549354 |title=The Facespan—the perceptual span for face recognition |journal=Journal of Vision |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=16 |year=2017 |last1=Papinutto |first1=Michael |last2=Lao |first2=Junpeng |last3=Ramon |first3=Meike |last4=Caldara |first4=Roberto |last5=Miellet |first5=Sébastien }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.

==Application to speed reading==

While reading, readers will fail to recognize a word unless they are fixating within three to four character spaces of the word.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(75)90005-5 |title=The perceptual span and peripheral cues in reading |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=65–81 |year=1975 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true for [[speed reading|speed readers]] and [[Skimming (reading)|skimmers]].  Speed readers cannot answer questions about a main point or detail, if they did not fixate directly on it or within three character spaces of it (Just and Carpenter 1987).  When a text is removed whilst reading, readers can only accurately report upon the word they were fixating upon or the next one to the right (McConkie and Hogaoam 1985).  There is no evidence from eye movement research that individuals are making predictions of text based upon hypotheses about the words in the periphery so that they can skip over or spend less time on unimportant or redundant words.&lt;ref name=Rayner1975/&gt;

Most speed reading courses claim that the peripheral vision can be used to read text. This has been suggested impossible because the text is blurred out through lack of visual resolution.  At best the human brain can only ''guess'' at the content of text outside the macular region. There simply are not enough cone cells away from the center of the visual field to identify words in the periphery of the field.

It has been suggested that the fixation span can be stretched through training ([[meta guiding]]) to take in as much as a line for the purpose of skimming or speed reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 2729064|year = 2007|last1 = Legge|first1 = G. E|title = The case for the visual span as a sensory bottleneck in reading|journal = Journal of Vision|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 9.1–915|last2 = Cheung|first2 = S. H|last3 = Yu|first3 = D|last4 = Chung|first4 = S. T|last5 = Lee|first5 = H. W|last6 = Owens|first6 = D. P|pmid = 18217824|doi = 10.1167/7.2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources suggest that using this method can result in a severely reduced comprehension rate in comparison to normal reading ("[[rauding]]").

Some speed reading courses stress that the human eye has to move very quickly.  They also stress that the human eye should move in a pattern to fill in the information that was not properly perceived.  The effective limit for [[wikt:scan|scan]]ning speeds based upon the limit of the human eye's resolution is about 300 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://skepdic.com/speedreading.html{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that such speeds also require great practice, and extremely rapid eye movements, although research suggests that such training is not possible.  It has been suggested by some speed reading promoters that the readers who achieve such speeds are on the [[autism spectrum]].  Research into reading rate suggests that study strategies, rather than speed reading, explains why expert readers, such as professors and editors, are more efficient than others.

==Application to face processing==

Face recognition system requires several fixation on different location (typically in a triangular pattern) for a face to be recognised. The same is true for the so-called Super Recognisers who are persons with high face recognition capabilities. Similarly to the reading span, the Facespan might be modulated by difficulty,&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1990-18858-001{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; expertise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3758/PBR.17.6.834 |pmid=21169577 |title=Eye movements, the perceptual span, and reading speed |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=834 |year=2010 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith |last2=Slattery |first2=Timothy J |last3=Bélanger |first3=Nathalie N |pmc=3075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(86)90037-8 |pmid=3701249 |title=Eye movements and the perceptual span in beginning and skilled readers |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=211–36 |year=1986 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02648003 |title=Eye movements, perceptual span, and reading disability |journal=Annals of Dyslexia |volume=33 |pages=163–173 |year=1983 |last1=Rayner |first1=Keith }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other idiosyncratic differences between individuals. The idiosyncratic differences are thus most probably due to differences in Facespan rather than in oculomotor strategy. Previous study revealed that the Vision span is more accurately defined in number of characters rather than in visual angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02364.x |pmid=19470124 |title=Parafoveal Magnification |journal=Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=721–8 |year=2009 |last1=Miellet |first1=Sébastien |last2=O'Donnell |first2=Patrick J |last3=Sereno |first3=Sara C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tourists with guide in lower canyon, Petra.jpg|thumb|Tourists on a walking tour of the lower canyon at [[Petra]], Jordan]]
A '''walking tour''' is a tour of a historical or cultural site undertaken on foot, frequently in an urban setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1304940#m_en_us1304940  Oxford Dictionary 1&lt;/ref&gt; Short tours can last under an hour, while longer ones can take in multiple sits and last a full day or more. A walk can be led by a [[tour guide]], as an escort.

==Precursors==
A [[Grand Tour]] was "a long tour of major cities" undertaken in Europe in the 17th through 19th centuries, as part of a wealthy young man's education,&lt;ref&gt;''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' (1998), and ''New Oxford American Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; and involved visits to cities, historic and cultural sites, with pedestrian activity  confined to these cities or sites. 

A [[pilgrimage]] is a religious journey traditionally taken on foot, to a location of significance to the walker's faith. Only a minority of contemporary pilgrimages are on foot. Chaucer's 14th-century narrative poem ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' certainly indicates that a pilgrimage can involve pleasure. 

There are also similarities between walking tours that involve long hikes and [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], while [[backpacking (travel)|non-pedestrian backpacking]] is a kind of modern, inexpensive Grand Tour that makes use of [[public transport]].

==Tours of cities and cultural sites==
[[File:Free Walking Tour in Baden-Baden.jpg|thumb|A walking tour in Baden-Baden]]
[[File:YorkPavementButton1.jpg|thumb|A glass stud in [[York]] sidewalk. Such glass studs are the remnants of the York Breadcrumbs trail, an initiative from 2005 which incorporated three custom walking tours and (now defunct) website. The tours included the Minster, the Shambles, the Guildhall etc. with a story thrown in.]]
===With guides===
A walking tour is generally distinguished from an [[escorted tour]] by its length and the employment of [[tour guides]], and can be under 12 hours, or last for a week or more. They are led by guides that have knowledge of the sites, or the landscape, covered on the tour, and explanations and interpretations of the site can cover a range of subjects, including places with historical, cultural and artistic significance. Walking tours, of various kinds and length, are universally part of the tourism industry, and can be found around the world.

Many walking tours involve a payment to the guide, although some operate on a [[Gratuity|tip]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "pay what you want" model started around 2004, and can be found in many countries. The UK-based Guild of Registered Tour has criticised the system for not requiring any training or certification of its guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narratives===
Several cities now have groups that are employing dramatic spectacle to add interest to their tours.  Usually guided by actors in costume playing a role, these walking tours create the feel of [[living history]] as guests walk in the footsteps of those who came before them. These tours, which blend history and dramatic narrative, share "history in a non-academic, very accessible fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Handley|first1=Gen|title=Forbidden Vancouver tour reenacts Gastown's gothic adventures|url=http://www.westender.com/news/forbidden-vancouver-tour-reenacts-gastown-s-gothic-adventures-1.882003|website=The Westender|publisher=The Westender|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These tours are similar in nature to [[promenade theatre]].  Although the theatrical nature of these tours is similar to [[museum theatre]] in that it makes use of [[Museum theatre#First-person interpretation|first person interpretation]], the fact that these tours take place outside of traditional museum settings and requires the audience to move through urban environments makes this style of walking tour a genre of its own.

===Self guided tours===
[[Self-guided tour|Self-guided]] tours, utilise a range of methods to aid travel through a place, or landscape, such as books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Frommer's walking tours.

'''Yardie''' (or '''Yaadi''') is a term often used, particularly within the [[Caribbean]] expatriate and [[Jamaican diaspora]] community, to refer to persons of [[Jamaica]]n origin, though its exact meaning changes depending on context. The term is derived from the [[Jamaican patois]] for home or "yard".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Register of Caribbean English Usage|last = Allsop|first = Richard|publisher = University of the West Indies Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-976-640-298-3|location = Jamaica|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have specifically originated from the crowded [[Trenchtown|government yards]] of two-storey concrete homes found in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] and inhabited by poorer Jamaican residents.&lt;ref name="covey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Covey|first1=Herbert|title=Street Gangs Throughout the World|date=2010|location=Springfirld, Illinois|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlZ3CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=government+yard+yardies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GYpj9NIDBd&amp;sig=IufbMf5wtZop8mv_zHvnGlC4UyA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_kpWbzZTQAhVK4IMKHYaZAdgQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=government%20yard%20yardies&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, especially outside of Jamaica, "yardies" or "the Yardies" usually specifically refers to Jamaican [[gang]]s or [[organized crime]] groups and gangsters of Jamaican origin, nationality, or ethnicity. The term is often used interchangeably with the term "posse" or "[[Jamaican posse]]" to refer to crime groups of Jamaican origin, with the term "Posse" used more frequently in Jamaica, the [[United States]], and [[Canada]] to refer to Jamaican, [[Jamaican-American]], and [[Jamaican-Canadian]] crime groups, and "Yardies" being deployed more frequently in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="mccarthy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Dennis M.

== Etymology and usage ==
Derived from [[Jamaican Patois]], the term "yardie" can be ambiguous, having multiple meanings depending on context.&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; In the most innocuous sense, "yardie" can simply refer to a Jamaican national; as "yard" can mean "home" in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican expatriates who moved abroad to countries such as the U.K. and U.S. would often refer to themselves and other Jamaicans as "yardies".&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; "Yardie" may also more specifically apply to those Jamaicans originating in the impoverished "government yards" or courtyards of Jamaican [[public housing]], and the term was eventually applied to criminals and gang members originating from these "yards."&lt;ref name="covey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who are the Yardies?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/371604.stm|accessdate=6 November 2016|agency=BBC News|date=June 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the term "yard" in Jamaican Patois can also refer to a territory, turf, or piece of land, "yardie" further gained gang or criminal connotations as Jamaican gangs or criminals claimed certain "territories" or "turf" and referred to such territory as their "yards."&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt; Subsequently, in the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, [[North America]], the term "Yardie" most frequently refers to gangsters or gangs of Jamaica origin, though these gang members themselves may refer to their gangs as "posses" or "crews."&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright2013"/&gt; The term is especially common in the U.K. to describe Jamaican or [[British Jamaican]] organized crime groups and gangs, while "posse" has become the more common term in North America.&lt;ref name="covey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarthy"/&gt;

==Origins of "Yardie" organized crime groups==
In the 1950s in [[Trenchtown]], [[Kingston, Jamaica]], the government created [[social housing]] developments employing large public courtyards, and the courtyard areas soon became the hub of social and recreational activity in the crowded housing of Trenchtown. With increasing overcrowding and poverty, however, [[squatting]] and [[homelessness]] developed within the yards. Crime, drug abuse, and violence overran the yards, while political corruption and [[clientelism]] led to local politicians buying and selling patronage within the community and paying gangs and violent political supporters to intimidate voters and threaten, assault, or kill political opponents.&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Carrie|title=Empire's Crossroads: The Caribbean From Columbus to the Present Day|date=2014|publisher=Pan Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXTAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT275&amp;dq=government+yards&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYqbLIz5TQAhVKxoMKHaxZDvwQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=government%20yards&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, political violence and politically-affiliated organized crime groups and street gangs became increasingly common in poorer areas of Jamaica, with gangs often led by older bosses known as "[[don (honorific)|dons]]" (in reference to the [[Sicilian Mafia]] don) and participating in both apolitical drug trafficking and racketeering and political violence and political intimidation.&lt;ref name="covey"/&gt; These gangs became known as "Yardies," "posses", or "crews".&lt;ref name="Wright2013"/&gt; Accounts of the association between Jamaican political factions and the rise of the Yardies are given in the factual books [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ruthless.html?id=18TrGwAACAAJ ''Ruthless''] by Geoff Small and ''[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8050-3205-5 Born Fi' Dead]'' by Laurie Gunst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/extreme-prejudice-1528024.html|title=Extreme prejudice|last=Hobson|first=Will|date=31 December 1995|work=The Independent|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, a drop in government budgets resulted in less money being paid by political parties to their gangs of armed supporters. These political Yardie gangs thus increasingly turned to apolitical criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, to bring in income.&lt;ref name="covey"/&gt; At the same time, the Jamaican government severely cracked down on Yardie gangs and political violence in general, leading many so-called Yardie gangsters to immigrate abroad and establish gangs the U.K., U.S., and Canada.&lt;ref name="abadinsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abadinsky|first1=Howard|title=Organized Crime|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcoKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=yardies+jamaican+yard+criminals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji8pK14JTQAhXH7IMKHcZ7AqkQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yardies%20jamaican%20yard%20criminals&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of Yardie gangs abroad coincided with the [[crack epidemic|rise of crack cocaine]] in both North America and the U.K., and Yardie and Posse gangs from Jamaica became heavily involved in the trafficking of [[crack cocaine]] and other drugs, in addition to [[illegal gambling]] and other criminal activity.&lt;ref name="abadinsky"/&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
During the 1950s, the British government encouraged immigration to the country to fill existing job vacancies. Within the [[Caribbean]] community, new arrivals from [[Jamaica]] were sometimes referred to as "Yardies" due to reference of Jamaica as "back a yard" (or "back home"). A large influx of inner city Jamaican immigration to Britain during the 1980s led to the rise of gang violence or behaviour on the part of Jamaicans which became known in wider [[British society]] as "Yardie culture" and the participants "Yardies". The terms "Yardie gang" or "Yardie gun violence" were largely used by the British media to describe violent crimes in [[London]]'s [[Black British|black community]]. The gangs in London are specifically known to have occupied and operated in their infamous grounds of [[Brixton]], [[Harlesden]], [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], [[Tottenham]], [[Peckham]] and [[Notting Hill]].&lt;ref name="Wright2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wright|title=Organised Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LWDR0BuafAC&amp;pg=PT211|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-01890-1|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamaican-born British writer [[Victor Headley]] wrote a bestselling 1992 novel entitled ''[[Yardie (novel)|Yardie]]''. In 2018, British actor [[Idris Elba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Yardie (film)|date=2018-06-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yardie_(film)&amp;oldid=845168942|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; made his directorial debut with his feature film [[Yardie (film)|''Yardie'']], based on Headley's book.

== Criminal activity ==
Yardie gangs are notorious for their involvement in [[gun crime]] and the [[illegal drug trade]], notably [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[crack cocaine]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1993, Yardies were blamed for the murder of Police Constable Patrick Dunne, shot dead while patrolling in [[Clapham]].&lt;ref name="Arnold2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catharine Arnold|title=Underworld London: Crime and Punishment in the Capital City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qa9gH3hdoYEC&amp;pg=PT407|date=5 July 2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-85720-117-1|pages=407–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rohan Chung, described as a Jamaican yard gangster was given three life sentences for the murders of Noel Patterson and his daughters, Connie and Lorna Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/yardie-convicted-over-triple-murder-7192598.html|title=Yardie convicted over triple murder|last=|first=|date=17 January 2006|work=Evening Standard|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Kingdom|British]] police are hesitant to categorize Yardie gangs as organized crime, since there appears to be no real structure or central leadership; gang affiliations can be described as loose at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/371604.stm|title=Who are the Yardies?|last=|first=|date=19 June 1999|website=BBC News|archive-url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/371604.stm|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither have Yardies made any attempts at setting up fronts for their illegal activities, nor any serious attempts to corrupt and infiltrate law enforcement organisations.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Academics have noted a tendency to over-label black British crime as "Yardie"-related due to stereotype and social narrative.&lt;ref name="FijnautPaoli2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cyrille Fijnaut|author2=Letizia Paoli|title=Organised Crime in Europe: Concepts, Patterns and Control Policies in the European Union and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XtKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA428|date=21 January 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-2765-9|pages=428–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of operations to combat Yardie gun crime have been set up, notably [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]] in the [[London]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/398197.stm "Police tackle London's Yardies"], BBC News, 20 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Yardies (or imitating) gangs also appear to be active in [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Nottingham]] but to a lesser extent.

Some maintain that the supposed reach and influence in communities of these "Yardies" is a myth.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">[[File:Palmerston NZ Boer War Memorial closer.jpg|230px|thumb|right|The Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] depicting ''Zealandia'' pointing heavenward, was unveiled in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ODT19030615.2.82.26?query=zealandia%20rifles Papers Past] | PALMERSTON FALLEN SOLDIERS'MEMORIAL ...&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Zealandia''''' is a [[national personification]] of [[New Zealand]]. In her stereotypical form, Zealandia appears as a woman of European descent who is similar in dress and appearance to [[Britannia]], who is said to be the mother of Zealandia.&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;[[Denis Glover|Denis James Matthews Glover]], [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/zealandia/1 "A National Symbol?"] in ''[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]'' ([[Alexander Hare McLintock|A. H. McLintock]] ed, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a direct link to both [[Motherland|Mother]] [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the old world, she brought a sense of history and classical respectability to the [[Colony of New Zealand|colony]] during the formative years as a young nation.
Zealandia appeared on [[postage stamp]]s, posters, cartoons, war memorials, and New Zealand government publications most commonly during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-mother-of-the-nation/ ZEALANDIA – MOTHER OF THE NATION?] - New Zealand Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Zealandia was a commonly used symbol of the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]], which was held in [[Wellington]] in 1939 and 1940. Three large Zealandia statues exist in New Zealand towns or cities; one is in [[Waimate]], one is in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]], and one in [[Newton, New Zealand#Symonds Street|Symonds Street]], [[Auckland]]. The first two (in stone) are [[Second Boer War]] memorials and the latter one (in bronze) is a [[New Zealand Wars]] memorial. Some smaller statues exist in museums and in private hands.

===Postage stamps===

[[File:1901 Universal Postage 1 penny red.JPG|145px|thumb|right|''Zealandia'' on a [[Postage stamps and postal history of New Zealand#Universal one penny postage|1901 postage stamp.]]]]
Zealandia also featured on one penny definitive postage stamps issued in 1901 and 1909 during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Edward VII]] when it went from being a Colony to a [[Dominion of New Zealand|Dominion]] and was also depicted on a stamp featuring the coat of arms issued in 1929.
