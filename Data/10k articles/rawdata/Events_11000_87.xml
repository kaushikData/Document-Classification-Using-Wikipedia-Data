{{BC year in topic|597}}

The year '''597 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 157 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 597 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. 

==Events==

He sends into [[Babylonian captivity]] the new young king [[Jeconiah]] (replacing him with [[Zedekiah]], a puppet ruler) and number of other prominent Jews, including [[Ezekiel]], along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], numbering about 10,000. The [[Ark of the Covenant]] vanishes at this time.

'''''Alternative 3''''' is a television programme, broadcast once only in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1977, and later broadcast in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]], as a [[fiction]]al [[hoax]], an heir to [[Orson Welles]]' [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio production of ''The War of the Worlds'']]. Purporting to be an investigation into the UK's contemporary "[[brain drain]]", ''Alternative 3'' uncovered a plan to make the [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] habitable in the event of [[climate change]] and a terminal environmental catastrophe on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.paranoiamagazine.com/2013/01/alternative-3-end-game-of-the-new-world-order/|title=Alternative 3: END GAME of the New World Order - Paranoia Magazine|date=2013-01-26|newspaper=Paranoia Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme was originally meant to be broadcast on [[April Fools' Day]], 1977.  While its broadcast was delayed until June 20, the credits explicitly date the film to April 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/exopolitica/esp_exopolitics_ZJ01.htm|title=Alternative 3 - The Saga Lives On|website=www.bibliotecapleyades.net|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alternative 3'' ended with credits for the actors involved in the production and featured interviews with a fictitious American astronaut.

==Overview==
The programme was presented as an edition of an Anglia TV series called ''Science Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theunredacted.com/alternative-3-secret-space-program/|title=Alternative 3 - Secret Space Program|date=2016-03-09|newspaper=theunredacted.com|language=en-UK|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/director-returns-to-norwich-to-relive-tv-hoax-that-shocked-the-world Director returns to relive TV hoax that shocked the world - Press Release - UEA]&lt;/ref&gt;  The intended transmission date was April 1, but it seems that Anglia was unable to obtain an ITV network slot for the programme on that date due to strike action/labour disputes{{cn|date=December 2017}}.  The script was written by Chris Miles and David Ambrose.  Music was supplied by [[Brian Eno]], a portion of his score being released on the album ''[[Music for Films]]'' (1978). Apart from the presenter [[Tim Brinton]], all the characters in the programme were played by actors who were explicitly credited at the end.

The episode began by detailing the so-called "brain drain:" a number of mysterious disappearances and deaths of [[physicist]]s, engineers, astronomers, and others in related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/alternative3|title=Alternative 3|newspaper=Museum of Hoaxes|language=en-us|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the strange deaths reported was that of one "Professor Ballantine" of [[Jodrell Bank]]. Before his death, Ballantine delivers a videotape to a friend in the press, but upon playback the tape appears to contain only static.

According to the research presented in the episode, it was hypothesized that the missing scientists were involved in a secret American/Soviet plan in [[outer space]], and further suggested that interplanetary space travel had been possible for much longer than was commonly accepted. The episode featured an [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] astronaut "Bob Grodin"  (played by [[Shane Rimmer]]) who claims to have stumbled on a mysterious lunar base during his moonwalk.

It was claimed that scientists had determined that the [[Earth]]'s surface would be unable to support life for much longer, due to [[pollution]] leading to catastrophic [[climate change]]. Physicist "Dr Carl Gerstein" (played by [[Richard Marner]]) claimed to have proposed in 1957 that there were three alternatives to this problem. The first alternative was the drastic reduction of the human population on Earth. The second alternative was the construction of vast underground shelters to house government officials and a cross section of the population until the climate had stabilised, a solution reminiscent of the finale of ''[[Dr Strangelove]]''. The third alternative, the so-called "Alternative 3," was to populate [[Mars]] via a [[Wiktionary:way station|way station]] on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://binnallofamerica.com/rr6.20.8.html|title=Richard's Room 101|website=binnallofamerica.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme ends with some detective work; acting on information from Grodin, the reporters determine that Ballantine's videotape requires a special decoding device. After locating the decoder, the resulting video turns out to depict a joint American and Russian landing on the Martian surface in 1962.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Production==
The programme was made with stock film used at the time to make it appear like a conventional documentary programme. In a 1989 interview, actor [[Richard Marner]] (Dr Carl Gerstein) said he didn't rehearse his lines to make the delivery appear as natural as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RYDfJPI3VewJ:img.pathfinder.gr/clubs/files/4553/7777.dat+&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=ALTERNATIVE 3, THE UK ANGLIA TELEVISION PROGRAMME 1977|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Within minutes of the programme ending, Anglia Television was flooded with telephone calls demanding more information. Callers were told the programme was a hoax. ''[[The Times]]'' on 21 June reported that "Independent television companies last night received hundreds of protest calls after an Anglia programme, ''Alternative 3'', gave alarming facts about changes in the Earth’s atmosphere. It was a hoax, originally intended for April 1st." It also pointed out that several of the characters in the programme were played by well known actors.

Nick Austin, who was editorial director of Sphere Books when Watkins' adaptation was commissioned and published, writes that the book was the "best chance I’d ever be likely to get to participate in a hoax of truly [[Guy Grand]] proportions — the best thing of its kind since [[Orson Welles]]' ''War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast."

Austin writes that he was both delighted and disturbed by the ''Alternative 3'' controversy, and adds that the reasons "a clever hoax, openly admitted to be such by its creators, should continue to exercise the fascination it so obviously does the best part of a generation after its first appearance is beyond my feeble powers of analysis and explanation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/121_a3.shtml Fortean Times Magazine | Articles |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010123513/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/121_a3.shtml |date=2004-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed explanation of the hoax is featured in a study of [[conspiracy theory]] [[subculture]] and literature, ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America'' (2003), wherein Michael Barkun devotes a few pages to ''Alternative 3''.

Barkun writes that "''Alternative 3'' was clearly a [[hoax]] — and not only because it was intended for broadcast on [[April Fools' Day]]. The interviews with supposed [[scientist]]s, [[astronaut]]s, and others were far too dramatically polished to have been spontaneous, and in any case, the episode's closing credits named the actors who took the roles of interviewees and correspondents. Though artfully produced, the show's counterfeit [[documentary film|documentary]] style could scarcely have been expected to fool many. As an Anglia TV spokeseman put it, 'We felt viewers would be fairly sophisticated about it.'"

Barkun notes that television and newspapers were "swamped" with inquiries about ''Alternative 3'' and that Anglia Television's sale of the book rights to Leslie Watkins caused the tale to spread far beyond the United Kingdom.

==Books==
In 1978, Leslie Watkins wrote a science fiction book based on the screenplay for the television episode. Watkins had previously written a few moderately successful "[[suspense thriller]]" novels, and his ''Alternative 3'' novelization detailed many of the claims presented in the episode. It was published by Sphere Books Ltd, of Grays's Inn Road, [[London]]. In the book, many of the fictional characters were replaced with real people. For example, quotes from the fictional astronaut Bob Grodin were attributed to real life astronauts [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Edgar Mitchell]].

[[Jim Keith]]'s ''Casebook on Alternative 3: Ufo's, Secret Societies and World Control'' (Illuminet Pr) {{ISBN|0-9626534-9-7}}, argues that some elements of the 1977 broadcast were in fact true.

Ken Mitchell's novel, ''Alternative 3'' ([[HarperCollins]]) {{ISBN|0-7322-7703-5}} uses the Alternative 3 scenario as a background to a techno-thriller. [http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780732278557/Alternative_3/index.aspx]

On June 20, 2010, the 33rd anniversary of the original Anglia Television broadcast, an allegedly "unexpurgated" edition of the ''Alternative 3'' text was released as an eBook. [https://archive.org/details/Alternative3-33rdAnniversaryEdition]

==DVD release==
The film was released on DVD in October 2007, together with a 30-minute featurette with presenter Tim Brinton and writers David Ambrose and [[Christopher Miles]] who also directed ''Alternative 3''; a production stills gallery; and contemporary press cuttings presented in the form of slowly scrolling [[rostrum camera]] shots.

The film is taken from a 16mm print with optical sound. According to Miles in the featurette, this is his personal copy, and the only one to have survived.

==Influence==
Barkun notes that ''Alternative 3'' and the intermittent availability of Watkins' book "lent itself to conspiracist interpretations," and though ''Alternative 3'' did not mention [[UFOs]] or [[extraterrestrials]], many of the plans mentioned in ''Alternative 3'' have been featured in later assorted [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Barkun argues that ''Alternative 3'' was important in that its "role in the growth of conspiracy theory lay in a later permutation" related to [[UFOs]] and the [[UFO conspiracy theory]]. [[Milton William Cooper]], for one, featured similar tales in some of his writings.

An episode of ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' featured a plot very similar to the later ''Alternative 3'': On the 14 July 1950 episode "The Man In the Moon", an employee of the fictional [[United States]] "Bureau of Missing Persons" overhears a [[radio]] broadcast from a man who claims to be held prisoner on the [[Moon]]. The employee investigates, and uncovers the kidnapping of many persons, including scientists and engineers, who are then forced to toil on the Moon by [[Germany|German]] overseers, who had colonized the Moon in the late 1930s, and who are preparing an invasion and takeover of the Earth. In turn, the movie ''[[Iron Sky]]'' also tells the story of Nazi moon-bases and a planned Earth invasion.

The novel ''Sold for a Spaceship'' (1973) by [[Philip High]] is set in the aftermath of a global ecological catastrophe; a ruling elite who escaped into space attempt to return to Earth, but find that they are unable to survive, whereas those left behind have adapted.

Canadian rocker Ian Thomas' 1979 song "Pilot" clearly has links to the Alternative 3 mythos.

[[Liverpool]] [[doom metal]] band [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]]'s 1998 album ''[[Alternative 4 (album)|Alternative 4]]'' was also named after the programme.

[[Psychedelic rock]] band [[Monster Magnet]] have a song about the conspiracy, titled "Third Alternative" on their ''[[Dopes to Infinity]]'' album.

The novel ''[[Stark (novel)|Stark]]'' by [[Ben Elton]] features a conspiracy of the rich and powerful to escape a doomed Earth which is very similar to that depicted in ''Alternative 3''.

The song "Alternative Three" on the album ''Karma Had It Coming'' by [[Nova Scotia]] punk rock band, The Broomhandles takes inspiration from the program.

[[Costa Botes]] cited ''Alternative 3'' as one of the influences that inspired him to produce the New Zealand [[mockumentary]] '' [[Forgotten Silver]]'' with [[Peter Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/mock-doc/documents/paper2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

A character in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'', portrayed by Jerry Delony, claims that ''Alternative 3'' is "absolutely true" and that humans have been on Mars since 1962.

UK [[punk rock]] band [[UFX]] released a video using allegedly hoax footage from Alternative 3, the [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]] [[alien autopsy]] and footage of Nazi flying saucers to accompany the title track of their 2013 album Reverse Engineering.

The '''Battle of Grolle''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Slag om Grolle'') is a regular [[historical reenactment]] of the [[Siege of Groenlo (1627)|siege]] of the fortified border town of [[Groenlo]] (formerly known as ''Grol'' or ''Grolle'') in the [[Achterhoek]] in 1627 during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. It is held in and around Groenlo itself every two years. The event lasts for three days and features a historic battle reenactment and a historic fair, with reenactors from many [[Europe]]an countries. During the event, the reenactors try to relive the conditions of 1627 as faithfully as possible, without [[electricity]] or heating, while eating traditional food.

The event was held for the first time in 2005, with around 350 reenactors, among which were [[pikeman|pikemen]], [[swordsman|swordsmen]], around 100 [[musketeer]]s and working [[cannon]]s. In October 2008 the event was held for a second time, this time featuring more than 600 reenactors from [[France]], [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], the [[Czech Republic]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The 2008 event included [[cavalry]], 21 working cannons and more than 250 musketeers. The 'Grols Kanon', left behind as a gift to the people of Grol by [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederik Hendrik]] in 1627, was also used. The [[Montferland]] [[folk music]] group 'Het Gezelschap' even composed the song "Grol" as a theme song for the 2008 event.&lt;ref&gt;[[De Gelderlander]] 3-9-2008: [http://www.gelderlander.nl/voorpagina/achterhoek/3654191/Folkzangeres-schrijft-liedje-voor-De-Slag-om-Grol.ece Folkzangeres schrijft liedje voor 'De Slag om Grol']&lt;/ref&gt; In the streets of Groenlo itself a 17th-century atmosphere is recreated, with beggars, street rascals, [[leper]]s, musicians and [[artisan]]s. More than 30,000 people came to visit the 2008 event, and it was thus decided by the organizers to hold it every two years. The latest re-enactment is October 2017.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.slagomgrolle.nl/nl/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606213948/http://www.slagomgrolle.nl/nl/ |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}
In the '''Battle of Lake Huleh''' in June 1157, a Crusader army led by King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] was ambushed and badly defeated by [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], the emir of [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]]. While the king and some fighting men escaped to a nearby castle, a large number were killed or made prisoner. The Latin [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] escaped worse damage when their adversary became ill and was unable to follow up his victory. The [[Hula Valley]] is located in the northeast part of modern-day [[Israel]]. At the time of the battle, the area belonged to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. 

==Background==
In 1154, [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] achieved his goal of seizing [[Damascus]] and welding Syria into a Zengid empire. Instead of confronting a group of Muslim emirates and being able to play them off against one another, the Crusader states ([[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[County of Tripoli]] and [[Principality of Antioch]]) faced a unified threat to their existence. 

Each year, the Damascenes pastured large flocks in the area of [[Banias]] on the Franks' territory, whose permission they had secured. In February 1157, Baldwin unwisely attacked them, seizing the animals to pay his kingdom's debts. This act of aggression violated a truce. Infuriated, Nur ad-Din immediately began launching raids on the Franks in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenbourg, p 349&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Battle==
Nur ad-Din laid siege to the fortified town of Banias at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]]. In June, King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] assembled a Frankish army and marched to the relief of Banias and its [[Knights Hospitaller]] defenders. While Baldwin and his knights camped near [[Lake Hula|Lake Huleh]] in the upper [[Jordan River]] valley, they were surprised and defeated by forces under Nur ad-Din. The chronicler [[William of Tyre]] noted that "no watch was kept in the Latin camp."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 124&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[R. C. Smail]] writes that the setback was caused by Baldwin's "carelessness and lack of normal precaution when in the neighborhood of the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin and his surviving soldiers took refuge in the nearby castle at [[Safad]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1856, p. [https://archive.org/stream/laterbiblicalre01smitgoog#page/n481/mode/1up  426]&lt;/ref&gt; Losses were considerable. [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] wrote of many Crusader prisoners and severed heads being presented in a victorious celebration in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Oldenbourg, p 350&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beyond the heavy casualties suffered in the combat, few consequences attended the Christian defeat. Banias remained a Latin territory until 1164. Nur ad-Din fell ill soon after his victory, and in his absence, Baldwin mounted a campaign in northern Syria. The Franks failed in a siege of [[Shaizar]] but recovered the castle of Harim for the Principality of Antioch in the winter of 1157. This set the stage for Nur ad-Din's crushing victory over the Crusaders at the [[Battle of Harim]] in 1164. But the next conflict would be the [[Battle of al-Buqaia]] in 1163.

'''Bishop Mule Days''' is an annual festival celebrating the [[mule]], held in [[Bishop, California]] over a six-day period leading up to [[Memorial Day]]. More than 700 mules compete in 181 events and the largest non-motorized [[parade]] in the United States. It started as a small show in 1969 with a few hundred attendees and has grown to Bishop's largest event, attracting as many as 30,000 spectators.  Among mule shows, Bishop Mule Days has been described as "The Granddaddy of Them All".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Parade==

The annual Bishop Mule Days parade takes place on the Saturday morning before Memorial Day.  The parade route runs north on [[U.S. Route 395]] through downtown Bishop.  No motorized vehicles or floats are allowed; all entries must either be on foot, or use mules or horses.  The 2010 parade had 110 units, including 18 mule pack strings from commercial [[pack station]]s and government agencies including the [[United States Forest Service]], the [[National Park Service]] and the [[Mountain Warfare Training Center]] operated by the [[United States Marine Corps]].  Many historic mule-drawn and horse-drawn vehicles participate.  Although most parade units are from California, units from Idaho, Nevada, Iowa, Arizona, Oregon and Utah participated in 2010.

Grand marshalls of the parade in past years have included [[Ronald Reagan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =Ellis| first =Darcy| author-link =| last2 =| first2 =| author2-link =| title =Magazine nominates Mule Days for Western awards| newspaper =Inyo Register| pages =| date =November 23, 2007| url =http://www.inyoregister.com/content/view/69909/1/| accessdate =}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Norman Livermore]].

There were nearly 220 classes in 2010.

==The Pack Scramble==
The packing scramble is a competitive event unique to Bishop Mule Days.  Mule pack strings enter the arena, and are unloaded and untethered. Rodeo cowboys then stampede the herd, firing blank gunshots.  The event is described as a "wild and wooly spectacular" with "more than one hundred horses and mules running loose in the arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{Events leading to World War I}}

The '''Bosnian crisis''' of 1908–09, also known as the '''Annexation crisis''' or the '''First Balkan Crisis''', erupted in early October 1908 when [[Austria-Hungary]] announced the [[annexation]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], territories formerly within the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{cref|A}} This unilateral action—timed to coincide with [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|Bulgaria's declaration of independence]] (5 October) from the Ottoman Empire—sparked protestations from all the [[Great Powers]] and Austria-Hungary's Balkan neighbours, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. In April 1909 the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] was amended to reflect the ''fait accompli'' and bring the crisis to an end. The crisis permanently damaged relations between Austria-Hungary on one hand and Serbia, Italy and the [[Russian Empire]] on the other. It helped lay the grounds for [[World War I]]. Although the crisis ended with what appeared to be a total Austro-Hungarian diplomatic victory, Russia became determined not to back down again and hastened its military build-up. Austrian–Serbian relations became permanently stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard C. Hall|title=War in the Balkans: An Encyclopedic History from the Fall of the Ottoman Empire to the Breakup of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wy3TBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|date= 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=40–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Bosnia-Herzegovina and Sanjak of Novibazar.JPG|thumb|225px|left|Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]

The mid-1870s witnessed a series of violent rebellions against Ottoman rule in the Balkans, and equally violent and repressive responses from the Turks. The Russian Tsar, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], wanting to intervene against the Ottomans, sought and obtained an agreement with Austria-Hungary. In the [[Budapest Convention of 1877|Budapest Conventions of 1877]], the two powers agreed that Russia would annex [[Bessarabia]], and Austria-Hungary would observe a benevolent neutrality toward Russia in the pending war with the Turks. As compensation for this support, Russia agreed to Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albertini|first1=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914|date=2005|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York, NY|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the Russians declared war, and, after a few setbacks, drove the Turks relentlessly back to within a few miles of Constantinople. What stopped the Russians from driving the Turks completely out of Europe was the willingness of the other great powers, particularly Britain and Austria-Hungary, to enforce an earlier treaty, the [[London Straits Convention]] of 1841, which stated that the Straits of Constantinople would be closed to warships during time of war.  This had the effect of bottling up the Russian fleet in the [[Black Sea]], but would be worthless if Russian troops gained control of the straits by land.  After their victory in the war, the Russians then imposed the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on the Ottomans, which, in part, reneged on pledges made in the Budapest Convention and declared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be jointly occupied by Russian and Austrian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albertini|first1=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914|date=2005|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York, NY|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty of San Stefano was overturned by the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Under article 29, Austria-Hungary received special rights in the Ottoman Empire's provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].  Article 25 stated: "The provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be occupied and administered by Austria-Hungary", and continued "Austria-Hungary reserves the right to maintain garrisons and to have military and trading roads over the whole area of that portion [the Sanjak of Novi Pazar] of the ancient [[Vilayet of Bosnia]]."{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=22–23}}

The Sanjak of Novi Pazar separated Montenegro from Serbia and prevented the geographic and political union of these two states which were often closely aligned.  The Austrian occupation of the Sanjak was also significant because it provided Austria-Hungary with a staging area for possible future expansion towards the Aegean port of [[Salonika]] in Ottoman controlled Macedonia. The Bosnian population was already religiously divided among Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox Christians. Austria-Hungary exercised its rights, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|taking firm control of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and jointly occupying the Sanjak of Novi Pazar together with the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Berlin allowed for sole Austrian occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but did not specify a final disposition of the provinces.  This omission was addressed in the Three Emperors' League treaty of 1881, where both Germany and Russia endorsed Austria's right to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albertini|first1=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914|date=2005|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York, NY|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1897, under the new Tsar, Nicholas II, the Russian Imperial government had managed, again, to withdraw its support for Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian Foreign Minister, Count Michael Muraviev, stated that an Austrian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina would raise "an extensive question requiring special scrutiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albertini|first1=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914|date=2005|publisher=Enigma Books|location=New York, NY|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the King of Serbia was assassinated in [[May Coup (Serbia)|a coup]] and the pro-Russian [[Karađorđević]] dynasty came to the throne. Power shifted to elements widely interested in expansion into Bosnia.  These Serbs wanted to take over the Sanjak of Novi Pazar and Bosnia-Herzegovina from the Austro-Hungarians. Relations between Serbia and Austria-Hungary gradually deteriorated.  However, Russia's ability to support Serbia was greatly reduced following military humiliation in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War and the ensuing internal unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Francis Kenny|title=Monarchs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-W4CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT753|year=2016|page=753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By 1907, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Alois Aehrenthal]] began formulating a plan to solidify Austria-Hungary's position towards Serbia through annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. His opportunity came in the form of a letter from Russian Foreign Minister [[Alexander Izvolsky]] and a subsequent meeting at [[Buchlov|Buchlau castle]] in Moravia, Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Gooch, ''Before the war: studies in diplomacy'' (vol 1 1936)  pp 366-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buchlau Bargain==

===Exchange of letters===
On 2 July 1908, Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky sent a letter to Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Alois Aehrenthal and proposed a discussion of reciprocal changes to the 1878 Treaty of Berlin in favour of the Russian interest in the [[Bosporus|Straits of Constantinople]] and Austro-Hungarian interests in the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].  On 14 July Aehrenthal responded with guarded acceptance of the proposed discussions.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=195–96}} On 10 September, after long and complex discussions within the Imperial Government discussing the Izvolsky proposals to Austria-Hungary, Aehrenthal outlined a slightly different set of counter-proposals to him: he proposed that in exchange for a friendly Russian attitude when Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary would then withdraw its troops from the Sanjak. The letter then went on to offer to discuss, as a separate matter, the Straits question, on a friendly basis. Aehrenthal proposed that should agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina be reached, his Government would not – should the Russians subsequently propose to assert a right of their Black Sea fleet to both use and protect their access to the Mediterranean through the Bosporus – automatically decide with the other powers to support collectively the Ottoman Empire's opposition (up to and including war) to such a proposal.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=201–02}}

===Meeting at Buchlau===
[[File:Buchlovice schloss1.jpg|thumb|right|Buchlovice castle]] 
On 16 September, Izvolsky and Aehrenthal met face-to-face at [[Buchlovice Castle]]. No minutes were taken during these private meetings which lasted a total of six hours.  Izvolsky accepted the responsibility to write up the conclusions of the meeting and forward them to Aehrenthal. On 21 September, Aehrenthal wrote to Izvolsky asking for this document to which Izvolsky replied two days later that the document had been sent to the Czar for approval. This document, if it ever existed, has never been produced.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=207}}

===Aehrenthal’s version of the agreement===
By Aehrenthal's account given by Albertini, Izvolsky agreed that Russia would maintain "a friendly and benevolent attitude" if Austria-Hungary were to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. Reciprocally, should Russia move to open "the Straits to single ships of war", Austria-Hungary would maintain a benevolent attitude. The two agreed that a likely consequence of the annexation was that Bulgaria, which was ''de facto'' independent since 1878, would declare its formal independence from the Ottoman Empire. Austria-Hungary would offer no territorial concessions to Serbia or Montenegro, but if they supported the annexation then Austria-Hungary would not oppose Serbian expansion in the Balkans, and would support the Russian demand to revise Article 29 of the Treaty of Berlin which restricted Montenegrin sovereignty.  The parties agreed that "these changes could receive sanction after negotiation with the Porte and the Powers", but "there would be no more talk of Bosnia-Herzegovina."  Annexation would probably take place at the beginning of October.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=206–07}} The original of Aehrenthal's account has not been found and so historians have had to make do with an undated office copy of the document.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=208}}

===Izvolsky’s version===
On 30 September, Austria-Hungary informed Izvolsky, who was in Paris at the time, that the annexation would take place on 7 October. On 4 October, Izvolsky prepared a report at the request of the British Ambassador to France, [[Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame|Francis Bertie]]. Izvolsky stated that his position was that annexation was a matter to be settled between the signatories to the Treaty of Berlin. With the compensation of Austro-Hungarian withdrawal from the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, Russia would not consider the annexation as reason to go to war, but Russia and other governments would insist on changes to the Treaty favorable to themselves, including opening the Straits (Russia's interest), Bulgarian independence, territorial concessions to Serbia, and abolition of restrictions on Montenegrin sovereignty under article 29.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=207–08}} Bertie told British Foreign Minister Grey that he felt Izvolsky was not being completely honest about the context whereby these understandings had come to be reached through his "diplomacy."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Annexation==
[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the annexation, 1908.]]
On 6 October, the day after Bulgaria [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] from the Ottoman Empire, Emperor Franz Joseph announced to the people of this Ottoman territory (that had been occupied by Austria for 30 years) his determination to recognize and grant them an autonomous and constitutional regime, under his authority as their annexing sovereign.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=218–19}} The following day, Austria-Hungary announced its withdrawal from the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. Bulgarian independence and the Bosnian annexation were not covered by the Treaty of Berlin and set off a flurry of diplomatic protests and discussions.

==Protests and compensations==
Serbia mobilized its army and on 7 October the Serbian Crown Council demanded that the annexation be reversed or, failing that, Serbia should receive compensation, which it defined on 25 October as a strip of land across the northernmost portion of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=222–23}} In the end these demands were rejected.  Serbia  took control of the Sanjak after the Balkan wars.

===Ottoman Empire===
The Ottoman Empire protested Bulgaria's declaration of independence with more vigor than the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which it had no practical prospects of governing. A boycott of Austro-Hungarian goods and shops did occur, inflicting commercial losses of over 100,000,000 ''[[Austro-Hungarian krone|kronen]]'' on Austria-Hungary.  On 26 February, Austria-Hungary settled the matter in a treaty. Austria-Hungary agreed to pay the Ottomans 2.2&amp;nbsp;million [[Ottoman lira]] for the public land in Bosnia-Herzegovina.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=277}} Bulgarian independence could not be reversed.

===France, Britain, Russia and Italy===
[[File:Caricature Bosnia Annexion 1909 Ion Kalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ottoman caricature on the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the ironic title: "Advance of civilization in Bosnia and Herzegovina"]]
The annexation and Bulgarian declaration were viewed as violations of the Treaty of Berlin. France, Britain, Russia and Italy therefore were in favor of a conference to consider the matter. German opposition and complex diplomatic maneuvering as to the location, nature and preconditions of the conference delayed and ultimately scuttled it.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=225–85}} Instead, the Powers reached agreement on amendments to the Treaty through consultations between capitals.

Italy expected compensations in the areas of "[[Italian irredentism|Italia Irredenta]]" ruled by Austria-Hungary in exchange for its recognition of the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as was agreed upon in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] treaties with Austria-Hungary. However this did not happen and this became one of the reasons for Italy to break its alliance with Austria-Hungary in 1915.{{sfn|Albertini|2005}} The mutual compensation clause was  article 7 of the 1909 and of 5 December 1912 versions of the same treaty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, if, in the course of events, the maintenance of the status quo in the regions of the Balkans or of the Ottoman coasts and islands in the Adriatic and in the Aegean Sea should become impossible, and if, whether in consequence of the action of a third Power or otherwise, Austria-Hungary or Italy should find themselves under the necessity of modifying it by a temporary or permanent occupation on their part, this occupation shall take place only after a previous agreement between the two Powers, based upon the principle of a reciprocal compensation for every advantage, territorial or other, which each of them might obtain beyond the present status quo, and giving satisfaction to the interests and well founded claims of the two Parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Amended_Version_of_The_Triple_Alliance Amended Version of the Triple Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Russia and Serbia back down==
British opposition to amending the Treaty of Berlin with respect to the Straits left Russia empty-handed and therefore Izvolsky and the Czar regarded the annexation and Aehrenthal's maneuvers as made in bad faith.  Cognizant of Aehrenthal's rumored Jewish heritage, Izvolsky exploded, remarking "The dirty Jew has deceived me. He lied to me, he bamboozled me, that frightful Jew."{{sfn|Joll|Martel|2007|p=69}} To bring Izvolsky to heel, Austria-Hungary threatened to release and then ultimately began leaking documents, in which, over the course of the previous 30 years, Russia had agreed that Austria-Hungary had a free hand to do as it liked with Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.  These documents were an embarrassment to Russia, especially with regard to its relations with Serbia.  Czar Nicholas II wrote to Emperor Franz-Joseph and accused Austria-Hungary of betraying a confidence and relations between the two countries were permanently damaged.  Under Germany's advice, Austria-Hungary kept in confidence the 2 July and 23 September correspondence from Izvolsky to Aehrenthal and these were a continued threat to Izvolsky's position if Russia did not firmly and publicly accept amendment of Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin to accept the annexation.  On 22 March, Germany put Russia on the spot, demanding that Russia give a clear and unequivocal "yes" or "no" as to whether it committed to accept this amendment.  Failure to give a positive reply would cause Germany to withdraw from the diplomatic discussions "and let things take their course".{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=285–86}} Under such pressure, Izvolsky caved and advised the cabinet to accept the amendment of Article 25 for fear that otherwise Austria would be free to act against Serbia.  The cabinet agreed.  On 23 March the Czar accepted the decision and communicated the decision to German Ambassador to Russia Portales.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=287}} Britain however was not quite ready to acquiesce and stated that it would do so only once "the [[Serbian question]] had been settled in a pacific manner."  France fell in line behind Britain.

On 26 March, Austria-Hungary provided Britain with the negotiated text of Serbia's March declaration committing Serbia to accept the annexation.  It ran:
{{quote|Serbia recognizes that she has not been injured in her right by the ''fait accompli'' created in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that consequently she will conform to such decision as the Powers shall take in regard to Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin. Submitting to the advice of the Great Powers, Serbia undertakes already now to abandon the attitude of protest and opposition which she has maintained in regard to the annexation since last autumn and undertakes further to change the course of her present policy towards Austria-Hungary to live henceforward with the latter on a footing of good-neighbourliness. Conformable to these declarations and confident of the pacific intentions of Austria-Hungary, Serbia will reduce her army to the position of spring 1908 as regards its organization, its distribution and its effectives. She will disarm and disband her volunteers and bands and will prevent the formation of new units of irregulars on its territories.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=291–92}}}}

The next day Austria-Hungary asked for Britain's firm assurance that once the negotiations with Serbia were complete, Britain would accept the amendment of Article 25.  Without such assurance Austria-Hungary stated it would break off negotiations with Serbia.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=289}} Later that day Austria-Hungary decided to partially mobilize its armed forces. On 28 March Britain committed as requested.  On 31 March Serbia made its formal declaration of acceptance to Austria-Hungary representing a complete Serbian climb down. The crisis was over.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|pp=291–92}} The Great Powers signed the amendments to the Treaty of Berlin in the various capitals from 7 April to 19 April.

A little over a year later, as a result of this diplomatic defeat, Izvolsky was demoted and made ambassador to France.  He was permanently embittered against Aehrenthal and the Central Powers.{{sfn|Goldberg|1968|p=430}} The Russian Diplomat and newspaperman de Schelking relates Izvolsky's political downfall:  "In the Salons of Petrograd he was given the Sobriquet 'Prince of the Bosphorus'. In his conceit, Izvolsky could not see he was being mocked."{{sfn|Shelḱīng|Makovskī|1918|p=183}}

The '''Bribery Act 2010''' (c.23) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that covers the criminal law relating to [[bribery]]. Introduced to Parliament in the [[Queen's Speech]] in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to bribery, instead replacing them with the crimes of bribery, being bribed, the bribery of foreign public officials, and the failure of a commercial organisation to prevent bribery on its behalf.

The penalties for committing a crime under the Act are a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment, along with an unlimited fine, and the potential for the confiscation of property under the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]], as well as the disqualification of directors under the [[Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986]]. The Act has a near-universal jurisdiction, allowing for the prosecution of an individual or company with links to the United Kingdom, regardless of where the crime occurred. Described as "the toughest [[anti-corruption]] legislation in the world",&lt;ref name=bres362/&gt; concerns have been raised that the Act's provisions criminalise behaviour that is acceptable in the global market, and puts British business at a competitive disadvantage.

==Background==
Prior to the Act, British anti-bribery law was based on the [[Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889]], the [[Prevention of Corruption Act 1906]] and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916, a body of law described as "inconsistent, anachronistic and inadequate".&lt;ref&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Poulson affair]] in 1972, the Salmon Committee on Standards in Public Life recommended updating and codifying these statutes, but the government of the time took no action. Similar suggestions were brought up in the first report of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] established by [[John Major]] in 1994, and the [[Home Office]] published a draft consultation paper in 1997, discussing extending anti-bribery and anti-corruption law.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh (2011) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]]'s report ''Legislating the Criminal Code: Corruption'' in 1998.&lt;ref name=sul87&gt;Sullivan (2010) p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation paper and report coincided with mounting criticism from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], who felt that, despite the United Kingdom's ratification of the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]], its bribery laws were inadequate.&lt;ref name=anw125&gt;Anwar (2010) p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft Bribery Bill was announced in the 2002 [[Queen's Speech]], but was rejected by the [[joint committee]] examining it. A second consultation paper was issued in 2005 examining the committee's concerns, before the government announced in March that "there was broad support for reform of the current law, but there was no consensus as to how this could be achieved".&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh (2011) p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[white paper]] in March 2009, the Bribery Bill, based on the Law Commission's 2008 report ''Reforming Bribery'',&lt;ref&gt;Editor (2010) p.439&lt;/ref&gt; was announced in the Queen's Speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/18/queens-speech-bribery-bill|title=Queen's speech 2009: bribery bill|last=Wearden|first=Graeme|date=18 November 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially given all-party support after its introduction by [[Jack Straw]] in 2009, the Bill was, according to ''[[The Guardian]]'', subject to an attempted [[filibuster]] by [[Members of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]] from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. This followed pressure from the [[Confederation of British Industry]], who worried that the Bill in its original form would hamper the competitiveness of British industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/05/cbi-conservatives-dilute-bribery-bill|title=Conservatives attempt to water down bribery bill under CBI pressure|last=Macalister|first=Terry|date=5 April 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 February 2011|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was given [[Royal Assent]] on 8 April 2010, becoming the Bribery Act 2010, and was expected to come into force immediately. The government instead chose to hold several rounds of public consultations before announcing that it would come into force in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/jul/23/bribery-act-law-bae|title=Government delays Bribery Act – again|last=Butterworth|first=Siobhain|date=23 July 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 February 2011|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of guidance by the Ministry of Justice, the act came into effect on 1 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bribery Act 2010: Quick Start Guide |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bribery-act-2010-quick-start-guide.pdf |work=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Justice also released a Quick Start Guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bribery Act 2010: Quick Start Guide |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bribery-act-2010-quick-start-guide.pdf |work=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which highlights some key points of the Act. The Quick Start Guide also suggests companies to consult relevant bodies for advice, including the UK Trade and Investment, and the government sponsored [[Business-Anti-Corruption Portal|Business Anti-Corruption Portal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bribery Act 2010: Quick Start Guide |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bribery-act-2010-quick-start-guide.pdf |work=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011 [[Munir Patel]], a clerk at Redbridge Magistrates Court, became the first person to be convicted under the Bribery Act, along with misconduct in a public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/opinion-first-conviction-proves-bribery-act-has-sharp-teeth/1010398.article/| title=Opinion: First conviction proves Bribery Act has sharp teeth| author=Eoin O’Shea| date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Act==
===General bribery offences===
Sections 1 to 5 of the Act cover "general bribery offences". The crime of bribery is described in Section 1 as occurring when a person offers, gives or promises to give a "financial or other advantage" to another individual in exchange for "improperly" performing a "relevant function or activity". Section 2 covers the offence of being bribed, which is defined as requesting, accepting or agreeing to accept such an advantage, in exchange for improperly performing such a function or activity. "Financial or other advantage" is not defined in the Act, but, according to Aisha Anwar and Gavin Deeprose in the ''[[Scots Law Times]]'', "could potentially encompass items such as contracts, non-monetary gifts and offers of employment".&lt;ref name=anw125/&gt; The "relevant function or activity" element is explained in Section 3&amp;mdash;it covers "any function of a public nature; any activity connected with a business, trade or profession; any activity performed in the course of a person's employment; or any activity performed by or on behalf of a body of persons whether corporate or unincorporated". This applies to both private and public industry, and encompasses activities performed outside the UK, even activities with no link to the country.&lt;ref name=anw126&gt;Anwar (2010) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions attached are that the person performing the function could be expected to be performing it in good faith or with impartiality, or that an element of trust attaches to that person's role.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 4, the activity will be considered to be "improperly" performed when the expectation of good faith or impartiality has been breached, or when the function has been performed in a way not expected of a person in a position of trust. Section 5 provides that the standard in deciding what would be expected is what a reasonable person in the UK might expect of a person in such a position. Where the breach has occurred in a jurisdiction outside the UK, local practises or customs should be disregarded when deciding this, unless they form part of the "written law" of the jurisdiction; "written law" is given to mean any constitution, statute or judicial opinion set down in writing.&lt;ref name=anw126/&gt; The general offences also cover situations where the mere acceptance of such an advantage would constitute improperly performing relevant functions or activities.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh (2011) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery of foreign public officials===
Bribery of foreign public officials is a distinct crime under Section 6, in line with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh (2011) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; A person will be guilty of this offence if they promise, offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as " an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a public function for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of "through a third party" is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid committing a crime, although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed.&lt;ref name=anw127&gt;Anwar (2010) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with general bribery offences, there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery===
Section 7 creates the "broad and innovatory offence" of the failure of commercial organisations to prevent bribery on their behalf. This applies to all commercial organisations which have business in the UK. Unlike [[corporate manslaughter]], this does not only apply to the organisation itself; individuals and employees may also be found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (2010) p.92&lt;/ref&gt; The offence is one of [[strict liability]], with no need to prove any kind of intention or positive action.&lt;ref&gt;Breslin (2010) p.363&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of [[vicarious liability]]; a commercial organisation can be guilty of the offence if the bribery is carried out by an employee, an agent, a subsidiary, or another third-party, as found in Section 8. The location of the third-party is irrelevant to the prosecution— according to David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins in the ''Archbold Review'', "therefore, a German business with retail outlets in the UK which pays a bribe in Spain could, in theory at least, face prosecution in the UK". Under Section 7(2), the commercial organisation has a defence if it can show that, while bribery did take place, the commercial organisation had in place "adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with [the organisation] from undertaking such conduct". Under the Act's explanatory notes, the burden of proof in this situation is on the organisation, with the standard of proof being "on the [[balance of probabilities]]".&lt;ref name=aar&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guidance was published by the Secretary of State three months before the Act came into force. The Guidance sets out 6 principles to be followed by business. They cover such topics as Proportionate Procedures, Top-level Commitment, Risk Assessment, Due Diligence, Communication (including training) and Monitoring &amp; Review.  The one firm conclusion to be drawn from the Guidance is that every commercial organisation that might be subject to the rigours of the Act needs to have a code of conduct in place that appropriately reflects the Guidance and to ensure its personnel are fully conversant with the risks and adequately trained.  If it is then charged with the offence of failing to prevent bribery, it would be able to show evidence of the ‘adequate procedures’ which it will need in order to defend itself.

===Prosecution and penalties===
Section 10 requires the authorisation of any prosecution by the director of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a [[summary offence]], they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on [[Indictable offence|indictment]], however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine.&lt;ref&gt;Pope (2010) p.482&lt;/ref&gt; The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the [[Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]], while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the [[Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986]].&lt;ref name=anw128&gt;Anwar (2010) p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other provisions===
The scope of the Act's provisions is set out in Section 12. For someone to fall within the Act's purview, they must have either committed a crime inside the United Kingdom, or acted outside of the United Kingdom in a way which would have constituted a crime had it happened in the UK. For a prosecution in the latter case, the person must have a "close connection" to the UK, which includes being a British citizen, resident or protected person, a company incorporated in the UK, or a Scottish partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Pope (2010) p.481&lt;/ref&gt; Section 13 provides the only defence available with the general bribery offences—that the conduct was necessary for the proper functioning of the intelligence services or, when engaged in active service, the armed forces.&lt;ref name=anw127/&gt; Under Section 14, senior officers or directors in a company which commits a general bribery offence will also be liable for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan (2010) p.99&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of an offence committed by a partnership, Section 15 provides that the prosecution must be brought in the name of the partnership and not in the name of any of the partners.&lt;ref&gt;Pope (2010) p.480&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 16, the Act applies to [[crown servant|servants of the crown]],&lt;ref name=aar/&gt; while Section 17 repeals all previous common law and statutory offences relating to bribery, replacing them with provisions of the Act.&lt;ref name=sul87/&gt; Section 18 provides that the Act applies to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; while the separate consent of the [[Scottish Parliament]] is usually required in such cases, as is made clear in Section 19, a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] was passed on 11 February 2010, allowing for the application of the Act within Scotland.&lt;ref name=aar/&gt;

==Assessment==
The Act has been described as "the toughest anti-corruption legislation in the world", raising the bar above the standard set by the United States [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].&lt;ref name=bres362&gt;Breslin (2010) p.362&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being "widely drafted and far-reaching in scope [and] in many ways an improvement upon earlier corruption legislation", significant concerns have been raised, mainly around the fact that the Act may harm British industry's competitiveness in the global market. David Aaronberg and Nichola Higgins, writing in the ''Archbold Review'', argue that section 6 particularly has the potential to include actions which are ethically problematic but seen as legally permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Aaronberg (2010) p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Aisha Anwar and Gavin Deeprose in the ''[[Scots Law Times]]'' take a similar line, highlighting as particularly problematic areas corporate hospitality and facilitation payments, described as "essentially a form of extortion on the payer and, although not a common feature in the UK, they are commonplace in many international jurisdictions", which may fall under the scope of the Act despite being permissible in the commercial world.&lt;ref name=anw128/&gt;

==Parliamentary committee==
In May 2018, the House of Lords appointed a [[Lords Select Committee|select committee]] to report on the Act. The current membership is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bribery Act 2010 Committee|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/bribery-act-2010/|website=UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lead too short|date=June 2018}}[[File:C19 interior 053.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Committee room, designed 1901, in [[Halifax Town Hall]]]]
A '''committee''' (or "commission") is a body of one or more persons that is subordinate to a [[deliberative assembly]]. Usually, the assembly sends matters into a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the assembly itself were considering them. Committees may have different functions and their type of work differ depending on the type of the organization and its needs.

==Purpose==
A [[deliberative assembly]] may form a committee (or "commission") consisting of one or more persons to assist with the work of the assembly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 489|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For larger organizations, much work is done in committees.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committees can be a way to formally draw together people of relevant expertise from different parts of an organization who otherwise would not have a good way to share information and coordinate actions. They may have the advantage of widening viewpoints and sharing out responsibilities. They can also be appointed with experts to recommend actions in matters that require specialized knowledge or technical judgment.

=== Functions ===
Committees can serve several different functions:
;Governance:  In organizations considered too large for all the members to participate in decisions affecting the organization as a whole, a smaller body, such as a [[board of directors]], is given the power to make decisions, spend money, or take actions. A ''governance committee'' is formed as a separate committee to review the performance of the board and board policy as well as nominate candidates for the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.guidestar.org/Articles.aspx?path=/rxa/news/articles/2012/need-to-improve-a-governance-committee.aspx|title = So You Need (to Improve) a Governance Committee?|date = April 2012|accessdate = 2015-12-17|website = guidestar.org|publisher = [[GuideStar]]|last = Walker|first = Dick|last2 = Bauser|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; {{Anchor|Coordination committee|Coordination subcommittee}} Coordination and administration: A large body may have smaller committees with more specialized functions. Examples are an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, and a program committee. Large [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] or [[academic conference]]s are usually organized by a coordinating committee drawn from the membership of the organization.
; {{Anchor|Research committee|Research subcommittee}} Research and recommendations: Committees may be formed to do research and make recommendations on a potential or planned project or change.  For example, an organization considering a major [[capital investment]] might create a temporary working committee of several people to review options and make recommendations to upper management or the board of directors.
;Discipline:{{Anchor|Disciplinary committee|Research subcommittee}}A committee on discipline may be used to handle disciplinary procedures on members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;As a tactic for indecision: As a means of [[public relations]] by sending sensitive, inconvenient, or irrelevant matters to committees, organizations may bypass, stall, or disacknowledge matters without declaring a formal policy of inaction or indifference. However, this could be considered a [[Dilatory motions and tactics|dilatory tactic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power and authority ===
Generally, committees are required to report to their parent body. Committees do not usually have the power to act independently unless the body that created it gives it such power.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Procedures==
When a committee is formed, a [[chairman]] (or "chair" or "chairperson") is designated for the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a vice-chairman (or similar name) is also appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for the committee chairman to organize its meetings. Sometimes these meetings are held through [[videoconferencing]] or other means if committee members are not able to attend in person, as may be the case if they are in different parts of the country or the world.

The chairman is responsible for running meetings. Duties include keeping the discussion on the appropriate subject, recognizing members to speak, and confirming what the committee has decided (through voting or by [[unanimous consent]]). Using ''[[Roberts Rules of Order|Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' (RONR), committees may follow informal procedures (such as not requiring [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] if it's clear what is being discussed).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|page = 162|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|ref = harv|display-authors = etal|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811000000/http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|archivedate = 2017-08-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of formality depends on the size and type of committee, in which sometimes larger committees considering crucial issues may require more formal processes.

[[Minutes]] are a record of the decisions at meetings. They can be taken by a person designated as the [[secretary]]. For most organizations, committees are not required to keep formal minutes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, some bodies require that committees take minutes, especially if the committees are public ones subject to [[Freedom of information laws by country|open meeting laws]].

Committees may meet on a regular basis, such as weekly or more often, or meetings may be called irregularly as the need arises. The frequency of the meetings depend on the work of the committee and the needs of the parent body.

When the committee completes its work, it provides the results in a report to its parent body. The report may include the methods used, the facts uncovered, the conclusions reached, and any recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the committee is not ready to report, it may provide a partial report or the assembly may discharge the committee of the matter so that the assembly can handle it. Also, if members of the committee are not performing their duties, they may be removed or replaced by the appointing power.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the committee continues to exist after presenting its report depends on the type of committee. Generally, committees established by the [[bylaws]] or the organization's rules continue to exist, while committees formed for a particular purpose go out of existence after the final report.

=== Commit (motion) ===
{{infobox motion
| name = Commit (RONR)
| class = S
| inorder = No
| seconded = Yes
| debatable = Yes, although debate on the motion must be confined to its merits only, and cannot go into the main question except as necessary for debate of the immediately pending question.
| amendable = Yes
| voterequired = Majority
| reconsidered = Yes, if committee has not begun consideration of the question. A negative vote on this motion can be reconsidered only until such time as progress in business or debate has made it essentially a new question.
}}
In [[parliamentary procedure]], the motion to '''commit''' (or '''refer''') is used to refer another motion—usually a main motion—to a committee.

A motion to commit should specify to which committee the matter is to be referred, and if the committee is a special committee appointed specifically for purposes of the referred motion, it should also specify the number of committee members and the method of their selection, unless that is specified in the bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any proposed amendments to the main motion that are pending at the time the motion is referred to a committee go to the committee as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Once referred, but before the committee reports its recommendations back to the assembly, the referred motion may be removed from the committee's consideration by the motion to discharge a committee.

=== Recommit ===
In the [[United States House of Representatives]], a motion to recommit can be made with or without instructions.  If the motion is made without instructions, the bill or resolution is simply sent back to the committee. If the motion is made with instructions and the motion is agreed to, the chairman of the committee in question will immediately report the bill or resolution back to the whole House with the new language.  In this sense, a motion to recommit with instructions is effectively an amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=Megan S.|title=The Motion to Recommit in the House of Representatives|date=January 6, 2016|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44330.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variations for full assembly consideration ===
In ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'' (RONR), the motion to commit has three variations which do not turn a question over to a smaller group, but simply permit the assembly's full meeting body to consider it with the greater freedom of debate that is allowed to committees. These forms are to go into a [[committee of the whole]], to go into a quasi committee of the whole, and to consider informally. Passing any of these motions removes the limitations on the number of times a member can speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'' has informal consideration, but does not have "committee of the whole" and "quasi committee of the whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title=TSC |pages=232, 233, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discharge a committee ===
{{infobox motion
 | name = Discharge a committee (RONR)
 | class = B
 | inorder = No
 | seconded = Yes
 | debatable = Yes; debate can go into question in hands of the committee
 | amendable = Yes
 | reconsidered = Negative vote only
 }}In ''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', the motion to '''discharge a committee''' is used to take a matter out of a committee's hands before the committee has made a final report on it. A committee can use this motion to discharge a subcommittee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote required is a [[majority vote]] if the committee has failed to report at the prescribed time or if the assembly is considering a partial report of the committee.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, it requires a majority vote with [[previous notice]]; or a [[two-thirds vote]]; or a [[majority of the entire membership]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Under ''The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', the assembly that has referred a motion or a matter to a committee may, by a majority vote, withdraw it at any time from the committee, refer it to another committee, or decide the question itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title=TSC |pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
=== Executive committee ===
Organizations with a large board of directors (such as international [[labor union]]s, large corporations with thousands of stock holders or national and international organizations) may have a smaller body of the board, called an ''executive committee'', handle its business. The executive committee may function more like a board than an actual committee.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert III|2011|p = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, an executive committee can only be established through a specific provision in the charter or [[bylaws]] of the entity (i.e. a board cannot appoint an executive committee without authorization to do so).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Members of the executive committee may be elected by the overall [[Suffrage|franchised]] membership or by the board, depending on the rules of the organization. However formed, an executive committee only has such powers and authority that the governing documents of the organization give it. In some cases, it may be empowered to act on behalf of the board or organization, while in others, it may only be able to make recommendations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Conference committee===
Governments at the national level may have a ''conference committee''. A conference committee in a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] is responsible for creating a compromise version of a particular [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] when each house has passed a different version.

[[United States congressional conference committee|A conference committee in the United States Congress]] is a temporary panel of negotiators from the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Unless one chamber decides to accept the other's original bill, the compromise version must pass both chambers after leaving the conference committee. The committee is usually composed of the senior members of the standing committees that originally considered the legislation in each chamber.

Other countries that use conference committees include France, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bicameralism|last = Tsebelis|first = George|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1997|isbn = 9780521589727|location = Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages = 178–179|last2 = Money|first2 = Jeannette|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eL_eT6JMTzIC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, conference committees have been unused since 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1297&amp;param=190|title = Reviving Conference Committees|date = Autumn 2008|accessdate = 2015-12-21|website = revparl.ca|publisher = [[Canadian Parliamentary Review]]|last = Hays|first = Hon. Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Different use of term ====
In organizations, the term "conference committee" may have a different meaning. This meaning may be associated with the conferences, or [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], that the organization puts together. The committees that are responsible for organizing such events may be called "conference committees".

===Standing committee===
A ''standing committee'' is a subunit of a political or deliberative body established in a permanent fashion to aid the parent assembly in accomplishing its duties.  A standing committee is granted its scope and powers over a particular area of business by the governing documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing committees meet on a regular or irregular basis depending on their function, and retain any power or oversight originally given them until subsequent official actions of the governing body (through changes to law or by-laws) disbands the committee.

==== Legislatures ====&lt;!-- merged in from very short [[standing committee]] stub --&gt;
Most governmental legislative committees are standing committees. The phrase is used in the [[legislature]]s of the following countries:
* [[Australia]]
** [[Australian House of Representatives committees]]
** [[Australian Senate committees]]
* [[Canada]]
** [[List of committees of the Canadian House of Commons]]
** [[Standing committee (Canada)]]
* [[China]]
** [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]
* [[Iceland]]
** [[List of standing committees of the Icelandic parliament]]
* [[India]]
** [[Standing committee (India)]]
* [[Malaysia]]
** [[Dewan Rakyat committees]]
** [[Dewan Negara committees]]
* [[United Kingdom]]
** [[Public bill committee]]
* [[United States]]
** [[Standing committee (United States Congress)]]
Under the laws of the United States of America, a standing committee is a [[Congressional committee]] permanently authorized by [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] rules. The [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]] greatly reduced the number of committees, and set up the legislative committee structure still in use today, as modified by authorized changes via the orderly mechanism of rules changes.

==== Examples in organizations ====
Examples of standing committees in organizations are an audit committee, an elections committee, a finance committee, a fundraising committee, a governance committee, and a program committee. Typically, the standing committees perform their work throughout the year and present their reports at an [[Annual general meeting|annual meeting]] of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 502}}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees continue to exist after presenting their reports, although the membership in the committees may change.

=== Nominating committee ===
A ''nominating committee'' (or [[nomination]]s committee) is a group formed for the purpose of nominating candidates for office or the board in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 433}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may consist of members from inside the organization. Sometimes a governance committee takes the role of a nominating committee. Depending on the organization, this committee may be empowered to actively seek out candidates or may only have the power to receive nominations from members and verify that the candidates are eligible.

A nominating committee works similarly to an [[electoral college]], the main difference being that the available candidates, either nominated or "written in" outside of the committee's choices, are then voted into office by the membership. It is a part of governance methods often employed by corporate bodies, business entities, and social and sporting groups, especially clubs. The intention is that they be made up of qualified and knowledgeable people representing the best interests of the membership. In the case of business entities, their directors will often be brought in from outside, and receive a benefit for their expertise.

In the context of nominations for awards, a nominating committee can also be formed for the purpose of nominating persons or things held up for judgment by others as to their comparative quality or value, especially for the purpose of bestowing awards in the arts, or in application to industry's products and services. The objective being to update, set, and maintain high and possibly new standards.

=== Steering committee ===
A ''steering committee'' is a committee that provides guidance, direction and control to a project within an organization.&lt;ref name="Mcleod2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mcleod|title=Management Information Systems | edition = 10 | year = 2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-81-317-1949-7|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from the [[steering]] mechanism that changes the steering angle of a vehicle's wheels.

Project steering committees are frequently used for guiding and monitoring [[information technology|IT]] projects in large organizations, as part of [[project governance]]. The functions of the committee might include building a business case for the project, planning, providing assistance and guidance, monitoring the progress, controlling the project scope and resolving conflicts.

As with other committees, the specific duties and role of the steering committee vary among organizations.

=== Special committee ===
{{See also|Select committee}}{{Anchor|Special committee|Ad hoc committee|Select committee|Working committee}}A ''special committee'' (or working, select, or [[ad hoc]] committee) is established to accomplish a particular task or to oversee a specific area in need of control or oversight.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are research or coordination committees in type or purpose, and are temporary. Some are a sub-group of a larger society with a particular area of interest which are organized to meet and discuss matters pertaining to their interests. For example, a group of astronomers might be organized to discuss how to get the larger society to address [[near earth object]]s. A subgroup of engineers and scientists of a large project's development team could be organized to solve some particular issue with offsetting considerations and trade-offs. Once the committee makes its final report to its parent body, the special committee ceases to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Subcommittee===
A committee that is a [[subset]] of a larger committee is called a ''subcommittee''. Committees that have a large workload may form subcommittees to further divide the work. Subcommittees report to the parent committee and not to the general assembly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee of the whole===
{{main|Committee of the whole}}
When the entire assembly meets as a committee to discuss or debate, this is called a "[[committee of the whole]]". This is not an actual committee but a procedural device that is more commonly used in legislative bodies.

=== Central Committee ===
{{Main|Central Committee}}

'''[[Central Committee]]''' was the common designation of a standing administrative body of [[Communist party|communist parties]], analogous to a [[board of directors]], whether ruling or non-ruling in the [[20th century]] and of surviving communist states in the [[21st century]]. In such party organizations the committee would typically be made up of delegates elected at a [[party congress]]. In those [[communist state|states]] where it constituted the state power, the Central Committee made decisions for the party between congresses, and usually was (at least nominally) responsible for electing the [[Politburo]]. In non-ruling Communist parties, the Central Committee is usually understood by the party membership to be the ultimate decision-making [[authority]] between Congresses once the process of [[democratic centralism]] has led to an agreed-upon position

'''Concert Artist/Fidelio Recordings''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[classical music]] [[record label]], situated in [[Royston, Hertfordshire]], England, and owned and operated by [[William Barrington-Coupe]]. It is best known for selling unauthorized copies of commercial recordings by other artists as the work of pianists [[Sergio Fiorentino]] and Barrington-Coupe's late wife, [[Joyce Hatto]]. Barrington-Coupe's long history in the music world includes time with [[Saga Films and Records]] and pop record producer [[Joe Meek]]. The company issued recordings from 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-news |work=Billboard |title=Pre-Recorded IPR Hi-Fi Tape at LP Prices |date=26 February 1955 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA28 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007.

==Fraudulent recordings==
The Concert Artist label received increased attention in its last years as it released over 100 CDs of highly acclaimed piano recordings attributed to [[Joyce Hatto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Musicweb International | title=Joyce Hatto: The Recordings | date= January 2006 | url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2006/Jan06/Hatto2_recordings.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=The Guardian | title=Joyce Hatto | date= 10 July 2006 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jul/10/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a great deal of speculation, discussion and allegations, on 26 February 2007 Barrington-Coupe admitted fraud and plagiarism regarding his recently deceased wife's recent recordings.&lt;ref name="admission"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joyce Hatto#Fraud|Joyce Hatto CDs]] released by Concert Artist are in fact plagiarised commercial recordings by other pianists on different labels. Some light editing and processing had been made to the Concert Artist releases in an effort to disguise the original recording's source.

Some of the Concert Artist recordings attributed to Sergio Fiorentino have also been positively identified as previously released commercial recordings by other pianists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=CHARM: Department of Music, Royal Holloway | title=Fiorentino Fakes: Continuing Saga of Concert Artist Recordings | url=http://mazurka.org.uk/fiorentino/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concert Artist release of [[Chopin]]'s Mazurkas attributed to [[Alfred Cortot]] has been the subject of continuing debate since before the "Hatto hoax".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27875">By 1965, '''[[Bob Dylan]]''' was the leading songwriter of the [[American folk music revival]].&lt;ref group=a&gt;[[Paul Simon]] suggested that Dylan's early compositions virtually took over the folk genre: "[Dylan's] early songs were very rich&amp;nbsp;... with strong melodies. '[[Blowin' in the Wind]]' has a really strong melody. He so enlarged himself through the folk background that he incorporated it for a while. He defined the genre for a while." quoted in {{harvnb|Fong-Torres|1973|p=424}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to his albums ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' and ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' led the media to label him the "spokesman of a generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1981|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1965, Dylan released his fifth album, ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''. Side one features Dylan backed by an electric band; side two features Dylan accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. On July 20, 1965, Dylan released his single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", featuring a [[Rock music|rock sound]]. On July 25, 1965, Dylan performed his first electric concert at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], joined by guitarist Mike Bloomfield and Barry Goldberg of the [[Paul Butterfield#Butterfield Blues Band with Bloomfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]. Some sections of the audience booed Dylan's performance, leading  members of the folk movement, including [[Irwin Silber]]&lt;ref group="a"&gt;In 1964, [[Irwin Silber]], the editor of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', had published an "Open Letter to Bob Dylan", criticizing Dylan for stepping away from political songwriting: "I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people. Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way." ''Sing Out!'', November 1964, quoted in {{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ewan MacColl]],&lt;ref group="a"&gt;In the September 1965 issue of ''[[Sing Out!]]'', singer [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time... 'But what of Bobby Dylan?' scream the outraged teenagers... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel." Quoted in {{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; to criticize Dylan for moving away from political songwriting and for performing with an electric band instead.

==Newport 1965 set==
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963-2.jpg|thumb|right|Fans were used to seeing Dylan perform alone, with [[acoustic guitar]] and [[harmonica]] (1963)]]
At the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan had been received enthusiastically when he performed "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" with [[Joan Baez]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and other Festival performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed "[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]" and "[[Mr Tambourine Man]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive reviews of Dylan's 1964 performance were accompanied by criticisms of Dylan's antics and dismissive nature;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=John|title=Invisible Now: Bob Dylan in the 1960s|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; one critic wrote that "being stoned had rarely prevented his giving winning performances, but he was clearly out of control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shelton|first1=Robert|title=No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan|publisher=Backbeat Books|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, July 24, 1965, Dylan performed three acoustic songs, "[[All I Really Want to Do]]", "[[If You Gotta Go, Go Now]]", and "[[Love Minus Zero/No Limit]]", at a Newport workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan's performances were filmed by Murray Lerner and included in the DVD ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (film)|The Other Side of the Mirror]].''&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jonathan Taplin]], a roadie at Newport (and later a road manager for the acts of Dylan's manager [[Albert Grossman]]), Dylan made a spontaneous decision on the Saturday that he would challenge the Festival by performing with a fully amplified band. Taplin said that Dylan had been irritated by what he considered condescending remarks which festival organiser [[Alan Lomax]] had made about the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]] when Lomax introduced them for an earlier set at a festival workshop. Dylan's attitude, according to Taplin, was, "Well, f*** them if they think they can keep electricity out of here, I'll do it. On a whim, he said he wanted to play electric."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan assembled a band and rehearsed that night at a mansion being used by festival organizer [[George Wein]].

On the night of Sunday, July 25, Dylan's appearance was between [[Cousin Emmy]] and the [[Georgia Sea Island Singers|Sea Island singers]], two traditional acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's band included two musicians who had played on his recently released single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]": [[Mike Bloomfield]] on lead guitar and [[Al Kooper]] on [[Electronic organ|organ]]. Two of Bloomfield's bandmates from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[Jerome Arnold]] and [[drum kit|drummer]] [[Sam Lay]], also appeared at Newport, as well as [[Barry Goldberg]] on [[piano]].

Footage of the Newport performance appears in the documentary films ''[[Festival (1967 film)|Festival]]'' (1967), ''[[No Direction Home]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (film)|The Other Side of the Mirror: Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival 1963–1965]]'' (2007). The footage begins with Dylan being introduced by [[Master of Ceremonies]] [[Peter Yarrow]]: "Ladies and gentlemen, the person that's going to come up now has a limited amount of time ... His name is Bob Dylan." In the documentary footage, both boos and cheers are heard a few bars into Dylan's first song, "[[Maggie's Farm]]", and continue throughout his second, "Like a Rolling Stone". Dylan and his band then performed "Phantom Engineer", an early version of "[[It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bjorner|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan was said to have "electrified one half of his audience, and electrocuted the other".{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32, track 1}}

After "Phantom Engineer", Dylan and the band left the stage. Booing and clapping are in the background. When [[Peter Yarrow]] returned to the microphone, he begged Dylan to continue performing. According to [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], when Dylan returned to the stage, he discovered he did not have the right harmonica and said to Yarrow, "What are you doing to me?"&lt;ref name="shelton"&gt;Robert Shelton, ''No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan'', New York, 1986, pp. 301–304&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan then asked the audience for "an E harmonica". Within a few moments, a clatter of harmonicas hit the stage. Dylan performed two songs on acoustic guitar for the audience: "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", and then, as his farewell to Newport, "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]". The crowd exploded with applause, calling for more. Dylan did not return to the Newport festival for 37 years. In an enigmatic gesture, Dylan performed at Newport in 2002, sporting a wig and fake beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berkshirelinks.com/bob-dylan-concert-review-newport-folk-festival-aug-3-2002/|title=Bob Dylan concert review – Newport Folk Festival, Aug. 3, 2002|author=Read, Dave|date=2008-08-30|accessdate=2018-07-27|publisher=berkshirelinks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for the crowd's reaction===
Filmmaker [[Murray Lerner]] and others present at Newport argued that the boos were from outraged folk fans who disliked Dylan playing an electric guitar. Others present, including musician [[Al Kooper]], disagreed, arguing that the audience were upset by poor sound quality and the short duration of the set.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Poor sound quality was the reason musician [[Pete Seeger]], who was backstage, gave for disliking the performance: he says he told the audio technicians, "Get that distortion out of his voice ... It's terrible. If I had an axe, I'd chop the microphone cable right now."&lt;ref name=seeger&gt;{{cite video|people=Seeger, Pete|date=2005|title=No Direction Home|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeger has also said, however, that he only wanted to cut the cables because he wanted the audience to hear Dylan's lyrics properly because he thought they were important.&lt;ref name=seeger/&gt; Rumors that Seeger actually had an axe, or that a festival board member pulled or wanted to pull out the entire electrical wiring system&lt;ref name="shelton"/&gt; are [[apocrypha]]l. In the film ''[[No Direction Home]]'', [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]] of the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], who is Pete Seeger's brother-in-law, states that Seeger wanted to lower the volume of the band because the noise was upsetting his elderly father [[Charles Seeger|Charles]], who wore a hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cohen, John|date=2005|title=No Direction Home|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same film, Dylan claimed that Seeger's unenthusiastic response to his set was like a "dagger in his heart" and made him "want to go out and get drunk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Dylan, Bob|date=2005|title=No Direction Home|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to jazz historian [[John Szwed]], the legend about Pete Seeger cutting the cable or pulling the cords of the acoustic system may have arisen from an actual incident from earlier that afternoon. Szwed writes that Festival organizer Alan Lomax had asked Texas folklorist [[Robert "Mack" McCormick|Mack McCormick]], discoverer of [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], to find a Texas prison gang to bring up to Newport to sing work songs, but the [[Texas Attorney General]] would not allow it, so McCormick had rounded up a group of ex-convicts. Since they had never performed together in front of an audience, much less a microphone, McCormick wanted to accustom them to the stage before the concert. "But Bob Dylan's electric band had been rehearsing for some time and refused to leave. 'I was trying to tell Dylan, we need the stage', McCormick said. 'He continued to ignore me. So I went over to the junction box and pulled out the cords. Then he listened'."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Szwed]], Alan Lomax: ''The Man Who Recorded the World'' (New York: Viking, 2010), p. 354. The story also appears in Michael Hall's [http://www.texasmonthly.com/content/mack-mccormick-still-has-blues/page/0/4 "Mack McCormick Still has the Blues"], ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', April, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Jackson, another director of the Newport Folk Festival, called the incident "the myth of Newport". Jackson was present at Dylan's 1965 performance and in 2002 reviewed an audio tape of it. Jackson contends that the booing was directed at Peter Yarrow (also a member of the Festival's Board), who upset the crowd when he attempted to keep Dylan's spot to its proper length; Jackson maintains there's nothing to indicate the crowd disliked Dylan's music, electrified or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Bruce|url=http://buffaloreport.com/020826dylan.html|title=The myth of Newport '65: It wasn't Bob Dylan they were booing|work=Buffalo Report|date=2002-08-26|accessdate=2007-01-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106044953/http://buffaloreport.com/020826dylan.html|archivedate=2008-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al Kooper]] has argued that the boos were brought on by the short duration of Dylan's set, not the fact that Dylan had gone electric. He said: "The reason they booed is that he only played for fifteen minutes when everybody else played for forty-five minutes or an hour. They were feeling ripped off. Wouldn't you? They didn't give a shit about us being electric. They just wanted more."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, N. ''The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan'', (1st ed., 2004), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, the standard set length that night was 15 minutes, and by the end of his electric segment Dylan had already been on stage longer than most of the performers who preceded him, but much of his time had been devoted to tuning and band members switching instruments, so he had only played the three songs.) According to performers [[Ian &amp; Sylvia]] Tyson, it was "an angry, startled reaction" but that "it was a hostile audience" that year for other performers also.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32, track 1}}

[[Joe Boyd]], responsible for the sound mixing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, said in an interview with [[Richie Unterberger]] in 2007: "I think there were a lot of people who were upset about the rock band, but I think it was pretty split. I think probably more people liked it than didn't. But there was certainly a lot of shouting and a lot of arguing, and a sound which, you can hear in a lot of ballparks. You used to get this confusion when Bill Skowron used to come up to the plate for the Yankees, 'cause his nickname was Moose. And everybody used to go, "MOOSE!" And it sounded like they were booing him. Because you don't get the articulation of the consonant, so that a crowd shouting "more, more, more" at the end of Dylan's three songs sounded very much like booing. I've heard recently a recording of that night, and it doesn't sound to me like booing so much as a roar, just a kind of general hubbub between songs, and during Yarrow's attempt to get Dylan back on stage... I really wouldn't be prepared to say it was 50–50, or two thirds/one third, or whatever. But I think that there was a segment of the audience, somewhere between a quarter and a half, that was dismayed or horrified or varying degrees of unhappy about what he was doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/boydfolk.html|title=Interview with Joe Boyd|author=Unterberger, Richie|date=February 26, 2007|accessdate=April 4, 2012|publisher=richieunterberger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, documentary director [[Murray Lerner]] released on DVD his complete footage of Dylan's three appearances at Newport: ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (film)|The Other Side of the Mirror: Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival 1963–1965]]''. When interviewed by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, Lerner was asked: "There’s been a lot of debate over the years as to who exactly was doing the booing and who were they booing? Dylan? The organizers? The shortness of the set?" Lerner replied: "It's a good question. When we showed the film at The New York Film Festival [in October 2007] one kid gets up and says, 'About this booing... I was sitting right in front of the stage, there was no booing in the audience whatsoever. There was booing from the performers'. So I said, Well, I don't think you're right. Then another kid gets up and says 'I was a little further back and it was the press section that was booing, not the audience', and I said, Well, I don't think you're right. A third guy gets up and says 'I was there, and there was no question, it was the audience that was booing and there was no booing from the stage'. It was fascinating. People remember hearing what they thought they should hear. I think they were definitely booing Dylan and a little bit Pete Yarrow because he was so flustered. He was not expecting that audience's reaction and he was concerned about Bob’s image since they were part of the same family of artists through Al Grossman. But I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/10/exclusive_dylan_at_newport_who.html|title=Exclusive: Dylan at Newport – Who Booed?|work=Mojo|date=2007-10-25|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dylan appears to have believed the booing represented disapproval of his new sound. Interviewed in San Francisco, on December 3, 1965, Dylan was asked whether he was "surprised the first time the boos came?" He responded: "That was at Newport. Well, I did this very crazy thing, I didn't know what was going to happen, but they certainly booed, I'll tell you that. You could hear it all over the place.... I mean, they must be pretty rich, to be able to go some place and boo. I couldn't afford it if I was in their shoes."&lt;ref&gt;Television Press Conference, KQED, San Francisco, reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rediscovery and sale of Dylan's Newport guitar===
In July 2012, an episode of the [[PBS]] series ''[[History Detectives]]'' recounted the story of New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson, who claimed the [[Fender Stratocaster]] Dylan played at Newport was in her possession. She explained that Dylan had left the guitar on a plane piloted by her father, Victor Quinto, in 1965. In the program, vintage-instrument specialist Andy Babiuk is convinced the guitar in question is the one played at Newport. Lyrics of songs in the guitar case are identified as Dylan's work by Dylan memorabilia collector Jeff Gold. Dylan attorney Orin Snyder denied the authenticity of the guitar in a statement: "Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965." Snyder added, "He did own several other Stratocaster guitars that were stolen from him around that time, as were some handwritten lyrics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Andy|title=Experts: Bob Dylan's Long-Lost Newport Folk Festival Electric Guitar Found In New Jersey|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/experts-bob-dylans-long-lost-newport-folk-festival-electric-guitar-found-in-new-jersey-20120711|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 11, 2012|access-date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dylan and Peterson quietly settled their legal dispute, the guitar was sold by [[Christie's]] auction house in New York for $965,000, in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25273104| title = Bob Dylan's Fender Stratocaster sells for nearly $1m| date = December 6, 2013| access-date = June 15, 2014| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2015, the guitar was publicly played for the first time in fifty years during a tribute set at the Newport Folk Festival honoring the 50th anniversary of Dylan plugging in at Newport. The tribute set included [[Gillian Welch]], [[Dave Rawlings]], [[Willie Watson (musician)|Willie Watson]], the New Orleans [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]], [[Jason Isbell]], and several others.

The next concert Dylan played after his Newport performance was on August 28, 1965, at [[West Side Tennis Club|Forest Hills Stadium]], in [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Heylin, 1996, ''Bob Dylan: A Life In Stolen Moments'', pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan appears to have believed that the booing at Newport was a consequence of some fans disliking his electric sound.&lt;ref name="Egan57"&gt;{{harvnb|Egan|2010|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographer Daniel Kramer, who accompanied Dylan to the Forest Hills concert, wrote: "Dylan held a conference with the musicians who were going to accompany him in the second half of the concert. He told them that they should expect anything to happen—he probably was remembering what occurred at Newport. He told them that the audience might yell and boo and that they should not be bothered by it. Their job was to make the best music they were capable of, and let whatever happened happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kramer|1991|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musician [[Tony Glover]], in his liner notes for the ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|Bob Dylan Live 1966]]'' album, quotes a contemporary account of the concert from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'': "Bob Dylan split 15,000 of his fans down the middle at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium Sunday night... The most influential writer-performer on the pop music scene during the past decade, Dylan has apparently evolved too fast for some of his young followers, who are ready for radical changes in practically everything else... repeating the same scene that occurred during his performance at the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan delivered a round of folk-rock songs but had to pound his material against a hostile wall of anti-claquers, some of whom berated him for betraying the cause of folk music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Live 1966|others=Bob Dylan|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia Records|date=1998|location=New York, New York|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dylan's "World Tour", 1965–1966==
{{Main|Bob Dylan World Tour 1966}}
The polarised responses of Dylan's fans were exacerbated by the structure of [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|his concerts in late 1965 and 1966]]; the first half would be 'folk,' Dylan solo accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and [[harmonica]]; with the second half 'rock,' Dylan and [[The Band|the Hawks]] with electric guitars and a full [[rock and roll]] combo. The rock segment was often greeted with hostility, as seen in shows in [[Sheffield]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in ''No Direction Home''. Footage from the [[Manchester]] concert, at the end of that film, includes the "Judas" heckling incident. During a quiet moment in between songs an audience member shouts loudly: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" Dylan replies: "I don't believe you, you're a liar" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" as they launch into "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Live 1966|others=Bob Dylan|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia Records|date=1998|location=New York, New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was recorded, and the full concert was eventually released in 1998 as ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|Live 1966: The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert]]'' in Dylan's Bootleg Series. One fan who claimed to have shouted "Judas!" was John Cordwell; when interviewed by [[Andy Kershaw]] he said:

:"I think most of all I was angry that Dylan... not that he'd played electric, but that he'd played electric with a really poor sound system. It was not like it is on the record [the official album]. It was a wall of mush. That, and it seemed like a cavalier performance, a throwaway performance compared with the intensity of the acoustic set earlier on. There were rumblings all around me and the people I was with were making noises and looking at each other. It was a build-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershaw|first=Andy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/bob-dylan-how-i-found-the-man-who-shouted-judas-314340.html|work=The Independent|title=Bob Dylan: How I found the man who shouted 'Judas'|date=2005-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another claimant to the "Judas!" shout was Keith Butler, who was a student at [[Keele University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=365–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler's presence was documented in the film ''[[Eat the Document]]'', when the 21-year-old was filmed leaving the [[Manchester]] [[Free Trade Hall]], saying "Any pop group could produce better rubbish than that! It was a bloody disgrace! He's a traitor!" In 1999, he took part in a [[BBC Radio]] documentary about ''Live 1966'', and asked about his reaction at the time, he replied, "I kind of think: 'You silly young bugger.'"&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, N. ''The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan'' (1st ed., 2004), p. 69, {{ISBN|1-84353-139-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Dylan referred to the incident while addressing criticism that he hadn't clearly acknowledged his lyrical sources for his new album [[Tempest (Bob Dylan album)|''Tempest'']]:

:Wussies and pussies complain about that stuff. It's an old thing — it's part of the tradition. It goes way back. These are the same people that tried to pin the name Judas on me. Judas, the most hated name in human history! If you think you've been called a bad name, try to work your way out from under that. Yeah, and for what? For playing an electric guitar? As if that is in some kind of way equitable{{sic}} to betraying our Lord and delivering him up to be crucified. All those evil motherfuckers can rot in hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Bob Dylan Strikes Back at Critics|date=12 September 2012|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-strikes-back-at-critics-20120912|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Drug Quality and Security Act}}

An '''epedigree''' (sometimes referred to as '''e-pedigree''' or '''electronic pedigree''') is an [[electronic document]] which provides data on the history of a particular batch of a drug.  It satisfies the requirement for a [[drug pedigree]] while using a convenient electronic form.

==Pedigree==
The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the 2006 Compliance Policy Guide for the [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]] states that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A drug pedigree is a statement of origin that identifies each prior sale, purchase, or trade of a drug, including the date of those transactions and the names and addresses of all parties to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FDA 2006 Compliance Policy Guide for the Prescription Drug Marketing Act|url=http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/06-9211.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An epedigree  is simply an electronic document which satisfies a pedigree requirement.  The primary purpose of an epedigree is to protect consumers from contaminated medicine or [[counterfeit drugs]].

==Standard==
On January 5, 2007 [[EPCglobal]] ratified the Pedigree Standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817203951/http://www.epcglobalinc.org/standards/pedigree/|title=EPCglobal Pedigree|date=17 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an international standard that specifies an [[XML]] description of the life history of a product across an arbitrarily complex supply chain.

As of 2008, most states have enacted some sort of pedigree requirement and many have also required epedigree.  However, the existing epedigree requirements amount to little more than requiring that pharmaceutical supply chain companies be able to provide reports in formats such as [[pdf]], text files or [[spreadsheets]].  

The basic data elements of an original epedigree are:
* Lot
* Potency
* Expiration
* [[National Drug Code]] and [[Electronic Product Code]]
* Manufacturer
* Distributor, Wholesaler or Pharmacy
* Unique identifier of the salable unit

As the product moves down the supply chain, each company is required to carry forward all previous epedigree information.  In this way, the final point of sale has the complete lineage of every unit.

==Laws==
ePedigree laws were eventually replaced by a harmonized national standard called the [[Drug Quality and Security Act]].

ePedigree laws were in a rapid state of flux with states changing the "drop dead" date for compliance with tracking and authentication years beyond the original dates set by Florida and California.  The definitive requirements will include serialization.  Companies that focus purely on achieving compliance will miss the opportunity to use regulation as a business driver.  The ability to track and serialize unit level saleable packages (e.g. bottle of 25 pills) not just cases or pallets can create business value in knowing exactly where their products are purchased can do the following: 
1) Minimize cost of chargebacks through 100% accurate adjudication. Chargebacks account for 2-15% of gross revenue for a pharmaceutical manufacturer.  
2) Minimize risk by increasing accuracy in Medicare/Medicaid pricing calculations by fully knowing all fees, rebates, and chargebacks that should be applied to a specific unit sale.  Over $4B in fines have been handed down for improperly calculating Medicare/Medicaid pricing.  
3) Limit liability of having to recall entire lots of product because a (non-serialized) shipment was stolen - see example: [http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?issueId=11679&amp;articleId=107687]
4) Achieve visibility for manufacturers in the labyrinth that is the wholesale distribution network to more accurately forecast demand and measure sales &amp; marketing programs.

Although simple epedigree systems are an important first step, significant improvement in public safety would result from a more standardized and automated approach.  The larger and more difficult task of providing for an Automated Epedigree System has been suggested, but not required by any state.  Such a system would require fairly significant changes to [[supply chain]] companies' data interchanges and would certainly require advanced Track and Trace technology (with [[bar codes]] or [[RFID]]).  The requirements that come closest to an Automated Epedigree System have been proposed by California.  In March 2008, the California Board of Pharmacy (CBOP) published its "E-Pedigree Requirements" which are scheduled to go into effect in a phased approach between 2015-2017 (since abandoned).  CBOP has proposed an [[XML]] standard document and the law requires an "interoperable electronic system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Board of Pharmacy E-Pedigree Law Act |url=http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/about/e_pedigree_laws.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515195728/http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/about/e_pedigree_laws.shtml |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Five Suns''' in the context of [[creation myth]]s, describes the doctrine of the [[Aztec]] and other [[Nahua people]]s in which the present world was preceded by four other cycles of creation and destruction. It is primarily derived from the mythological, cosmological and [[eschatological]] beliefs and traditions of earlier cultures from central Mexico and the [[Mesoamerica]]n region in general. The [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]] [[Aztec]] society inherited many traditions concerning [[Mesoamerican creation accounts]], while however modifying some aspects and supplying novel interpretations of their own.

In the [[creation myth]]s which were known to the Aztec and other [[Nahua peoples]] of the Late Postclassic era, the central tenet was that there had been four worlds, or "Suns", before the present universe. These earlier worlds and their inhabitants had been created, then destroyed by the catastrophic action of leading deity figures. The present world is the fifth sun, and the Aztec saw themselves as "the People of the Sun," whose divine duty was to wage cosmic war in order to provide the sun with his ''tlaxcaltiliztli'' ("nourishment"). Without it, the sun would disappear from the heavens. Thus the welfare and the very survival of the universe depended upon the offerings of [[blood]] and [[heart]]s to the sun.

== Legend ==

=== First sun ===
It was these four gods who eventually created all the other gods and the world we know today, but before they could create they had to destroy, for every time they attempted to create something, it would fall into the water beneath them and be eaten by [[Cipactli]], the giant earth crocodile, who swam through the water with mouths at every one of her joints. The four Tezcatlipocas descended the first people who were giants. They created the other gods, the most important of whom were the water gods: [[Tlaloc]], the god of rain and fertility and [[Chalchiuhtlicue]], the goddess of lakes, rivers and oceans, also the goddess of beauty. To give light, they needed a god to become the sun and the Black Tezcatlipoca was chosen, but either because he had lost a leg or because he was god of the night, he only managed to become half a sun. The world continued on in this way for some time, but a sibling rivalry grew between Quetzalcoatl and his brother the mighty sun, who Quetzalcoatl knocked from the sky with a stone club. With no sun, the world was totally black and in his anger, Tezcatlipoca commanded his jaguars to eat all the people.&lt;ref name="Agu"&gt;Aguilar-Moreno, Manuel. The Aztec World. [[California State University]], Los Angeles, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second sun ===
The gods created a new group of people to inhabit the Earth, this time they were of normal size. Quetzalcoatl became the new sun and as the years passed, the people of the Earth grew less and less civilized and stopped showing proper honor to the gods. As a result, Tezcatlipoca demonstrated his power and authority as god of sorcery and judgment by turning the animalistic people into monkeys. Quetzalcoatl, who had loved the flawed people as they were, became upset and blew all of the monkeys from the face of the Earth with a mighty hurricane.  He then stepped down as the sun to create a new people.

=== Third sun ===
[[Tlaloc]] became the next sun, but Tezcatlipoca seduced and stole his wife [[Xochiquetzal]], the goddess of sex, flowers and corn. Tlaloc then refused to do anything other than wallow in his own grief, so a great drought swept the world. The people's prayers for rain annoyed the grieving sun and he refused to allow it to rain, but the people continued to beg him. Then, in a fit of rage he answered their prayers with a great downpour of fire. It continued to rain fire until the entire Earth had burned away. The gods then had to construct a whole new Earth from the ashes.

=== Fourth sun ===
The next sun and also Tlaloc’s new wife, was [[Chalchiuhtlicue]]. She was very loving towards the people, but Tezcatlipoca was not. Both the people and Chalchiuhtlicue felt his judgment when he told the water goddess that she was not truly loving and only faked kindness out of selfishness to gain the people’s praise. Chalchiuhtlicue was so crushed by these words that she cried blood for the next fifty-two years, causing a horrific flood that drowned everyone on Earth. Humans became fish in order to survive.

=== Fifth sun ===
Quetzalcoatl would not accept the destruction of his people and went to the underworld where he stole their bones from the god [[Mictlantecuhtli]]. He dipped these bones in his own blood to resurrect his people, who reopened their eyes to a sky illuminated by the current sun, Huitzilopochtli.&lt;ref name="Smi" /&gt;

The [[Tzitzimimeh]], or stars, became jealous of their brighter, more important brother Huitzilopochtli. Their leader, [[Coyolxauhqui]], goddess of the moon, lead them in an assault on the sun and every night they come close to victory when they shine throughout the sky, but are beaten back by the mighty Huitzilopochtli who rules the daytime sky. To aid this all-important god in his continuing war, the [[Aztecs]] offer him the nourishment of human sacrifices. They also offer human sacrifices to Tezcatlipoca in fear of his judgment, offer their own blood to Quetzalcoatl, who opposes fatal sacrifices, in thanks of his blood sacrifice for them and give offerings to many other gods for many purposes. Should these sacrifices cease, or should mankind fail to please the gods for any other reason, this fifth sun will go black, the world will be shattered by a catastrophic earthquake, and the Tzitzimitl will slay Huitzilopochtli and all of humanity.

== Variations and alternative myths ==
Most of what is known about the ancient Aztecs comes from the few [[codices]] to survive the Spanish conquest.  Their myths can be confusing not only because of the lack of documentation, but also because there are many popular myths that seem to contradict one another due the fact that they were originally passed down by word of mouth and because the Aztecs adopted many of their gods from other tribes, both assigning their own new aspects to these gods and endowing them with aspects of similar gods from various other cultures.  Older myths can be very similar to newer myths while contradicting one another by claiming that a different god performed the same action, probably because myths changed in correlation to the popularity of each of the gods at a given time.

Other variations on this myth state that [[Coatlicue]], the earth goddess, was the mother of the four Tezcatlipocas and the Tzitzimitl.  Some versions say that Quetzalcoatl was born to her first, while she was still a virgin, often mentioning his twin brother [[Xolotl]], the guide of the dead and god of fire.  Tezcatlipoca was then born to her by an obsidian knife, followed by the Tzitzimitl and then Huitzilopochtli.  The most popular variation including Coatlicue depicts her giving birth first to the Tzitzimitl.  Much later she gave birth to Huitzilopochtli when a mysterious ball of feathers appeared to her.  The Tzitzimitl then decapitated the pregnant Coatlicue, believing it to be insulting that she had given birth to another child.  Huitzilopochtli then sprang forth from her womb wielding a serpent of fire and began his epic war with the Tzitzimitl, who were also referred to as the [[Centzon Huitznahuas]].  Sometimes he is said to have decapitated Coyolxauhqui and either used her head to make the moon or thrown it into a canyon.  Further variations depict the ball of feathers as being the father of Huitzilopochtli or the father of Quetzalcoatl and sometimes Xolotl.

Other variations of this myth claim that only Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca were born to Ometeotl, who was replaced by Coatlicue in this myth probably because it had absolutely no worshipers or temples by the time the Spanish arrived.  It is sometimes said that the male characteristic of Ometeotl is named Ometecutli and that the female characteristic is named Omecihualt.  Further variations on this myth state that it was only Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca who pulled apart Cipactli, also known as [[Tlaltecuhtli]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and that Xipe Totec and Huitzilopochtli then constructed the world from her body.  Some versions claim that Tezcatlipoca actually used his leg as bait for Cipactli, before dismembering her.

The order of the first four suns varies as well, though the above version is the most common.  Each world’s end correlates consistently to the god that was the sun at the time throughout all variations of the myth, though the loss of Xochiquetzal is not always identified as Tlaloc’s reason for the rain of fire, which is not otherwise given and it is sometimes said that Chalchiuhtlicue flooded the world on purpose, without the involvement of Tezcatlipoca.  It is also said that Tezcatlipoca created half a sun, which his jaguars then ate before eating the giants.

The fifth sun however is sometimes said to be a god named [[Nanauatzin]].  In this version of the myth, the gods convened in darkness to choose a new sun, who was to sacrifice himself by jumping into a gigantic bonfire.  The two volunteers were the young son of Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue, [[Tecuciztecatl]], and the old Nanauatzin.  It was believed that Nanauatzin was too old to make a good sun, but both were given the opportunity to jump into the bonfire.  Tecuciztecatl tried first but was not brave enough to walk through the heat near the flames and turned around.  Nanauatzin then walked slowly towards and then into the flames and was consumed.  Tecuciztecatl then followed.  The braver Nanauatzin became what is now the sun and Tecuciztecatl became the much less spectacular moon.  A god that bridges the gap between Nanauatzin and Huitzilopochtli is [[Tonatiuh]], who was sick, but rejuvenated himself by burning himself alive and then became the warrior sun and wandered through the heavens with the souls of those who died in battle, refusing to move if not offered enough sacrifices.

==Brief summation==
*''Nahui-Ocelotl'' (Jaguar Sun) - Inhabitants were giants who were devoured by jaguars. The world was destroyed.
*''Nahui-Ehécatl'' (Wind Sun) - Inhabitants were transformed into monkeys. This world was destroyed by hurricanes.
*''Nahui-Quiahuitl'' (Rain Sun) - Inhabitants were destroyed by rain of fire. Only birds survived (or inhabitants survived by becoming birds).
*''Nahui-Atl'' (Water Sun) - This world was flooded turning the inhabitants into fish. A couple escaped but were transformed into dogs.
*''Nahui-Ollin'' (Earthquake Sun) - We are the inhabitants of this world. This world will be destroyed by earthquakes (or one large earthquake).

==In popular culture==
* The version of the myth with Nanahuatzin serves as a [[framing device]] for the 1991 Mexican film, ''In Necuepaliztli in Aztlan (Retorno a Aztlán)'', by Juan Mora Catlett.
* The version of the myth with Nanahuatzin is in the 1996 film, ''The Five Suns: A Sacred History of Mexico'', by Patricia Amlin.
* [[Rage Against the Machine]] refers to intercultural violence as "the fifth sunset" in their song [[People of the Sun]], on the album [[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]].
* [[Thomas Harlan (fantasy writer)|Thomas Harlan]]'s science fiction series "In the Time of the Sixth Sun" uses this myth as a central plot point, where an ancient star-faring civilization ("people of the First Sun") had disappeared and left the galaxy with many dangerous artifacts.

The '''fête de l'Humanité''' ({{IPA-fr|fɛt də lymaniˈte}}; ''English: Festival of Humanity'') is an event organised annually by French daily newspaper ''[[L'Humanité]]'' in order to fund itself. It is the largest popular gathering in France.

L'Humanité was created in 1904 by French socialist [[Jean Jaurès]] but the first fête de l'Humanité took place in September 1930 to raise funds for the newspaper ''L'Humanité'' and 1000 people attended it. The 2010 festival attracted 600,000 visitors. The 2018 festival attracted 800,000 visitors over 3 days, breaking all records.

The festival is organized and held almost exclusively by '''volunteers''', since it exists to fund the newspaper. 

Hundreds of stalls are scattered around the venue offering food and drinks with the stall holders coming from all over the world to be part of the event. The fête is a unique mix of politics and entertaining, with concerts happening alongside many debates, art exhibits, movies, etc. Because of the proximity of l'Humanité with the [[French communist party]], most of the volunteers are communists, even though the attendants aren't. 

The festival comprises many stages (Grande Scène (main stage), scène Zebrock (rock stage), scène reggae, P'tite Scène (smaller stage), and tens of smaller stages inside stalls). The Main Stage can accommodate about 100,000 spectators. 

Due to its size, this festival is considered the kickoff of the left-wing's "political year" each year in September. Tens of thousands of left-wing activists gather there to celebrate and debate (from many sensitivites : [[communists]], but also [[social-democrats]], [[anarchists]], [[trotskysts]], sympathizers of the left wing, etc.). They forget their disagreements for a festive weekend and get energized to start the year. 

The festival is usually attended by the main figures of the left wing (leaders of the French socialist party, [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]], [[Arlette Laguiller]], [[Olivier Besancenot]], [[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]], etc.) as well as famous journalists ([[Edwy Plenel]], [[Guillaume Meurice]], etc.)

==Artists involved==
Many artists such as [[Roger Hodgson]], [[Léo Ferré]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Who]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Jacques Brel]], [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Renaud]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Jacques Dutronc]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and [[Joan Baez]] have performed at this event.

The '''great Oulu fire of 1652''' was a [[conflagration]] that destroyed the majority of the young city of [[Oulu]], [[Finland]] on 2 October 1652. Almost all of the houses of the town’s [[bourgeoisie]], the provision warehouses in which the [[Monarch_of_Sweden|Crown’s]] grain and money was stored and the [[drawbridge]] of [[Oulu Castle]] were destroyed.&lt;ref name=virkkunen&gt;{{cite book|title=Oulun kaupungin historia I |trans-title=The History of the City of Oulu I |last= Virkkunen |first= A.H. |publisher=Kirjola Oy |year= 1953|pages=128–130|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was rebuilt after the fire according to the city plan drawn up by surveyor [[Claes Claesson]] in 1651. The new city plan doubled the surface area of the town. At the same time, the streets and [[city block]]s were laid out in a more regular fashion. The shoreline of the [[Oulu River]] was turned into a marketplace that had its own [[measuring house]], a [[weigh house]], and, of course, a [[packhouse]].&lt;ref name=virkkunen /&gt;

Zacharias, ''Behind Closed Doors: the Secret History of the Cold War'', G. Putnam’s sons, New York, 1950, Chapter 8, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt; The mystery of the case was unravelled only 50 years later when the classified top secret documents of the [[Department of State|State Department]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] became open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;State Department Decimal File, 1945–1949, Box 3069 NACP&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kasenkina Goes Missing ==

After [[WWII]] the profound economic and political differences led to a confrontation between the wartime allies against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1946 the United States, United Kingdom, and France unified their [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] in Germany. The [[Marshall Plan]] was introduced to support [[economic recovery]] of Western Europe and stop the expansion of [[Communism]]. In retaliation the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] began the Berlin Blockade (June 24, 1948 – May 12, 1949) by halting all surface traffic communications (road, railroad, and canal transport) to [[West Berlin]], which was located 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) inside Soviet-controlled [[New states of Germany|Eastern Germany]]. [[Diplomacy|Diplomatic negotiations]] on the terms of lifting the blockade were going at a very slow pace. As war-like tensions kept dangerously mounting [[the Soviet Union|Soviets]] began to reduce the number of their experts seconded to the United States.
In June 1948, on orders from Moscow, the Soviet school in New York was closed. All teachers and students were to return to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] by September. On July 31, when the steamer "Pobeda"  was scheduled to sail, the former headmaster and math teacher Michael Samarin with his wife (an English teacher) and their 3 children were reported missing. Also missing was the 52-year-old chemistry teacher Oksana Kasenkina. Samarin immediately went to the FBI and asked for political asylum for his family, which was granted.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, August 9, 1948, pages 1, 4, Russian asks protection of U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York World-Telegram, August 20, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Kasenkina's behavior was erratic, which caused a major international scandal.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mystery of the Kidnapped Russian", ''Life'', August 23, 1948, vol.25, 8, 23–27&lt;/ref&gt; For 50 years and political reasons the US State Department held the documents of the Kasenkina case as classified and top secret. The documents declassified in 1998 and available to the public at the State Archives of the United States (National Archives, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD, 20740) show that three days before her departure, at different times two Russian-speaking men, – chemist Dr. Alexander Korzhinsky and Leo Castello, independently, started a conversation with Kasenkina on a park bench close to her place of residency.  Korzhinsky invited her to his apartment for dinner;- she refused to eat but complained that she did not want to return to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Mirror, Aug.21, 1948, pages 1, 6; Well, Where's the FBI? Asks Tutor 'Kidnaper'&lt;/ref&gt; He advised her to seek help at the office of the anti-soviet newspaper [[Russian language in the United States|"The New Russian Word"]].  On July 31 [[Vladimir Zenzinov]] a journalist and former member of the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] , took her to Reed farm in [[Valley Cottage, New York|Valley Cottage]] belonging to the [[Tolstoy Foundation]].  The President of the Foundation, countess [[Alexandra Tolstaya]] , provided Kasenkina shelter and a job. The teacher worked in the kitchen and dining room serving farm workers, many of whom previously served in the [[White Movement]] and the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and therefore distrusted the Soviet teacher.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Daily Mirror'', Aug.25, 1948, p.3; "Tolstoy Farm is land of promise for Anti-Reds", by Rodney Stahl and James Carter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3266723, Fyokla Tolstaya,"Three times my grandfather was taken to be executed by squad"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mystery Letter ==

After five days at the farm  Kasenkina stopped a passing-by driver with a vegetable cart and secretly smuggled out a handwritten letter to the [[Consul-General]] of the USSR.
On August 6, 1948, Consul [[Jacob Lomakin]] received the five-page muddled handwritten letter in which she complained of loneliness and a [[Suicide crisis|suicidal mood]]. The excerpts from the letter read: -"the reaction of the already undermined organism has set in. You never considered it necessary to speak frankly with me... I was in despair ready to commit suicide... Finally they began to persecute me, apparently being aware of my state of mind... And then just before my departure it seemed that they begun to pay some attention to me, but I was already warned of my condition..." Kasenkina used propaganda clichés about [[loyalty]] to the [[dictatorship]] of the [[working class]],  "devotion and love for the [[Fatherland]] and her "hatred for traitors", not a word about the US and no information on how she came to the farm. Her disorganized thoughts jumped from past to present. The letter certainly imparted no suggestion that its author was driven by an overwhelming desire to begin life over in United States, borne aloft by her ardor for freedom and hatred of Soviet tyranny ... The letter's most unambiguous statement is in its concluding plea to the Consul: "I implore you, I implore you, don’t let me perish here. I have lost my will power." &lt;ref&gt;Cold War Captives. Imprisonment, Escape and Brainwashing, Susan Carruthers, University of California Press, 2009, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consulate-General of Russia in New York City&lt;/ref&gt;  The unsigned letter ends with the handwritten address of the farm.&lt;ref&gt;State Department Decimal File, 1945–1949, Box 3069 NACP&lt;/ref&gt; The Consulate’s primary activities include the protection of the interest of their citizens temporarily or permanently residing in the host country. Kasenkina's letter addressed to Lomakin left him no alternative but to take the dangerous mission to Reed Farm.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The [[Kidnapping]] Mystery  ==

On August 7, before starting to the farm, Lomakin called the Missing Persons Bureau, [[New York City Police Department|Police Dept of New York]] and asked for support. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 8, 1948, 1 , 48 ; Russian Factions here, War over "Kidnapping of Woman, by Alexander Feinberg&lt;/ref&gt; Capt. John J. Cronin confirmed the call from the Consulate at 12:15&amp;nbsp;pm. "He said that the Russian Consul General was going to Reed Farm to get a woman who was in a highly nervous state and asked for help." Capt. Cronin informed the [[New City, New York|New City]] [[Barracks]] nearest to Reed farm. The trooper got to the farm too late, the Consulate car with Kasenkina has already departed. Questioning under oath of the President of the Tolstoy Foundation, Countess [[Alexandra Tolstaya]] at the New York County [[Supreme Court]] on August 12, 1948 revealed the following events. As the black Buick [[executive car]] with a driver carrying the Consul, the [[Consul (representative)|vice-consul]] Zot Chepurnykh and [[Shorthand|stenographer]] Maria Kharlamova arrived, Kasenkina took her suitcase and walked out to meet them. Countess Tolstaya ordered 12 men to surround the diplomat's car. She called Kasenkina into the house, locked the door and tried to convince the teacher not to leave with the Soviets. Kasenkina did not listen to the [[argument]]s and repeated – "I must go, I must go". Seeing that the teacher was desperate to leave Tolstaya told the men not to hold the car, because Kasenkina decided to leave with the Consul "of her own free will."&lt;ref&gt;Official Memorandum – US Government. National Archives Administration, Washington, DC, document FW 702.6111/8-948, State Department Decimal File, 1945–49, Box 3060, RG 59, NACP)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press Conference at the Consulate  ==

Upon returning to the Consulate Lomakin immediately invited a large group of journalists and mass media workers. In this [[emergency]] [[News conference|press conference]] Kasenkina told how she was drugged and kidnapped by "White Russian [[Banditry|bandits]]". Lomakin showed the envelope and Kasenkina's [[Handwriting|handwritten]] letter. He read aloud extracts from the letter in English translation. The [[Photostat machine|photostatic]] copy was given to the [[United States Department of State]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. On August 8, all major US newspapers came out with photos from the press conference, and [[The New York Times]]&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, August 8, 1948, 1 , 48 ; Russian Factions here, War over "Kidnapping of Woman, by Alexander Feinberg&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York Herald Tribune|New Herald Tribune]]&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, August 8, 1948 p.1 and 29, Thiller: Red vs White; Soviet Consul, a Countess, F.B.I in it, by Margaret Parton&lt;/ref&gt; published detailed reports. Countess A. Tolstaya stated that she was against providing shelter to Kasenkina  believing she was sent for spying, in particular, to determine the location of Samarins.&lt;ref&gt;New York Post, Home News, August 9, 1948 , Soviet Teacher in Hiding&lt;/ref&gt; A separate article printed a statement by [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] Karl Mundt, – a member of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|HUAC]] requiring that Kasenkina should be questioned as a witness of USSR espionage activities.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Herald Tribune'', Aug.9, 1948, "Mundt Seeks Right to Quiz Red Teacher"&lt;/ref&gt;

Headlines of other newspapers cried out that the teacher was kidnapped "by force" from her hiding place at the farm of anti-communists and the letter to the Consul was called a [[Fake news|fake]]. The Consul gave the photocopy of the letter into the hands of the representatives of the U.S. State Department, hoping for a fair [[Conflict resolution|resolution]] of the conflict. Publication of the letter would demonstrate that Kasenkina came to the Consulate of "her own free will". Despite the validity of his actions, the press and radio accused Lomakin of kidnapping, the authenticity of the letter was denied or called forged. Reporters hounded Lomakin. Day and night the building was surrounded by journalists and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-soviet]] crowds. According to the memoirs of Kasenkina, ghosted by anticommunist writer [[Isaac Don Levine]], she had a private room and freely moved within the Consulate.&lt;ref&gt;Cold War Captives. Imprisonment, Escape and Brainwashing, Susan Carruthers, University of California Press, 2009, Chapter 1, 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oksana Kasenkina, Leap to Freedom, J.B. Lippincott Company, 1949, 282&lt;/ref&gt; On August 12, former New York Democratic Congressman and New York State Supreme Justice [[Samuel Dickstein (congressman)|Samuel Dickstein]] issued the ''habeas corpus'' writ ordering the Consul General to produce Kasenkina to the Supreme Court for questioning the next day. Lomakin refused, stating that the teacher was sick. Dickstein responded: "he would order the sheriff to seize Mrs. Kasenkina if necessary. Immunity given to Lomakin and his staff does not extend to the teacher".&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, August 12, 1948, Writ Orders Mrs.Kosenkina be brought into Court Today, by Charles Grutzner&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, declassified Soviet files revealed that Dickstein, known as the "father of McCarthyism", for many years was a paid agent of the Soviet secret service agency [[NKVD]]. The file documents indicate that for his greed, his handlers gave him a code name "crook" (in Russian -"zhulik").&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Allen; Vassiliev, Alexander, The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America-The Stalin Era.

On August 12, after five days at the Consulate, Kasenkina fell from a high third floor window to the building's concrete fenced yard. Miraculously she survived and was taken to the hospital. In Lomakin's version, she had jumped in suicidal despair.&lt;ref&gt;Life magazine, vol. 25, 8, August 23, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Four inspectors of the New York Police headed by Deputy Chief Inspector Conrad Rotingast were allowed by Lomakin to enter the Consulate building and inspect the teacher's room for a possible [[suicide note]]. They found a sealed letter addressed to Moscow, after translation by an FBI translator, a photostat was made and "the letter was returned to the Consulate unopened".&lt;ref&gt;Office Memorandum, United State Government, Date September 20, 1948, Mr Amshey to Robert G. Hooker Jr., Box 702.6111/9-2048&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter written to her friends (or relatives) on June 10, 1948 Kasenkina wrote:"We shall see one another very, very soon. I dream every day, every hour, and every minute of the moment of our meeting... It seems that even now I see the shores of our distant, vast and beloved Fatherland!.." Graphology expertise proved that both letters were written by Kasenkina.&lt;ref&gt;State Department Decimal File, 1945–1949, Box 3069 NACP&lt;/ref&gt; History professor at [[Rutgers University]] Susan Carruthers in the book "Prisoners of the Cold War: imprisonment, escape and brainwashing" writes: "in the first 6 hours at the hospital Kasenkina explained her action by the fact that she wanted to end it all". No statements about the desire to obtain [[Right of asylum|political asylum]]. In the hospital communication of Kasenkina with Soviet representatives was banned, while visits by Zenzinov and Tolstaya and reporters were permitted. The mass media called her action as a "leap to freedom" &lt;ref&gt;Susan Lisa Carruthers, Cold war captives: imprisonment, escape, and brainwashing, University of California Press, 2009, Chapter 1, 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; and harshly predicted: "Soviet Consul May Face Firing Squad" and "Failure to Hold Kasenkina May Mean Death".&lt;ref&gt;''New York Enquirer'', August 16, 1948; Soviet Consul May Face Firing Squad, Failure to Hold Kasenkina May Mean Death&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28, 1948, two weeks after the incident, the BBC newsreel clip "Mrs Kasenkina tells her story", shows bedridden Kasenkina. When asked why she jumped, she mumbles in Russian almost the exact words from her letter to the Consul-General:- "I have repeatedly asked you to tell me frankly everything that you know..." , her words were maliciously mistranslated by interpreter Luba Trepak, who speaks of her leap to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishpathe.com/video/mrs-kasenkina-tells-her-story&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellias M. Zacharias writes  "the judgement of some of the men who rushed headlong to Mme Kasenkina’s bedside to take charge of her relations with the press and radio were not to be trusted. Their anti-Soviet record had been remarkable for its senseless and vindictive venom rather than for its effectiveness." &lt;ref&gt;Ellis M. Zacharias, Behind Closed Doors: the Secret History of the Cold War, G. Putnam’s sons, New York, 1950, Chapter 8, 85&lt;/ref&gt; For many weeks "Voice of America" radio beamed overseas in 22 languages, including Russian, the story of Mrs. Oksana Kasenkina.&lt;ref&gt;Better Dead than Red, Oksana Kasenkina, ''Daily News'' (New York)/.../better-dead-red-oksana-kasenkina&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://openrussia.org/notes/716283/&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation the Soviets jammed Russian programs of VOA, including music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com&gt;1949/05/11&gt;archives&lt;/ref&gt; For decades mass media revived the Kasenkina Case without explanation of her emotional instability that caused her to radically change her life three times in 11 days. For 50 years the US State Department kept all the documents and the text of her letters [[Classified information|classified]] as well as the fact that the FBI [[Graphology|graphologist]] confirmed that it was entirely in Kasenkina's handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives Administration, Washington, DC, document FW 702.6111/9-2048, State Department Decimal File, 1945–49, Box 3060, RG 59, NACP.

Mulligan, in charge of investigating the Kasenkina Case, asked State Department Spokesman Michael J. McDermott for an English translations of both mysterious letters, but they were never turned over to the Police or Press.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Aug.27, 1948. City Police to get Kasenkina's Notes. Notes Authenticity not yet confirmed. McDermott says -Teacher may see them&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 1948, in a letter to Kasenkina's lawyer Mr. Archie Dawson, State Department Acting Legal Adviser Jack B.Tate suggested that "inasmuch as the letters are presumably the personal property of Mrs. Kasenkina, the question of releasing them to the Press is a matter for her decision so far as the Department of State is concerned". 
Despite demands of her return by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin,&lt;ref&gt;Text of Soviet 'Kidnap' Note, Journal American, August 20, 1948, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Kasenkina stayed in the US; in 1951 she received a US residence permit, and in 1956 became a US citizen; she died in Miami of heart failure on July 24, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian defector Oksana Kasenkina's leap for freedom|work=Daily News|location=New York| author=Jay Maeder |date=August 14, 2017 |url=http://beta.nydailynews.com/news/national/russian-defector-oksana-kasenkina-leap-freedom-article-1.820726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Severance of Consulate Ties and End of Berlin Negotiations  ==

On August 19, 1948 the Department of State requested the President to revoke the exequatur issued to Consul General Lomakin. The same day President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] approved the decision of the State Department. Consul General Lomakin was declared [[persona non grata]] on the grounds that he kidnapped a woman and held her in custody.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1948, Eastern Europe, The Soviet Union, vol. lV- Office of Historian, doc.681, 702.6111/8-1948&lt;/ref&gt; The Kasenkina Case coincided in time with the neck-to-neck &lt;ref&gt;United States presidential election, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; presidential campaign of President Harry Truman and New York Governor Thomas Dewey. The revoke of the exequatur came before the State Department received a translation of Kasenkina's letters and ahead of graphology expertise.&lt;ref&gt;State Department Decimal File, 1945–49, Box 3069, RG59, NACP&lt;/ref&gt; Cancellation of a high-ranking diplomat exequatur is rare and is always seen as a blow to the prestige of the country. In retaliation the Government of the USSR ended [[negotiation]]s on lifting the Berlin Blockade, and closed its consulates in New York and San Francisco, that by protocol meant the closing of US consulates in Leningrad and Vladivostok.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 25, 1948; "Russia closes Consulates in U.S., asks we quit ours in the Far East, as she backs actions on teachers"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chamberlin|first=William Henry|title=Russia's Iron Age|publisher=Read Books|year=2007|page=405|chapter=Coannihilation?|isbn=1-4067-6820-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eERpaEH2G_UC&amp;pg=PA405|accessdate=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State George C.

Sub-Group. Ousted Consul might claim immunity accorded U.N. personnel to return here. Mr. Lomakin was elected as an individual-rather than a member of the Soviet government-by the Economic and Social Council".&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, Aug.26, 1948; Lomakin still a member of U.N. Sub-Group. Ousted Consul might claim immunity accorded U.N. personnel to return here&lt;/ref&gt; 
Consular relations between the USSR and the US were restored only after 24 years in 1972.
In his 1952 book, Ellis M. Zacharias writes: " In the moment of Lomakin’s expulsion we lost the initiative to the Russians. ...we became deprived of a major diplomatic listening post in the far East". In addition to the closing of Consulates, termination of Berlin blockade negotiations cost the United States millions of dollars spent on the creation of the [[Berlin Airlift|airlift]] needed for food supply to the 2.5-million population of West Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis M. Zacharias, ''Behind Closed Doors: the Secret History of the Cold War'', G. Putnam’s sons, New York, 1950, Chapter 8, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''list of Baja California Peninsula hurricanes''' includes all of the [[tropical cyclone]]s that impacted the [[Baja California Peninsula]], which includes the [[Mexican state]]s of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; In the period 1951 to 2000, Baja California had one hurricane and three tropical storms make landfall. During the same period, Baja California Sur witnessed nineteen hurricanes and thirty tropical storms. During the same time period, the region got hit by two major hurricanes ([[1967 Pacific hurricane season|Hurricane Oliva in 1967]] and [[Hurricane Kiko (1989)|Hurricane Kiko in 1989]]).{{EPAC hurricane best track}} The most expensive storm in the area is [[Hurricane Odile (2014)|Hurricane Odile in 2014]] and the deadliest is [[Hurricane Liza (1976)|Hurricane Liza in 1976]].

==Tropical cyclone warnings and watches==
If a tropical cyclone threatens to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to areas in the Baja California Peninsula, the [[Government of Mexico|government]] issues [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches]] for the threatened areas. The watches and warnings will be issued in coastal area between internationally recognized points known as [[breakpoint (meteorology)|breakpoints]]. The Baja California Peninsula has twenty-two breakpoints, running from the [[United States-Mexico border]], south along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast to [[Cabo San Lucas]], and north along the [[Gulf of California]] coast to [[Calamajue]].&lt;ref name=breakpoints&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints.shtml?gm |title=Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watch/Warning Breakpoints |date=2006-08-08 |publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]] |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627023712/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints.shtml?gm |archivedate=June 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tropical cyclones can still bring dangerous conditions such as flooding to areas not covered by warnings and watches.

The following is an incomplete list of classical music festivals, which encapsulates [[music festival]]s focused on [[classical music]]. Classical music is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture|Western]] music (both [[Religious music|liturgical]] and [[secular music|secular]]), and has long been played at festival-like settings. It encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the [[early music]] period, which includes the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) era, played at [[early music festival]]s; the [[common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1830), and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras (1804–1910), which included [[opera festival]]s and [[choral]] festivals; and the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] (1901–2000) which includes the [[modernism (music)|modern]] (1890–1930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the [[high modernism|high modern]] (mid 20th-century), and [[contemporary classical music]] festivals or [[postmodern music|postmodern]] (1975–2000) eras, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century. The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as a golden age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Rushton|Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Louis Riel''''' is a historical biography in [[comics]] by Canadian cartoonist [[Chester Brown]], published as a book in 2003 after serializion in 1999–2003.  The story deals with [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] rebel leader [[Louis Riel]]'s antagonistic relationship with the newly established [[Canadian Confederation|Canadian government]].  It begins shortly before the 1869 [[Red River Rebellion]], and ends with Riel's 1885 hanging for [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]].  The book explores Riel's possible [[schizophrenia]]—he believed God had named him Prophet of the New World, destined to lead the Métis people to freedom.

The work is noted for its emotional disengagement, its intentionally flat dialogue, and a minimalist drawing style inspired by that of [[Harold Gray]]'s comic strip ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''.  Unusual for comics of the time, it includes a full scholarly apparatus: a foreword, index, bibliography, and end notes.  The lengthy, hand-lettered appendix provides insight into Brown's creative process and biases and highlights where he changed historical facts to create a more engaging story, such as incorporating a conspiracy theory not widely accepted by historians.  Brown became interested in the issue of property rights while researching the book, which led to a public change in his politics from [[anarchism]] to [[libertarianism]].

Although Brown intended it to be published only in book form, his publisher had him first serialize ''Louis Riel'' as a comic book, which lasted ten issues.  The series was the first comic book to receive a grant from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].  It won a favourable critical reception and three [[Harvey Award]]s.  The serialization sold poorly, but the book version was a surprise bestseller.  Its success played a major part in gaining shelf space for serious [[graphic novel]]s in mainstream North American bookstores.

==Overview==

Subtitled "A Comic-Strip Biography",{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=56}} ''Louis Riel'' looks at [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] rebel leader [[Louis Riel]] and his leadership in the [[Red River Rebellion|Red River]] and [[North-West Rebellion|North-West]] rebellions.  It does not attempt a complete retelling of Riel's life—it omits long periods and ignores many aspects of his personality.  Instead the focus is on his "antagonistic relationship with the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]"{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=47}} from 1869 to 1885.{{sfn|Booker|2010|p=370}}  The story comprises 241 pages of the 271-page book, and is supplemented with a complete [[Critical apparatus|scholarly apparatus]]: a foreword, bibliography, [[index (publishing)|index]], map section and extensive end notes.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=Marshall|2y=2005|3a1=MacDonald|3y=2012|3pp=57–58}}  It has strong [[Historiography|historiographical]] elements, detailing in the appendix the research done and choices made by the author in developing a story.{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|pp=57–58}}

Brown grew up in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], where the majority speaks French, and where Riel is often considered a martyr.  However Brown, who grew up speaking only English,{{sfn|Weisblott|2008}} said he was largely ignorant of Riel's story{{Sfn|Sim|2003a|p=23}} until he read [[Maggie Siggins]]' 1994 biography ''Louis Riel: A Life of Revolution''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hajdu|1y=2009/2010|2a1=Epp|2y=2002}}  Many of Brown's favourite topics are entwined in ''Louis Riel'': [[anti-authoritarianism]], outsider religion, [[insanity]], and accuracy and objectivity in nonfiction.{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  A central incident in the book is an eight-panel sequence in which Riel has a revelatory experience on a hilltop in Washington, D.C.  He experiences visions and talks to God, who declares him Prophet of the New World and instructs him to lead his people to freedom.  On the cover of the book, however, we see Riel standing alone in the wilderness, staring into the sky, leaving open the question of whether what he witnessed was real.{{sfn|Wolk|2007|p=155}}

==Background==

{{Quote box
|quote  = "I read {{interp|''Louis Riel: A Life of Revolution''}} and thought, 'That's a good dramatic story—it'd make a good strip.'"
|source = Chester Brown, interview with [[Dave Sim]] (2003){{sfnm|1a1=Sim|1y=2003a|1p=23|2a1=Hajdu|2y=2009/2010}}
|width = 25em}}

In 1995, Brown published the [[anti-psychiatry]] comics essay "[[The Little Man (comics)#My Mom was a Schizophrenic|My Mom was a Schizophrenic]]", in which he examines society's role in mental illness, and questions the medical profession's accepted beliefs about it.{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}  The six-page strip came with two pages of end notes gathered from his research.  Brown enjoyed this project and thought he would like to take on another in which he could "cram a lot of research into a comic strip".{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=164}}  When he came across Siggins' biography of Riel, he had been working on the experimental ''[[Underwater (comics)|Underwater]]'' series, a project on which he felt he had lost his way.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=162}}  His father died in late 1997, and he decided he did not "want to waste {{interp|his}} time with projects that weren't working out".{{sfn|Tousley|2005}}  In 1998, he turned his attention to Riel,{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=164}} putting the unpopular ''Underwater'' series on hold.{{sfn|Arnold|2004-06-28}}

While researching, Brown came across two books by political scientist [[Tom Flanagan (political scientist)|Tom Flanagan]]: ''Louis "David" Riel: "Prophet of the New World"'' (1996) and ''Louis Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000).  Brown found ''"Prophet of the New World"'' particularly intriguing as it dealt with Riel's religious ideas while reevaluating his alleged diagnosis of mental illness,{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=164}} two topics Brown had especial interest in, as he had previously made "eccentric" [[Chester Brown's Gospel adaptations|adaptations of the Gospel]], and comics dealing with his mother's [[schizophrenia]].{{sfn|Wolk|2004}}  He also came across books by researcher Don McLean and historian Douglas N. Sprague that advanced the [[conspiracy theory]] that the 1885 North-West Rebellion was deliberately provoked by Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] to gain support for the building of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway#Building the railway, 1881–1885|transcontinental railway]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=164–165}}

Brown had gained a reputation for improvised storytelling by the time he began work on ''Louis Riel''.  With ''Underwater'', he had intended to write a script, but in the end chose to improvise.  He found the results unsatisfactory, and decided to write a full script beforehand for his next project.  The script for ''Louis Riel'' came to over 200 pages.{{sfnm|1a1=Epp|1y=2002|2a1=Wivel|2y=2011b}}

Brown's was not the first depiction of the Métis leader in comics.  [[James Simpkins]], a Canadian cartoonist best known for Jasper the Bear, made a mildly anti-Riel two-page strip in 1967,{{sfn|Brown|May 2002|p=25}} and Pierre Dupuis produced a French-language two-page summary in 1979.{{sfn|Brown|October 2002|p=24}}  A 23-page pro-Riel strip appeared in ''Canadian History Comic Book No. 2: Rebellion'' in 1972.{{sfn|Brown|February 2003|p=24}}  In 1980, Italian artist [[Hugo Pratt]] created a character called [[Jesuit Joe]] who was supposed to have descended from Riel.{{sfn|Paquin|2006|p=8}}  Publishing house Les Éditions des Plaines published two books on Riel: Robert Freynet's 58-page {{lang|fr|Louis Riel en bande dessinée}}{{efn

==Plot==

&lt;!--

     PLEASE KEEP IN MIND that this is a summary of events as they happened in Brown's book

--&gt;[[File:Canada provinces 1870-1871.png|right|thumb|alt=Map of Canada, 1870–1871|Canada in 1870, after [[Manitoba]] (square in lower centre) was [[Manitoba Act|admitted]] into Confederation following the [[Red River Rebellion]] ]]

The government of the [[Canadian Confederation|new Dominion of Canada]] (established 1867), under Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, has made a deal with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to purchase [[Rupert's Land]]—vast tracts of land in northern North America.  The French-speaking Métis—people who are half [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native]], half [[White people|white]], and inhabit parts of Rupert's Land—dispute that their land can be sold to the Canadians without their consent.  In the [[Red River Colony|Red River settlement]], the Métis, led by Louis Riel, dodge political manoeuverings on the part of Lieutenant Governor [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]] and some of the English-speaking settlers, while seizing [[Fort Garry]].  After an armed standoff at English-speaking settler [[John Christian Schultz|John Schultz]]'s home, the Métis declare a provisional government and vote Riel their president, with an even number of French and English representatives.{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  Schultz escapes from prison and rounds up a number of men with the intention of freeing the prisoners from Fort Garry, but when Riel lets the prisoners go, Schultz's men set out for home.  On the way, a number of them pass Fort Garry, where they are captured and imprisoned.  One of the prisoners, Thomas Scott, relentlessly quarrels with the guards, showering them with racial epithets.  Eventually, the provisional government convicts him of treason and executes him by firing squad.  The remaining prisoners are released, and the provisional government enters into negotiations with Ottawa, which results in the founding of the province of [[Manitoba]].  They are unable to get an [[amnesty]] for the execution of Scott, however.  The Canadian army arrives, ostensibly to keep the peace.  Riel flees to the U.S., and the anglophone population assumes governance.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}

Schultz takes control of Manitoba, and the government of [[Ontario]] offers a cash reward for Riel's capture, dead or alive.  Macdonald secretly sends Riel money to disappear, as his death would lose him votes in Quebec but allowing him to live would cost him votes in English Canada.  Riel flees from town to town in the U.S. as [[bounty hunter]]s try to track him down.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}  In 1873, he returns to the Manitoba and wins a seat in the federal [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] in a by-election. He fears actually sitting in parliament because there is still a bounty on his head, and continues to live in hiding.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}  In 1874, he wins his seat again.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}  Schultz wins a seat in the settlement as well, however, and [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] has become Prime Minister, running on promises not to grant the rebels an amnesty.  Riel is expelled from Parliament for failing to sit, but wins his seat again in the next by-election.  The frustrated government finally extends an amnesty to the rebels—all except Riel, whose amnesty is conditional on a five-year banishment from Canada.  During his exile, he has a [[Vision (spirituality)|visionary experience]] on a hilltop in Washington, D.C., in which God names him David, the Prophet of the New World,{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}} and tells him to lead the Métis to freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Arnold|1y=2003-05-30|2a1=Wolk|2y=2007|2p=155}}  In 1876, Riel is secretly committed by a friend to a lunatic asylum near Montréal under a false name.{{sfn|Wolk|2007|p=153}}

[[File:Battle of Batoche Print by Seargent Grundy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Print of the Battle of Batoche|Contemporary print of the [[Battle of Batoche]], on which Brown based the cover to ''Louis Riel'' {{No.}}8 ]]

Over the next several years, the Métis, unhappy with the Canadian government's handling of their land rights, move farther west across the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]].{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  There as well, they see their petitions to the government repeatedly ignored and their rights trampled on.  Finally, after being ignored for too long, the Métis search for Riel in [[Montana]], in the hope that his return will force the Canadians to take their claims seriously.  He is reluctant at first, as he has started a family and settled down as a schoolmaster.  In the hopes that he will get money from the Canadian government for his tenure administering the Red River settlement (by this time known as [[Winnipeg]]), he moves his family to [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]] (now in [[Saskatchewan]]) in mid-1884.  Macdonald has returned to the prime ministership and conspires with [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], president of the financially burdened [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], to use the situation to gain support for finishing the railway.  By inciting a violent revolt amongst the Métis, the government can justify funding the railway to move troops to the Prairies.{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  The Métis under Riel respond with arms as intended.  Riel declares "Rome has fallen!" and breaks from the Catholic Church.  He breathes the [[Holy Spirit]] into his followers, thereafter known as the [[Exovedate]].  Tensions build until the bloodshed at the [[Battle of Duck Lake]], where Riel and his followers drive back the [[North-West Mounted Police]].  Macdonald takes this as a cue to send two thousand troops to the area.  At the [[Battle of Fish Creek]], the outnumbered Métis manage to drive back the Canadians, but at the [[Battle of Batoche]], while Riel is increasingly immersed in religious activities, the Métis finally suffer defeat.  In the hope that his trial will provide an opportunity to get the Métis' story to the public, Riel surrenders instead of fleeing.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=2005|2a1=Wivel|2y=2011a}}

In July 1885, Riel is put on trial in Regina for his role as leader in the North-West Rebellion.{{sfn|Lander|2005|p=117}}  Against his will, Riel's lawyer tries unsuccessfully to defend him on grounds of insanity.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}  He is found guilty of [[Treason Act 1351|high treason]].  Though the jury pleads for mercy, he is sentenced to hang.  In response to the pleas of Quebeckers to pardon Riel, Macdonald responds, "He shall hang though every dog in Quebec bark in his favour".{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}}  After reconciling himself with the Church, Riel is hanged in Regina on 16&amp;nbsp;November 1885.{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  In the aftermath, the remaining rebels receive a pardon, Macdonald and Stephen continue in their success, and Riel's wife dies.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}

===Louis Riel===

Riel (1844–85) was a French-speaking Métis politician from a devoutly Catholic background.{{sfn|Stanley|1963|pp=13–20}}  He founded and named the Province of Manitoba (a [[Cree language|Cree]] word meaning "the god that speaks"{{sfn|Epp|2002}}{{efn|Other translations contradict the one given here (see [[Manitoba]]), but "the god that speaks" is the translation Riel's character gives in the story.}}).  He led the two Métis rebellions against the Canadian government: the Red River Rebellion of 1869–70 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885.  Following the latter, he was hanged for high treason.{{sfn|Johnson|2012b}} Riel remains an ambiguous and controversial figure in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], and Brown's depiction maintains that ambiguity.{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}}

Riel is depicted as charismatic.  He is Montréal-educated and speaks English, which makes him a natural leader to the Métis,{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}} though his leadership is flawed—he ignores the military advice of his peers in battle, placing his faith in God that the Métis will defeat the Canadians.{{sfn|Shulgan|2003}}  Brown depicts him as having a [[Messiah complex|messianic complex]] and possibly having schizophrenia.{{sfn|Wolk|2007|p=153}}  He is unsure of himself, averse to bloodshed, and easily convinced to flee to the U.S. to avoid capture.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}

===John A. Macdonald===

Macdonald (1815–91) was the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]], in office 1867–73, and again 1878–91.{{sfn|Johnson|2012a}}  Brown depicts the Prime Minister in the role of scheming villain and [[caricature]]s his features in an absurd manner, giving him an extremely oversized nose{{sfnm|1a1=Arnold|1y=2003-05-30|2a1=Shulgan|2y=2003}} and showing him as a drunk.  He is a man of ambitions and will not let anyone stand in the way of his legacy.  In the appendix, however, Brown discloses that he does not see Macdonald as the villain he has portrayed in the book.{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}}  Brown's distrust of [[big government]] leads him to push the conspiracy theory side of the story to Macdonald's detriment, but, in the end, he states that he "would rather have lived in a state run by John A. Macdonald than one run by Louis Riel".{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1p=166|2a1=Park|2y=2011}}

''Louis Riel'' is noted for its emotional restraint,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=Wolk|2y=2007|2p=154}} and intentionally flat and expository dialogue.{{sfn|Wolk|2007|p=154}}  To critic Rich Kreiner the book "has been rigorously scrubbed of staged drama and crowd-pleasing effects".{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}  It avoids manipulation of the reader by invoking sympathy or sentiment.  Brown takes a distanced approach and relies faithfully on his source material—he focuses on the concrete and corporeal and eschews techniques of speculation such as thought balloons.  This includes his presentation of Riel's mystical experiences, which Brown presents plainly and without interpretation of its reality or lack thereof.{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}

The book makes frequent deliberate use of silent panels, focused on imagery{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=165}} with the narrative moved forward by the characters' actions.  Riel's "despairs over the decisions he makes" are expressed through pictures, as Brown had come to believe that historical comics had been too "narration-heavy".{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=46}}  He wanted ''Louis Riel'' "to show what the medium is capable of",{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=46}} and made use of greater panel-to-panel continuity.{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=47}}  While the grid of panels gives a feeling of page symmetry, the pages are not composed as a unit—scenes change anywhere on the page with little regard to page layout.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}

Printed on yellowish paper,{{sfnm|1a1=Booker|1y=2010|1p=370|2a1=Hajdu|2y=2009/2010|3a1=Kreiner|3y=2004}} each page conforms strictly to a rhythmic six-panel grid,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=Booker|2y=2010|2p=370|3a1=Wolk|3y=2004|4a1=Wivel|4y=2011a}} in contrast to the free placement of panels that characterized Brown's [[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics|autobiographical period]].{{sfn|Paquin|2006|p=9}}  Tone and mood are set by the composition of the panels, as during Riel's trial when all tonal variation is dropped, and the white figures are placed against a heavy black background,{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}} which emphasizes the claustrophobic atmosphere.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}

Brown makes the language barriers that separate the characters visual by having Riel drop the letter "h" in his dialogue (e.g. "over t'e last several days") and by putting French-language dialogue in ⟨[[Bracket#Angle brackets or chevrons ⟨ ⟩|chevron brackets]]⟩ and [[Cree language]] dialogue in ⟨⟨double-chevrons⟩⟩.  He shows Riel, who was an educated and sophisticated speaker of French, struggling with English.  These touches emphasize that English was not yet a dominant language in the regions in which the story unfolds.{{sfn|Marshall|2005}}  Brown uses consistent semantics in his [[speech balloon]]s; the size and weight of the dialogue varies according to speech patterns, and sound effects vary according to how close they are to the reader.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}

Brown's drawing style had always changed from project to project.{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  He frequently cited [[Harold Gray]] of ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' as the primary influence on the drawing style of ''Louis Riel''—restrained artwork which avoids extreme closeups,{{sfn|Heer|2003}} and blank-eyed characters with large bodies, small heads, and oversized noses.{{sfnm|1a1=Booker|1y=2010|1p=370|2a1=Arnold|2y=2003-05-30|3a1=Wolk|3y=2007|3p=153}}  Gray's drawing and compositional style was well suited to the subject of ''Louis Riel''.  Gray often used his strip as a public platform for politics, and ''Louis Riel'' was also very public and outward-looking.  This approach is in great contrast to the inward-looking comics Brown had previously been known for—notably his autobiographical work.  His [[Hatching|cross-hatching]] style was reminiscent of the editorial cartoonists of Riel's time.  Gray's outdoor scenes were inspired by the Illinois plains of Gray's youth, terrain similar to that of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2009}}

Brown also acknowledges significant debts to [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]]'s historical comics,{{sfn|Rogers|2011|loc=part 8}} [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'',{{sfn|Lander|2005|p=119}} and the extremely exaggerated style of [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe|Cartoon History of the Universe]]''.{{sfn|Wivel|2011b}}  He says he referred to [[Jack Hamm]]'s ''How to Draw Animals'' when drawing the horses that appear frequently throughout the book,{{sfn|Sim|2003c|p=46}} which were rendered running with their legs splayed, as an artist may have depicted them in the days before the influence of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s photographs of bodies in motion.{{sfn|Wivel|2011a}}  Brown drew each of the 1325{{sfn|Paquin|2006|p=8}} panels separately on watercolour paper{{sfn|Tousley|2005}} on a block of wood he placed on his lap in lieu of a [[Drawing board|drawing table]],{{sfn|Shulgan|2003}} which allowed him seamlessly to rearrange, insert, and delete panels as he saw fit.{{sfn|Wivel|2011b}}  The drawings were [[Inker|finished]] using both a thin [[ink brush]] (no larger than size 0) and [[dip pen]] with a [[Speedball (art products)|Hunt]] 102 [[nib (pen)|nib]] and black ink.{{sfn|Toronto Public Library staff|2005}}

===Appendices===

[[File:Thomas Bland Strange.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of [[Thomas Bland Strange]]|[[Thomas Bland Strange]]'s appearance is ahistorical, but his name amused Brown.]]

When he began ''Louis Riel'', Brown had increasingly been making use of notes and appendices in his work,{{sfn|Park|2011}} beginning with his researching and annotating the 1994 comics essay, "My Mom was a Schizophrenic".{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1p=164|2a1=Park|2y=2011}}  He added appendices to the 1998 collection of short strips, ''[[The Little Man (comics)|The Little Man]]'', and the 2002 reprinting of ''[[I Never Liked You]]''.{{sfn|Park|2011}}  In ''Louis Riel'', the appendix totalled 23 pages, along with a bibliography and an index.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=166}}  [[Alan Moore]]'s use of extensive end notes in his and [[Eddie Campbell]]'s ''[[From Hell]]'', another fictional reconstruction of a historical event, influenced Brown's appendices.{{sfn|Epp|2002}}  In the comics essay "Dance of the Gull Catchers" which closes the ''From Hell'' appendices, Moore metaphorically reveals to the reader the myriad choices he could have made from the available historical evidence when putting together his version of the [[Jack the Ripper]] story.{{sfn|MacDonald|2012|p=58}}

Allowing him to "tell the best story and tell the truth",{{Sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}} Brown's notes were self-reflexive, and drew attention to the artistic choices he made when putting together the book.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=Bell|2y=2006|2p=166}}  Brown makes explicit the inaccuracies in the book,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=Wolk|2y=2007|2p=155|3a1=Kreiner|3y=2004}} as when he realized his drawings of William McDougall did not match up with descriptions of him by biographers as a "portly" and "heavily built man".{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=47}}  Brown chose not to redraw McDougall's scenes, deciding he "could live with that level of inaccuracy".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutcheon|1y=2010|1p=47|2a1=MacDonald|2y=2012|p=58}}  He also admits that he deliberately changed some of the historical details, as when he has Prime Minister Macdonald in talks with the Hudson's Bay Company in London—Macdonald was not in London at that time and did not directly participate in the negotiations.  In other instances, Brown noted where he paid special care to historical details: the dialogue of [[Trial of Louis Riel|Riel's trial]] comes directly from court transcripts.{{sfn|Hutcheon|2010|p=48}}  Brown makes clear in his notes the amount of research undertaken for the book, emphasizing both its authenticity and his desire to show the different aspects of Riel's ambiguous story.{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}}  Many of his changes were made for space considerations, as he intended to limit the book to about two hundred pages.{{sfn|Wivel|2011b}}

The notes range from nearly insignificant details to major discrepancies and deliberate distortions.{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}  They have a self-deprecatory tone that is common in North American comics, tracing its roots to the awkwardly self-aware [[underground comix]] of the 1960s and 1970s.  They also reveal Brown's process in shaping the story from conflicting sources.{{sfn|Lander|2005|p=119}}  He acknowledges some of the more capricious details.  He explains he was not committed to the conspiracy theory he presented, but included it in order to present Macdonald in a certain light: "[V]illains are fun in a story", he said, and he was "trying to tell this tale in an engaging manner".{{sfn|Park|2011}}  He also included a "Major-General [[Thomas Bland Strange]]" in an 1885 meeting at which the general was not actually present.  Brown explains that he included Strange because he was amused by the Major-General's name.{{sfn|Park|2011}}

==Publication history==

[[File:Kobo ereader touch black front.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of Kobo e-reader|Brown's ''Louis Riel'' and ''[[Paying for It]]'' were the first two [[Drawn and Quarterly]] comics to become available for e-readers, in a non-exclusive deal with [[Kobo Inc.]] ]]

Brown originally meant ''Louis Riel'' to be published in book form, but his publisher, Chris Oliveros, convinced him to serialize it first.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1p=165|2a1=MacDonald|2y=2004}}  [[Drawn and Quarterly]] published the ten comic-book instalments from 1999 until 2003.{{sfn|Booker|2010|p=369}}  Brown was granted [[Canadian dollar|CA$]]6000 by the [[Canada Council|Canadian Council for the Arts]] in 2001 to assist in its completion.{{sfnm|1a1=Weisblott|1y=2008|2a1=Canada Council staff|2y=2002|2p=29}}  The full volume appeared in hardcover in 2003 and softcover in 2006.{{sfn|Booker|2010|p=370}}  The book sold out its first printing in two months,{{sfn|Arnold|2004-04-12}} went through multiple printings, and had sold fifty thousand copies by the beginning of 2011.{{sfn|Adams|2011}}  The original serialization sold poorly, which made the book's success a surprise.{{sfn|McGillis|2011}}

The comic book and the collection both came with an extensive appendix, and the collection came with a bibliography and an index, all hand-lettered by Brown.{{sfnm|1a1=Shulgan|1y=2003|2a1=Park|2y=2011|3a1=Wolk|3y=2004|4a1=Kreiner|4y=2004}}  The collection's appendix came to 22 pages.{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}

In the original serialization, as the series progressed the influence of Harold Gray became stronger.  The characters' heads became smaller while their bodies and hands grew larger, with Riel appearing "like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in a wool suit" after his hilltop religious revelation.{{sfn|Arnold|2003-05-30}}  Brown redrew many of the earlier drawings to make them consistent with the later ones in the collected edition.{{sfnm|1a1=Kreiner|1y=2004|2a1=Tousley|2y=2005}}  He added backgrounds, redrew,{{sfn|Shulgan|2003}} added or deleted panels to improve page rhythms or make chapter divisions cleaner,{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}} and reshaped or relettered word ballons.  Dialogue remained intact for the most part, although the slur "frog" for the French-speaking Métis was replaced with "half-breed".{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}

In 2012, Drawn and Quarterly first began offering comics in [[e-book]] format, prompted in part by Brown.  His ''Louis Riel'' and ''[[Paying for It]]'' were the first two books made available,{{sfnm|1a1=Reid|1y=2011|2a1=ICTMN Staff|2y=2012}} though Brown is a print-lover who professes little interest in e-books, or computers in general.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2012}}  The non-exclusive deal was made with Toronto-based [[Kobo Inc.]]{{sfn|ICTMN Staff|2012}}  A tenth-anniversary edition in 2013 included sketches and other supplemental material.{{sfn|Collins|2016}}

French and Italian editions appeared in 2004—the Italian from [[Coconino Press]]{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=166}} and the French from the Belgian publisher [[Casterman]].  To appeal to francophones in Europe, where Riel is not well known, Casterman had the book titled ''Louis Riel: l'insurgé'' (''"Louis Riel: Rebel"'').  The Montreal-based publisher [[La Pastèque]] obtained the rights to the book and re-released it as ''Louis Riel'' with a different cover in 2012.{{sfn|Slobod|2015|p=82}}

==Reception and legacy==

Though not the first work of biography in comics, Louis Riel was the first completed of its length and depth.{{sfn|Lanzendörfer|2011|p=27}}  The book sold well,{{sfnm|1a1=MacKay|1y=2011|2a1=Adams|2y=2011}} and became the first graphic novel to reach Canada's non-fiction bestseller list.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1p=166|2a1=Baker|2a2=Atkinson|2y=2004|3a1=Collins|3y=2016}}  A critical and commercial success,{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=166}} it was especially popular with libraries and schools.{{sfn|Adams|2011}}  Comics academic Jeet Heer states that it has perhaps sold more copies in Canada than any other graphic novel.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2009}}  ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it "a strong contender for the best graphic novel ever",{{sfn|Bethune|2004}} ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included it in its annual Best Comix list in 2003,{{sfn|Arnold|2003-12-18}} and, in 2009, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' placed it on its list of the ten best books of "The Century So Far".{{sfn|Smith|2009}}  It is regularly cited as being at the forefront of a trend in historical graphic novels, along with [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'' and [[Marjane Satrapi]]'s ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Lander|1y=2005|2a1=Wright|2y=2009}}

Especially in Canada, ''Louis Riel'' brought Brown out of the fringes into the mainstream,{{sfn|Adams|2011}} and also attracted more serious attention to graphic novels.{{sfn|Hajdu|2009/2010}}  It was the first work of comics to receive a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts (although Brown's libertarian politics have led him to condemn the government for handing out grants{{sfn|Weisblott|2008}}), and helped pave the way for the Council's special category for graphic novels.{{sfn|Doane|2004}}  The book was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] for a movie by [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]] and another film director, though the project never started filming.{{sfn|Rogers|2011|loc=part 4}}

Researching Riel had a significant impact on Brown's thinking.  When he started the book, he considered himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].  His intention was to write an anti-government book, and had a bias in Riel's favour—despite what Brown considered Riel's own political conservatism—as Riel opposed the government.  Over the course of drawing the book, he came to sympathize more with Macdonald.{{sfn|Wivel|2011b}}  His reading led him in 1998 to ''The Noblest Triumph: Property and Prosperity Through the Ages'' by [[Tom Bethell]], which led him change his own politics to favour [[libertarianism]].  He later ran for parliament as representative of the [[Libertarian Party of Canada]], to the dismay of his friends.{{sfn|Weisblott|2008}}  At one point, after Brown had started drawing the book, he tried to rewrite the script to reflect his changed perspective, but found it too difficult and stayed with the original script.  He revealed his new beliefs only in the appendix.{{sfn|Wivel|2011b}}

Reviewer Dennis Duffy commended Brown's research, but stated Brown "often cheats" in assigning forethought to Macdonald's action unattested in historical documents.{{sfn|Duffy|2004/2005|p=447}}  Critic Rich Kreiner found that Brown's disengaged approach to ''Louis Riel'' invited a [[Reader-response criticism|reader-response]] approach to reading it.  As an example, it was the impetus for an in-depth, three-part interview conducted by [[Dave Sim]] in the pages of his comic book ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'', which Sim uses as an opportunity to apply his own idiosyncratic views to an interpretation of events in Brown's book.{{efn|Sim's interview with Brown appears in ''Cerebus'' {{No.}}295–297.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=166}} }}{{sfn|Kreiner|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14777">The '''[[meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions]] (MICE) industry in Thailand''' is one of the major branches of [[tourism in Thailand]], contributing an estimated 0.58 percent to Thailand's GDP in 2012 (9.4% of all tourism earnings).&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite web |title=M.I.C.E.

== Overview ==
The number of tourists in the MICE sector is around three percent of the overall arrivals to Thailand each year. They are recognized as the most desirable category of visitors, mainly because of their high-spending potential. The average spending of tourists in this sector is three times higher than spending of tourists in other sectors.&lt;ref name="Kom Campiranon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding crisis vulnerability of the MICE sector: A case study of Thailand |author=Kom Campiranon |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |date=2006 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv.php?pid=UQ:7829&amp;dsID=kc_mice.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand benefits from its geographic position between China and India&lt;ref name="TET"&gt;{{cite web |title=Thailand sets a MICE trap |author=Sudipto Dey |website=[[The Economic Times]] |date=9 August 2006 |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-08-09/news/27458534_1_exhibition-industry-thailand-convention-thailand-sets |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tops the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] region in terms of exhibition spaces sold and for being the most profitable MICE market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand unveils MICE initiatives |author=Sangeeth Sebastian |work=[[India Today]] |date=8 September 2011 |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/thailand-unveils-mice-initiatives/1/150526.html |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Thailand hosted more than 7,300 meeting events (a 6.84 percent increase from 2011), totaling 895,000 visitors. The main sources were conventions (33 percent), corporate meetings (25 percent) and incentive travel (24 percent), adding the equivalent of more than US$2.5 billion to the [[economy of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="GT" /&gt; Around 65 percent of Thailand’s MICE business came from Asian countries. India was the most frequent MICE customer, with 74,941 meetings visitors in 2012, followed by China (63,955), Japan (45,424) and Korea (37,175). The United States was on the eighth place, sending 21,786 delegates in 2012.&lt;ref name="GT" /&gt;

In 2013, the number of visitors surpassed one million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turmoil Costing Thailand Conference Business |author=Newley Purnell |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304811904579587662790829236 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 72 percent from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand sees surge in Mideast Mice visitors |work=Travel and Tourism News |date=May 2014 |url=http://www.ttnworldwide.com/Article/14978/Thailand_sees_surge_in_Mideast_Mice_visitors |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was the main contributor, both by number of travelers (128,437) and revenue (US$360 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thailand targets China's MICE travelers |work=[[China Daily]] |date=17 April 2014 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-04/17/content_17442669.htm |accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large scale events, such as conferences and conventions, can have a significant environmental impact in terms of energy usage, water consumption, waste, and carbon emissions. Thus, the [[Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau]] (TCEB) launched the "Green Meetings" campaign in 2009. However, the understanding of many event planners and industry players regarding environmentally sustainable events and meetings remains lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Buathong |first=Kantapop |last2=Lai |first2=Pei-Chun |date=2017-07-01 |title=Perceived Attributes of Event Sustainability in the MICE Industry in Thailand: A Viewpoint from Governmental, Academic, Venue and Practitioner |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/7/1151 |journal=Sustainability |language=en |volume=9 |issue=7 |pages=1151 |doi=10.3390/su9071151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Bkksirikitconvcentr0905a.jpg|thumb|285px|[[Queen Sirikit National Convention Center]]]]

In most Asia/Pacific countries (including Thailand), governments lead the way in the construction of MICE facilities. The private sector is generally leads the development of conference and exhibition centres in countries where governments have few financial resources (Indonesia and Mekong sub-region).&lt;ref name="PATA"&gt;{{cite web |title=MICE comes of age in Asia Pacific (Issues &amp; Trends, Volume 16, Issue III) |author= |website=[[Pacific Asia Travel Association]] |date=July 2011 |url=http://patachina.org/ziyuan |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thailand, in 1984, the government and private sectors jointly established the "Thailand Incentive and Convention Association" (TICA), in order to support the growth of the MICE sector.&lt;ref name="Kom Campiranon" /&gt; It cooperated with 'Trade Exhibition Association Thailand' (TEA) and some medical associations to draw meetings and seminars to be held in Thailand. These associations had some help from the government, but the government had not yet seen MICE as an opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meeting, Incentive, Convention and Exhibition (MICE) industry in Thailand: an assessment of convention and exhibition centers in Bangkok |author=Pavit Tansakul |website=[[Academia.edu]] |date=2008 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1406934/Meeting_Incentive_Convention_and_Exhibition_MICE_industry_in_Thailand_an_assessment_of_convention_and_exhibition_centers_in_Bangkok_2008_ |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[Queen Sirikit National Convention Center]], one of the main convention centers in East Asia, opened.&lt;ref name="PATA" /&gt;

In 2002, the [[Royal Thai Government]] established the Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB) under the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]], as the organization to market MICE events in Thailand. One of the bureau's roles is to encourage the inclusion of Thai arts and culture in these events in order to promote the national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businesseventsthailand.com/about-us/vision-mission/ |title=Vision &amp; Mission |website=Thailand Convention &amp; Exhibition Bureau |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCEB identified five major MICE cities: ([[Bangkok]], [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]], [[Khon Kaen]], [[Pattaya]], [[Chiang Mai]]).&lt;ref name="Look East"&gt;{{cite news |title=Khon Kaen Helps Raise Northeast Thailand's Profile for Mice Events |author=Imtiaz Muqbil |work=Look East Magazine |date=11 November 2013 |url=http://www.lookeastmagazine.com/2013/11/khon-kaen-helps-raise-northeast-thailands-profile-for-mice-events/ |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations involved in the development of the MICE sector in Thailand are [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT) and [[Thai Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Thai MICE |website=[[Thai Airways]] |url=http://www.thaiairways.com/en/mice/index.page |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2006 TIPREX.jpg|thumb|240px|2006 TIPREX at [[Bangkok International Trade and Exhibition Centre|BITEC]]]]

[[Bangkok]] is the administrative, education, commercial and transport center of the country, and a regional center for business, finance and communications, many international corporations having offices here. The city is the hub of Thailand's commercial events industry, with 299 hotels in the city center and seven world-standard convention and exhibition centers. [[Bangkok International Trade and Exhibition Centre]] (BITEC) focuses on machinery and trade shows. [[Impact, Muang Thong Thani|IMPACT]], with a 130,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibition area and a convention center with a 10,000 delegates hosting capacity, mostly takes on consumer shows. Smaller venues such as the [[Siam Paragon#Royal Paragon Hall|Royal Paragon Hall]] and Queen Sirikit National Convention Center usually host lifestyle events.&lt;ref name="TET" /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, [[Pattaya]] became the first Thai resort destination to attract international incentives, mainly from Europe. By the year 2000, Pattaya Exhibition and Convention Hall (PEACH), the largest local convention centre, secured its position as a venue for major conventions and exhibitions. It has been the venue for numerous large-scale conventions, including the [[Pacific Asia Travel Association|PATA]] Travel Mart, PATA annual conference and [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] Tourism Forum as well as major medical and insurance related congresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TCEB identifies Pattaya MICE strategy |author= |publisher=TTR Weekly |date=28 July 2014 |url=http://www.ttrweekly.com/site/2014/07/tceb-identifies-pattaya-mice-strategy/ |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Pattaya Alliance is a group of seven hotels focused on different identities and features that work together in hosting MICE events and Indian weddings.&lt;ref name="NPA" /&gt;

This poster was issued by various branches of the United States Military to educate and prevent domestic abuse.]]
The '''management of domestic violence''' deals with the treatment of victims of [[domestic violence]] and preventing repetitions of such violence. The response to domestic violence in [[Western countries]] is typically a combined effort between law enforcement, social services and health care. The role of each has evolved as domestic violence has been brought more into public view.

Historically, domestic violence has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve the government or [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref name="fagan1995"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf |title=Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits|author=Fagan, Jeffrey |conference=Conference on Criminal Justice Research and Evaluation |year=1995 |booktitle=Research Report |publisher=National Institute of Justice|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were often reluctant to intervene by making an [[arrest]], and often chose instead to simply counsel the couple and/or ask one of the parties to leave the residence for a period of time. The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions on those convicted of domestic violence, largely because it was viewed as a [[misdemeanor]] offense.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The modern view in industrialized countries is that domestic violence should be viewed as a public matter and all criminal authority should be involved; that once the violence is reported it should be taken seriously.  Further, supports need to be put in place to restore the victim's safety and respect, which often includes the efforts of the person who did the harm. 

==Medical response==
Medical professionals can make a difference in the lives of those who experience abuse. Many cases of spousal abuse are handled solely by physicians and do not involve the police. Sometimes cases of domestic violence are brought into the [[emergency room]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subspecialist physicians are also increasingly playing an important role. For example, HIV physicians are ideally suited to play an important role in managing abuse given the association between abuse and HIV infection as well as their often lifelong relationships with patients.&lt;ref name="Siemieniuk 2010 763–770"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Siemieniuk | first1 = R.

Medical professionals are in a position to give advice, and refer them to appropriate services. The health care professional has not always met this role, with uneven quality of care, and in some cases misunderstandings about domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Williamson-p83"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = P. | doi = 10.1080/095892399102841 | title = Women, Health and Domestic Violence | journal = Journal of Gender Studies | volume = 8 | pages = 83–102| year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carole Washaw suggests that many doctors prefer not to get involved in people's "private" lives. Jenny Clifton, John Jacobs, Jo Tulloch found that training for general practitioners in the United States about domestic violence was very limited or they had no training. Abbott and Williamson found that knowledge and understanding of domestic violence was very limited among health care professionals in a [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[United Kingdom]] county, and that they do not see themselves as being able to play a major role in helping women in regards to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Williamson-p83" /&gt; Furthermore, in the biomedical model of health care, injuries are often just treated and diagnosed, without regard for the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Warshaw, C. |year=1993 |chapter=Limitations of the Medical Model in the Care of Battered Women |editors=Bart, P., E. Moran |title=Violence Against Women: The Bloody Footprints |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, there is substantial reluctance for victims to come forward and broach the issue with their physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In the U. S., the Institute of Medicine recognized the shortcomings of the health care system in its 2002 report entitled Confronting Chronic Neglect and attributed some of the problems cited to a lack of adequate training among health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Cohn, F, Salmon, ME, Stobo JD |title=Confronting Chronic Neglect, the Education and Training of Health Professional on Family Violence |year=2002 |publisher=National Academy Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health professionals have an ethical responsibility to recognize and address exposure to abuse in their patients, in the health care setting. For example, the American Medical Association's code of medical ethics states that "Due to the prevalence and medical consequences of family violence, physicians should routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of the medical history. Physicians must also consider abuse in the differential diagnosis for a number of medical complaints, particularly when treating women." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion202.shtml |title=AMA&amp;nbsp;– Opinion 2.02&amp;nbsp;– Abuse of Spouses, Children, Elderly Persons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, studies in Europe and North America showed that domestic violence was widespread in many homes, resulting in emotional and physical trauma, and sometimes death.&lt;ref name="police responses" /&gt; Into the 21st century many countries have taken steps to eradicate domestic violence, such as criminalization of [[violence against women]] and other abuses. Organizations have been formed which provide assistance and protection of domestic abuse victims, laws and criminal remedies, and domestic violence courts.{{refn|For instance, in Spain, the 2004 "The Organic Act on Integrated Protection Measures against Gender Violence" established Courts of "Violence against Women." Spanish Courts may allow to hear the case behind closed doors and that proceedings should not be made public, order a person accused of gender violence to leave the abode he shared with his victim, suspend the alleged perpetrator of acts of gender violence from exercising parental authority, custody or guardianship with regard to the minors he or she specifies, and may order the suspension of the right to possess weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo1-2004.t5.html#c4 Ley Orgánica 1/2004, de 28 de diciembre, de Medidas de Protección Integral contra la Violencia de Género].

World Health Organization. 2010. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although acts of domestic violence are criminal and a violation of human rights, safety and dignity, as of 2010 the United Nation has found that it is still often considered a private matter. Some countries with laws against domestic violence may not enforce them and there are many countries that do not [[Criminalization|criminalize]] domestic violence. The [[United Nations]] published ''Handbook on Effective Responses to Violence against Women'' for police and other first responders to provide guidelines for police intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf ''Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women.''] Criminal Justice Handbook Series. World Health Organization. 2010. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there are laws against domestic violence, such abuse is often under-reported.&lt;ref name="police responses p. 13" /&gt; The reasons for not reporting may include that the victim does not want to end the relationship, report the violence or pursue legal remedies include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf ''Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women.''] Criminal Justice Handbook Series.

According to the United Nations'''Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women'': "Without clearly targeted efforts to alter institutional culture and practices and to mainstream the issue of gender in legislation and practice, most legal and political reforms have little positive impact." An effective system requires "cooperative, coordinated and effective
involvement" of law enforcement, communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), courts, and prisons.&lt;ref name="police responses p. 13"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf ''Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women.''] Criminal Justice Handbook Series.

==Counseling==

===Counseling for victim===
Due to the extent and prevalence of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists are encouraged to assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated). If the clinician is seeing a couple for couple's counseling, this assessment should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial interview, in order to increase the victim's sense of safety in disclosing any violence in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawson | first1 = D. M. | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6678.2003.tb00221.x | title = Incidence, Explanations, and Treatment of Partner Violence | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 81 | pages = 19–99 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to determining whether violence is present, counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations where battering may have been a single, isolated incident or an ongoing pattern of control. The therapist must, however, consider that violence may be present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"/&gt;

Another important issue in assessing clients for domestic violence lies in differing definitions of abuse&amp;nbsp;– the therapist's definition may differ from that of the client, and paying close attention to the way the client describes their experiences is crucial in developing effective treatment plans. The therapist must determine if it is in the best interest of the client to explain that some behaviors (such as emotional abuse) are considered domestic violence, even if the client did not previously consider them as such.

If it becomes apparent to the therapist that domestic violence is taking place in a client's relationship, there are several statements the clinician can make that have been shown to be effective in rapport-building and immediate crisis intervention with clients. Firstly, it is essential that the therapist believe the victim's story and validate their feelings. It is recommended that the therapist acknowledge them for taking a risk in disclosing this information, and assure them that any ambivalent feelings they may be having are normal. The therapist should emphasize that the abuse they have experienced is not their fault, but should keep their feelings of ambivalence in mind and refrain from blaming their partner or telling them what to do. It is unreasonable for the therapist to expect that a victim will leave their perpetrator solely because they disclosed the abuse, and the therapist should respect the victim's autonomy and allow them to make their own decisions regarding termination of the relationship. Finally, the therapist must explore options with the client (such as emergency housing in shelters, police involvement, etc.) in order to uphold their obligation to protect the welfare of the client.&lt;ref name="Lawson 2003 19–33"/&gt;

====Lethality assessment====
A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of victims of attempted domestic violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Jacquelyn C. | title = Safety Planning Based on Lethality Assessment for Partners of Batterers in Intervention Programs | journal = [[Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment &amp; Trauma]] | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–143 | year = September 2001 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1300/J146v05n02_08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, lethality assessment is an essential first step in assessing the severity of a victim's situation.

====Safety planning====
Safety planning allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator. Safety planning usually begins with determining a course of action if another acute incident occurs in the home. The victim should be given strategies for their own safety, such as avoiding confrontations in rooms where there is only one exit and avoiding certain rooms that contain many potential weapons (such as kitchens, bathrooms, etc.).&lt;ref name="azcadv.org"&gt;{{cite web

Gender specific groups (male offenders only or female offenders only) are common in the field.  Groups can be helpful to establish group norms that are contrary to the use of violence that, in turn, create a context where offenders are held accountable to their own values in a respectful manner. Successful completion of groups is generally associated with old age, higher levels of education, lower reported drug use, non-violent criminal histories, and longer intimate relationships.&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;Pollard, Carrie (2004).

Along with offering group conversations, others incorporate individual and conjoint conversations to assist in ending the violence and repairing the harms. One such approach, which focuses on [[restorative justice]], is highlighted in the critically acclaimed documentary [[A Better Man (film)|A Better Man]]. ''[[Maclean's]]'' reported, “The film manages to be simultaneously agonizing and hopeful… it is revelatory to know these kinds of [restorative] conversations are possible.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/culture/movies/in-attiya-khans-a-better-man-a-different-way-to-understand-domestic-abuse/ MacLean's]&lt;/ref&gt; Film reviewer Miria Bale of [[Vulture.com]] heralds the film is a "Revolutionary documentary."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/why-attiya-khan-confronted-her-longtime-abuser-on-camera.html Vulture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anger management]] alone has not been shown to be effective in treating domestic violence offenders because such an approach seldom addresses the societal influences that are influencing offenders choices to perpetrate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Anger management is recommended as a part of an offender program that is based on accountability, along with topics such as recognizing abusive patterns of behavior and re-framing communication skills.  Interventions require not only stopping the violence but developing a plan to repair harms.&lt;ref name=Bidgood&gt;Bidgood, Bruce Alan (1999). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/222/ The social construction of a nonabuser image: A study of a post-treatment male abuser self-help group]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; Any corresponding problems should also be addressed as part of domestic violence offender treatment, such as problems with substance abuse or other mental illness.&lt;ref name="Colorado Domestic Violence Offender Management Board 2010"/&gt;

== Occupational therapy ==
Victims of domestic violence may require [[occupational therapy]] to be able to participate in work and to address a diminished skill-set caused by a prolonged absence from the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Occupational therapy with women and children survivors of domestic violence: Are we fulfilling our activist heritage? A review of the literature|last = Cage|first = A|date = 2007|journal = The British Journal of Occupational Therapy|access-date = |doi = |pmid = |issue = 5|volume = 70|pages = 192–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational therapists work with individuals to develop the skills needed to acquire desired roles and satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. Occupational therapists can provide services through direct or indirect treatment, advocacy efforts, consultation, or group sessions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Surviving domestic violence: Rebuilding one's life|last = Javaherian, H., Krabacher, V., Andriacco, K., &amp; German, D|date = 2007|journal = Occupational Therapy in Health Care|access-date = |doi = 10.1300/j003v21n03_03|pmid = 23941339|volume = 21|issue = 3|pages = 35–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may work with victims of domestic violence and their families in a variety of settings such as hospitals, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation centers, long-term care facilities, mental health facilities, schools, homes, and in shelters or other community programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Occupational therapy services for individuals who have experienced domestic violence (statement)|last = Javaherian, H.

Within any of the practice settings, occupational therapists may encounter victims of domestic violence including individuals who have not reported abuse. Occupational therapists are in a position to uncover information that leads to suspicion of violence or identification of abuse that has occurred. As health care professionals, occupational therapists follow state mandated requirements to report abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In treatment sessions, they may encounter individuals who have either chosen to remain in or must move on from an intimate relationship where abuse has occurred. Occupational therapists may see patients for complications directly related to abuse, such as physical injuries. On the other hand, occupational therapy services may be requested for unrelated issues but consequences of violence are addressed after the patient reveals abuse to the therapist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The consequences of domestic violence may impact the ability to perform [[Occupational therapy#Areas of occupation|daily occupations]]. Occupational therapy contributes to recovery by enabling victims to create new roles, develop satisfying and productive routines, and gain the self-efficacy necessary to overcome the effects of domestic violence. Occupational therapy interventions may include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Trauma Symptoms and Life Skill Needs of Domestic Violence Victims|last = Gorde, M.

OT interventions with children who are exposed to domestic violence are focused on promoting age appropriate academic, play, and social skills to facilitate proper development and success in school activities. This may include activities to improve organization, study habits, or attention. Adolescents who have seen or experienced domestic abuse may also benefit from occupational therapy to work on relationship and life skills and learn coping strategies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Prevention and intervention==
[[File:Get Away by Latasha Lee (lyrics onscreen).ogg|thumb|right| education sample]]
There are many community organizations which work to prevent domestic violence by offering safe [[Women's shelter|shelter]], [[crisis intervention]], advocacy, and education and prevention programs. Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobihealthnews.com/13989/app-to-help-physicians-screen-for-domestic-abuse/ app to help physicians screen for domestic abuse].

===Duluth model===

{{See also|Duluth model}}
In 1981, the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project became the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence. This experiment, conducted in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], frequently referred to as the "Duluth Project" because it is constantly evolving through the help of an entire community.&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of the Duluth Model|url=http://www.theduluthmodel.org|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Domestic Abuse Intervention Program has federal, state and local funders who support them. This funding allows DAIP to explore strategies to end violence to communities throughout the United States and around the world.&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"/&gt;

The objectives of the Duluth approach:&lt;ref name="Home of the Duluth Model"/&gt;
* Remove the blame from the victim and make the offender accountable for the abuse.
* Create criminal and civil justice systems to hold offenders accountable and keep the victims safe.
* Use the experiences and voices from battered women to improve and create policies.
* Offer court-ordered educational groups for the offenders.
* Review current cases and policies.

A news report from California cites a batterer intervention by ''The Center for Violence-Free Relationships'' based on [[Nonviolent Communication]] as having demonstrated zero percent recidivism within 5 years, and contrasts this with 40 percent recidivism within 5 years said to have been reported by DAIP for graduates of programs based on the [[Duluth Model]].&lt;ref name=Battering&gt;{{cite news|title=Batterers' intervention recidivism rates lowest known to date|url=http://www.mtdemocrat.com/news/batterers-intervention-recidivism-rates-lowest-known-to-date/|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=Mountain Democrat (Placerville, CA)|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Margravial Opera House''' ({{lang-de|Markgräfliches Opernhaus}}) is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[opera house]] in the town of [[Bayreuth]], [[Germany]], built between 1744 and 1748. It is one of Europe's few surviving theatres of the period and has been extensively restored.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, A. J., 
''[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/arts/music/bayreuth-margravial-opera-house.html?emc=edit_th_180417&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=686341800417 Inch by Inch, an Operatic Jewel Is Polished]'', The New York Times, April 16, 2018, photographs by Gordon Welters&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2012, the opera house was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1379| publisher=UNESCO| title=Margravial Opera House Bayreuth| accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was built according to plans designed by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Joseph Saint-Pierre|de}} (ca. 1709 – 1754), court builder of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] margrave [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Frederick of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] and his wife Princess [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine of Prussia]]. It was inaugurated on the occasion of the marriage of their daughter [[Margravine Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie]] with Duke [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg|Charles Eugene of Württemberg]].

[[File:Opéra des margraves intérieur Bayreuth.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|none|Interior]]

The wooden interior was designed by [[Giuseppe Galli Bibiena]] (1696 – 1757)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Margravial+Opera+House|title=Margravial Opera House Bayreuth - World Heritage Site - Pictures, info and travel reports|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Carlo from [[Bologna]] in an [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] Late Baroque style. The [[Box (theatre)|box]] theatre is completely preserved in its original condition, except for the curtain which was taken by [[Napoleon]]'s troops on their march to the 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]]. The prince box was seldom used by the art-minded margravial couple, who preferred a front-row seat.

Princess Wilhelmine, older sister of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]], had established the margravial theatre company in 1737. In the new opera house she participated as a composer of [[opera]] works and ''[[Singspiel]]e'', as well as an actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfopera.com/contentassets/8bab3d29ee2c4743b96f5621c7972be3/article---kotnik.pdf|title=The Adaptability of Opera: When Different Social Agents Come to Common Ground|last=Kotnik|first=Vlado|date=6 July 2017|website=sfopera.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today she features in a sound-and-light presentation for tourists. After her death in 1758, performances ceased and the building went into disuse, one reason for its good conservation status.

More than one hundred years later, the stage's great depth of {{convert|27|m|ft}}&lt;ref name=City&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe Markgräfliches Opernhaus|trans-title=UNESCO World Heritage Site: Margravial Opera House| url=http://www.bayreuth.de/tourismus-kultur-freizeit/sehen-und-erleben/unesco-weltkultur-und-markgraefin-wilhelmine/markgraefliches-opernhaus/| publisher=City of Bayreuth: Tourism, Culture and Leisure| language=German| accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the composer [[Richard Wagner]], who in 1872 chose Bayreuth as festival centre and had the ''[[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Festspielhaus]]'' built north of the town. The foundation stone ceremony was held on 22 May, Wagner's birthday, and included a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]], directed by the maestro.  

Parts of the 1994 biopic ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'' were filmed in the Opera House. The theatre was the site of the annual [[Bayreuther Osterfestival]] until 2009. Each September from the year 2000 to 2009, the theatre also hosted the Bayreuth Baroque festival, with performances of early operatic rarities. The 2009 festival included performances of [[Andrea Bernasconi]]'s ''festa teatrale'', ''L'Huomo'', to a libretto by the [[Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia| Margravine Wilhelmine]].

The theatre closed between October 2012 for extensive refurbishment and redevelopment and reopened April 12, 2018.&lt;ref name=City/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article175442510/Bayreuth-hat-mit-dem-Markgraeflichen-Opernhaus-seinen-schoensten-Kulturtempel-zurueck.html|title=Bayreuth hat seinen schönsten Kulturtempel zurück|last=Brug|first=Manuel|date=2018-04-14|website=Die Welt|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/markgr%C3%A4fliches-opernhaus-bayreuth-in-neuem-glanz-wiederer%C3%B6ffnet/a-43346264|title=Markgräfliches Opernhaus Bayreuth in neuem Glanz wiedereröffnet|last=|first=|date=2018-04-12|website=Deutsche Welle|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)''''' (2014–2015) was a work of [[endurance art|endurance performance art]] by [[Emma Sulkowicz]], conducted as their senior thesis during the final year of a [[visual arts]] degree at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=endurance&gt;For "endurance performance art", Emma Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU "Emma Sulkowicz: "Carry That Weight"], ''Columbia Daily Spectator'', at 2:22 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Begun in September 2014, the piece involved Sulkowicz carrying a {{convert|50|lb|adj=on}} mattress, of the kind that Columbia uses in its [[dorm]]s, around campus. Sulkowicz, who is [[non-binary]] and uses they/them pronouns,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/is-there-a-smarter-way-to-think-about-sexual-assault-on-campus)&lt;/ref&gt; said the piece would end when a student [[Columbia University rape controversy|Sulkowicz alleged raped them]] in Sulkowicz's dorm room in 2012 was expelled or otherwise left the university.&lt;ref name=ignore&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/29/its-hard-to-ignore-a-woman-toting-a-mattress-everywhere-she-goes-which-is-why-emma-sulkowicz-is-still-doing-it/ | title=It's hard to ignore a woman toting a mattress everywhere she goes, which is why Emma Sulkowicz is still doing it | work=The Washington Post | date=October 29, 2014| author=Soraya Nadia McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulkowicz carried the mattress until the end of the spring semester as well as to the graduation ceremony in May 2015.&lt;ref name="Taylor20May2015" /&gt;

Paul Nungesser, the student who Sulkowicz accused, was found not responsible in 2013 by a university inquiry into the allegations. He called Sulkowicz's accusation "untrue and unfounded" and ''Mattress Performance'' an act of bullying.&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20January2015 /&gt; Sulkowicz filed a police complaint in May 2014; the district attorney's office did not pursue criminal charges, citing a lack of [[reasonable suspicion]]. In April 2015 Nungesser filed a lawsuit against the university, its trustees, university president [[Lee Bollinger]], and art professor [[Jon Kessler]], Sulkowicz's thesis supervisor, alleging that the school exposed him to gender-based harassment by allowing ''Mattress Performance'' to take place on campus for [[course credit]].&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt;&lt;ref name="kutner_dec_2015"&gt;Max Kutner (December 10, 2015), [http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/18/other-side-sexual-assault-crisis-403285.html "The Other Side of the College Sexual Assault Crisis"], ''Newsweek''. Retrieved February 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was dismissed in March 2016. Nungesser filed an amended complaint on April 25, 2016,&lt;ref name="newsweek_new_complaint"/&gt; which resulted in the university settling for undisclosed terms, and expressing regret about his "difficult" time and promising to reform its policies so "accuser and accused, including those like [the student] who are found not responsible" are "treated with respect" in the future.&lt;ref name="lawsuit-settled" /&gt;

The piece stirred controversy with praise from art critics and criticism from some commentators. Art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] called ''Mattress Performance'' "pure radical vulnerability" and one of the best art shows of 2014.&lt;ref name=Saltz /&gt; Journalist [[Emily Bazelon]] described the work and events surrounding it as "an increasingly bitter fight over truth and narrative", a triumph for the [[rape survivor|survivor]] movement and a nightmare for the student Sulkowicz accused.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt; Caught between defending and enabling Sulkowicz's [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and Nungesser's right to [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and the university's written policies regarding confidentiality, the university was criticized by both parties and their parents for its handling of the issue.

{{Main|Columbia University rape controversy}}
[[File:Emma Sulkowicz, 14 December 2014.jpg|thumb|Sulkowicz, December 2014]]
Emma Sulkowicz attended [[Dalton School]] on the [[Upper East Side]], and in 2011 began their [[visual arts]] degree at Columbia University.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt;
Sulkowicz alleges that they were slapped, choked, and anally raped by Nungesser in Sulkowicz's dorm room, on the first day of their second year in August 2012, during what began as a consensual sexual encounter.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt; Nungesser denies the allegation, insisting that the encounter was entirely consensual.

[[File:Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight), 10 September 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=photograph|"Carry that Weight Together", Columbia University, September 10, 2014]]

Sulkowicz created ''Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)'' in the summer of 2014 for their senior thesis while at [[Yale University]] Summer School of Art and Music. Their first effort was a [[Video art|video]] of themself moving a bed out of a room, accompanied by the [[Audio art|audio]] of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz14Dec2014b&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMXp3RLOVNg Smith 2014], at c.&amp;nbsp;38:50 min.&lt;/ref&gt; The mattress later became the focus of the piece.&lt;ref name=Smith22September2014 /&gt; Sulkowicz's thesis was supervised by artist [[Jon Kessler]], a professor at Columbia. As the idea for ''Mattress Performance'' developed, Kessler and Sulkowicz discussed the nature of endurance art and the work of [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Marina Abramović]], [[Ulay]] and [[Chris Burden]].&lt;ref name=Steinhauer17September2014&gt;Jillian Steinhauer (September 17, 2014).

They told the ''Columbia Daily Spectator'': "I do think that nowadays art pieces can include whatever the artist desires and in this performance art piece it utilizes the elements of protest ..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014)], from c. 2:23 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Purchased online from Tall Paul's Tall Mall, the 50-lb (23-kg), dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which Sulkowicz said that they were raped.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014&gt;Vanessa Grigoriadis (September 21, 2014).

Written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these included that they had to carry the mattress when on university property; that it had to remain on campus when they were not there; and that they were not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help was offered they could accept.&lt;ref name=Sulkowicz14Dec2014b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Watson Hall, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9hHZbuYVnU Sulkowicz (September 2, 2014)], from c. 2:00 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2014 Sulkowicz began carrying the mattress on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Duan (September 9, 2014).

Sulkowicz told ''New York'' magazine: "He was the first person who helped without some sort of preconstructed belief for why they were going to help. He was like, 'Oh, look, a struggling girl—let me help her and be a nice human being.' That was probably the most honest interaction I had."&lt;ref name=Battaglia28May2015&gt;Andy Battaglia (May 28, 2015).

Sulkowicz said the work would end when Nungesser was expelled from or otherwise left Columbia, and that they would take the mattress to their graduation ceremony if necessary.&lt;ref name=Grigoriadis21September2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith22September2014 /&gt; In the end Sulkowicz carried it to the graduation ceremony on May 19, 2015,&lt;ref name="kutner_dec_2015" /&gt; despite a request from the school that students should not bring "large objects which could interfere with the proceedings".&lt;ref name=Taylor20May2015&gt;Kate Taylor (May 20, 2015).

As they approached, university president [[Lee Bollinger]], who had been shaking other graduates' hands, turned away as if to pick something up, and did not shake their hands; the university said this happened because the mattress was in the way.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt; The next day posters appeared in [[Morningside Heights]] near the university calling Sulkowicz a "pretty little liar".&lt;ref name=Roy20May2015&gt;Jessica Roy (May 20, 2015); [http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/posters-around-columbia-emma-sulkowicz-lied.html "Posters Around Columbia Campus Call Emma Sulkowicz a 'Pretty Little Liar'"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation Sulkowicz said they had known the university would not expel Nungesser, and had expected to carry the mattress for nine months, the length of a pregnancy, which was an important part of the work: "To me, the piece has very much represented [the fact that] a guy did a horrible thing to me and I tried to make something beautiful out of it."&lt;ref name=Battaglia28May2015 /&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Reaction by the accused ===
Paul Nungesser said in a December 2014 interview with ''The New York Times'' that the mattress performance is not an act of artistic expression, but instead one orchestrated to bully him and force him to leave Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Kaplan (February 4, 2015).

He also said that he was not permitted to use written communications between himself and the alleged victim as evidence, and expressed disbelief that anyone could believe he was guilty even after his accusers failed to meet what he deemed the low burden of proof in the university hearing process.&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015&gt;Emily Bazelon (May 29, 2015).

Nungesser's parents criticized the university, including its decision to let Sulkowicz take the mattress to the graduation ceremony: "This has been a deeply humiliating experience.&amp;nbsp;... A university that bows to a public witch-hunt no longer deserves to be called a place of enlightenment, of intellectual and academic freedom."&lt;ref name=VanSyckle20May2015&gt;Katie Van Syckle (May 20, 2015).

His father said that he sometimes fears his son will leave the school as a "cynic" and a "suspicious man".&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Cadenbach: [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/42729/3/1 "Nachtschatten"], ''Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin'', Heft 5/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 Nungesser filed a [[Title IX]] lawsuit against Columbia University, its trustees, university president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's senior-thesis supervisor, Jon Kessler, alleging they exposed him to gender-based harassment and a hostile educational environment in allowing the project to go forward. Nungesser said that in so doing they damaged his college experience, emotional well-being, reputation and career prospects.&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt;&lt;ref name="kutner_dec_2015" /&gt; His lawyers argued that Columbia allowed Sulkowicz to create and propose "performances depicting [the plaintiff] as a rapist" even though the university cleared him of any wrongdoing. &lt;ref name=jointletter&gt;Jessica Roy (June 25, 2015): [http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/06/lawsuit-emma-sulkowicz-ran-misandrist-campaign.html "Lawyers for Emma Sulkowicz's Alleged Rapist Accuse Her of Misandry"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]].&lt;/ref&gt; Among examples of what they described as "public harassment", they cited Sulkowicz's public display of drawings which the lawyers said depicted Nungesser's genitals as part of the project (Sulkowicz left open the question of whether these drawings were of him or stories about him&lt;ref name=Bazelon29May2015 /&gt;), as well as depictions of the alleged sexual assault, as violations of Columbia's gender-based misconduct policy, which prohibits "unwelcome remarks about the private parts of a person's body" and "graffiti concerning the sexual activity of another person". The lawsuit alleged that Columbia was responsible because the university sponsored and supervised the project.&lt;ref name=Schow22July2015&gt;Ashe Schow (July 22, 2015): [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/columbia-student-accused-of-rape-amends-lawsuit-to-include-the-mattress-attends-graduation/article/2568763 "Columbia student accused of rape amends lawsuit to include 'the mattress attends graduation'"], ''The Washington Examiner''.&lt;/ref&gt; The university's lawyers say the university is "not responsible or liable" for Sulkowicz's conduct&lt;ref name=jointletter /&gt;

On August 28, 2015, Columbia's lawyers asked that the case be dismissed, citing [[First Amendment]] protections and arguing that Nungesser's lawsuit suggests Columbia was obligated to prevent Sulkowicz from speaking publicly on an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neumeister |first1=Larry |title=University Defends Mattress-Carrying Project Against Lawsuit|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/university-defends-mattress-carrying-project-lawsuit-33392586 |publisher=ABC News |date=August 28, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neumeister|first1=Larry|title=Columbia Cites Free Speech In Defense Of Allowing Mattress Protest|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/columbia-mattress-protest_55e2200de4b0aec9f3538924|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard by Judge [[Gregory Howard Woods|Gregory H.

==== Criticism ====
A number of commentators questioned Sulkowicz's account of the assault and argued that the performance was unfair to Nungesser.

Social critic [[Camille Paglia]] described ''Mattress Performance'' as "a parody of the worst aspects of that kind of grievance-oriented feminism", adding that a feminist work "should empower women, not cripple them".&lt;ref name=Paglia&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daley|first1=David|title=Camille Paglia: How Bill Clinton is like Bill Cosby|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/07/28/camille_paglia_how_bill_clinton_is_like_bill_cosby/ |publisher=Salon |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quackenbush|first1=Casey|title=Camille Paglia: Columbia Anti-Rape Mattress Project Is Not Feminism|url=http://observer.com/2015/07/camille-paglia-columbia-anti-rape-mattress-project-is-backwards-feminism/ |newspaper=[[New York Observer]] |date=July 30, 2015 |accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial in the ''[[New York Post]]''', [[Naomi Schaefer Riley]] criticized Sulkowicz's work as "shaming without proof" and accused Sulkowicz and their supporters of "saving themselves from having to answer any questions and destroying men's lives with lies and innuendo".&lt;ref name="Naomi Schaefer Riley"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/08/columbia-mattress-rape-case-is-not-justice-its-shaming-without-proof/|title=Columbia mattress rape case is not justice—it's shaming without proof |last1=Riley |first1=Naomi Schaefer |date=February 8, 2015 |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article "If anything's art, art's nothing", ''[[National Post]]'' columnist [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] compared Sulkowicz's work to that of [[Megumi Igarashi]] and concluded, "if everything is art, then art can be used for anything.

The '''Metropolitan Opera House''' was an [[opera house]] located at 1411 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City]]. Opened in 1883 and demolished in 1967, it was the first home of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Company.

==History==

Sometimes referred to as "the old Met", the Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, with a performance of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. It was located at 1411 Broadway, occupying the whole block between West 39th Street and West 40th Street on the west side of the street in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Nicknamed "The Yellow Brick Brewery" for its industrial looking exterior, the original Metropolitan Opera House was designed by [[J. Cleaveland Cady]]. On August 27, 1892, the nine-year-old theater was gutted by fire. The 1892−93 season was canceled while the opera house was rebuilt along its original lines.  During that season, the Vaudeville Club, which eventually became the [[Metropolitan Opera Club]], was founded and hosted entertainment in the undamaged portions of the house.

In 1903, architects [[Carrère and Hastings]] extensively redesigned the interior of the opera house. The familiar golden auditorium with its sunburst chandelier, and curved [[proscenium]] inscribed with the names of six composers ([[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]), dates from this time. The first of the Met's signature gold [[damask]] stage curtains was installed in 1906, completing the look that the old Metropolitan Opera House maintained until its closing.

[[File:Metropolitan Opera House program cover 1935.jpg|thumb|left|Metropolitan Opera House program cover depicting the [[proscenium|Proscenium arch]] in 1935]]
In 1940, ownership of the opera house shifted from the wealthy families who occupied the theater's boxes to the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association. At this time the last major change to the auditorium's interior was completed. The second tier of privately held boxes (the "grand tier") was converted into standard row seating. This enlarged the seating capacity and left only the first tier of boxes from the "golden horseshoe" of the opera house's origins as a showplace for New York society.

The Met had a seating capacity of 3,625 with 224 standing room places.

While the theater was noted for its excellent acoustics and elegant interior, as early as the 1900s the backstage facilities were deemed to be severely inadequate for a large opera company. Scenery and sets were a regular sight leaning against the building exterior on 39th Street where crews had to shift them between performances. Various plans were put forward over the years to build a new home for the company and designs for new opera houses were created by various architects including [[Joseph Urban]]. Proposed new locations included [[Columbus Circle]] and what is now [[Rockefeller Center]], but none of these plans came to fruition. Only with the development of [[Lincoln Center]] on New York's [[Upper West Side]] did the Met finally have the opportunity to build a modern opera house.

The Metropolitan Opera said goodbye to its old house on April 16, 1966, with a sentimental gala farewell performance featuring nearly all of the company's current leading artists. Long-time Met star soprano [[Zinka Milanov]] made her last Met appearance that night, and among the many invited guests was soprano [[Anna Case]], who had made her debut at the house in 1909. The final performance at the opera house was given not by the Met, but by the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], which concluded a short run of appearances on May 8, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ballet: Our Revels Now Are Ended at the Old Metropolitan; Bolshoi Gives House Its Last Performance Hurok Invites Dancers of the Past for Finale| url=https://article.archive.nytimes.com/1966/05/09/82433033.pdf| last=Barnes| first=Clive| date=May 9, 1966| page=48| work=[[The New York Times]]| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater was purchased by [[Jack D. Weiler]]&lt;ref name=PittPress&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19860218&amp;id=nu4iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9GIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5171,2206769&amp;hl=en| work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]| title=Millionaire Began as a Realty Clerk| date=February 18, 1986| page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite a campaign to preserve the theater, it failed to obtain landmark status and the old Met was razed in 1967. It was replaced by a 40-story office tower, 1411 Broadway, intended to provide a steady income for the opera company. Designed by [[Irwin S. Chanin]] and completed in 1970, the building was later sold by the Metropolitan Opera and today it is owned by 1411 TrizecHahn-Swig LLC, a partnership of the [[TrizecHahn]] and Swig real estate companies. Since 1966, the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] at Lincoln Center has been home to the Metropolitan Opera.{{clear left}}

'''Pamela Mastropietro''' was an 18-year-old Italian girl who was last seen on 29 January 2018 and was murdered soon after in [[Macerata]], Italy. The suspects are three [[Nigerian people in Italy|Nigerian]] immigrants, as of 7 July 2018 these allegations are still being investigated and the accused criminals are in custody.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2018"/&gt; Parts of Mastropieto's body were missing, which sparked allegations of the murder having been a [[Murder for body parts|muti killing]] involving [[cannibalism]].

==Background==
Mastropietro was born and lived in Rome.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} She was 18 years old and had moved away from the recovery community for drug addiction where she was a guest in [[Marche]], the Pars of [[Corridonia]], on 29 January. Her mother stated that Mastropietro began abusing drugs after dating a [[Romanians in Italy|Romanian]] man, and was attending a drug treatment facility at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2018"&gt;Jason Horowitz (July 7, 2018) [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/07/world/europe/italy-macerata-migrants.html This Italian Town Once Welcomed Migrants. Now, It’s a Symbol for Right-Wing Politics], The New York Times, accessed 28 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; When she left the community she did not take her mobile phone and identification documents. She is believed to have sought drugs in Diaz Gardens, a known gathering place for dealers, addicts and criminals.

==Murder and investigation==
Mastropietro's body was found severely mutilated, hidden in two suitcases; though believed to be a murder victim her exact cause of death was unclear as of February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.it/20180207/absurd-violence-torchlight-march-death-italian-pamela-mastropietro&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, Italian police said they found her bloodied clothing at the home of Innocent Oseghale, a Nigerian who came to Italy in 2014 but dropped out of a refugee assistance program and began selling drugs.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2018"/&gt; Along with Oseghale, police arrested Desmond Lucky and Lucky Awelima. A fourth suspect, a Ghanese drug dealer, was sought as a fugitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2018/01/31/macerata-donna-fatta-pezzi-e-rinchiusa-due-valigie-abbandonate-il-corpo-e-della-18enne-pamela-mastropietro/4128734/ Il Fatto Quotidiano], 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocent Oseghale, described as "a 29-year-old Nigerian with an expired residency permit and a criminal record of drug dealing," is suspected and was arrested soon after the body was found.&lt;ref name="JonesVento"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Thomas|title=Fischia il vento|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2018/02/13/thomas-jones/fischia-il-vento/|accessdate=11 March 2018|publisher=London Review of Books blog|date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2018 the magistrate of [[Macerata]], Giovanni Maria Manzoni, has revoked custody in prison, but only for allegations of murder, vilification, destruction and concealment of corpse, against Lucky Awelima and Desmond Lucky initially arrested for competition with Innocent Oseghale for the murder of Pamela Mastropietro and the dismemberment of the corpse in Macerata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pamela:revocato carcere per omicidio a 2 |url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2018/06/07/pamelarevocato-carcere-per-omicidio-a-2_c3a57063-bb09-45ec-bc4d-b52567a19ff8.html |accessdate=7 June 2018 |agency=ansa.it |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucky Awelima and Desmond Lucky remain in jail for [[heroin]] dealing.

[[Matteo Salvini]], the newly-elected deputy prime minister and interior minister, has often mentioned the Mastropietro murder as part of his hard-on-crime policies and skepticism towards immigration.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2018"/&gt;

Alessandro Meluzzi, a psychiatrist and criminologist, has alleged that the murder was associated with Nigerian organized crime gangs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/sfoglio/13308726/pamela-mastropietro-alessandro-meluzzi-suo-cuore-potrebbe-essere-stato-mangiato-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2018, 28 year old Italian shot and injured six [[African emigrants to Italy|African]] immigrants in a [[drive-by shooting]] incident that was described as an act of revenge motivated by the murder of Mastropietro.

[[Image:MLM Nauka module - 3D rendering.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Artist's rendering of the ''Nauka'' module docked to ''Zvezda''.]]
'''''Nauka''''' ({{lang-ru|Нау́ка}}; lit. ''Science''), also known as the '''Multipurpose Laboratory Module''' (MLM), ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Многофункциональный лабораторный модуль'', or ''МЛМ''), is a component of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) which has not yet been launched into space. The MLM is funded by the [[Roscosmos State Corporation]]. In the original ISS plans, ''Nauka'' was to use the location of the [[Rassvet (ISS module)|Docking and Stowage Module]]. Later, the DSM was moved to ''[[Zarya]]''{{'}}s nadir port and named [[Rassvet (ISS module)|''Rassvet'']]. Planners anticipate ''Nauka'' will dock at [[Zvezda (ISS module)|''Zvezda''{{'}}s]] nadir port, replacing [[Pirs (ISS module)|''Pirs'']].

The launch of ''Nauka'', initially planned for 2007, has been repeatedly delayed for various reasons. {{As of|2018|11}}, the launch to the ISS is assigned to November 2019.&lt;ref name="tass20180816" /&gt;

==Original plans for Nauka==
In the 1990s, plans for the Russian segment of the ISS included several research modules that were intended to be adjunct to ''[[Zarya]]'' and ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]''. In these earlier plans, the now-cancelled complex of the [[Universal Docking Module]] (UDM) and the two newly developed [[Russian Research Module]]s were to be attached [[Zvezda (ISS module)|''Zvezda''{{'}}s]] nadir port – the UDM was to be based on the [[Functional Cargo Block]] FGB-2. The FGB-2 was originally built as a backup for the original launch of the ''[[Zarya]]'' (FGB) module – FGB-2's construction had been halted at 70-percent completeness in the late 1990s.

However, the plans changed in the early 2000s. In August 2004, it was decided to build the ''Nauka'' ISS module based on the FGB-2.&lt;ref name="1997 memos"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasawatch.com/iss/02.26.97.iss.memo.html|title=02.26.97.iss.memo|accessdate=July 10, 2008|publisher=nasawatch.com|year=1997}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time there was an alternate, rejected proposal for ''Nauka'' from [[RKK Energia]], based on the cancelled Commercial Enterprise Module (entertainment and studio module), which was to be jointly funded by [[RKK Energia]] and [[SPACEHAB]].&lt;ref name="Zak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_russia.html |title=Russian segment of the ISS |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |website=RussianSpaceWeb |access-date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on ''Nauka'' and launch date==
[[File:ISS mock-up training modules at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.jpg|left|thumb|Nauka training mockup at the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center|Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]] in April 2012.]]
At the end of 2005, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) agreed with the Russians that the [[European Robotic Arm]] would be launched together with ''Nauka'', mated on its surface for a later deployment in space. A spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm was already launched together with [[Rassvet (ISS module)|''Rassvet'']].

In 2004, the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] stated that ''Nauka'' should be ready for launch in 2007 on a Russian [[Proton rocket]]. However, the ''Nauka'' project was delayed further, first to 2008 and later to 2009. A November 2006 ESA bulletin mentioned that the RSA was negotiating with the ISS partners to push back the prospective launch date to the end of 2008. In October 2011, it was reported that ''Nauka'' was expected to be launched at the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="gazetaru2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2011/10/19/3806658.shtml |language=ru |title=Новые деньги под старую "Науку" |trans-title=New money for the old "Science" |first=Alina |last=Chernoivanova |website=Gazeta.ru |date=19 October 2011 |access-date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, it was reported that the launch date had been pushed back to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_05_23_2012_p05-01-460939.xml|title=Russia Sees Moon Base As Logical Next Step|last=Morring|first=Frank|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Aviation Week|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next planned launch date was April 2014, according to Vitaly Lopota, president of [[RSC Energia]].&lt;ref name="dec13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronews.ru/cgi-bin/mng.cgi?page=news&amp;news=4508 |language=ru |title=О запусках новых российских модулей МКС |trans-title=About launches of new Russian modules to the ISS |date=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2018}}

On October 25, 2013, Parabolic Arc reported that Nauka was flawed and had failed acceptance testing at RKK Energia.&lt;ref name="ria20131127"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.ru/space/20131127/980030598.html |language=ru |title=Роскосмос сообщил НАСА, что модуль МЛМ не войдет в состав МКС в 2014 г. |trans-title=Roscosmos has informed NASA that the MLM module will not join ISS in 2014 |website=RIA Novosti |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found problems in the propulsion system included a leaking fueling valve that needed to be replaced and contamination, which would require a lengthy cleaning.&lt;ref name="rsw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_fgb2.html |title=MLM (FGB-2) module of the ISS |website=RussianSpaceWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The module was to be returned to Khrunichev for repairs which would take another 12 to 18 months.&lt;ref name="ria20131127" /&gt; On November 27, 2013, it was reported that the Russian Space Agency had informed NASA that the launch had been postponed until at least 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20131127/185078995/Russia-Postpones-Space-Lab-Launch-Again.html |title=Russia Postpones Space Lab Launch Again |website=RIA Novosti |date=27 November 2013 |access-date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, it emerged that the target date for launch was postponed to February 2017: a new propulsion system needed to be manufactured, as the installed had exceeded its warranty.&lt;ref name="rsw" /&gt;

By November 2016, the tentative launch date had slipped to mid-2018,&lt;ref name="3dnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://3dnews.ru/942263 |language=ru |title=Запуск лабораторного модуля "Наука" к МКС откладывается |trans-title=Launch of the Nauka laboratory module to the ISS postponed |first=Sergey |last=Karasev |date=7 November 2016 |access-date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard a [[Proton M]] rocket. It then slipped further with a projected launch date of March 2019, before a December 20, 2018 launch date was confirmed in December 2017. In August 2018, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin set a new launch date of November 2019.&lt;ref name="tass20180816"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/1017479|title=Research module Nauka to be launched to ISS in November 2019|publisher=Tass|date=16 August 2018|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
''Nauka'' will initially be used for experiments, docking and cargo. It will also serve as a crew work and rest area. ''Nauka'' will be equipped with full guidance and navigation control including engines and an [[attitude control]] system that can be used as a backup by the ISS. It will be docked onto the ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' module's nadir (Earth facing) docking port. Outfitting equipment launched in 2010 with the [[Rassvet (ISS module)|''Rassvet'']] (Mini-Research Module 1) on [[NASA]]'s [[STS-132]] will also be used for ''Nauka'', including the spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm, internal hardware and an experimental airlock to be positioned on one of the side-facing ports at the bottom of the module. The new module will contain crew quarters with life support equipment including atmospheric processing, galley and toilet.&lt;ref name="gazetaru2011" /&gt;

===Primary research module===
''Nauka'' will be Russia's primary ISS research module. For some time, NASA's official plans included a second research module around the same size as ''Nauka'', listed to be "under review", but it was eventually cancelled, leaving ''Nauka'' to be the only [[Russian research module]] besides ''Rassvet'' and [[Poisk (ISS module)|''Poisk'']] (Mini-Research Module 2).

'''Petya''' is a family of encrypting [[ransomware]] that was first discovered in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Greenberg |first1=Andy |title=The Untold Story of NotPetya, the Most Devastating Cyberattack in History |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2018-08-22 |url=https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The malware targets [[Microsoft Windows]]-based systems, infecting the [[master boot record]] to execute a [[Payload (computing)|payload]] that encrypts a hard drive's [[file system]] table and prevents Windows from booting. It subsequently demands that the user make a payment in [[Bitcoin]] in order to regain access to the system.

Variants of Petya were first seen in March 2016, which propagated via infected [[e-mail attachment]]s. In June 2017, a new variant of Petya was used for a [[2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine|global cyberattack]], primarily targeting [[Ukraine]]. The new variant propagates via the [[EternalBlue]] exploit, which is generally believed to have been developed by the [[United States | U.S]]. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and was used earlier in the year by the [[WannaCry]] ransomware. [[Kaspersky Lab]] referred to this new version as '''NotPetya''' to distinguish it from the 2016 variants, due to these differences in operation. In addition, although it purports to be ransomware, this variant was modified so that it is unable to actually revert its own changes.

== History ==
Petya was discovered in March 2016;&lt;ref name= "nw-petyadouble" /&gt; [[Check Point]] noted that while it had achieved fewer infections than other ransomware active in early 2016, such as [[CryptoWall]], it contained notable differences in operation that caused it to be "immediately flagged as the next step in ransomware evolution".&lt;ref name="cp-petya"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/04/11/decrypting-the-petya-ransomware/|title= Decrypting the Petya Ransomware |date= 2016-04-11 |website= Check Point Blog |access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant of Petya discovered in May 2016 contained a secondary payload used if the malware cannot achieve [[superuser |administrator]]-level access.&lt;ref name= "nw-petyadouble"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3069990/petya-ransomware-is-now-double-the-trouble.html|title= Petya ransomware is now double the trouble|last=Constantin |first= Lucian |work=NetworkWorld|access-date= 2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Petya" is a reference to the 1995 ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' film ''[[GoldenEye]]'', wherein ''Petya'' is one of the two Soviet weapon satellites which carry a "Goldeneye" – an atomic bomb detonated in low Earth orbit to produce an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. A [[Twitter]] account that ''[[Heise Online|Heise]]'' suggested may have belonged to the author of the malware, named "Janus Cybercrime Solutions" after [[Alec Trevelyan]]'s crime group in ''GoldenEye'',  had an avatar with an image of ''GoldenEye'' character [[Boris Grishenko]], a Russian hacker and antagonist in the film played by Scottish actor [[Alan Cumming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Petya-Mischa-Goldeneye-Die-Erpresser-sind-Nerds-3571937.html|author=Scherschel, Fabian A. |title=Petya, Mischa, Goldeneye: Die Erpresser sind Nerds |publisher=''[[Heise Online]]''|date=2016-12-15|accessdate=2017-07-03|quote=Die Virenschreiber hinter diesen Erpressungstrojanern scheinen große Fans des Films zu sein.

Ob ein Twitter-Konto, welches genau auf dieses Profil passt, ein Bild von Boris Grishenko als Avatar nutzt und nach dem Verbrechersyndikat aus dem Film benannt ist, von den Drahtziehern betrieben wird, konnten wir nicht bestätigen. Aber es ist immerhin denkbar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2018, a regional court in [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] in the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] of Ukraine convicted an unnamed Ukrainian citizen to one year in prison after pleading guilty to having spread a version of Petya online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=На Дніпропетровщині викрили чоловіка, який розповсюджував вірус «Petya.A» |author=Valery Iliyeva |work=Dniprograd |date=August 7, 2017 |url=http://dniprograd.org/2017/08/07/na-dnipropetrovshchini-vikrili-cholovika-yakiy-rozpovsyudzhuvav-virus-petyaa_59243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Регіональний "координатор" вірусу РЕТYА на Дніпропетровщині отримав один рік тюрми |author= Ivan Muracha |work=Dniprograd |date=September 3, 2018 |url=http://dniprograd.org/2018/09/03/regionalniy-koordinator-virusu-retya-na-dnipropetrovshchini-otrimav-odin-rik-tyurmi_70920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Оголошено вирок у справі за фактами масштабних кібератак вірусу "PETYA" |date=August 31, 2018 |publisher=Judiciary of Ukraine |url=https://court.gov.ua/archive/546734/ |archive-url=http://archive.is/XRoHJ |archive-date=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine}}
[[File:PetyaA.jpg|right|thumb|NotPetya's ransom note displayed on a compromised system]]
On 27 June 2017, a major global [[cyberattack]] began (Ukrainian companies were among the first to state they were being attacked&lt;ref name=BBCGlobalR /&gt;), utilizing a new variant of Petya. On that day, [[Kaspersky Lab]] reported infections in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but that the majority of infections targeted Russia and Ukraine, where more than 80 companies were initially attacked, including the [[National Bank of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=BBCGlobalR /&gt;&lt;ref name= BloombergUkrRus /&gt; [[ESET]] estimated on 28 June 2017 that 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany second hardest hit with about 9%.&lt;ref name= BBCUkr80&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40428967|title= Tax software blamed for cyber-attack spread |date=28 June 2017 |work= BBC Newsv|access-date= 28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]]'s press secretary, [[Dmitry Peskov]], stated that the attack had caused no serious damage in Russia.&lt;ref name= BBCUkr80 /&gt; Experts believed this was a politically-motivated attack against Ukraine, since it occurred on the eve of the Ukrainian holiday [[Constitution Day (Ukraine) |Constitution Day]].&lt;ref name= NYTcfU&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html | title = Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally | date = 27 June 2017 | accessdate = 28 June 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BBCUkraineR&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40427907|title= 'Vaccine' created for huge cyber-attack |last= Lee|first= David|date= 28 June 2017 |work=BBC News|access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaspersky dubbed this variant "NotPetya", as it has major differences in its operations in comparison to earlier variants.&lt;ref name=BBCGlobalR/&gt; [[McAfee]] engineer Christiaan Beek stated that this variant was designed to spread quickly, and that it had been targeting "complete energy companies, the [[power grid]], bus stations, gas stations, the airport, and banks".&lt;ref name=BBCGlobalR&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40416611|title= Global ransomware attack causes chaos |date=27 June 2017 |work= BBC News|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/petya-malware-ransomware-attack-outbreak-june-2017|title= There's another 'worldwide' ransomware attack and it's spreading quickly |last= Burgess |first=Matt| publisher =Wired UK |access-date= 2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that the [[Patch (computing)#Software update systems|software update mechanism]] of {{ill|M.E.Doc|uk}} — a Ukrainian tax preparation program that, according to [[F-Secure]] analyst [[Mikko Hyppönen]], "appears to be de facto" among companies doing business in the country—had been compromised to spread the malware.&lt;ref name= BBCUkr80 /&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg-medoc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/microsoft-analysts-see-hack-origin-at-ukrainian-software-firm|title= Microsoft, Analysts See Hack Origin at Ukrainian Software Firm |date= 2017-06-28 | publisher = Bloomberg |access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-20170703&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-ukraine-software-idUSKBN19O2DK |title=Family firm in Ukraine says it was not responsible for cyber attack |author=Jack Stubbs, Pavel Polityuk |publisher=Reuters |date=3 July 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis by [[ESET]] found that a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] had been present in the update system for at least six weeks prior to the attack, describing it as a "thoroughly well-planned and well-executed operation".&lt;ref name="ars-backdoormedoc"/&gt; The developers of M.E.Doc denied that they were entirely responsible for the cyberattack, stating that they too were victims.&lt;ref name= "bloomberg-medoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "ars-medoc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/06/a-new-ransomware-outbreak-similar-to-wcry-is-shutting-down-computers-worldwide/|title= A new ransomware outbreak similar to WCry is shutting down computers worldwide|work=Ars Technica |access-date= 2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/global-ransomware-hack-what-we-know-and-dont-know.html | title = Global Ransomware Attack: What We Know and Don’t Know | first= Sheera | last= Frenkel | date = 27 June 2017 | accessdate = 28 June 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcau-medocseized"/&gt;

On July 4, 2017, Ukraine's cybercrime unit seized the company's servers after detecting "new activity" that it believed would result in "uncontrolled proliferation" of malware. Ukraine police advised M.E.Doc users to stop using the software, as it presumed that the backdoor was still present.&lt;ref name="ars-backdoormedoc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/05/notpetya-ransomware-hackers-ukraine-bitcoin-ransom-wallet-motives|title=Hackers who targeted Ukraine clean out bitcoin ransom wallet|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2017-07-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/07/heavily-armed-police-raid-company-that-seeded-last-weeks-notpetya-outbreak/|title=Backdoor built in to widely used tax app seeded last week’s NotPetya outbreak|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the seized servers showed that software updates had not been applied since 2013, there was evidence of Russian presence, and an employee's account on the servers had been compromised; the head of the units warned that M.E.Doc could be found criminally responsible for enabling the attack because of its negligence in maintaining the security of their servers.&lt;ref name=reuters-20170705&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-ukraine-backdoor-idUSKBN19Q14P |title=Ukraine scrambles to contain new cyber threat after 'NotPetya' attack |author=Jack Stubbs, Matthias Williams |publisher=Reuters |date=5 July 2017 |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcau-medocseized"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-03/cyber-attack-charge-ukarine/8675006|title=Ukrainian software company will face charges over cyber attack, police suggest|date=2017-07-03|agency=AP|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-backdoormedoc"/&gt;

== Operation ==
Petya utilizes a payload that infects the computer's [[master boot record]] (MBR), overwriting the Windows [[bootloader]], and then triggering a restart. On the next startup, the payload is executed, which encrypts the [[Master File Table]] of the [[NTFS]] [[file system]], and then displays the ransom message demanding a payment made in [[Bitcoin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.kaspersky.com/new-ransomware-epidemics/17314/|title=New ransomware outbreak|website=Kaspersky Blog|publisher=Kaspersky Lab|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nw-petyadouble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-notpetya"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/27/15879480/petrwrap-virus-ukraine-ransomware-attack-europe-wannacry|title=A new ransomware attack is hitting airlines, banks and utilities across Europe|last=Brandom|first=Russell|date=2017-06-27|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, text purportedly output by [[chkdsk]], Windows' file system scanner, is displayed on-screen, suggesting that the hard drive's sectors are being repaired.&lt;ref name="cp-petya"/&gt; The original payload required the user to grant it administrative privileges; one variant of Petya was bundled with an alternate payload known as Mischa, which is used if Petya fails to install.

The "NotPetya" variant utilized in the 2017 attack uses [[EternalBlue]], an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] which takes advantage of a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] in Windows' [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) protocol.

The pine tree was planted in 1336 by [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Emperor Dušan]] and cut down and burned  in a revenge attack by local Albanian villagers returning from exile in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Sites, [http://www.sacred-sites.org/preservation/kosovo.html After the War: The Destruction and Preservation of Sacred Sites in Kosovo]: "The chapel was blown up and the famous pine tree cut down and burned in a revenge attack by local Albanian villagers returning from exile in June–July 1999."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The old [[pine]] tree ({{Lang-la|[[Pinus heldreichii]]}}) as a relict, endemic tree, was one of the decorations of the [[Šar Mountains]] with its huge size. The pine was over 25 meters high, 1.5 meters wide, and had a bark thickness of 10&amp;nbsp;cm, and it was in good health prior to its destruction. It was visited by various state delegations. King [[Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, Prince of Serbia|Aleksandar Karađorđević]] had a memorial plaque placed by it in 1926 with the year of planting. The Monastery of the Holy Archangels in [[Nerodimlje]] was, together with the Pine of Tsar Dušan, added on [[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance]]-list by the [[Republic of Serbia]] in 1961, as a historical monument and natural rarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{CHS-SANU|Link=439|Name=Црква Св. арханђела/Church of St. Arhangels}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian institutions suggested that the [[Šar Mountains|Šar Mountains National Park]] be nominated for World Heritage under [[UNESCO]] protection, because of its biological, cultural and historical heritage; the pine tree was included in the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Novosti, [http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:211197-Ognjista-puna-samoce Ognjišta puna samoće]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destruction ==
In June/July 1999, after the [[Kosovo War]], the Monastery of the Holy Archangels and the cemetery was desecrated, while the pine was cut down and burned, by Albanian villagers returning from exile.&lt;ref&gt;Sacred Sites, [http://www.sacred-sites.org/preservation/kosovo.html After the War: The Destruction and Preservation of Sacred Sites in Kosovo]: "The chapel was blown up and the famous pine tree cut down and burned in a revenge attack by local Albanian villagers returning from exile in June–July 1999."&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[Tree stump|stump]] remained, which was later burned completely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/clanak/glas-javnosti-31-01-2008/beli-medved-evoluirao-na-kosmetu White bears on Kosmet?]&lt;/ref&gt; As the entire complex was destroyed, there were no visible traces of Dušan's Pine, until 2014 when new branches started to sprout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Оживео бор цара Душана, на остацима престонице Немањића извијају се нови изданци |url=http://www.novosti.rs/%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B5.409.html:515001-%D0%9E%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80-%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0-%D0%94%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5-%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%9A%D0%B8%D1%9B%D0%B0-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0%D1%98%D1%83-%D1%81%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%86%D0%B8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earle, Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty, 1920, i.jpg|thumb|''[[wikisource:Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty?|Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty?]]'' (1920) by [[George Howard Earle, Jr.]]]]
'''Price fixing''' is an agreement between participants on the same side in a market to buy or sell a [[product (business)|product]], service, or commodity only at a fixed price, or maintain the market conditions such that the price is maintained at a given level by controlling [[supply and demand]].

The intent of price fixing may be to push the price of a product as high as possible, generally leading to [[profit (economics)|profits]] for all sellers but may also have the goal to fix, peg, discount, or stabilize prices. The defining characteristic of price fixing is any agreement regarding price, whether expressed or implied.

Price fixing requires a conspiracy between sellers or buyers. The purpose is to coordinate pricing for mutual benefit of the traders. For example, manufacturers and retailers may conspire to sell at a common "retail" price; set a common minimum sales price, where sellers agree not to discount the sales price below the agreed-to minimum price; buy the product from a supplier at a specified maximum price; adhere to a [[price book]] or [[list price]]; engage in cooperative price [[advertising]]; standardize [[credit (finance)|financial credit]] terms offered to purchasers; use uniform [[discounts and allowances|trade-in allowances]]; limit [[discounts and allowances|discounts]]; discontinue a free service or fix the price of one component of an overall service; adhere uniformly to previously-announced prices and terms of sale; establish uniform costs and [[markup (business)|markups]]; impose mandatory [[fee|surcharges]]; purposefully reduce output or sales in order to charge higher prices; or purposefully share or pool markets, territories, or customers.

Price fixing is [[competition law|permitted in some markets but not others]]; where allowed, it is often known as ''[[resale price maintenance]]'' or ''retail price maintenance''.

In [[neo-classical economics]], price fixing is inefficient. The anti-competitive agreement by producers to fix prices above the market price transfers some of the [[consumer surplus]] to those producers and also results in a [[deadweight loss]].

International price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of many countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are those that controlled the prices and output of [[Lysine price-fixing conspiracy|lysine]], [[citric acid]], [[graphite electrodes]], and bulk [[Hoffmann-La Roche#Controversies|vitamins]].&lt;ref name="AAEA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://purl.umn.edu/19499 | title=Extraterritoriality of the Sherman Act and Deterrence of Private International Cartels | publisher=[[American Agricultural Economics Association]] AGM 2005 | date=April 2004 | accessdate=September 30, 2014 | author=Connor, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
===United States===
In the United States, price fixing can be prosecuted as a criminal [[federal offense]] under Section 1 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1- |title=US CODE: Title 15,1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal prosecutions must be handled by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], but the [[Federal Trade Commission]] also has jurisdiction for civil antitrust violations. Many [[state attorney general|state attorneys general]] also bring [[antitrust]] cases and have antitrust offices, such as [[Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[California]].

Private individuals or organizations may file lawsuits for triple damages for antitrust violations and, depending on the law, recover attorneys fees and costs expended on prosecution of a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.state.ny.us/business/antitrust.html|title=www.ag.ny.gov - New York State  Attorney General|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naag.org/issues/issue-antitrust.php Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (Feb. 2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022074748/http://www.naag.org/issues/issue-antitrust.php |date=2004-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under American law, exchanging prices among competitors can also violate the [[antitrust laws]]. That includes exchanging prices with the intent to fix prices or the exchange affecting the prices individual competitors set. Proof that competitors have shared prices can be used as part of the evidence of an illegal price fixing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Antitrust Law Developments (2002); Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000) |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts generally advise that competitors avoid even the appearance of agreeing on price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000) |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, US courts have divided price fixing into two categories: vertical and horizontal maximum price fixing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Tsui, Tat Chee, Interstate Comparison – Use of Contribution Margin in Determination of Price Fixing (2011). Pace Int’l Law Review Online Companion, Vol. 1, April 2011. at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1839223&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical price fixing includes a manufacturer's attempt to control the price of its product at retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sauer|first=Raymond D.|title=VERTICAL PRICE FIXING|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~sauerr/classes/309/vertpfix.htm|accessdate=9 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708042032/http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~sauerr/classes/309/vertpfix.htm|archivedate=8 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[State Oil Co. v. Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] held that vertical price fixing is no longer considered a ''per se'' violation of the Sherman Act, but horizontal price fixing is still considered a breach of the Sherman Act. Also in 2008, the defendants of ''United States v LG Display Co.'', ''United States v. Chunghwa Picture Tubes'', and ''United States v. Sharp Corporation'', heard in the Northern District of California, agreed to pay a total sum of $585 million to settle their prosecutions for conspiring to fix prices of liquid crystal display panels. That was the second largest amount awarded under the Sherman Act in history.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, it is an indictable criminal offense under Section 45 of the [[Competition Act]]. [[Bid rigging]] is considered a form of price fixing and is illegal in both the United States (s.1 Sherman Act) and Canada (s.47 Competition Act). In the United States, agreements to fix, raise, lower, stabilize, or otherwise set a price are illegal ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&amp;court=us&amp;vol=310&amp;invol=150|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not matter if the price agreed upon is reasonable or for a good or altruistic cause or the agreement is unspoken and tacit. In the United States, price-fixing also includes agreements to hold prices the same, discount prices (even if based on financial need or income), set credit terms, agree on a price schedule or scale, adopt a common formula to figure prices, ban price advertising, or agree to adhere to prices that are announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=The Antitrust Laws A Primer (1993); Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000). |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although price fixing usually means sellers agreeing on price, it can also include agreements among buyers to fix the price at which they will buy products.

===Australia===
Price fixing is illegal in Australia under the [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]], with considerably similar prohibitions to the US and Canadian prohibitions. The Act is administered and enforced by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]. Section 48 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) explicitly states, "A corporation shall not engage in the practise of resale price maintenance." A broader understanding of the statutory provision is in Section 96(3)of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), which broadly defines what can be resale price maintenance.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand law prohibits price fixing, among most other anti-competitive behaviours under the [[Commerce Act 1986]]. The act covers practices similar to that of US and Canadian law, and it is enforced by the [[Commerce Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/2004/commissionwarnsgpsaboutpricefixing.aspx| title=Commerce Commission warns GPs about Price Fixing| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416054240/http://www.comcom.govt.nz/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/2004/commissionwarnsgpsaboutpricefixing.aspx| archivedate=2009-04-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0005/latest/DLM87623.html|title=Commerce Act 1965 No 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Under the [[EU commission's leniency programme]], [[whistleblowing]] firms that co-operate with the antitrust authority see their prospective penalties either wiped out or reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David|last= Gow|coauthors= |title=Heineken and Grolsch fined for price-fixing |date= April 18, 2007|publisher= |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2059542,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
British competition law prohibits almost any attempt to fix prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?topicId=1074014670 |title=Price fixing, cartels and monopolies |publisher=Business Link |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Net Book Agreement]] was a public agreement between UK booksellers from 1900 to 1991 to sell new books only at the recommended retail price to protect the revenues of smaller bookshops. The agreement collapsed in 1991, when the large book chain [[Dillons Booksellers|Dillons]] began discounting books, followed by rival [[Waterstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://britishacademy.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5871/bacad/9780197263266.001.0001/upso-9780197263266 | title=The Organisation of Knowledge in Victorian Britain | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Daunton, Martin | authorlink =Martin Daunton| year=2005 | page=275 | isbn=978-0197263266 | doi=10.5871/bacad/9780197263266.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1E3FF934A35753C1A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Suzanne | last=Cassidy | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; British Book Shops in Price Skirmishes | date=1991-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, price-fixing is still legal in the magazine and newspaper distribution industry. Retailers who sell at below cover price are subject to withdrawal of supply. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] has given its approval to the ''status quo''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Exemptions==
When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral [[treaty]] or is entered by sovereign nations as opposed to individual firms, the [[cartel]] may be protected from lawsuits and criminal [[antitrust]] prosecution. That is why [[OPEC]], the global [[petroleum]] cartel, has not been prosecuted or successfully sued under [[US antitrust law]].

International airline tickets have their prices fixed by agreement with the [[IATA]], a practice for which there is a specific exemption in [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22IATA%22+antitrust+%22price+fixing%22|title="IATA" antitrust "price fixing" - Google Search|author=|date=|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2017}}

==Examples==

=== Compact discs ===
{{main article|CD price fixing}}

Between 1995 and 2000 music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as [[resale price maintenance|minimum advertised pricing]] to artificially inflate prices of [[compact disc]]s in order to end price wars by discounters such as [[Best Buy]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] in the early 1990s. It is estimated customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album. A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], [[EMI|EMI Music]], [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] as well as retailers [[Musicland]], [[Trans World Entertainment]] and [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]]. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups.

=== Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) ===
{{main article|DRAM price fixing}}
In October 2005, the [[Korea]]n company [[Samsung]] pleaded guilty to conspiring with other companies, including [[Infineon]] and [[Hynix Semiconductor]], to fix the price of dynamic random access memory ([[DRAM]]) chips. Samsung was the third company to be charged in connection with the international cartel and was fined $300 million, the second largest antitrust penalty in US history.

In October 2004, four executives from Infineon, a German chip maker, received reduced sentences of 4 to 6 months in federal prison and $250,000 in fines after agreeing to aid the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] with their ongoing investigation of the conspiracy.

=== Capacitors ===
In March 2018, the [[European Commission]] fined eight firms, mostly Japanese companies, €254 million for operating an illegal price cartel for [[capacitors]]&lt;ref name=jpcapactiros&gt;{{cite news|last1=JiJi|title=EU fines Japanese firms over price-fixing cartel for capacitors|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/03/22/business/eu-fines-japanese-firms-price-fixing-cartel-capacitors|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=The Japan Times Online|publisher=The Japan Times|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The two largest players were [[Nippon Chemi-Con]] which was fined €98 million and [[Hitachi]] Chemical which was fined €18 million&lt;ref name=jpcapactiros /&gt;.

=== Perfume ===
In 2006, the [[Cabinet of France|government of France]] fined 13 [[perfume]] brands and three vendors for price collusion between 1997 and 2000. The brands include [[L'Oréal]] (4.1mil euro), ''Pacific Creation Perfumes'' (90,000 euro), [[Chanel]], [[LVMH]]'s [[Sephora]] (9.4mil euro) and [[Hutchison Whampoa]]'s ''Marionnaud'' (12.8mil euro).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8GBH2GO1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214162749/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8GBH2GO1.htm |date=February 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid crystal display ===
In 2008 in the US, [[LG Display Co.]], Chunghwa Picture Tubes and [[Sharp Corp.]], agreed to plead guilty and pay $585 million in criminal fines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/12/news/international/pricefixing/index.htm | work=CNN | first1=Terry | last1=Frieden | first2=Justice | last2=Producer | title=$585 million LCD price-fixing fine | date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/November/08-at-1002.html |title=#08-1002: LG, Sharp, Chunghwa Agree to Plead Guilty, Pay Total of $585 Million in Fines for Participating in LCD Price-fixing Conspiracies (2008-11-12) |publisher=Justice.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for conspiring to fix prices of [[liquid crystal display]] panels.

South Korea–based [[LG Display]] would pay $400 million, the second-highest criminal fine that the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|US Justice Department antitrust division]] has ever imposed. Chunghwa would pay $65 million for conspiring with LG Display and other unnamed companies and Sharp would pay $120 million, according to the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aP1P0CBFZssE&amp;refer=asia | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | title=LCD Makers Will Plead Guilty in Price-Fixing Scheme (Update2) | date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[EU]] fined LG Display €215 million for its part in the [[LCD]] price fixing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-08/six-lcd-panel-makers-fined-649-million-by-european-union-for-price-fixing.html|title=LCD-Panel Makers Fined $649 Million by European Union for Price Fixing|author=Aoife White|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=8 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies were fined for a combined total of €648.9 million, including [[Chimei Innolux Corporation|Chimei Innolux]], [[AU Optronics]], Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd., and [[HannStar Display Corporation|HannStar Display Corp.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/10/736&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Joaquín Almunia Vice President of the European Commission responsible for Competition Policy Press conference on LCD cartel, Visa and French chemists' association decisions Press conference Brussels, 8 December 2010 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; LG Display said it is considering appealing the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2010/12/133_77753.html|title=2 LCD giants face contrasting fates|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|date=9 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air cargo market ===
In late 2005/early 2006, [[Lufthansa]] and [[Virgin Atlantic]] came forward about their involvement in large price-fixing schemes for cargo and passenger surcharges in which 21 airlines were involved since 2000 (amongst which were [[British Airways]], [[Korean Air]], and [[Air France-KLM]]). [[U.S. Department of Justice]] fined the airlines a total of $1.7 billion, charged 19 executives with wrongdoing and four received prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell |first=Alicia A. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41926712/ns/travel-news/t/airlines-fined-price-fixing-scheme/#.TrXMyRwrxt0 |title=21 airlines fined in price-fixing scheme |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[New Zealand Commerce Commission]] filed legal proceedings against 13 airlines in the [[New Zealand High Court]]. According to the Commission, the carriers "colluded to raise the price of [freight] by imposing fuel charges for more than seven years".&lt;ref name="Commerce Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/BusinessCompetition/Anti-competitivePractices/commercecommissionprocedureinaccor.aspx|title=Commerce Commission procedure in accordance with standard best practice|date=20 March 2009|work=Release no 113|publisher=[[New Zealand Commerce Commission|Commerce Commission]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906183007/http://www.comcom.govt.nz/BusinessCompetition/Anti-competitivePractices/commercecommissionprocedureinaccor.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Air New Zealand]] was the final airline of the 13 to settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/media-centre/media-releases/detail/2013/air-new-zealand-final-airline-to-settle-with-commerce-commission-in-air-cargo-case|title=Air New Zealand final airline to settle with Commerce Commission in air cargo case|work=Media Release|publisher=Commerce Commission|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission noted that it might involve up to 60 airlines.&lt;ref name="CC Dec 08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/media-centre/media-releases/2008/internationalaircargocarteltobepro|title=International air cargo cartel to be prosecuted|date=15 December 2008|work=Media Release|publisher=Commerce Commission|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Commission said overseas competition authorities were also investigating the [[air cargo]] market, including the US and Australia where fines had been imposed.&lt;ref name="Commerce Commission"/&gt;

==Criticism on legislation==
[[Economic liberals]] believe that price fixing is a voluntary and consensual activity between parties that should be free from government compulsion and government interference. At times price fixing ensures a stable market for both consumers and producers. Any short term benefit of increased price competition will force some producers out of the market and cause product shortages and prices for consumers to rise. In the end price-fixing legislation forces producers out of a market because it can't compete with the biggest discounter and the market winds up a monopoly anyway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv12n2/reg12n2-debow.html |title=Regulation Magazine Vol. 12 No. 2 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prinsengrachtconcert''' is an annual open-air concert of classical music held annually in August since 1981 on the [[Prinsengracht]] in Amsterdam. The orchestra is situated on a pontoon anchored in front of the [[Hotel Pulitzer]]; much of the audience watches and listens from boats. Traditionally the concert is closed with a rendition of one of the city's anthems, "[[Aan de Amsterdamse grachten]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/729849/2003/08/25/Brahms-moet-ook-kunnen-zolang-er-rose-is.dhtml|title='Brahms moet ook kunnen' zolang er rosé is|last=Swanborn|first=Peter|date=25 August 2003|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1984 it is televised by the [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]]. Since 1998 it is part of the [[Grachtenfestival]], though still independently organized; the first Prinsengrachtconcert on ice was held in February 2012.

'''Public intoxication''', also known as "'''drunk and disorderly'''" and '''drunk in public''', is a [[summary offense]] in some countries rated to public cases or displays of [[alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]]. Public intoxication laws vary widely from jurisdiction, but usually require some obvious display of intoxicated incompetence or behavior disruptive/obnoxious to [[public-order crime|public order]] before the charge is levied.

== Australia ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
While it is technically illegal in most [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]] of [[Australia]] to be drunk and disorderly, most Australian police are relatively lenient about public intoxication. They generally transport the IP ("Intoxicated Person") to his or her residence or temporary detention at a police station or other welfare establishment until the person is sober.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] being "drunk in a public place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Offences Act 1966|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/soa1966189/s13.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "drunk and disorderly in a public place"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Offences Act 1966|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/soa1966189/s14.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are separate offences contained in the ''Summary Offences Act 1966'' which have their own power of arrest. Recent changes to legislation allow police to issue an infringement notice for these offences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infringements (General Regulations ) 2006 - Schedule 3 Section 10AA|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/ir2006325/sch3.html|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the traditional method of charging and bailing the offender to the Magistrates' Court. The current fine attached to the infringement notice is $590 for a first offence and $1,100 for a subsequent offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough new laws to tackle drunken louts|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/322-tough-new-laws-to-tackle-drunken-louts.html|publisher=Premier of Victoria|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person arrested for being drunk or drunk and disorderly is held at the Melbourne Custody Centre or the cells at a police station or placed in the care of a friend or relative.  

In [[New South Wales]] police have the discretion to issue "on the spot" fines or infringement notices for "drunk in public", a fine that costs the individual over $480 (4 penalty units).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Community Legal Centres across the state complain about these fines and the impact it has had on various vulnerable members of the community, including young people, the homeless and minority groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Prosecution (charging) is generally only considered if the person is violent or other offenses have been committed.

As an example, a "Drunk and Disorderly" Fine in the State of New South Wales starts at $550.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

As of February 2009, local councils in the state of New South Wales are not allowed to charge people who drink in alcohol-free zones; they are only permitted to confiscate the alcohol of the intoxicated person.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Canada==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
In [[Canada]], liquor laws are made by the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and not the [[Government of Canada|federal government]].

In [[British Columbia]], drinking in public and public [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] are offenses.  If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.

In Ontario, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. Having an open container in public garners a $125 fine. Public drunkenness garners a $65 fine and detainment until sober. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.

While liquor laws are similar from [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] to province, the laws in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories]] tend to be substantially different. For instance, in the [[Northwest Territories]] public intoxication can result in imprisonment or detention in a medical facility for up to 24 hours (NWT Liquor Act).

== United Kingdom ==
{{see|Alcohol licensing laws of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Stonehenge trouble on stones.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a group of people standing outside at nighttime, two of whom are barechested and one of whom is balancing on a stone|In the United Kingdom, the police normally only enforce the laws against public intoxication if the intoxicated person is unable to act in a reasonable manner, as demonstrated by such activities as climbing on [[Stonehenge]] ''(pictured)''.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], there are a number of offences dealing with intoxication, which vary between the constituent countries.

In a public place, it is an offence to be:
*drunk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1052305&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1052313 |title=section 12 Licensing Act 1872 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*drunk and disorderly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1251271&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1251348 |title=section 91, Criminal Justice Act 1967 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also an offence to be drunk:
*while boarding, or while on board, an aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=3635635&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3635866 |title=section 139, Air Navigation Order 2009 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*while in charge of a child under 7 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=licensing&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=7&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1066805&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1066810&amp;filesize=3498 |title=section 2, Licensing Act 1902 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*while travelling to a "designated sporting event" (usually professional football matches) on [[public transport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1300758&amp;activetextdocid=1300761 section 1, Sporting  Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; or a vehicle with eight seats or more&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1300758&amp;activetextdocid=1300762section 1A, Sporting   Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;
*while in, or attempting to enter, a "designated sporting ground" (a football ground) during a designated sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/57/section/2 section 2], Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc.) Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police]] will only get involved if the person is so drunk they are unable to act in a reasonable manner, such as passing out on the street. In that case typically the police will, depending on the circumstances, help the intoxicated person on their way or place the person in a police station cell until [[Sobriety|sober]].  Once fit to be dealt with the detained person will normally either be cautioned, be issued with a [[Penalty Notice for Disorder]] (PND – £90 fine in ticket form) or bailed to appear at the local [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|court]]. The court in turn may issue a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] (up to level 1 or level 3 on the [[standard scale#United Kingdom|standard scale]] depending on the offence charged).

There are also many more specific offences, including driving a motor vehicle while drunk (or being found 'drunk in charge')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_2] - [[Road Traffic Act 1998]], ss.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; and riding a cycle while unfit through drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880052_en_3] - [[Road Traffic Act 1998]], s.30&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the police have the power (although not the obligation) to confiscate any alcohol which is being consumed in public by those under 18, and [[local government|local authorities]] have the power to prohibit alcohol consumption in certain areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/ukpga_20010016_en_2] - [[Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001]], ss.12-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.

==United States==
[[File:HomelessPeople-BaltimoreMD.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a man and a woman lying on a sidewalk, the woman wearing one white shoe while its match lies beside her, the man wearing two shoes|Public intoxication laws in the United States vary from state to state, and some states consider it a misdemeanor to obstruct sidewalks as a result of intoxication.]]
Laws in the United States regarding [[drunkenness]] vary widely from state to state.

===1968 Constitutional challenge===
In 1968, in the case of ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', the [[Texas]] law against public intoxication was challenged in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] for alleged violation of [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], which forbids [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. The court upheld the law, ruling that making a crime of public intoxication was neither cruel nor unusual.

===State public intoxication laws today===
{{See also|Alcohol laws of the United States}}
*[[California]]: California Penal Code 647(f) considers public intoxication a [[misdemeanor]]. The code describes public intoxication as someone who displays intoxication to liquor, drugs, controlled substances or [[toluene]] and demonstrates an inability to care for themselves or others, or interferes or obstructs the free use of streets, sidewalks or other public way. California Penal Code 647(g) affords law enforcement the option to take an individual fitting the arrest criteria for 647(f), and no other crime, into civil protective custody if a "sobering facility" is available.  Essentially, the detainee agrees to remain at the location until the facility's staff consents to their departure; usually after four hours and upon the belief that the detainee is safe to look after themselves.   Not every municipality in California has such a facility.  Also, if a person is being combative and/or is under the influence of drugs, they will be taken to jail.  Unlike a person who is taken to jail, a civil detainee under 647(g) is not later prosecuted in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/639-653.1.html |title=CAL. PEN. CODE § 639 : California Code - Section 639 |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Colorado]]: Public intoxication in the state of Colorado is not punished with criminal or civil penalties. Instead, state law prohibits the passing of local laws that penalize public intoxication, but state law provides for the creation of patrols trained to provide assistance to intoxicated and incapacitated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/colorado-public-intoxication-laws.htm |title=Colorado Public Intoxication Laws |date= |accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]:  In Georgia, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor.  Public intoxication is defined as a person who shall be and appear in an intoxicated condition in any public place or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which condition is made manifest by boisterousness, by indecent condition or act, or by vulgar, profane, loud, or unbecoming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexis-nexis.com/hottopics/gacode/default.asp |title=LexisNexis Custom Solution: Georgia Code Research Tool |publisher=Lexis-nexis.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Indiana]]: In Indiana, public intoxication is a class B misdemeanor, punishable with up to 180 days in jail, and a $1000 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title35/ar50/ch3.html |title=Indiana Code 35-50-3 |publisher=In.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, simply being intoxicated in public is no longer a crime. The person must also be, (1) endangering the person's life; (2) endangering the life of another person;(3) breaching the peace or is in imminent danger of breaching the peace; or (4) is harassing, annoying, or alarming another person. (See IC 7.1-5-1-3).
*[[Iowa]]: The Code of Iowa Sec 123.46 states that "a person shall not be intoxicated or simulate intoxication in a public place". Public Intoxication is a Simple Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days' jail and a $1,000 fine. Aggravated Public Intoxication (3rd or subsequent Offense) is an Aggravated Misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 2 years in prison. As of 2013, Johnson County, home of the University of Iowa had the highest arrest rate for public intoxication of any county in the state, at 8.28 per 1,000 residents.
*[[Kansas]]: Being drunk in public in Kansas is not a criminal offense. Kansas statute 65-4059 states "No county or city shall adopt any local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation having the force of law rendering public intoxication by alcohol in and of itself or being a common drunkard or being found in enumerated places in an intoxicated condition, an offense, a violation, or the subject of criminal penalties."
*[[Minnesota]]: Public intoxication is not a crime in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes?id=340A.902|title=340A.902 - 2015 Minnesota Statutes|website=www.revisor.mn.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cities can enact laws against public intoxication, such as the City of [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ci.stcloud.mn.us/106/Code-of-Ordinances|title=Code of Ordinances {{!}} St. Cloud, MN - Official Website|website=ci.stcloud.mn.us|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Missouri]] has no state public intoxication law. Missouri's [[Alcohol laws of Missouri|permissive alcohol laws]] both protect people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibit local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/06700003051.HTML|title=Section: 067.0305 Counties or cities not to arrest or punish for public intoxication.  RSMO 67.305|website=www.moga.mo.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Montana]] state law states that public intoxication is not a crime. However, the law allows law enforcement to take an intoxicated person home, or to detain them, if they are a danger to themselves or others. The law also states that no record can be made that indicates the person was arrested or detained for being intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/53/24/53-24-107.htm |title=Article 53-24-107 of the Montana Code |publisher=Leg.mt.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nevada]] has no state public intoxication law. Nevada state law both protects people from suffering any criminal penalty (including arrest) for the mere act of being drunk in public, and prohibits local jurisdictions from enacting criminal public intoxication laws on their own.
*[[Oregon]]: The state has no laws against public intoxication and actively bans local intoxication ordinances in §430.402.  "However, if the person is incapacitated, the health of the person appears to be in immediate danger, or the police have reasonable cause to believe the person is dangerous to self or to any other person, the person shall be taken by the police to an appropriate treatment facility." § 430.399 
*[[Texas]]: Public intoxication is a Class C misdemeanor&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code Section 49.02.&lt;/ref&gt; (Class C misdemeanors are punishable by fine only not to exceed $500&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code Section 12.23.&lt;/ref&gt;).  However, if the offender is a minor, harsher penalties apply (especially if a two-time prior offender in which case jail time can be ordered).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code Section 106.071.&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 49.01 of the Penal Code, which legally defines "intoxication", includes both a blood alcohol content greater than 0.08 but also defines it as "not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body"; thus, a breathalyzer or field sobriety test is not required to prove public intoxication.  This low standard of proof has led to criticism that officers are using "public intoxication" as a means of harassment, especially towards minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/blog/2010/02/26/texas-public-intoxication-laws |title=Texas Public Intoxication Laws Allow for Arrest Without Intoxication. Or Even Drinking. - Hit &amp; Run |publisher=Reason.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Virginia]] criminalizes public intoxication under section 18.2-388 of the Code of Virginia. It is punishable by a fine of up to $250. 
*[[Wisconsin]] also does not have a state public intoxication law although municipalities may pass city ordinances prohibiting public intoxication.  Public intoxication is legal in [[Milwaukee]], however, public drinking is not.

In mid-1947, a [[United States Army Air Forces]] balloon crashed at a [[ranch]] near [[Roswell, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=olmsted184 /&gt; Following wide initial interest in the crashed "flying disc", the US military stated that it was merely a conventional [[weather balloon]].&lt;ref name=olmsted /&gt; Interest subsequently waned until the late 1970s, when [[ufologist]]s began promoting a variety of increasingly elaborate [[conspiracy theories]], claiming that one or more alien spacecraft had crash-landed and that the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] occupants had been recovered by the military, which then engaged in a [[cover-up]].

In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed object: a nuclear test surveillance balloon from [[Project Mogul]]. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest in popular media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as "the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked [[UFO]] claim".&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt;

The sequence of events was triggered by the crash of a [[Project Mogul]] balloon near Roswell.&lt;ref name=olmsted184&gt;{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2009|page=184}}: Olmsted writes "When one of these balloons smashed into the sands of the New Mexico ranch, the military decided to hide the project's real purpose." The official Air Force report (Weaver &amp; McAndrew 1995) had concluded (p. 9) "[…] the material recovered near Roswell was consistent with a balloon device and most likely from one of the MOGUL balloons that had not been previously recovered."&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 14, 1947, {{Anchor|William Brazel}}William Brazel, a [[Plant foreman|foreman]] working on the Foster homestead, noticed clusters of debris approximately {{convert|30|mi|-1}} north of [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. This date—or "about three weeks" before July 8—appeared in later stories featuring Brazel, but the initial press release from the [[Roswell Army Air Field]] (RAAF) said the find was "sometime last week", suggesting Brazel found the debris in early July.&lt;ref name=telex1&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}{{cite web | url=http://roswellproof.homestead.com/United_Press_Telexes.html | title=''United Press'' Teletype Messages | publisher=Roswell Proof | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazel told the ''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'' that he and his son saw a "large area of bright wreckage made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ufologie.net/rw/p/roswelldailyrecord9jul1947.htm |title=Harassed Rancher who Located 'Saucer' Sorry He Told About it |newspaper=[[Roswell Daily Record]] |date=July 9, 1947 |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109043134/http://ufologie.net/rw/p/roswelldailyrecord9jul1947.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid little attention to it but returned on July 4 with his son, wife and daughter to gather up the material.&lt;ref name=tpretty&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}{{Harvnb|Printy|1999|loc=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts have described Brazel as having gathered some of the material earlier, rolling it together and stashing it under some brush.&lt;ref name=ap3jnine&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.roswellproof.com/AP3_Main_July9.html | title=New Mexico 'Disc' Declared Weather Balloon and Kite | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Examiner]] | page=1 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=July 9, 1947 | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Brazel heard reports about "flying discs" and wondered if that was what he had picked up.&lt;ref name=tpretty /&gt; On July 7, Brazel saw Sheriff Wilcox and "whispered kinda confidential like" that he may have found a flying disc.&lt;ref name=tpretty /&gt; Another account quotes Wilcox as saying Brazel reported the object on July 6.&lt;ref name=telex1 /&gt; 

Wilcox called RAAF Major Jesse Marcel and a "man in plainclothes" accompanied Brazel back to the ranch where more pieces were picked up. "[We] spent a couple of hours Monday afternoon [July 7] looking for any more parts of the weather device", said Marcel. "We found a few more patches of tinfoil and rubber."&lt;ref name=fortworthst&gt;{{cite news | url=http://roswellproof.homestead.com/FortWorthST_July9.html | title=New Mexico Rancher's 'Flying Disk' Proves to be Weather Balloon-Kite | newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |date= July 9, 1947 | page=Front | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 1947, [[Roswell Army Air Field]] (RAAF) [[public information officer]] [[Walter Haut]] issued a [[press release]] stating that personnel from the field's [[509th Operations Group]] had recovered a "flying disc", which had crashed on a ranch near Roswell. As described in the July 9, 1947 edition of the ''[[Roswell Daily Record]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;The balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been 12 feet [3.5 m] long, [Brazel] felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about 200 yards [180 m] in diameter. When the debris was gathered up, the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a bundle about three feet [1 m] long and 7 or 8 inches [18 or 20 cm] thick, while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches [45 or 50 cm] long and about 8 inches [20 cm] thick. In all, he estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds [2 kg]. There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an engine, and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil. There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there were letters on some of the parts. Considerable Scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction. No strings or wires were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.&lt;ref name=rswdr&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.angelfire.com/indie/anna_jones1/daily_record02.html | title=Harassed Rancher who Located 'Saucer' Sorry He Told about It | newspaper=[[Roswell Daily Record]] | date=July 9, 1947 | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[telex]] sent to a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) office from the [[Fort Worth, Texas]] office quoted a Major from the Eighth Air Force (also based in Fort Worth at [[Carswell Air Force Base]]) on July 8, 1947 as saying that "The disc is hexagonal in shape and was suspended from a {{sic|ballon}} by cable, which {{sic|ballon}} was approximately twenty feet (6 m) in diameter. Major Curtan further advices {{sic|advises}} that the object found resembles a high altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector, but that telephonic conversation between their office and Wright field had not [UNINTELLIGIBLE] borne out this belief."&lt;ref name=tprettydefla&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}{{Harvnb|Printy|1999|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nssl0020.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[weather balloon]] after launching]]

Early on Tuesday, July 8, the RAAF issued a press release, which was immediately picked up by numerous news outlets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/Roswell/RoswellDailyRecord.jpg | title=RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region | newspaper=[[Roswell Daily Record]] | date=July 8, 1947 | page=Front | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510200615/http://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/Roswell/RoswellDailyRecord.jpg | archivedate=May 10, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the [[509th Operations Group|509th Bomb group]] of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of [[Chaves County, New Mexico|Chaves County]]. The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office. Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.&lt;ref name=raff1&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}{{Harvnb|Printy|1999|loc=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Colonel [[William H. Blanchard]], commanding officer of the 509th, contacted General Roger M. Ramey of the Eighth Air Force in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and Ramey ordered the object be flown to [[Carswell Air Force Base|Fort Worth Army Air Field]]. At the base, [[Warrant officer (United States)#Air Force|Warrant Officer]] Irving Newton confirmed Ramey’s preliminary opinion, identifying the object as being a weather balloon and its "kite",&lt;ref name=ap3jnine /&gt; a nickname for a radar reflector used to track the balloons from the ground. Another news release was issued, this time from the Fort Worth base, describing the object as being a "weather balloon".

The military decided to conceal the true purpose of the crashed device – [[nuclear test]] monitoring – and instead inform the public that the crash was of a [[weather balloon]].&lt;ref name=olmsted&gt;{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the press reported that [[Commanding General]] of the [[Eighth Air Force]] Roger Ramey had stated that a weather balloon was recovered by the RAAF personnel. A [[News conference|press conference]] was held, featuring debris (foil, rubber and wood) said to be from the crashed object, which matched the weather balloon description. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the intended effect was achieved: "the story died the next day".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the incident faded from the attention of UFO enthusiasts for more than 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing interest, 1978–1994 ==

Between 1978 and the early 1990s, UFO researchers such as [[Stanton T. Friedman]], [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|William Moore]], [[Karl T. Pflock]], and the team of [[Kevin D. Randle]] and Donald R. Schmitt interviewed several hundred people who claimed to have had a connection with the events at Roswell in 1947.&lt;ref name=korff-csi&gt;{{cite journal | last=Korff | first=Kal | date=August 1997 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/what_really_happened_at_roswell | title=What Really Happened at Roswell | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | volume=21 | issue=4 | accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of documents were obtained via [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests, along with other documents such as [[Majestic 12]] that were supposedly leaked by insiders. Their conclusions were at least one alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell, alien bodies had been recovered, and a government cover-up of the incident had taken place.&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt;

Over the years, books, articles, and television specials brought the 1947 incident significant notoriety.&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt; By the mid-1990s, public polls such as a 1997 [[CNN]]/''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' poll, revealed that the majority of people interviewed believed that aliens had indeed visited Earth, and that aliens had landed at Roswell, but that all the relevant information was being kept secret by the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-06-15/us/9706_15_ufo.poll_1_ufo-aliens-crash-site?_s=PM:US | title=Poll U.S. Hiding Knowledge of Aliens | newspaper=''[[CNN]]'' | date=June 15, 1997 | accessdate=February 5, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314070634/http://articles.cnn.com/1997-06-15/us/9706_15_ufo.poll_1_ufo-aliens-crash-site?_s=PM:US | archivedate=March 14, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[anthropologist]]s Susan Harding and Kathleen Stewart, the Roswell Story was the prime example of how a discourse moved from the fringes to the mainstream according to the prevailing ''[[zeitgeist]]'': public preoccupation in the 1980s with "conspiracy, cover-up and repression" aligned well with the Roswell narratives as told in the "sensational books" which were being published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harding|Stewart|2003|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friedman's initial work ===

In 1978, nuclear physicist and author Stanton T. Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth where reporters saw material which was claimed to be part of the recovered object. The accounts given by Friedman and others in the following years elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time.&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gildenberg|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===

==== ''The Roswell Incident'' (1980) ====
The first conspiracy book about Roswell was ''The Roswell Incident'' (1980) by [[Charles Berlitz]] and William Moore, authors who had previously written popular books on the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] and on the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref name=olmsted /&gt;

Historian Kathy Olmsted writes that the material in this book has come to be known as "version 1" of the Roswell myth. Berlitz and Moore's narrative holds that an alien craft was flying over the New Mexico desert observing US [[nuclear weapon]]s activity, but crashed after being hit by [[lightning]], killing the aliens on board; a government cover-up duly followed.&lt;ref name=olmsted /&gt;

The authors claimed to have interviewed over ninety witnesses. Though he was uncredited, Friedman carried out some research for the book.&lt;ref name=korff-general&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|pp=1–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Roswell Incident'' featured accounts of debris described by Marcel as "nothing made on this earth."&lt;ref name="Berlitz28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional accounts by Bill Brazel,&lt;ref name="Berlitz79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of Mac Brazel, neighbor Floyd Proctor&lt;ref name="Berlitz83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Walt Whitman Jr.,&lt;ref name="Berlitz88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|pp=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of newsman W. E. Whitman who had interviewed Mac Brazel, suggested the material Marcel recovered had super-strength not associated with a weather balloon. The book introduced the contention that debris which was recovered by Marcel at the Foster ranch, visible in photographs showing Marcel posing with the debris, was substituted for debris from a weather device as part of a cover-up.&lt;ref name="Berlitz33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|pp=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also claimed that the debris recovered from the ranch was not permitted a close inspection by the press. The efforts by the military were described as being intended to discredit and "counteract the growing hysteria towards flying saucers".&lt;ref name="Berlitz42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two accounts&lt;ref name="Berlitz75,88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|pp=75,88}}&lt;/ref&gt; of witness intimidation were included in the book, including the incarceration of Mac Brazel.&lt;ref name="Berlitz75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|pp=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also introduced the secondhand stories of civil engineer Barney Barnett and a group of archeology students from an unidentified university seeing alien wreckage and bodies while in the desert.&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlitz and Moore's narrative was dominant until the late 1980s when other authors, attracted by the commercial potential of writing about Roswell, started producing rival accounts.&lt;ref name=Goldberg197&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''UFO Crash at Roswell'' (1991) ====
In 1991, Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt published ''UFO Crash at Roswell''. They added 100 new witnesses, altered and tightened the narrative, and included several "sinister" new twists.&lt;ref name=Goldberg197 /&gt;

Some new details were included, including accounts of a "gouge […] that extended four or five hundred feet [120 or 150 m]" at the ranch&lt;ref name="Randle200"&gt;{{Harvnb|Randle|Schmitt|1991|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and descriptions of an elaborate cordon and recovery operation. Several witnesses in ''The Roswell Incident'' described being turned back from the Foster ranch by armed military police, but extensive descriptions were not given.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The Barnett accounts were mentioned, though the dates and locations were changed from the accounts found in ''The Roswell Incident''. In the new account, Brazel was described as leading the Army to a second crash site on the ranch, at which point the Army personnel were supposedly "horrified to find civilians [including Barnett] there already."&lt;ref name="Randle206"&gt;{{Harvnb|Randle|Schmitt|1991|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Dennis was produced as a supposedly important witness in 1989, after calling the hotline when an episode of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' featured the Roswell incident. His descriptions of [[Alien autopsy|Roswell alien autopsies]] were the first account that said there were alien corpses at the Roswell Army Air Base.&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt;

Randle and Schmitt's book sold 160,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Goldberg199&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Crash at Corona'' (1992) ====
In 1992, Stanton Friedman re-entered the scene with his own book ''Crash at Corona'', co-authored with Don Berliner – an author of books on space and aviation.&lt;ref name=Goldberg199 /&gt; Goldberg writes that Friedman too introduced new "witnesses", and that he added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight – two of which were said to have survived and been taken into custody by the government.&lt;ref name=Goldberg199 /&gt;

==== ''The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell'' (1994) ====
Randle and Schmitt responded with another book, updating their previous narrative with several new details, including the claim that alien bodies were taken by cargo plane to be viewed by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who was curious about their appearance.&lt;ref name=Goldberg199 /&gt;

==== ''[[The Day After Roswell]]'' (1997) ====
Former Lt. Col. [[Philip J. Corso]] reported in his autobiographical book that the Roswell Crash did happen and that when he was assigned to Fort Riley (Kansas) in July 1947, 5 trucks of 25 tons and some semi trailers entered the base from Fort Bliss Texas. He claimed while he was patrolling the base he was brought into the medical facilities by Sgt. Brown and shown the remnants of bodies that were from an "air crash". [[Philip Klass]] analyzed his claims line by line and exposed many inconsistencies and factual errors.&lt;ref name=kf2&gt;{{Harvnb|Klass|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competing accounts ===
The existence of so many differing accounts by 1994 led to a schism among ufologists about the events at Roswell.&lt;ref name="Saler24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saler|Ziegler|Moore|1997|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for UFO Studies]] (CUFOS) and the [[Mutual UFO Network]] (MUFON), two leading UFO societies, disagreed in their views of the various scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner; several conferences were held to try to resolve the differences. One issue under discussion was where Barnett was when he saw the alien craft he was said to have encountered. A 1992 UFO conference had attempted to achieve a consensus among the various scenarios portrayed in ''Crash at Corona'' and ''UFO Crash at Roswell'', however, the publication of ''The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell'' had "resolved" the Barnett problem by simply ignoring Barnett and citing a new location for the alien craft recovery, including a new group of archaeologists not connected to the ones the Barnett story cited.&lt;ref name="Saler24" /&gt;

Don Schmitt held that variations in narratives between different writers was not however an essential problem, commenting by way of comparison "We know Jesus Christ was crucified, we just don't know where."&lt;ref name=Goldberg201&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Problems with witness accounts ====
Hundreds of people were interviewed by the various researchers, but critics point out that only a few of these people claimed to have seen debris or aliens. Most witnesses were repeating the claims of others, and their testimony would be considered [[hearsay]] in an American court of law and therefore inadmissible as evidence. Of the 90 people claimed to have been interviewed for ''The Roswell Incident'', the testimony of only 25 appears in the book, and only seven of these people saw the debris. Of these, five handled the debris.&lt;ref name=korff29&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pflock, in ''Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe'' (2001), makes a similar point about Randle and Schmitt's ''UFO Crash at Roswell.'' Approximately 271 people are listed in the book who were "contacted and interviewed" for the book, and this number does not include those who chose to remain anonymous, meaning more than 300 witnesses were interviewed, a figure Pflock said the authors frequently cited.&lt;ref name=PflockInconv176&gt;{{Harvnb|Pflock|2001|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 300-plus individuals, only 41 can be "considered genuine first- or second-hand witnesses to the events in and around Roswell or at the Fort Worth Army Air Field," and only 23 can be "reasonably thought to have seen physical evidence, debris recovered from the Foster Ranch." Of these, only seven have asserted anything suggestive of otherworldly origins for the debris.&lt;ref name=PflockInconv176 /&gt;

As for the accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens, critics identified problems ranging from the reliability of second-hand accounts, to credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false claims, or multiple, contradictory accounts, to dubious death-bed confessions or accounts from elderly and easily confused witnesses.&lt;ref name=korff-ch3&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|pp=77–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|pp=86–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pflock noted that only four people with supposed firsthand knowledge of alien bodies were interviewed and identified by Roswell authors: Frank Kaufmann; Jim Ragsdale; Lt. Col. Albert Lovejoy Duran; Gerald Anderson.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Harvnb|Pflock|2001|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duran is mentioned in a brief footnote in ''The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell'' and never again, while the other three all have serious credibility problems. A problem with all the accounts, charge critics, is they all came about a minimum of 31 years after the events in question, and in many cases were recounted more than 40 years after the fact. Not only are memories this old of dubious reliability, they were also subject to contamination from other accounts the interviewees may have been exposed to.&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt; The shifting claims of Jesse Marcel, whose suspicion that what he recovered in 1947 was "not of this world" sparked interest in the incident in the first place, cast serious doubt on the reliability of what he claimed to be true.

In ''The Roswell Incident'', Marcel stated, "Actually, this material may have ''looked'' like tinfoil and balsa wood, but the resemblance ended there […] They took one picture of me on the floor holding up some of the less-interesting metallic debris […] The stuff in that one photo was pieces of the actual stuff we found. It was not a staged photo."&lt;ref name=berlitz-general&gt;{{Harvnb|Berlitz|Moore|1980|pp=1–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Printy points out that the material Marcel positively identified as being part of what he recovered is material that skeptics and UFO advocates agree is debris from a balloon device.&lt;ref name=tprettydefla /&gt; After that fact was pointed out to him, Marcel changed his story to say that that material was not what he recovered.&lt;ref name=tprettydefla /&gt; Skeptics like Robert Todd argued that Marcel had a history of embellishment and exaggeration, such as claiming to have been a pilot and having received five Air Medals for shooting down enemy planes, claims that were all found to be false, and skeptics feel that his evolving Roswell story was simply another instance of this tendency to fabricate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Todd | first=Robert | date=December 8, 1995 | url=http://www.roswellfiles.com/pdf/KowPflop120895.pdf | title=Jesse Marcel: Folk Hero or Mythomaniac | journal=The KowPflop Quarterly | volume=1 | issue=3 | pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Air Force reports, 1994–1997 ==
In response to these reports, and after [[United States Congress|United States congressional]] inquiries, the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the [[United States Secretary of the Air Force]] to conduct an internal investigation. The result was summarized in two reports. The first, released in 1994, concluded that the material recovered in 1947 was likely debris from [[Project Mogul]], a military surveillance program employing [[high-altitude balloon]]s (and classified portion of an unclassified [[New York University]] project by atmospheric researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=The Roswell Incident at 70: Facts, Not Myths |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=12-15 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720182643/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_roswell_incident_at_70_facts_not_myths |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The second report, released in 1997, concluded that reports of recovered alien bodies were likely a combination of innocently transformed memories of accidents involving military casualties with memories of the recovery of [[Crash test dummy|anthropomorphic dummies]] in military programs such as the 1950s [[Operation High Dive]], mixed with hoaxes perpetrated by various witnesses and UFO proponents. The psychological effects of time compression and confusion about when events occurred explained the discrepancy with the years in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

The Air Force reports were dismissed by UFO proponents as being either [[disinformation]] or simply implausible, though skeptical researchers such as [[Philip J. Klass]]&lt;ref name=saf /&gt; and Robert Todd, who had been expressing doubts regarding accounts of aliens for several years, used the reports as the basis for skeptical responses to claims by UFO proponents. After the release of the Air Force reports, several books, such as Kal Korff's ''The Roswell UFO Crash: What They Don't Want You To Know'' (1997), built on the evidence presented in the reports to conclude "there is no credible evidence that the remains of an extraterrestrial spacecraft was involved."&lt;ref name=korff-csi /&gt; In the 1990s, skeptics and even some [[social anthropologist]]s&lt;ref name="Saler2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saler|Ziegler|Moore|1997|pp=1–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the increasingly elaborate accounts of alien crash landings and government cover ups as evidence of a myth being constructed.

=== Evidence ===
Although there is no evidence that a UFO crashed at Roswell, believers firmly hold to the belief that one did, and that the truth has been concealed as a result of a government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=Joseph132&gt;{{Harvnb|Joseph|2008|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; B. D. Gildenberg has called the Roswell incident "the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim".&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt;

Pflock said, "[T]he case for Roswell is a classic example of the triumph of quantity over quality. The advocates of the crashed-saucer tale […] simply shovel everything that seems to support their view into the box marked 'Evidence' and say, 'See? Look at all this stuff. We must be right.' Never mind the contradictions. Never mind the lack of independent supporting fact. Never mind the blatant absurdities."&lt;ref name=PflockInconv223&gt;{{Harvnb|Pflock|2001|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korff suggests there are clear incentives for some people to promote the idea of aliens at Roswell, and that many researchers were not doing competent work: "[The] UFO field is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} people who are willing to take advantage of the gullibility of others, especially the paying public. Let's not pull any punches here: The Roswell UFO myth has been very good business for UFO groups, publishers, for Hollywood, the town of Roswell, the media, and UFOlogy […] [The] number of researchers who employ science and its disciplined methodology is appallingly small."&lt;ref name=korff248&gt;{{Harvnb|Korff|1997|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gildenberg wrote there were as many as 11 reported alien recovery sites&lt;ref name="ARoswellRequiem" /&gt; and these recoveries bore only a marginal resemblance to the event as initially reported in 1947, or as recounted later by the initial witnesses. Some of these new accounts could have been confused accounts of the several known recoveries of injured and dead servicemen from four military plane crashes that occurred in the area from 1948 to 1950.&lt;ref name=creatures1&gt;{{Harvnb|Printy|1999|loc=Chapter 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts could have been based on memories of recoveries of [[Crash test dummy|test dummies]], as suggested by the Air Force in their reports. Charles Ziegler argued that the Roswell story has all the hallmarks of a traditional folk narrative. He identified six distinct narratives, and a process of transmission via storytellers with a core story that was created from various witness accounts, and was then shaped and molded by those who carry on the UFO community's tradition. Other "witnesses" were then sought out to expand the core narrative, with those who give accounts not in line with the core beliefs being repudiated or simply omitted by the "gatekeepers."&lt;ref name="Saler34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Saler|Ziegler|Moore|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saler|Ziegler|Moore|1997|pp=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others then retold the narrative in its new form. This whole process would repeat over time.

In September 2017, UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported on Kodachrome slides which some had claimed showed a dead space alien.&lt;ref name="Guardian 30 September 2017"&gt;{{cite news |last= Carpenter |first= Les | authorlink= |title= The curious case of the alien in the photo and the mystery that took years to solve|url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/30/alien-photo-roswell-new-mexico-mystery| date= 30 September 2017 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=2 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First presented at a BeWitness event in Mexico, organised by [[Jaime Maussan]] and attended by almost 7,000 people, days afterwards it was revealed that the slides were in fact of a mummified Native American child discovered in 1896 and which had been on display at the [[Mesa Verde National Park#Mug.2C Oak_Tree.2C Spruce Tree.2C and Square Tower houses| Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum]] in Mesa Verde, Colorado for many decades.&lt;ref name="Guardian 30 September 2017"/&gt;

=== Roswellian Syndrome ===
Prominent skeptics [[Joe Nickell]] and co-author James McGaha identified a myth-making process, which they called the "Roswellian Syndrome".&lt;ref name=syndrome&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nickell | first1=Joe | last2=McGaha | first2=James | date=May–June 2012 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_roswellian_syndrome_how_some_ufo_myths_develop | title=The Roswellian Syndrome: How Some UFO Myths Develop | journal=Skeptical Inquirer | publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | volume=36 | issue=3 | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this syndrome a myth is proposed to have five distinct stages of development: ''Incident'', ''Debunking'', ''Submergence'', ''Mythologizing'', and ''Reemergence and Media Bandwagon Effect''. The authors predicted that the Roswellian Syndrome would "play out again and again",&lt;ref name=syndrome /&gt; in other UFO and conspiracy-theory stories.

=== Recriminations among ufologists  ===
Glenn Dennis, who testified that Roswell alien autopsies were carried out at the Roswell base, and that he and others were the subjects of threats, was deemed one of the "least credible" Roswell witnesses by Randle in 1998. In Randle and Schmitt’s 1991 book ''UFO Crash at Roswell'', Dennis's story was featured prominently. Randle said Dennis was not credible "for changing the name of the nurse once we had proved she didn't exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}{{cite web | url=http://www.roswellfiles.com/storytellers/KevinRandleOnIRC.htm | title=Kevin Randle of the UK-UFO-NW #UFO Channel | publisher=Center for UFO Studies | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis's accounts were also doubted by researcher Pflock.&lt;ref name="kf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Klass|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skeptical movement|Scientific skeptic]] author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] concurs that Dennis cannot be regarded as a reliable witness, considering that he had seemingly waited over forty years before he started recounting a series of unconnected events. Such events, Dunnings argues, were then arbitrarily joined together to form what has become the most popular narrative of the alleged alien crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4079|number=79|title=Aliens in Roswell|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent UFOlogists including Karl T. Pflock,&lt;ref name="kf" /&gt; Kent Jeffrey,&lt;ref name=kf /&gt; and William L. Moore&lt;ref name=kf /&gt; have become convinced that there were no aliens or alien space craft involved in the Roswell crash.

=== Alien autopsy hoax ===
{{Main article|Alien autopsy}}
In 1995, film footage purporting to show an alien autopsy and claimed to have been taken by a US military official shortly after the Roswell incident was released by [[Ray Santilli]], a London-based video entrepreneur. The footage caused an international sensation when it aired on television networks around the world.&lt;ref name=saf&gt;{{Scientific American Frontiers |8 |2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Santilli admitted that the film was mostly a reconstruction, but continued to claim it was based on genuine footage now lost, and some original frames that had supposedly survived. A fictionalized version of the creation of the footage and its release was retold in the comedy film ''[[Alien Autopsy (film)|Alien Autopsy]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Osborn | first=Michael | date=April 5, 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4873284.stm | title=Ant and Dec Leap into the Unknown | newspaper=''[[BBC News]]'' | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522130808/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2136617,00.html | archivedate=May 22, 2008 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2136617,00.html | title=Max Headroom Creator Made Roswell Alien | newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] | date=April 16, 2006 | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photo analysis ===
[[File:Gen Ramey Roswell memo 1947.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Enlargement of Gen. Ramey's held message in the original photo.]]
In an attempt to produce fresh evidence, some researchers used new technology to try to re-analyze photographs of the telegram held by General Ramey during his 1947 press conference.&lt;ref name=Goldberg230noquote&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg writes that the results proved inconclusive: while some claimed they could discern wording like "victims of the wreck", others claimed they saw "turn out to be weather balloons". Overall, there was no consensus that anything was legible.&lt;ref name=Goldberg230noquote /&gt;

=== US political interest ===
On October 26, 2007, [[Bill Richardson]] (who at the time was a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for U.S. President) was asked about releasing government files on Roswell. Richardson responded that when he was a Congressman, he attempted to get information on behalf of his New Mexico constituents, but was told by both the Department of Defense and Los Alamos Labs that the information was classified. "That ticked me off," he said "The government doesn't tell the truth as much as it should on a lot of issues." He promised to work on opening the files if he were elected as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Slater | first=Wayne | date=October 27, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122111528/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/102707dntexrichardson.3164110.html | archivedate=January 22, 2009 | title=On Texas stop, Democratic Candidate Richardson Criticizes Government Secrecy | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/102707dntexrichardson.3164110.html | newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, before airing its Roswell documentary, the Sci-Fi Channel hosted a Washington UFO news conference. [[John Podesta]], President Clinton's chief of staff, appeared as a member of the public relations firm hired by Sci-Fi to help get the government to open up documents on the subject. Podesta stated, "It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the true nature of the phenomena."&lt;ref name="Stenger"&gt;{{cite news | last=Stenger | first=Richard | date=October 22, 2002 | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-10-22/tech/ufo.records_1_ufos-project-blue-book-foia?_s=PM:TECH | title=Clinton Aide Slams Pentagon's UFO Secrecy | newspaper=''[[CNN]]'' | accessdate=February 6, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115014607/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-10-22/tech/ufo.records_1_ufos-project-blue-book-foia?_s=PM:TECH | archivedate=November 15, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a 2015 interview with GQ Magazine about whether he'd looked up top secret classified information, President Barack Obama replied "I gotta tell you, it’s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that’s top secret isn’t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it’s not as top secret as you’d think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/president-obama-bill-simmons-interview-gq-men-of-the-year|title=Bill Simmons Interviews President Obama, GQ’s 2015 Man of the Year|first=Bill|last=Simmons|date=17 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deathbed confessions ===
As time wore on, it became harder for Roswell researchers to find new evidence to publish; there was potential though in the prospect of [[deathbed confession]]s from those originally involved in 1947.&lt;ref name=GoldBerg230&gt;{{Harvnb|Goldberg|2001|page=230}}: "The Roswell researchers were also pulling up stakes, for the evidence was well-worn and growing cold. There were few witnesses left to interview, although 'deathbed confessions' still offered hope."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Donald Schmitt and Tom Carey published the book ''Witness to Roswell'', which prominently featured a document said to be a sworn affidavit written by Walter Haut, who had written the first Army press release about the Roswell crash in 1947.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document, apparently kept under seal until Haut's death in 2005, described how the 1947 crash debris had been discussed by high-ranking staff and how Haut had seen alien bodies.&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/roswell-theory-revived-by-deathbed-confession/story-e6frfkp9-1111113858718 | title=Roswell Theory Revived by Deathbed Confession | newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] | date=July 1, 2007 | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims, however, drew an unimpressed response even from ufologists: Dennis Balthaser said that the document was not written by Haut, and that by 2000 Haut's mental state was such he could not recall basic details about his past, making the detail contained in the affidavit seem dubious.&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt; Physicist and skeptic [[Dave Thomas (physicist)|Dave Thomas]] commented: "Is Roswell still the 'best' UFO incident? If it is, UFO proponents should be very, very worried."&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt;

=== The "other Roswell" ===
{{Main article|Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident}}
[[File:FlyingSaucersMemorandumMarch22-1950.jpg|thumb|A 1950 FBI document relating a story about "so-called flying saucers" told to an agent by a third party.&lt;ref name="fbipressrelease"&gt;{{cite press release |title=UFOs and the Guy Hottel Memo |date=25 March 2013 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2013/march/ufos-and-the-guy-hottel-memo |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The 1948 Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident was a hoaxed flying saucer crash and subject of the book ''Behind the Flying Saucers'' (1950) by Frank Scully. The incident is sometimes referred to as the "other Roswell" and parallels have been drawn between the incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Malkin | first=Bonnie | date=April 11, 2011 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/8442464/Exploding-UFOs-and-alien-landings-in-secret-FBI-files.html | title={{-'}}Exploding UFOs and Alien Landings' in Secret FBI Files | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Area 51'' (2011) ===
American journalist [[Annie Jacobsen]]'s ''[[Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base]]'' (2011), based on interviews with scientists and engineers who worked in [[Area 51]], dismisses the alien story. She quotes one unnamed source as claiming that [[Josef Mengele]], a German [[Schutzstaffel]] officer and a physician in [[Auschwitz]], was recruited by the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] to produce "grotesque, child-size aviators" to be remotely piloted and landed in America in order to cause hysteria similar to [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1938). The aircraft, however, crashed and the incident was hushed up by the Americans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Jacobsen wrote that the bodies found at the crash site were children around 12 years old with large heads and abnormally-shaped, oversized eyes. They were neither aliens nor consenting airmen, but human guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Harding | first=Thomas | date=May 13, 2011 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/ufo/8512408/Roswell-was-Soviet-plot-to-create-US-panic.html | title=Roswell 'was Soviet plot to create US panic{{'-}} | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was criticized for extensive errors by scientists from the [[Federation of American Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Norris | first1=Robert | last2=Richelson | first2=Jeffrey | date=July 11, 2011 | url=http://www.washingtondecoded.com/site/2011/07/area51.html | title=Dreamland Fantasies | publisher=[[Washington Decoded]] | accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">'''Sahak II Bagratuni''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Սահակ Բ Բագրատունի), was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] nobleman from the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]]. He served as the [[marzban]] of [[Persian Armenia]] from 481 to 482.

==Biography==
Sahak II was the son of [[Tirots I Bagratuni]], an Armenian ''[[aspet]]''. When Tirots died in 451, Sahak II was given the aspet title. In 475, the [[Mamikonian]] princess [[Saint Shushanik|Shushanik]], was murdered by her husband Prince [[Varsken]], who was a convert to [[Zoroastrianism]], and was related to the Mihran family. The reason for this murder was because she had refused to convert to Zoroastrianism and wanted to stay [[Christianity|Christian]]. Varsken, because of his actions was in 482 executed by [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang I]], king of [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberia]]. The [[Sasanian]] [[shah]] [[Peroz I]] shortly sent an army to punish Vakhtang for intervening. However, Vakhtang was joined by the Armenians, and a revolt broke out in Armenia, led by [[Vahan I Mamikonian]] and Sahak II.

Vahan and Sahak managed to defeat the marzban [[Adhur Gushnasp]], and Sahak was shortly declared by Vahan and the other Armenians as the marzban of Armenia. However, in 482, Peroz sent an army under [[Shapur Mihran]], which defeated the Armenian rebels, killing Sahak. Vahan then fled to the mountains, while Shapur regained control of Armenia. Sahak hah a son named [[Spandiat]], who was given the title of aspet after his death.

A serious '''outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease''' occurred in [[South Korea]] in 2010–2011, leading to the [[culling]] of hundreds of thousands of pigs (as of January 2011) in an effort to contain it. The [[epidemic|outbreak]] began in November 2010 in pig farms in [[Andong]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], and has since spread in the country rapidly.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news | title = Foot-and-Mouth Disease Roils Korean Farms | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703791904576075341212752096 | publisher = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 2011-01-11 | first1=Evan | last1=Ramstad | first2=Jaeyeon | last2=Woo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost&gt;{{cite news | title = South Korea Reportedly Buries 1.4 Million Pigs Alive To Combat Foot And Mouth Disease | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/12/south-korea-buries-pigs-alive_n_808119.html?ir=Food | publisher = [[The Huffington Post]] | date = 2011-01-12 | first=Curtis | last=Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 cases of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] have been confirmed in the country so far,&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; and [[South Korea]]n officials have started a mass cull of approximately 12 percent of the entire [[domestic pig]] population and 107,000 of three million cattle of the country to halt the outbreak.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt;

As parts of the culling process, it was reported by some sections of the English-language media that the South Korean government had decided to bury approximately 1.4&amp;nbsp;million pigs alive, which drew complaints from animal activists.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt; The American animal rights organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] started online campaigns, arguing that the animals should be vaccinated rather than buried alive.&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost/&gt;

Joyce D'Silva, Director of Public Affairs for [[Compassion in World Farming]], said that they are "appalled", and argued that it is contrary to international guidelines on humane culling, which the South Korean government allegedly endorsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = South Korea Buries One Million Pigs Alive | url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/South-Korea-One-Million-Pigs-Buried-Alive-In-Foot-And-Mouth-Outbreak-Mass-Criticism/Article/201101115887024 | publisher = [[Sky News]] | date = 2011-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the local media had only reported that there had been incidents of swine being buried alive, and that a South Korean agriculture ministry official had confirmed some incidents, but that they had been few, explaining that "officials are rushed to stop the spread, and the number of people involved is too small for the operation,"&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; and that until a more humane way to cull the infected swine is found, the government will have to resort to burying the infected animals alive because the "government has temporarily run out of euthanasia drugs."&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news | title = S.

On 12 January 2011, local officials stated that more than US$1&amp;nbsp;billion worth of livestock have been lost so far to the disease, including government efforts to halt the spread.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; According to Kim Jae-hong, a veterinary science professor at [[Seoul National University]], the outbreak is "the most serious in Korea's history" and it is difficult to say when the spread of the disease will be stopped, and he said that "the most important thing right now is to control movement in and out of the farmhouses that are affected, and thoroughly disinfect the cars around the area".&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

South Korea's Citizens' Institute for Environmental Studies revealed 32 places that had dead livestocks buried around 4 drinking water facilities in [[Gyeonggi-do]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Gi-chang (기창) | last = Im (임) | script-title=ko:"생수공장 주변에 구제역 매몰지 조성" | date = 2011-05-07 | url = http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2011/05/07/0200000000AKR20110507024700004.HTML | work = Yonhap News | accessdate = 2011-12-06 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[ProMED-mail]] post described the [[epizootic]] and subsequent cancellations of festivities as being reminiscent of [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|Britain's February 19, 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak]], and even more so of [[2010 Japan foot-and-mouth outbreak|an outbreak in Japan beginning late March 2010]], which was caused by the same strain of the virus.  In that epizootic cattle herds were found to be 3.9-4.5 times more susceptible to the virus than pig herds, but pig herds had 5.0-13.6 times greater relative infectiousness; thus cattle on infected premises suffered a cumulative incidence of 8.5%, whereas 36.4% of pigs were infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promedmail.com/pls/apex/f?p=2400:1001:1188708772600889::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1010,86373|title=FOOT &amp; MOUTH DISEASE - SOUTH KOREA (23): SPREAD, VACCINATION

The '''Staatstheater Darmstadt''' (Darmstadt State Theatre) is a theatre company and building in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], Germany, presenting opera, ballet, plays and concerts. It is funded by the [[German states|state]] of [[Hesse]] and the city of [[Darmstadt]]. Its history began in 1711 with a court theatre building. From 1919 it was run as '''''Landestheater Darmstadt'''''. The present theatre was opened in 1972 when the company was named Staatstheater.

== History ==

The theatre dates back more than 300 years. It was originally a court theatre at the residence of the county [[Darmstadt]]. At a request by {{ill|Elisabeth Dorothea von Hessen-Darmstadt|de}} a first theatre building in Darmstadt was opened in 1711 with [[Christoph Graupner]]'s opera ''[[Telemach (opera)|Telemach]]''. About a century later, [[Louis I, Grand Duke of Hesse]], built a court theatre open to the citizens. The architect [[Georg Moller]] built a theatre with 2000 seats and advanced stage machinery, opened in 1819. It burnt down in 1871 and was restored in seven years.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In 1919 the theatre became a ''Landestheater''. The former building was made the small stage (''Kleines Haus''). Director [[Gustav Hartung]] (1920–1924 and 1931–1933) made the theatre famous for premieres of contemporary authors. He was forced to flee by the Nazis. Actress [[Lilli Palmer]], then 20 years old, emigrated to Paris. Both halls of the theatre were destroyed by bombs in the night 11 to 12 September 1944. After the war a provisional stage was found in the [[Orangerie, Darmstadt|Orangerie]] ([[:de:Orangerie (Darmstadt)|de]]), where the company played for almost three decades. It was known for plays during the times of directors [[Rudolf Sellner]] (1951–1961) and {{ill|Gerhard F. Hering|de}} (1961–1971).&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The play ''Männersache'' by [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]] premiered in 1972.&lt;ref name="Kroetz" /&gt; In 1966 [[Maciej Łukaszczyk]] arrived and worked as an [[Répétiteur]] at the Landestheater Darmstadt. In 1970 he founded the Chopin Organisation.

The present building was opened in 1972, when the theatre was named ''Staatstheater''.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The theatre is funded by the state of Hesse and the city of [[Darmstadt]]. The building was designed by the Darmstadt architect Rolf Prange who had won a national competition in 1963. The great hall (''Großes Haus'') seats 956 people, the small hall (''Kleines Haus''), mostly for plays and dance, 482. A chamber theatre (''Kammerspiele'') seats 120. The ''Großes Haus'' was opened on 6 October 1972 with Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]]'', the ''Kleines Haus'' a day later with [[Gaston Salvatore]]'s ''Büchners Tod''.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; [[Reinhard Febel]]'s opera ''Morels Erfindung'' premiered on 6 November 1994.&lt;ref name="Roelcke" /&gt; [[Jan Müller-Wieland]]'s chamber opera in one act ''Die Nachtigall und die Rose'' was first performed in 1996,&lt;ref name="FAZ" /&gt; ''Die Versicherung'' after a play by [[Peter Weiss]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Versicherung" /&gt;

From 2002 to 2006 the building was restored, with new technical and safety features.&lt;ref name="Baunetzwissen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumanagement" /&gt; It was reopened with [[Leoš Janáček]]'s ''Schicksal'' and ''[[Lélio|Lélio oder die Rückkehr ins Leben]]'' by Hector Berlioz on 22 September 2006, and a day later Schiller's ''[[Don Karlos]]''.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

[[John Dew (director)|John Dew]] has been director of the theatre from 2004.

'''''State of Revolution''''' is a play by [[Robert Bolt]], written in 1977. It deals with the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], the rise to power of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the struggles of his chief lieutenants – namely [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] – to gain power under Lenin in the chaos of the Revolution.

The play was first staged in the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Repertory Theatre]] in Birmingham, on 3 May 1977 and later moved to the [[Royal National Theatre|Lyttelton Theatre]] in London.

Despite the painstaking work put into the show by Bolt (he spent almost three years researching the Revolution and then editing the script), ''State of Revolution'' was at best a modest success. He was particularly criticised for having a play which, many felt, lacked Bolt's usual humour and a clear point (see ''Times'' review below). Others criticised the play for depicting the Russian characters in too much of an Anglicized manner. The play received its share of positive reviews as well, but was ultimately not a box-office success. It would prove to be Bolt's last stage production, though he would write several more film scripts.

Bolt himself was never satisfied with the play, feeling that he had failed to create strong and sympathetic lead characters. In the late 1970s (according to Bolt's biographer, [[Adrian Turner]]), [[Charlton Heston]] attempted to produce a film version, but Bolt himself talked Heston out of it.

== Play synopsis ==

'''Act I'''

The play is framed by an address being given by [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] to a group of Young Communists at an unspecified date in the future, on the anniversary of Lenin's death. Lunacharsky gives a speech which solidly toes the Communist Party line about the Revolution and its leaders, [[Joseph Stalin]], Lenin, and Trotsky.

The narrative begins in [[Capri]] in 1910 at a meeting of several exiled Communist leaders – including Lenin, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], [[Alexey Gorky]], and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]. Lunacharsky's speech dissolves into a speech being given at this meeting, being proposed as a Communist thesis; all present support it except Lenin, who dismisses it as "shit". Lenin thinks his beliefs in supporting "[[Humanism|the human ethic]]" is ridiculous and "merits abuse", and dismisses the majority opinion against him: "It's not a school for revolutionary activists you're getting ready here – it's a school in parliamentary procedure."  Lenin continues to draw conflict with his peers and is depicted as being driven purely by ideology rather than any idealism.

The play cuts ahead to 1917, when Russia's struggles in [[World War I]] lead to the [[February Revolution|collapse]] of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar]]'s government. The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] wants to continue the war, but the radical Bolsheviks urge an end to the war at all costs while others in the Party – including Stalin – urge continuation of the fighting on the grounds that Russia's defeat will lead to the re-establishment of the Czar. When Lenin arrives in [[Finland Station]], he is initially greeted warmly – until he calls for the establishment of a socialist regime and an end to the war – even if it means a German victory. Later on, the situation comes to a head as the Russian army finally collapses, and Lenin recruits Zhelnik – commander of the [[Kronstadt]] Sailors' Soviet – in his plan to capture [[Petrograd]] for the Bolsheviks.

Lenin instantly sets about organising his government, placing Trotsky, Stalin, Kollontai, and Lunacharsky in high-ranking positions. The government leaders proclaim a new system of freedoms and reforms, much to the delight of the Russian people. Trotsky is, however, forced to negotiate a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace treaty]] with the Germans and is unable to bargain on his own terms – apparently under the delusion that the German soldiers will desert and join the Revolution. The first signs of tension appear when Stalin refers to Trotsky – who volunteers to organise the [[Red Army]] – as "our [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]]", greatly insulting Trotsky for [[Bonapartism|this suggestion of counter-revolutionary disloyalty]]. At this time, Dzerzhinsky is appointed head of the [[Cheka]], the Soviet secret police. At the end of the act, in a private conversation, Lenin tells Stalin that he is "the most useful Comrade on the whole Committee."

'''Act II'''

Act II begins as Zhelnik angrily meets with Lenin, his wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], and Kollontai, reporting an incident where he and his men were ordered to massacre a group of peasants who would not turn over their stores of grain. Lenin argues the measure was justified because peasants are likely to be counter-revolutionaries, and Zhelnik's protests – "We're all – ''peasants''!" – fall on deaf ears.
Shortly thereafter, Lenin meets with [[Fanya Kaplan]], a member of the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Peasant Revolutionary Party]], who protests the exclusion of all non-Bolshevik parties from the Soviets. At the end of the conversation, Kaplan produces a pistol and shoots Lenin, regretting only that she failed in her attempt.

The assassination coincides with the outbreak of full-scale [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention]] of foreign powers, leading Dzerzhinsky to institute the [[Red Terror]] against all Russians suspected of being counter-revolutionary. At this time, Lunacharasky protests to Dzerzhinsky the extravagant production demands of the government – in turn, she is warned by him against protesting.

Zhelnik and the other Kronstadt sailors organise a [[Kronstadt Rebellion|revolt]] against the Soviet government. Trotsky and Kollontai meet with the sailors and refuse to give in to their demands; Trotsky resorts to violent force to put down the rebellion. Shortly after, Trotsky comes into conflict with Lenin and Stalin for proposing a limited market economy – which Stalin twists into being counter-revolution. At this point, Stalin proposes that the Party must be expunged of its less loyal members, and advocates a purge – which is supported by Lenin. The accusations against Trotsky grow, until even Lenin is almost convinced of his possible treachery. Gorky confronts Lenin over his treatment of Trotsky. Gorky angrily protests the imprisonment of provably innocent individuals by the Cheka, and Lenin accuses him too of being a traitor. Lenin then has a stroke, leaving him incapicitated and Stalin and Trotsky to fill in the void.

Stalin and Dzerzhinsky meet with Victor Mdvani, leader of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] Communist Party, and interrogate him over disloyal statements made in a private letter and his alleged refusal to support Lenin's policies of collectivisation and unification in his republic. At the end of this meeting, a Cheka officer – Pratkov – is identified as Captain Draganov, a high-ranking member of the Czar's secret police, and Stalin orders him executed.

A crippled but still strong-willed Lenin speaks with his wife, expressing his dislike and distrust of Stalin. He plans to have Trotsky give a speech denouncing Stalin, but Trotsky is ill and Stalin ends up giving the same speech about Trotsky. Lenin dies shortly thereafter.

After Lenin's death, his colleagues organise a vote, hoping to have Trotsky appointed as Lenin's successor. Despite his distaste for Stalin, Trotsky refuses to brand him a counter-revolutionary, and Stalin wins the vote. The play ends with Lunacharsky's speech – discussing Trotsky's fall from grace and saying that the Revolution should not be remembered as a "pageant of Great Men", but rather as an inevitable event which was served by Lenin, Stalin, and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12618">The '''Sunset Junction Street Fair''' was an event held annually in the [[Sunset Junction, Los Angeles, California|Sunset Junction]] neighborhood of the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] community in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Occurring annually in late August, the two-day neighborhood festival was first held in 1980, as a way to quell tensions between the neighborhood's long-time [[Latino]] residents and the newer [[gay]] residents, who some felt were causing the neighborhood to become [[Gentrification|gentrified]]. (''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]'', 2002-12-09)

The festival, put on by the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance, closed off a large portion of Sunset Boulevard and features live music, rides, food and merchandise vendors. Over the years, many noted musicians and musical acts performed, including [[Beck]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Redd Kross]], [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], [[Eels (band)|Eels]], [[Chaka Khan]], the Ladies of [[The Supremes]], and [[Kent James|Nick Name and the Normals]] among others.

==2011 festival closure==

In 2011, the fair was scheduled to take place on August 27 and 28. After booking the talent the promoters failed to secure permits for the fair and it was canceled.  In dispute was $260,000 owed to the city for unpaid fees for the previous couple of years.  In a last minute ditch effort, the promoters of Sunset Junction were able to secure a $142,000 backing from [[Live Nation]] to at least cover this year’s bills, which would have gone towards cost of police protection, parking enforcement and other city services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sunset-junction-festival-cancelation-organizers-227320 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Rebecca | last=Ford | title=Sunset Junction Festival Cancelation: Organizers Speak Out | date=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $142,000 did not include any part of the $260,000 that is due for previous years. Despite this, the permits were still denied by members of the Board of Public Works.

In the previous year, the city issued a permit for the event even though the estimated fees for police, sanitation and traffic crews were not paid in advance. Following the festival, the city sent organizers three invoices for $256,484. The unpaid bill was eventually forwarded to the Office of Finance, which turned it over to a collection agency, and ultimately the matter was referred to the city attorney’s office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/24/sunset-junction-festival-cancelled_n_935715.html |title=Sunset Junction Festival Canceled: Public Work Permits Denied |work=Huffington Post |date=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Los Angeles Times'',{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} “It was the most aggressive stand yet in the city's effort to get tough on the people and organizations who owe money to cash-strapped City Hall.”

One of the reasons for the denial of the permits was that the festival's original reason for charging admission was that the proceeds would be reinvested in the community. However, several community advocates claimed that said proceeds were, in fact, not being reinvested, and that the committee handling the festival were unwilling to submit themselves to public scrutiny of their finances.

To date, neither the vendors nor ticketholders have been reimbursed. The fair's official ticket vendor, Flavorus, has suggested that ticketholders contact their credit card providers to dispute the ticket purchases, and that they themselves are unable to provide refunds as they have not been paid either.

It was the first time in the street fair's thirty-year history that it had been cancelled.

In February 2012, the Sunset Junction Neighborhood Alliance filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] [[bankruptcy]], citing $900,000 in debts and only $500 in assets. Alliance president Michael McKinley is also listed among the creditors owed money. According to the official filing, he claims that he is owed $25,000. The City of Los Angeles is listed as the most prominent creditor, at $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/earshot/sunset-junction-bankrupt-hanson-butch-walker-294641 |title=Hanson Booked for $20K, Butch Walker for $3K; Sunset Junction Bankruptcy Reveals Artist Fees |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==

===June 1942===
[[File:Ellie Kendrick.jpg|right|thumb|English actress Ellie Kendrick portrayed Anne Frank.]]
The series begins in June 1942, in wartime and [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)|Nazi occupied Amsterdam]]. [[Anne Frank|Annelies Marie Frank]], a teenage Jewish girl, is celebrating her 13th birthday - amongst her birthday presents, she is given a [[The Diary of a Young Girl|red diary]]. Days later, call up papers arrive for her 16-year-old sister [[Margot Frank|Margot]] and her parents, [[Otto Frank|Otto]] and [[Edith Frank|Edith]], decide to hasten their plan to go into hiding to ensure that the family does not get separated.

The next morning, 6 July 1942, the Franks head to Otto's [[Opekta|pectin and spice company]]. They proceed up to a [[Anne Frank House|Secret Annex]] at the back of the building. Only the trustworthy office staff, such as [[Miep Gies]], know of their existence and have agreed to help them survive.  In the annex they must obey strict rules, remaining completely silent during working hours. Otto and Edith sleep in one room, with Margot and Anne next door in another. At the very top of the building is a disused attic for storing food.  This soon becomes Anne's getaway, as she is able to gaze outside at a [[Anne Frank tree|chestnut tree]] and the tower of the [[Westerkerk]].

At first, Edith and Margot find the confinement hard to bear, while Otto and Anne sew material together to make black-out curtains.  They are soon joined by their Jewish friends Mr and Mrs van Daan and their teenage son Peter. Their arrival liven things up, but also brings tension, especially since Peter brought his pet cat. She continues writing her diary.

===October 1942===
It is now October 1942. In the secret annex, the ''[[Anne Frank House|achterhuis]]'', the toilet is blocked and her father, Otto, is forced to try and unblock by hand. Their helpers in the offices downstairs call a plumber, and the family are terrified that he will need to come up to the annex.

Anne finds Mrs. van Daan increasingly hard to bear, as she orders her around and criticises her in a way that her liberal parents never do. But overall they are getting used to their time together, and the strict routine by which they must live. Otto begins to oversee their school studies so that they won't be behind after the war. During an air raid, Anne is so scared that she runs to her father for comfort.

One day Anne invites Miep and her husband Jan to dinner and to stay overnight in her room. When they agree, Anne draws up a special menu in their honour, which Mrs van Daan cooks for them.  But Miep brings bad news, which she tells only the Franks, that the van Daans' apartment has been ransacked and all their property confiscated.  Also another person arrives to stay at the annex, a dentist called Mr Dussel, who will sleep in Margot's bed.

===November 1942===
It is now November 1942. The routine in the rear annex is now well established - as are the squabbles. Otto is shocked to discover that the building has had to be sold. They fear that the new owner will demand access to the annex and they will be discovered. The lease won't be exchanged for months yet, so for now the threat is over.

When Miep arrives she tells them their helpful grocer has gone missing. Miep also gives Mr Dussel the latest letter and food parcel from his fiancé - this annoys Anne as she thinks he is putting them at greater risk. Her parents agree but do not want to intervene.  That evening Anne helps to wash her mother's hair and for once they are close. Soon it is Hanukkah and everyone in the annex gathers for the ceremony around the dinner table.

Food shortages are getting worse and [[Bep Voskuijl]] from the office now comes up to the annex for lunch every day. Anne asks Mr Dussel to let her use their shared bedroom for the agreed time but he isn't ready to give up the desk and they row. Otto talks to Dussel and persuades him how important writing is to Anne.  Mr Dussel also begins to learn Spanish for his life post-war.

===June 1943===
It is June 1943 and Anne is dreaming about her fourteenth birthday party. Suddenly she wakes up and remembers she is in the annex. Her family give her whatever they can, but the only present that really excites her is a bar of chocolate.

Also, the families are wearing out their clothes and don't have the money to replace them. In fact, the van Daans have little money left and argue about whether they should sell Mrs van Daan's fur coat.  Otto measures Anne and Margot against the wall and finds that Anne has grown three inches in the last year. They learn on BBC radio of the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|capitulation of Italy]] (September 1943).

Anne is growing into a young woman and is amazed by the changes happening to her body and emotions. Her periods have started and she is becoming aware of her feminine sexuality. She has even started to look differently at Peter. When Peter comes up to the attic she tells him that she sees him differently now and apologises for having teased him in the past. He invites her to accompany him down to the warehouse to collect the potatoes.  However, one day on his potato run, Peter forgets to unlock the front doors, forcing the employees to break in.  Later, in response to her feelings, Anne writes her parents a hurtful letter.

===May 1944===
It is May 1944 and the Franks are woken up by the sound of intruders downstairs. When the noises seem to stop, Otto and Peter go downstairs to lock the front door so as not to attract the police, but they discover that the burglars are still there and flee back to the annex. The next morning [[Victor Kugler|Mr Kugler]] informs them that the burglars took a lot of valuables and that they must be more careful.

The tension and the summer heat start to get to them and they continually snap at each other. Food shortages are getting worse and the authorities have confiscated all radios. Luckily, [[Johannes Kleiman|Mr Kleiman]] secretly gives them a replacement. As the bombing raids get worse, Anne takes to running up and down the annex stairs to block out the sound. But they try to keep their spirits up and are thrilled when Miep finds some butter to bake a small cake for Edith's birthday.

Finally, their worst nightmare comes true when the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] and Dutch plain-clothed police raid the warehouse (4 August 1944).  As all of the Jews are being led away one by one end title reveal each of their fates. In the final scene, Miep finds Anne's notebooks scattered across the floor and reaches down to pick them up.

==Reception==
One reviewer, Michael Fox of jweekly.com, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/57606/bbcs-anne-frank-vividly-depicts-determined-dreamy-teen/ Retrieved 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

: Sixty-five years on, and despite her legendary stature, Anne Frank still comes across as a willful, normal teenager with unrealistic — and tragically unrealized — dreams of her future. She attaches supreme importance to her own whims and needs, demands immediate satisfaction and musters barely an iota of tolerance for what she perceives as the stunted, compromised world of adults.

:As it unfolds, however, the British television adaptation of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' increasingly and irresistibly frames its subject’s willfulness as a determination to establish an identity, and a place of significance, in the soon-to-come postwar world... It is the pitiless snuffing of this potential — the dream destroyed when the Gestapo breached her family’s Amsterdam refuge in 1944 after two long years in hiding — that is, and has always been, the piercing tragedy of Anne Frank’s life.

:Solidly engrossing and vigorously paced, ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' takes place almost entirely (after the first five minutes) in the secret annex above Otto Frank’s warehouse and office. It confines itself to the events recorded by our unintentional heroine — which is to say that younger viewers unfamiliar with the Nazis’ systematic, continent-spanning implementation of the Final Solution aren’t provided with a great deal of detail.

:Anne Frank has long been an icon to Jews and a symbol of the Holocaust to non-Jews, but I suspect mainstream audiences will view this version a bit differently. In the current era, when children die in every corner of the world and "ethnic cleansing" has become part of our vocabulary, Anne’s story provokes associations with racism, persecution and lost promise that go beyond Nazis and Jews.

:This production also has a more contemporary feel thanks to a shockingly candid scene where Anne acknowledges the changes in her body and admits her confusion over puberty. This was one of the passages regarding Anne’s sexuality that Otto Frank removed before the diary’s original publication in 1947, and which were restored in an edition published well after his 1980 death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4063">'''The Prohibited and Unlawful Societies and Associations Act''', also known as '''The Dread Act''', was a 1974 [[Dominica]] law that was designed to combat [[Rastafari|Rastafariansim]].  

==Origins==
Rastafariansm was brought to Dominica in the early 1970s by students returning from studying abroad in the United States and [[Trinidad]]. The Rasta ideology spread through the ranks of educated young men and then down into the lower classes. Government officials became alarmed by the movement's anti-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] stance, use of [[marijuana]] and acceptance of [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=wessinger/&gt;  

==Provisions==
According to the law, adherents of Rastafarianism wearing their hair in [[dreadlocks]] (referred to as "Dreads") were subject to arrest without a warrant, were not permitted bail and could be held without charges for at least 48 hours. The law also prohibited the prosecution of any individual who killed or injured a "Dread" inside a place of residence.&lt;ref name=wessinger&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wessinger |editor1-first=Catherine |title=Millennialism, Persecution, and Violence: Historical Cases |date=2000 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Legislative history==
Prime Minister [[Patrick John]] and the [[Dominica Labour Party]] spearheaded the effort to pass the bill in the [[House of Assembly of Dominica]]. The bill was passed unopposed by members of the [[Dominica Freedom Party]].

==Impact==
As a result of the act, Dominica residents and law enforcement were granted immunity from prosecution for assaulting or murdering Rastafarians. During the years the act was in effect, Rastafarians were arrested, beaten and killed. Some sources also report that adherents had their dreadlocks forcibly cut off during this time,&lt;ref name=wessinger/&gt; while others cut their own hair and left the movement to avoid persecution.&lt;ref name=chanting/&gt; Many Rastafarians fled into the rainforest to escape the effects of the Dread Act. 

In 1975, the government announced an amnesty for "Dreads" living in the forests. However, these groups did not trust the government and refused to accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Frank Jan van Dijk |title=Jahmaica: Rastafari and Jamaican Society, 1930-1990 |date=1993 |publisher=Utrecht University |isbn=9051871643 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government then established an eight-person task force to decide on the matter. The committee, led by Reverend A. Didier, concluded that the majority of Dominica's "Dread" population was made up of peaceful activists and that the Dread Act should be annulled and replaced by a new law designed to combat terrorism. However, the government rejected the committee's findings.&lt;ref name=chanting&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nathaniel Samuel Murrell |author2=William David Spencer |author3=, Adrian Anthony McFarlane |title=Chanting Down Babylon: The Rastafari Reader |date=1998 |publisher=Temple University Press |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
==Repeal==
[[Eugenia Charles]] voiced opposition to the bill shortly after it was passed, but took no steps to repeal it during her tenure as a House representative.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite book |author1=Eudine Barriteau |author2=Alan Gregor Cobley |title=Enjoying Power: Eugenia Charles and Political Leadership in the Commonwealth Caribbean |date=2006 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |isbn=9766401918|page=54–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Charles became prime minister in 1980, she initially decided not to repeal the act. However, after "Dreads" living in the woods kidnapped a prominent citizen, the government decided to revamp the strict parameters of the Dread Act.&lt;ref name=chanting/&gt;      

On February 16, 1981, the House of Assembly passed the Prevention of Terrorism Temporary Provisions Act, finally acting on the recommendation of the Didier Committee. Section 18 of the new legislation repealed the Dread Act.&lt;ref name=power/&gt;

'''Thomas Frederick Dalton-Morgan''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|DSO|OBE|DFC1}} (23 March 1917 – 18 September 2004) was a fighter pilot and [[flying ace]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Battle of Britain – Roll of Honour| url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/BattleofBritainRollofHonour.cfm| publisher=RAF| accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew during the [[Battle of Britain]], and is counted amongst the ranks of '[[The Few]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Obituary: Group Captain Tom Dalton-Morgan| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472458/Group-Captain-Tom-Dalton-Morgan.html| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=28 August 2013| date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dalton-Morgan was born in [[Cardiff]], Wales, on 23 March 1917 and attended [[Taunton School]].

==RAF career==
On 21 October 1935, he accepted a short service commission with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in the rank of [[acting pilot officer]] (on probation), and trained as a pilot,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34219|page=7168|date=12 November 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; being confirmed as a [[pilot officer]] on 26 August 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34329|page=6367|date=6 October 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flying officer]] on 26 April 1938 and was later sent to join [[No. 22 Squadron RAF]], flying the Vickers Vildebeest torpedo bomber.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34505|page=2712|date=26 April 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later seconded to war at the [[Air Ministry]] in London.

In April 1940 Dalton-Morgan applied to return to flying, and was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] on 26 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34849|page=2895|date=14 May 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then appointed to [[No. 43 Squadron RAF]] ("The Fighting Cocks") as a flight commander in June 1940. With minimal fighter experience as a fighter pilot he flew [[Hawker Hurricane]]s from [[RAF Tangmere]] (part of [[No. 11 Group RAF]]).

===Battle of Britain===
Dalton-Morgan's first 'kill' came on 12 July 1940 when he shared in the downing of a [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber.

On 13 August 1940, the ''Luftwaffe'' began [[Adlertag|Operation Eagle Attack]], which the ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' (''OKL'') began a major effort to destroy [[RAF Fighter Command]] in southern England. At 06:25, Dalton-Morgan was scrambled with 43 Squadron to support [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|64]], [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87]] and [[No. 601 Squadron RAF|601]] Squadrons. The RAF formations intercepted 20 [[Junkers Ju 88]]s from I. and 18 Ju 88s from II./[[Kampfgeschwader 54|''Kampfgeschwader'' 54]]. They were escorted by V.(Z)./[[Lehrgeschwader 1|''Lehrgeschwader'' 1]]. The German objective was to attack [[RAF Odiham]] and [[RAF Farnborough]]. No. 43 Squadron intercepted the Germans between [[Guildford]] and [[Brighton]]. Dalton-Morgan attacked a Ju 88 from the ''stab'' ''staffel'', perhaps piloted by ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' Kurt Erdmann. He damaged the rudder and engine but was struck by return fire or became the victim of one of the escorting fighters; possibly ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Walter Gerigk. Both the Ju 88 and Hurricane crashed and the German crew were captured by a local policeman. Dalton-Morgan had taken off without properly changing because of the rapid scramble, and he had difficulty and convincing the local constabulary he was not a member of the German crew.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2015, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly returning to his squadron, Dalton-Morgan was soon flying combat sorties and shot down four more enemy aircraft over the next three weeks. In early September 1940 he added three [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s fighters to his tally. On 6 September he again came worse off in combat with Bf 109s and he was wounded in the face and knee and was forced to crash land his Hurricane.

[[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) was gazetted on 6 September 1940:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalton-Morgan, Thomas Frederick|url=http://en.ww2awards.com/person/43810|publisher=World War Two Awards|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|This officer has shown great resolution as a fighter pilot and has led his flight, and at times his squadron, with conspicuous success. He has displayed great courage and determination in the face of heavy enemy odds, and has destroyed seven enemy aircraft. His behaviour in action has been an inspiration to the pilots in his flight.}}

Once more returning to No. 43 Squadron on 7 September, Dalton-Morgan now took over command and relocated the squadron to [[Northumberland]] to refit with new fighters and to train replacement pilots.

===Pilot trainer===
Following the end of the Battle of Britain in October 1940, Dalton-Morgan concentrated on passing on his experience to new pilots. He also worked on developing the Hurricane fighter into a night-fighter with great success. He soon accounted for six further 'kills' flying his Hurricane at night. One of his most successful periods was over the nights of the 6 and 7 May 1941 when he shot down three Luftwaffe bombers over [[Glasgow]]. He was promoted to temporary [[squadron leader]] on 1 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35187|page=3323|date=10 June 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June he shot down a Junkers Ju 88 and two further 'kills' followed. On 24 July he intercepted another Ju 88 off [[May Island]]. Despite his engine starting to fail he pressed home his attack and downed the enemy bomber. His engine then completely quit and he was forced to land on the water, a highly dangerous exercise. He was later picked up by the Royal Navy.

For this attack he received a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DFC on 31 May 1941:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalton-Morgan, Thomas Frederick|url=http://en.ww2awards.com/person/43810|publisher=World War Two Awards|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|This officer has displayed exceptional skill both as a squadron commander and an individual fighter. During two consecutive nights in May 1941, he destroyed three enemy aircraft bringing his total victories to 13. Squadron Leader Morgan has contributed in a large measure to the high standard of operational efficiency of the squadron}}

On 2 October 1941 he shot down another bomber, off [[Berwick-on-Tweed]]. Finally, in February 1942, Dalton-Morgan was rested with a tally of at least 14 aircraft shot down and several damaged.

===Distinguished Service Order===
After a short period working as a fighter controller at [[RAF Turnhouse]], near [[Edinburgh]], he was promoted to temporary [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] on 1 June 1942, and promoted to squadron leader (war-substantive) on 26 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35618|page=2925|date=3 July 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35736|page=4384|date=6 October 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to operations in late 1942 to become leader of the [[Ibsley Wing]]. Commanding eight fighter squadrons, Dalton-Morgan organised long-range offensive sorties and bomber escort duties over northern France. He damaged an Bf 109 in December 1943, and then shot down a [[Focke Wulf 190]] fighter and damaged another during a sweep over the French port of [[Brest, France|Brest]]. He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] on 25 May 1943:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalton-Morgan, Thomas Frederick|url=http://en.ww2awards.com/person/43810|publisher=World War Two Awards|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Since being awarded a bar to the D.F.C. in May, 1941, this officer has destroyed four enemy aircraft, bringing his total victories to 17 aircraft destroyed.}}

===4th Fighter Group===
Dalton-Morgan's bomber escort experience saw him attached to the [[4th Fighter Group]] of the US [[8th Air Force]] and flew over 70 combat sorties with the group. Promoted to wing commander (war-substantive) on 12 December 1943, he served as operations officer with the [[2nd Tactical Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36588|supp=y|page=3083|date=27 June 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the buildup to the [[Normandy Landings]] he was part of the planning team organising the roster of ground targets. Shortly before the end of the war, he learned his brother John had been killed after being shot down in a [[de Havilland Mosquito]].

==Post war==
After the war he remained in Germany with 2nd Tactical Air Force. He was promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader on 1 September 1945 and attended the [[RAF Staff College, Bulstrode Park|RAF staff College]], becoming a senior instructor at the School of Land/Air Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37511|supp=y|page=1532|date=22 March 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to wing commander on 1 July 1947, he commanded the [[Vickers Vampire]] equipped Gutersloh Wing before taking command of [[RAF Wunstorf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38020|supp=y|page=3419|date=18 July 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from the RAF on 4 April 1952 with the rank of wing commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=39718|supp=y|page=6609|date=12 December 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving the RAF, Dalton-Morgan joined the joint UK/Australian [[Woomera Test Range|weapons testings facility]], at [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]], which he managed for the next 30 years before retiring in Australia.

In January 1945 he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] and [[mentioned in despatches]] in 1946, the same year he also received the US [[Bronze Star Medal]].

He was exposed as committing [[bigamy]] ten days after receiving promotion as group captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PTe1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=tom+dalton+morgan+bigamist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dILwzs4-Er&amp;sig=DnBGeCb9AcOlIeWGwulysd5DKp0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipg8K7-YPQAhULCsAKHQXpAnkQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=tom%20dalton%20morgan%20bigamist&amp;f=false|title=Coming in to Land: The Memoirs of Wing Commander Bill Malins DFC|last=Malins|first=Bill|date=11 May 2014|publisher=Memoirs Publishing|isbn=9780956510235|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}

[[File:Blank Fork.png|thumb|Situations often arise wherein a decision must be made when the results of each possible choice are uncertain.]]
'''Uncertainty''' is a situation which involves imperfect or unknown [[information]]. It applies to predictions of future events, to physical measurements that are already made, or to the unknown. Uncertainty arises in [[partially observable]] and/or [[stochastic]] environments, as well as due to [[ignorance]], [[Laziness|indolence]], or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Peter Norvig]] |author2=[[Sebastian Thrun]] |work=[[Udacity]] |url=https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs271/unit1_notes |title=Introduction to Artificial Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arises in any number of fields, including [[insurance]], [[philosophy]], [[physics]], [[statistics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[engineering]], [[metrology]], [[meteorology]], [[ecology]] and [[information science]].

Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public, many specialists in [[decision theory]], [[statistics]] and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty, risk, and their measurement as:
;Uncertainty: The lack of [[certainty]], a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
;Measurement of uncertainty: A set of possible states or outcomes where [[probabilities]] are assigned to each possible state or outcome – this also includes the application of a [[probability density function]] to continuous variables.&lt;ref&gt; Kabir, H.

;Knightian uncertainty: In economics, in 1921 [[Frank Knight]] distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate; this is now referred to as [[Knightian uncertainty]]:
{{quote|Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk, from which it has never been properly separated.... The essential fact is that 'risk' means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character; and there are far-reaching and crucial differences in the bearings of the phenomena depending on which of the two is really present and operating.... It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or 'risk' proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all.|author=[[Frank Knight]] (1885–1972)|source=''Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit'' (1921), [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight |first=F. H. |year=1921 |title=Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit |location=Boston |publisher=Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cquote|You cannot be certain about uncertainty.|author=Frank Knight}}

Other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective:&lt;ref name="embo1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannert C, Elvers HD, Jandrig B |title=The ethics of uncertainty.

For example, if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow, then there is a state of uncertainty. If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a [[calibrated probability assessment]], the uncertainty has been quantified. Suppose it is quantified as a 90% chance of sunshine. If there is a major, costly, outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10% chance of rain, and rain would be undesirable. Furthermore, if this is a business event and $100,000 would be lost if it rains, then the risk has been quantified (a 10% chance of losing $100,000). These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs. heavy rain, the cost of delays vs. outright cancellation, etc.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some may represent the risk in this example as the "expected opportunity loss" (EOL) or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss (10% × $100,000 = $10,000). That is useful if the organizer of the event is "risk neutral", which most people are not. Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss. An insurance company, for example, would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage, then add onto that other operating costs and profit. Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons, then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk.

Quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent from fields such as [[probability theory]], [[actuarial science]], and [[information theory]]. Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk. For example, [[surprisal]] is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in [[information theory]]. But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term, usage may vary widely. In [[cognitive psychology]], uncertainty can be real, or just a matter of perception, such as [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectations]], threats, etc.

[[Vagueness]] is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes, such as 'person of average height.' and 'tall person'. This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on [[Lotfi A. Zadeh|Zadeh]]'s [[fuzzy logic]] or [[subjective logic]]. 

[[Ambiguity]] is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations. The statement &lt;i&gt;"He returns from the bank"&lt;/i&gt; is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word 'bank' is meant as &lt;i&gt;"the side of a river"&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;"a financial institution"&lt;/i&gt;. Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Uncertainty may be a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts. That is, there may be uncertainty about whether a new rocket design will work, but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation. 

At the subatomic level, uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe. In [[quantum mechanics]], the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle. This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found. There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are "hidden variables" that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenberg's uncertainty principle allows.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Measurements== &lt;!-- Heavily linked section: Standard uncertainty, Concise notation --&gt;
{{Main article|Measurement uncertainty}}
{{See also|Uncertainty quantification|Uncertainty propagation}}

The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement" (GUM) published by [[ISO]]. A derived work is for example the [[National Institute for Standards and Technology]] (NIST) Technical Note 1297, "Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results", and the Eurachem/Citac publication "Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement". The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components. The components are regarded as [[random variables]], and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values:
* Type A, those evaluated by [[statistical]] methods
* Type B, those evaluated by other means, e.g., by assigning a [[probability distribution]]
By propagating the [[variance]]s of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result, the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance. The simplest form is the [[standard deviation]] of a repeated observation.

In [[metereology]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], the uncertainty or [[margin of error]] of a measurement, when explicitly stated, is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value. This may be denoted by [[error bar]]s on a graph, or by the following notations:{{cn|date=November 2017}}
* ''measured value'' ± ''uncertainty''
* ''measured value'' {{su|p=+uncertainty|b=−uncertainty}}
* ''measured value'' (''uncertainty'')

{{Anchor|Shortest help for uncertainty notation}} 
In the last notation, parentheses are the concise notation for the ± notation. For example, applying 10 {{frac|1|2}} meters in a scientific or engineering application, it could be written {{val|10.5|u=m}} or {{val|10.50|u=m}}, by convention meaning accurate to ''within'' one tenth of a meter, or one hundredth. The precision is symmetric around the last digit. In this case it's half a tenth up and half a tenth down, so 10.5 means between 10.45 and 10.55. Thus it is ''understood'' that 10.5 means {{val|10.5|.05}}, and 10.50 means {{val|10.50|.005}}, also written {{val|10.50|(5)}} and {{val|10.500|(5)}} respectively.  But if the accuracy is within two tenths, the uncertainty is ± one tenth, and it is ''required'' to be explicit: {{val|10.5|.1}} and {{val|10.50|.01}} or {{val|10.5|(1)}} and {{val|10.50|(1)}}.   The numbers in parentheses ''apply'' to the numeral left of themselves, and are not part of that number, but part of a notation of uncertainty. They apply to the [[significant figure|least significant digits]]. For instance, {{val|1.00794|(7)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00007}}, while {{val|1.00794|(72)}} stands for {{val|1.00794|0.00072}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty|work=[[CODATA]] reference|publisher=[[NIST]]|accessdate=26 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016021440/http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html|archivedate=16 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concise notation is used for example by [[IUPAC]] in stating the [[list of elements by atomic mass|atomic mass]] of [[chemical element|elements]].

The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value – for example {{val|3.4|+0.3|-0.2}}. This can occur when using a logarithmic scale, for example.

Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation. However, if the values are averaged, then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty, equal to the [[standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements. This procedure neglects [[systematic error]]s, however.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement, then about 68.3% of the time, the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range. For example, it is likely that for 31.7% of the atomic mass values given on the [[list of elements by atomic mass]], the true value lies outside of the stated range. If the width of the interval is doubled, then probably only 4.6% of the true values lie outside the doubled interval, and if the width is tripled, probably only 0.3% lie outside. These values follow from the properties of the [[normal distribution]], and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors. In that case, the quoted [[standard error (statistics)|standard errors]] are easily converted to 68.3% ("one [[sigma]]"), 95.4% ("two sigma"), or 99.7% ("three sigma") [[confidence interval]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In this context, uncertainty depends on both the [[accuracy and precision]] of the measurement instrument. The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument, the larger the measurement uncertainty is. Notice that precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value, namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty. However, this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate. When it is inaccurate, the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures, and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision.

==Uncertainty and the media==
Uncertainty in science, and science in general, may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=zehr&gt;Zehr, S. C. (1999). Scientists' representation of uncertainty. In Friedman, S.M., Dunwoody, S., &amp; Rogers, C. L. (Eds.), Communicating uncertainty: Media coverage of new and controversial science (3–21). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience, and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; One example is explained by the [[information deficit model]]. Also, in the public realm, there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; For example, depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere, discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted, as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals.  For example, global warming contrarian activists took the advice of [[Frank Luntz]] to frame [[global warming]] as an issue of scientific uncertainty, which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2009 |title=What's next for science communication? Promising directions and lingering distractions |journal=[[American Journal of Botany]] |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=1767–1778 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known, whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shackley |first=S. |last2=Wynne |first2=B. |year=1996 |title=Representing uncertainty in global climate change science and policy: Boundary-ordering devices and authority |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=275–302 |doi=10.1177/016224399602100302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These unknowns, indeterminacy and ignorance, that exist in science are often "transformed" into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable, since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility.&lt;ref name=zehr /&gt; Conversely, uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Somerville |first=R. C. |last2=Hassol |first2=S. J. |year=2011 |title=Communicating the science of climate change |journal=[[Physics Today]] |volume= 64|issue= |pages=48–53 | doi = 10.1063/pt.3.1296 |bibcode=2011PhT....64j..48S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public's misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance.

Journalists may inflate uncertainty (making the science seem more uncertain than it really is) or downplay uncertainty (making the science seem more certain than it really is).&lt;ref name=stocking&gt;{{cite book |last=Stocking |first=H. |year=1999 |chapter=How journalists deal with scientific uncertainty |editor1-last=Friedman |editor1-first=S. M. |editor2-last=Dunwoody |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Rogers |editor3-first=C. L. |title=Communicating Uncertainty: Media Coverage of New and Controversial Science |pages=23–41 |location=Mahwah, NJ |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-2727-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views, without adequately describing or explaining the state of [[scientific consensus]] on the issue.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; In the same vein, journalists may give non-scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating "scientists' carefully chosen tentative wording, and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Also, stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; There is often a "product over process" approach to [[science journalism]] that aids, too, in the downplaying of uncertainty.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt; Finally, and most notably for this investigation, when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest, uncertainty is erroneously framed as "reducible and resolvable".&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty; other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue. Because the general public (in the United States) generally trusts scientists, when science stories are covered without alarm-raising cues from special interest organizations (religious groups, environmental organizations, political factions, etc.) they are often covered in a business related sense, in an economic-development frame or a social progress frame.&lt;ref name=nisbet&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbet |first=M. |last2=Scheufele |first2=D. A. |year=2007 |title=The Future of Public Engagement |journal=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]] |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=38–44 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty, so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle, as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States, the matter in question seems more definitive and certain.&lt;ref name=nisbet /&gt;

Sometimes, stockholders, owners, or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue, and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated.&lt;ref name=stocking /&gt;

==Applications==
* Uncertainty is designed into [[game]]s, most notably in [[gambling]], where [[probability|chance]] is central to play.
* In [[scientific modelling]], in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values
* In [[optimization]], uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the final outcome of the optimization procedure, see [[scenario optimization]] and [[stochastic optimization]]. 
** In [[meteorology|weather forecasting]], it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a [[weather forecast]].
* Uncertainty or [[error]] is used in science and engineering notation. Numerical values should only be expressed to those digits that are physically meaningful, which are referred to as [[significant figures]]. Uncertainty is involved in every measurement, such as measuring a distance, a temperature, etc., the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement. Similarly, uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregory |first=Kent J. |last2=Bibbo |first2=Giovanni |last3=Pattison |first3=John E. |year=2005 |title=A Standard Approach to Measurement Uncertainties for Scientists and Engineers in Medicine |journal=Australasian Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=131–139 |doi=10.1007/BF03178705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[physics]], the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] forms the basis of modern [[quantum mechanics]].
* In [[metrology]], [[measurement uncertainty]] is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result. Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement [[error]]. In daily life, measurement uncertainty is often implicit ("He is 6 feet tall" give or take a few inches), while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary. The expected measurement uncertainty of many [[measuring instruments]] (scales, oscilloscopes, force gages, rulers, thermometers, etc.) is often stated in the manufacturers' specifications.
* In [[engineering]], uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926183351/https://icme.hpc.msstate.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Category:Uncertainty |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertainty has been a common theme in art, both as a thematic device (see, for example, the indecision of [[Hamlet]]), and as a quandary for the artist (such as [[Martin Creed]]'s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make).
* Uncertainty is an important factor in [[economics]]. According to economist [[Frank Knight]], it is different from [[risk]], where there is a specific [[probability]] assigned to each outcome (as when flipping a fair coin). Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities.
** Investing in [[financial market]]s such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probabiliy of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown.
** In [[entrepreneurship]]: New products, services, firms and even markets may be created in the absence of probability estimates. According to entrepreneurship research, expert entrepreneurs use{{since when|date=November 2017}} experience based [[heuristics]] called [[effectuation]] (as opposed to [[causality]]) to overcome uncertainty.{{cn|date=November 2017}}
