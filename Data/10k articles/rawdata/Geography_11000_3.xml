'''Ahuna Mons'''&lt;ref name=IAU&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15409 Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature – Ahuna Mons]&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|@|'|h|u:|n|@|_|'|m|Q|n|z}} is the largest mountain on the dwarf planet and asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. It protrudes above otherwise smooth terrain, it is not an impact feature, and it appears to be the only mountain of its kind on Ceres. Bright streaks run top to bottom on its slopes; these streaks are thought to be salt, similar to the better known [[Bright spots on Ceres|Cererian bright spots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Maddie |url=https://gizmodo.com/ceres-mysterious-bright-spots-arent-made-of-ice-after-a-1734112941 |title=Ceres' Mysterious Bright Spots Aren't Made of Ice After All |work=Gizmodo |date=1 October 2015 |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likely resulted from cryovolcanic activity from Ceres's interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burnham |first=Robert |url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20151215-deep-freeze-puts-squeeze-dwarf-planet-ceres |title=Deep freeze puts the squeeze on dwarf planet Ceres |work=[[Arizona State University]] |date=15 December 2015 |accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the traditional post-harvest festival ''[[Sumi Naga#Ahuna|Ahuna]]'' of the [[Sumi Naga]] people of [[India]]. In July 2018, NASA released a comparison of physical features, including Ahuna Mons, found on Ceres with similar ones present on Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180724"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=McCartney |first2=Gretchen |title=What Looks Like Ceres on Earth? |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7196 |date=24 July 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The mountain was discovered on images taken by the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]] in orbit around Ceres in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA spies 3-mile-tall 'pyramid,' more bright spots on Ceres |url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/3-mile-tall-pyramid-more-bright-spots-spied-on-ceres/|date=17 June 2015|work=Cnet|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated to have an average height of about {{convert|4|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and a maximum height of about {{convert|5|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} on its steepest side; it is about {{convert|20|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} wide at the base.&lt;ref name="PIA20348"&gt;{{cite web |title=PIA20348: Ahuna Mons Seen from LAMO |url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20348 |date=7 March 2016 |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Lab]] |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
It has been proposed that Ahuna Mons formed as a [[cryovolcanic]] dome.&lt;ref name="Skibba2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skibba|first1=R.|title=Giant ice volcano spotted on dwarf planet Ceres|journal= Nature|date=1 September 2016|doi= 10.1038/nature.2016.20526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruesch2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruesch|first1= O.|last2=Platz|first2= T.|last3=Schenk|first3= P.|last4=McFadden|first4=L.

Seismic energy from the Kerwan-forming impact may have been focused on the opposite side of Ceres, fracturing the outer layers of the area and facilitating the movement of high viscosity cryovolcanic magma (consisting of muddy water ice softened by its content of salts) that was then extruded onto the surface. Crater counts suggest that formation of the mountain continued into the last several hundred million years, making this a relatively young geological feature.&lt;ref name="Ruesch2016" /&gt;

'''Al Khadraniyah''' is a village in [[Iraq]]. It is located west of River [[Tigris]] and north of [[Al-Shirqat]]. From 2014 until November 2016, it was under control of [[ISIL]].

==Location==
Al-Khadraniyah(Al Khaḑrānīyah) is located at 35° 36' 39" [[North]], 43° 14' 26" [[East]],  near [[Al-Shirqat|Sharqat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://geolocated.org/IQ/5g6p3imh   Al Khadraniyah].&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[ruins]] of ancient [[Assur]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itouchmap.com/?c=iz&amp;UF=-3107225&amp;UN=-4388748&amp;DG=PPL  Places in Iraq » Al Khadraniyah, Iraq].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town is off the [[Mosul]] to [[Tikrit]] road, on the banks of the [[Tigris River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maplandia.com/iraq/neineva/al-khadraniyah/  Al Khadraniyah Map — Satellite Images of Al Khadraniyah].&lt;/ref&gt; The town is services by a railway station and the border between [[Nineveh Governorate]] and [[Al-Shirqat District]] of [[Saladin Governorate]] passes through the town.
 
==History==
In 1918 the [[Battle of Sharqat]] was fought to the south of the town. 
In 2014 the town was captured by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[Battle of Mosul (2016)|retaken]] by the [[Iraqi Security Forces]] in November 2016.

[[File:Ramses II audience.jpg|thumb|A depiction of a light skinned foreign servant of ramesss ii amongst his son and local servants, it may be Ben Azen or reflect his appearance]]

'''Ben-Azen''' ([[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] for "Son of Azen" or in his [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] given name: "Ramesses-em-per-Ra"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=acT0GQfclFkC&amp;pg=PT249&amp;lpg=PT249&amp;dq=BEN+AZEN+EGYPT&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c74S7R8uxT&amp;sig=lEl6U-WsWJq8g_ck0405lqLKUio&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1vLXh4J_TAhXHtxQKHV5zBK0Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=BEN%20AZEN%20EGYPT&amp;f=false Marc Van De Mieroop, A History of Ancient Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;  - meaning "Ramesses in the House of [[Ra]]") was an Asiatic [[official]] in the [[19th Dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] at the court of [[Pharaohs]] [[Ramses II]] and his son, [[Merneptah]]. Ben-Azen's was titled: "[[Cup]] Bearer"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=HHmOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=BEN+AZEN+EGYPT&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GMkS2uNwzM&amp;sig=E7s7lYZ6XdXmOdQ_G6zXeMn6yZs&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1vLXh4J_TAhXHtxQKHV5zBK0Q6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=BEN%20AZEN&amp;f=false Dr Rosalie David &amp; Anthony E. David, A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.24]&lt;/ref&gt; - meaning he was in a high position stationed next to the kings themselves despite his foreign descent that allegedly should have restricted him to menial tasks.

According to an inscription asserted to him, Ben-Azen had came to Ancient Egypt from Northern [[Jordan]], thus he's to be referred to as [[Canaan]]ite in terms of ethnic background. Like many "butlers" (a term coined to the officials of foreign descent) in the [[Ramesside]] era, Ben Azen reflects the Asiatic tone the Royal Court had.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=acT0GQfclFkC&amp;pg=PT249&amp;lpg=PT249&amp;dq=BEN+AZEN+EGYPT&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c74S7R8uxT&amp;sig=lEl6U-WsWJq8g_ck0405lqLKUio&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1vLXh4J_TAhXHtxQKHV5zBK0Q6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=BEN%20AZEN%20EGYPT&amp;f=false Marc Van De Mieroop, A History of Ancient Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is watered by the [[Piave River]] which has its source in the [[Carnic Alps]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Titian |volume=26 |page=1023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an undeveloped and poor district, the former ''contado'' (countship) of Cadore now has a thriving economy based on [[tourism]] and a small [[Manufacturing|manufacturing industry]], specialising in the production of [[glasses]].

The celebrated [[Renaissance]] painter [[Titian]] was born in Cadore, probably in 1488–90, one of a family of four born to Gregorio Vecelli, a distinguished councillor and soldier&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; descended from the counts. The painter's birthplace in [[Pieve di Cadore]], in a locality named ''Arsenale'' between the castle and the village Sotto Castello, is open to visitors. Titian's wife, Cecilia, was also born in Cadore, the daughter of a barber.

== History ==
[[File:Bandiera Cadore.jpg|thumb|right|Palace and flag of Magnifica Comunità Cadorina]]
Originally populated by people who spoke [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]], [[Euganei]] and then by the Celtic [[Gauls]], the area now known as Cadore was later conquered by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the second century BC and became part of the [[Italia (Roman province)|Regio X ''Venetia et Histria'']].

In the [[Late Antiquity]] era, Cadore was occupied by [[Decline of the Roman Empire|invading Germanic populations]] and was first declared part of the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and finally, in 1077,  part of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (State)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]]. From 1135 to 1335, Cadore was ruled by the da Camino family, the Counts of Cadore, who later became the ''Signori'' family of [[Treviso]]. It was briefly annexed to [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and again was ceded to the [[Patriarchs of Aquileia]]. However, the ''[[Comune|comuni]]'' of Cadore always enjoyed a certain degree of self-government.

When the [[Republic of Venice]] conquered the neighbouring [[Friuli]] region in 1420 and put an end to the [[State (polity)|temporal power]] of the Patriarchs, the rulers of Cadore were forced to choose between aligning with Venetia or the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]]. It declared its loyalty to the former, becoming one of many parts of the ''Terra ferma'', admininistered by a local ''[[podestà]]''.

The conflict between Venice and the Empire broke out again at the beginning of the 16th century, during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]]. The Venetians and the Cadorines defeated [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1508 at the [[Battle of Valle di Cadore]], and again in 1509. Then, in 1511, Maximilian conquered the town of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], which was once and for all assigned to the Empire in 1516. Cortina, formerly considered part of Cadore, has since developed a distinct identity.  
[[File:Titian house pieve cadore 1.JPG|thumb|right|Titian house - Pieve di Cadore]]
Cadore remained part of the Venetian Republic until the [[Napoleonic War]]. A famous Venetian  incumbent of the local post of ''Commisario del Cadore'' ('Commissioner'; in 1589) was [[Paolo Paruta]]. [[Napoleon I Bonaparte]] created a [[duché grand-fief]], a rare, hereditary but nominal honor of ducal rank (extinguished in 1893) for his minister and admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Nompère de Champagny]].

Being a part of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]], Cadore was ruled by the [[Austrian Empire]] until 1866, when it was finally conquered by the newly formed [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in the [[Unification of Italy|Third War of Independence]]. During the [[First World War]], Cadore was on the [[Alpine Front]] and was the scene of many battles.

==''Comuni'' of Cadore==
Cadore is generally subdivided into [[Comelico]], [[Sappada]], [[Central Cadore]] and [[Boite Valley]]. The Cadore mountain community includes 22 [[comune|comuni]]:

{{Politics of Lithuania}}
__NOTOC__

The territory of [[Lithuania]] is divided into '''10 counties''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: singular ''apskritis'', plural ''apskritys''), all named after their capitals. The counties are divided into [[Municipalities of Lithuania|60 municipalities]] (Lithuanian: singular ''savivaldybė'', plural ''savivaldybės''): 9 city municipalities, 43 district municipalities and 8 municipalities. Each municipality is then divided into [[elderate]]s (Lithuanian: singular ''seniūnija'', plural ''seniūnijos''). This division was created in 1994 and slightly modified in 2000. 

Until 2010, the counties were administered by county governors (Lithuanian: singular – ''apskrities viršininkas'', plural – ''apskrities viršininkai'') appointed by the central government in [[Vilnius]]. Their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws and the [[Constitution of Lithuania]]. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much for Lithuania as the two smallest counties administer only four municipalities. Therefore, on 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished but the counties are retained for statistical and reporting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dėl apskričių viršininkų administracijų likvidavimo|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=392936|publisher=Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania|accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ''apskritys'' should not be confused with ''apskritys'' that existed in the independent Lithuania during the [[interwar period]]. At that time Lithuania had a two-tier administrative division: ''apskritys'' that were subdivided into ''valsčius''. Lithuania now has a three-step division: counties, municipalities, and elderates (''apskritys'', ''savivaldybės'', and ''seniūnijos''). See [[subdivisions of Lithuania]] for details.

The '''Crimean journey of Catherine the Great''' ({{lang-ru|Путешествие Екатерины II в Крым}}, also known as Таврический вояж ('''[[Taurida]] Voyage''') at the time) was a six-month (January 2, 1787 &amp;mdash; July 11, 1787) inspection trip of [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II of Russia]] to the newly acquired lands of [[New Russia]] and [[Crimea]], gained as a result of the victorious wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]] ([[Russo-Turkish War, 1735-1739|1735–39]] and [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|1768–74]]) and peace treaties with the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] followed by the forced liquidation of free [[Zaporizhian Sich]]. The trip was carried out with her court and several ambassadors. During the trip she met with the Austrian emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], travelling incognito. The trip was arranged by [[Gregory Potemkin]], a favorite and lover of Catherine II. The trip happened when the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)]] was just about to erupt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Brückner]], ''Potyomkin'', С.-Петербург. Издание К.Л. Риккера 1891, [http://adjudant.ru/potemkin/brikner05.htm Chapter V: Путешествие Екатерины (1787 г.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109184010/http://adjudant.ru/potemkin/brikner05.htm |date=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these times the expression "[[Potemkin village]]" came into being, referring to the legend&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2479/did-potemkin-villages-really-exist "Did "Potemkin villages" really exist?"], ''[[Straight Dope]]''&lt;/ref&gt; about fake villages hastily erected by Potemkin along the Catherine's route, in order to impress the Empress.

'''David Gans''' ({{lang-he-n|דָּוִד בֶּן שְׁלֹמֹה גנז}}; &amp;lrm;1541–1613), also known as '''Rabbi Dovid Solomon Ganz''', was a [[Jew]]ish [[chronicler]], [[mathematician]], [[historian]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrologer]]. He is the author of "Tzemach David" (1592) and therefore also known by this title, the '''צמח דוד'''.

==Biography==
David was born in [[Lippstadt]], in what is now [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. His father, Shlomo, was a moneylender. He studied rabbinical literature in [[Bonn]] and [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], then in [[Kraków]]  under [[Moses Isserles]].&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|article=GANS, DAVID BEN SOLOMON BEN SELIGMAN|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6506-gans-david-ben-solomon-ben-seligman|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he attended the lectures of the [[Maharal of Prague]] and of his brother, Rabbi [[Sinai ben Bezalel|Sinai]]. They introduced [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], and [[astronomy]] into the circle of their studies, and from them Gans received the impulse to devote himself to these branches of science. He lived for a time in [[Nordheim vor der Rhön|Nordheim]] (where he studied [[Euclid]]), passed several years in his native city of Lippstadt, and then in about 1564 settled in Prague. There he came into contact with [[Kepler]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], and took part for three consecutive days in astronomical observations at the Prague observatory. He also carried on a scientific correspondence with Johann Müller ([[Regiomontanus]]), and was charged with the translation of the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' from Hebrew into German by Tycho Brahe.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

His grave in the [[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague|Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague]] is marked with a [[Star of David]] and a [[goose]] ({{lang-de|Gans}} meaning goose in German). This is the first time a Star of David was officially used as Jewish community emblem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/whats-new-with-pragues-old-new-synagogue-and-old-jewish-cemetery/2009/04/29/0/?print What's new with Prague's Old-New Synagogue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Among Gans's works the most widely known is his history entitled ''Tzemach David'', published first in Prague in 1592. It is divided into two parts, the first containing the annals of Jewish history, the second those of general history. The author consulted the writings of [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]], [[Laurentius Faustus]], [[Hubertus Holtzius]], [[Georg Cassino]], and [[Martin Borisk]] for the second part of his work. Gans's annals are memorable as the first work of this kind among the German Jews. In his preface to the second volume the author tries to justify writing about a "profane" subject like general history, and demonstrated that it was permitted to read history on [[Shabbat]]. ''Tzemach David'' was published in  many editions. To the 1692 edition published in Frankfurt, [[David ben Moses Rheindorf]] added a third part containing the annals of that century, which addition has been retained in later editions of the ''Tzemach''. The first part of Gans's work, and extracts from the second, were translated into Latin by [[Wilhelm Heinrich Vorst]] (Leyden, 1644). It was translated also into [[Judæo-German|Yiddish]] by [[Solomon Hanau]] (Frankfurt, 1692).&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

Gans was also the author of: ''Gebulat ha-Eretz'', a work on [[cosmography]], which is in all probability identical to the ''Zurat ha-Eretz'', published in [[Constantinople]] under the name of "David Avazi" ("Avaz" means "goose" in Hebrew, a reference to the surname "Gans", which means "goose" in German); ''Magen David'', an astronomical treatise, a part of which is included in the ''Nechmad ve'naim'' mentioned below; the mathematical works ''Ma'or ha-Ḳatan'', ''Migdal David'', and ''Prozdor'', which are no longer in existence; ''Nechmad ve'naim'' dealing with astronomy and mathematical geography, published with additions by [[Joel ben Jekuthiel]] of Glogau at Jessnitz, 1743. This work is divided into 12 chapters and 305 paragraphs. In the introduction the author gives a historical survey of the development of astronomy and mathematical geography among the nations. Although acquainted with the work of [[Copernicus]], Gans followed the [[Ptolemaic system]], attributing the Copernican system to the [[Pythagoreans]]. He also ventures to assert that the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] made a mistake in computation. A Latin translation of the introduction, and a résumé made by [[Hebenstreit]], are appended to the ''Nechmad ve'naim''.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

'''Dhanmondi Lake''' is a lake located in the [[Dhanmondi]] residential area in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/music/homage-sudhin-das-and-karunamaya-goswami-1434073|title=Homage to Sudhin Das and Karunamaya Goswami|date=2017-07-17|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/streets-dhaka-7-reasons-why-we-love-saat-masjid-road-1407493|title=7 reasons why we love Saat Masjid Road|date=2017-05-19|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was originally a dead channel of the Karwan Bazar River, and was connected to the [[Turag River]]. The lake is partially connected with the Begunbari Canal. In 1956, Dhanmondi was developed as a residential area. In the development plan, about 16% of the total area of Dhanmondi was designated for the lake.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book

'''East Malaysia''' (''Malaysia Timur''), also known as '''[[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Labuan]]''' (''Sabah, Sarawak dan Labuan'')&lt;ref&gt;The latter term is more commonly used in Malaysia to avoid the connotation of "East Malaysia" and "West Malaysia" ([[Peninsular Malaysia]]) being two separate countries, as in former [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Malaysian Borneo''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Malaysia urged to scrap coal plant in eco-sensitive Borneo|date=7 July 2010|publisher=AFP|accessdate=8 July 2010|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j8XrzbzMEHI_Mb5D1IHsGoveMMeA}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the part of [[Malaysia]] on the island of [[Borneo]], the world's third largest island. It consists of the [[States of Malaysia|Malaysian states]] of [[Sabah]], closer to the [[Philippines]] than the west of the country, [[Sarawak]] in the west and the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] of [[Labuan]]. Labuan is an island in its small archipelago of the same name due north of [[Brunei]]; its closest land mass is with Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:354:0019:0028:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; It lies to the east of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] (West Malaysia), the part of the country on the [[Malay Peninsula]]. The two are separated by the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiatravel.org.uk/geography.html|title=Location|publisher=Malaysia Travel.org.uk|accessdate=7 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923131937/http://malaysiatravel.org.uk/geography.html|archivedate=23 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Malay+Peninsula|title=Malay Peninsula|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

East Malaysia is less populated and overall less developed in its settlements than its West which contains [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]] however its land mass is larger and it has more of many natural resources including oil and gas reserves. City status award is restrained in the pan-regional style so reserved to [[Kuching]], [[Kota Kinabalu]], and [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]]; [[Victoria, Labuan]] for example is an [[Offshore Financial Centre]] and major port. In ecology it has a significant proportion of the biodiverse [[Borneo lowland rain forests]] and [[Borneo montane rain forests]].

==History==
{{see also|History of Sabah|History of Sarawak|History of Labuan|British Borneo}}
Some parts of present-day East Malaysia, especially the coastal regions, were once part of the [[thalassocracy]] of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A History of Brunei |page=45 |publisher=RoutlegdeCurzon |year=2002 |author=Saunders, Graham E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&amp;pg=PA40 |accessdate=5 October 2009|isbn=9780700716982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most parts of the interior region consisted of independent tribal societies.

In 1658, the northern and eastern coasts of Sabah were ceded to the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] while the west coast of Sabah and most of Sarawak remained part of Brunei. Beginning in the mid 19th century, Sabah and Sarawak became British protectorates, and, in 1946, they became separate British colonies.

==Federation==
Sabah (formerly [[British North Borneo]]) and Sarawak were separate [[Crown colony|British colonies]] from [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and did not become part of the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1957. However, each voted to become part of the new [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] along with the [[Federation of Malaya]] and Singapore in 1963. Previously, there were efforts to unite [[Brunei]], Sabah, and Sarawak under the [[North Borneo Federation]] but that failed after the [[Brunei Revolt]] occurred.

Sabah and Sarawak retained a higher degree of local government and legislative autonomy than other states in West Malaysia. For example, both states have their own immigration controls, requiring Malaysian citizens from West Malaysia to carry passports or identity cards when visiting East Malaysia.

The islands of [[Labuan]] were once part of [[North Borneo]] (later [[Sabah]]) in 1946 before becoming a [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] in Malaysia on 1984. It was used to establish a centre for [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore finance]] in 1990.

Since 2010, there has been some speculation and discussion, at least on the ground level, about the possibility of secession from the Federation of Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/newscommentaries/30977-push-for-sabah-swaks-independence-next-stop-un- Push for Sabah, S'wak's independence: Next stop UN] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907203736/http://www.malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/newscommentaries/30977-push-for-sabah-swaks-independence-next-stop-un- |date=7 September 2012 }}. Malaysia-today.net (2010-04-02). Retrieved on 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt; because of allegations of resource mishandling, illegal processing of immigrants, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sarawakwatch.com/?p=13661{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
It has been a source of debate whether the states of Sabah and Sarawak joined the Federation of Malaysia as equal partners with Malaya and Singapore or whether they became merely equal partners of the states of Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=72641|title='Know Federal System' advice|publisher=Daily Express|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621233347/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=72641|archivedate=21 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus seems to be that Sabah and Sarawak are merely states of the federation with a slightly higher degree of autonomy compared to states in Peninsular Malaysia. For example, the East Malaysian states have separate laws regulating the entry of citizens from other states in Malaysia (including the other East Malaysian state), whereas, in Peninsular Malaysia, there are no restrictions on interstate travel or migration, including visitors from East Malaysia. There are also separate [[Property law|land law]]s governing Sabah and Sarawak, as opposed to the National Land Code, which governs Peninsular Malaysia.

With regard to the administration of justice, the courts in East Malaysia are part of the federal court system in Malaysia. The Constitution of Malaysia provides that there shall be two [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Courts]] of co-ordinate jurisdiction&amp;nbsp;– The High Court in Malaya and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak (formerly the High Court in Borneo). The current Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak is [[David Wong Dak Wah]] from Sabah. His office is the fourth highest in the Malaysian judicial system (behind the Chief Judge of Malaya, President of the [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]], and [[Chief Justice of Malaysia]]).

==Politics==

[[File:Borneo Topography.png|right|thumb|A topographic map of Borneo with East Malaysia located on the northern portion of the island]]
The landscape of East Malaysia is mostly [[Borneo lowland rain forests|lowland rain forests]] with areas of [[Borneo montane rain forests|mountain rain forest]] towards the hinterland.

The total area of East Malaysia is 198,447&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing approximately 60% of the total land area of [[Malaysia]] and 26.4% of the total area of [[Borneo]], which is 50% bigger than [[Peninsular Malaysia]] at {{convert|132156|km2|sqmi}}, comparable with [[South Dakota]] or [[Great Britain]].

East Malaysia contains the five highest [[List of mountains in Malaysia|mountains in Malaysia]], the highest being [[Mount Kinabalu]] at 4095 m, which is also the highest mountain in Borneo and the 10th highest mountain peak in Southeast Asia. It also contains the two longest rivers in Malaysia&amp;nbsp;– [[Rajang River]] and [[Kinabatangan River]].&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;{{Citation|title=Geography|url=http://www.malaysiahistorical.com.my/geography.html|date=|accessdate=16 July 2010|publisher=Malaysiahistorical.com.my|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427065735/http://www.malaysiahistorical.com.my/geography.html|archivedate=27 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents 20.4% of the population of Malaysia. A significant part of the population of East Malaysia today reside in towns and cities. The largest city and urban centre is [[Kuching]], which is also the capital of Sarawak and has a population of over 600,000 people. [[Kota Kinabalu]] is the second largest, and one of the most important cities in East Malaysia. Kuching, Kota Kinabalu, and [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] are the only three places with city status in East Malaysia. Other important towns include [[Sandakan]] and [[Tawau]] in Sabah, [[Sibu]] and [[Bintulu]] in Sarawak, and [[Victoria, Labuan|Victoria]] in Labuan.

The earliest inhabitants of East Malaysia were the [[Dayak people]] and other related ethnic groups such as the [[Kadazan-Dusun]] people. These indigenous people form a significant portion, but not the majority, of the population. For hundreds of years, there has been significant migration into East Malaysia and Borneo from many parts of the [[Malay Archipelago]], including Java, the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sulu]]. More recently, there has been immigration from [[India]] and China.

The indigenous inhabitants were originally animists. Islamic influence began as early as the 15th century, while Christian influence started in the 19th century.

The indigenous inhabitants are generally partisan and maintain culturally distinct dialects of the [[Malay language]], in addition to their own ethnic languages. Approximately 13% of the population of Sabah, and 26% of the population of Sarawak, is composed of ethnic Chinese Malaysians.

However, the demography of Sabah has been altered dramatically with the alleged implementation of [[Project IC]] in the 1990s. Citizenships are alleged to be granted to immigrants of [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] in order to keep the [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] ruling party in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SPECIAL REPORT: Sabah's Project M (subscription required)|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/53046|date=27 June 2006|last=|first=|publisher=[[Malaysiakini]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718105636/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/53046|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on illegal immigrants in Sabah|Royal Commission of Inquiry]] (RCI) has been conducted from 11 August 2012 to 20 September 2013.

==Education==
East Malaysia currently has two public universities, namely [[Universiti Malaysia Sarawak]] (UNIMAS) and [[Universiti Malaysia Sabah]] (UMS). [[Universiti Teknologi Mara]] (UiTM) also has branch campuses in both states. Labuan's own institution of higher education is Universiti Malaysia Sabah Labuan International Campus, which has a branch in Sepanggar Bay, Kota Kinabalu. All prospective university entrants from Sabah, Sarawak, and Labuan must sit the examinations of one matriculation college, Kolej Matrikulasi Labuan.

[[UCSI University, Sarawak Campus]], [[University College of Technology Sarawak]] (UCTS) [[Tunku Abdul Rahman University College]] (Sabah campus), [[International University College Of Technology Twintech]] (Sabah campus), and [[Open University Malaysia]] (Sabah campus) have local private university branch campuses in East Malaysia. [[Curtin University, Malaysia]] and [[Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus]] are foreign university branch campuses in Sarawak.

There are 4 teacher training colleges ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Maktab Perguruan'') in Sarawak, and 4 teacher training colleges in Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institut Pendidikan Guru (Teachers' Training Institute)|url=http://www.moe.gov.my/my/direktori-ipg?page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1|publisher=Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia (Malaysian Ministry of Education)|accessdate=22 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222000249/http://www.moe.gov.my/my/direktori-ipg?page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1&amp;page=2&amp;page=1|archivedate=22 December 2015|quote=IPG Kampus Sarawak, IPG Kampus Tun Abdul Razak, IPG Kampus Batu Lintang(1st page), IPG Kampus Rajang (2nd page)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The [[Pan Borneo Highway]] connects Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei. The road has been poorly maintained since it was built. The narrow road is dark at night without any street lights and there are many danger spots, sharp bends, blind spots, potholes, and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Repair Pan Borneo Highway now, says Bintulu MP following latest fatal accident |url= http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/09/13/Deadly-reminder-after-grim-toll-Repair-Pan-Borneo-Highway-now-says-Bintulu-MP-following-latest-fatal.aspx/ |date= 13 September 2013 |last= Then |first= Stephen |publisher= [[The Star (Malaysia)]] |accessdate= 23 June 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160206023625/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/community/2013/09/13/deadly-reminder-after-grim-toll-repair-pan-borneo-highway-now-says-bintulu-mp-following-latest-fatal/ |archivedate= 6 February 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, federal government funds have been allocated for the upgrade of the highway, which will be carried out in stages until completion in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan Borneo Highway project will be carried out in stages, says minister|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/11/14/Pan-Borneo-Highway-project-will-be-carried-out-in-stages-says-minister/|date=14 November 2013|last=|first=|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904034305/http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Community/2013/11/14/Pan-Borneo-Highway-project-will-be-carried-out-in-stages-says-minister/|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major airports in East Malaysia are [[Kuching International Airport]], [[Labuan Airport]] and [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]]. There are frequent air flights by carriers including [[Malaysia Airlines]] (MAS) and [[AirAsia]] between East Malaysia and Peninsular Malaysia. Other ports of entry to East Malaysia include [[Sibu Airport]], [[Bintulu Airport]], and [[Miri Airport]] in Sarawak, [[Sandakan Airport]] and [[Tawau Airport]] in Sabah. MAS also operates international flights to major cities in East Malaysia.&lt;ref name=borneo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borneo-hotels.com/info/gettingthere.htm|title=Getting To Borneo By Air, By Car, By Train|publisher=Asia Web Direct|accessdate=15 July 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612184348/http://www.borneo-hotels.com/info/gettingthere.htm|archivedate=12 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural areas in Borneo can only be accessed by air or river boat. River transport is especially prevalent in Sarawak because there are many large and long rivers, with [[Rajang River]] being the most used. Rivers are used by boats and ferries for communications (i.e. mail) and passenger transport between inland areas and coastal towns. Timber is also transported via vessels and log carriers down the rivers of Sarawak.&lt;ref name=borneo/&gt;

The Labuan Ferry operates boat express and vehicle ferries from [[Labuan]] Island to [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]] and [[Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Ferry launched for Labuan-Sabah-Brunei sea route|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/05/02/Ferry-Labuan-Sabah-Brunei/|journal=http://www.thestar.com.my|date=2 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505014002/http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/05/02/Ferry-Labuan-Sabah-Brunei/|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferries have overtaken air travel as the chief [[Mode of transport|transportation mode]] on and off the island.

==Security==
{{Main article|Cross border attacks in Sabah}}
The state of Sabah has been subjected to attacks by [[Moro people|Moro]] pirates and militants since the 1960s and intensification in 1985, 2000, 2013. The [[Eastern Sabah Security Zone]] (ESSZONE) and [[Eastern Sabah Security Command]] (ESSCOM) were established on 25 March 2013 to tighten security in the region. Since 2014, a 12-hour dusk-to-dawn curfew has been imposed on six Sabah east coast districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sabah curfew renewed for the seventh time |url= http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/sabah-curfew-renewed-for-the-seventh-time |date= 5 November 2014 |last= Chan |first= Julia |publisher= [[The Malay Mail]] |accessdate= 6 November 2014 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141222161922/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/sabah-curfew-renewed-for-the-seventh-time |archivedate= 22 December 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC)''' (French: ''Conseil International de la Chasse et de la Conservation du Gibier'', German: ''Internationaler Rat zur Erhaltung des Wildes und der Jagd'') is a politically independent not-for-profit advisory body, aiming to preserve [[wildlife]] through the promotion of [[sustainable use]] of wildlife resources. The acronym CIC comes from the organisation’s original French name ''Conseil International de la Chasse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Keil |url=http://www.cms.int/about/partnerships/partnerships_index.htm |title=CMS - Partner Organisations |publisher=CMS |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213125722/http://www.cms.int/about/partnerships/partnerships_index.htm |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIC was founded in 1928. Up until 1999, the headquarters of the CIC was located in [[Paris]]. Today, the CIC has its headquarters in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huntingpress.eu/magazine/the_government_supports_the_cic |title=The Government supports the CIC |publisher=Hunting Press |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservationandsociety.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4923;year=2012;volume=10;issue=1;spage=53;epage=62;aulast=Paulson&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the organisation unites 26 State Members (represented by the Ministries responsible for [[wildlife management]] and [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]], or the delegated institution), a wide range of organisations engaged in [[hunting]] and [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]], as well as individuals such as private members and scientific experts from 86 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainpartnership.org/members/members-detail/en/c/43138/ |title=Members detail |publisher=Mountain Partnership |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official languages of the CIC are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]].

==History==
The idea of establishing an [[international organisation]] dealing with [[sustainable hunting]] and [[wildlife management]] was first brought up in 1910 at the occasion of an international hunting exhibition in [[Vienna]]. The concept was however translated into concrete action in 1928 only, by French lawyer Maxime Ducrocq and Count Louis Károlyi, who organised an international conference in [[Nové Zámky]], [[Slovakia]], in view of establishing an international hunting organisation. Many of the discussions took place in the manor of Count Károlyi in [[Palárikovo]], which now serves as the CIC Museum. The conference resulted in the "Declaration of Nové Zámky" calling for the foundation of an international hunting council named "''Conseil International de la Chasse''" and the formation of a commission which was to work out the Statutes of the CIC. This was the basis for the first general assembly and the official registration of the CIC in November 1930 in [[Paris]].

 |}
From the beginning, the CIC has promoted ideals for sustainable and ethical hunting, stressing that [[hunting]] and the [[conservation of wildlife]] go hand in hand, and gaining global recognition as an independent advisor in the field of [[wildlife conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rolf Baldus |url=http://cic-sustainable-hunting-worldwide.org/history.html |title=CIC Division Applied Science |date=2008-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213121642/http://cic-sustainable-hunting-worldwide.org/history.html |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working Groups==

===Young Opinion (YO)===

The CIC Working Group – Young Opinion focuses on creating a global network of young conservationists under the age of 35 who are enthusiastic about [[wildlife]] and its [[sustainable management]], in line with the views of the CIC.

The YO was launched at the General Assembly of the CIC in [[Slovenia]] in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive-org.com/org/c/cic-wildlife.org/2012-10-29_552430_4/CIC_Wildlife_Hunting_and_Gastronomy/&lt;/ref&gt; Today, under the guidance of Benedict Hammer, President of the YO, the working group is leading several projects (e.g. promotion of nature and wildlife with kids, sustainable wildlife management (e.g. wolves), [[hunting in enclosures]]) and is promoting the values of the CIC through regular activities and events.

Jologan is King, the “Global Youth for Sustainable Use” (GYSU), a multiple day event including scientific symposia and cultural exchange. The first GYSU event took place in 2005, and has since been organised by delegations from various countries every year. &lt;ref&gt;http://cacamaioremportugal.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/the-cic-working-group-young-opinion-global-youth-for-sustainable-use-gysu-fonte-cic/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunting on a SA Game Ranch: A View from Central Europe // Game and Hunt - 2010 - October - p. 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artemis Club===

Recognising and advocating the role of women in the field of hunting, the CIC Artemis Club was founded in 2011 with the aim of uniting huntresses and women dedicated to sustainable use issues. Members of the Artemis Club are active in the field of environmental education, hunting culture and gastronomy, and in general as an advocate for the role of women in [[wildlife management]] around the globe. The President is Sonia Supekova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stange |first=Mary |url=http://fairchasehunting.blogspot.hu/2012/12/artemis-abroad.html |title=Fair Chase Hunting: Artemis Abroad |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
The CIC maintains alliances for promoting sustainable use as well as furthering wildlife policy and law development worldwide. Its main partners are:

'''United Nations Institutions:''' [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|FAO]] ([[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]), [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]), [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] ([[United Nations Development Programme]]), [[UNESCO]] ([[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]])

'''Environmental Conventions:''' [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] ([[Convention on Biological Diversity]]); [[CITES]] ([[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]]); [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals|CMS]] ([[Convention on Migratory Species]]), with which a partnership agreement was signed in 2005; [[Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds|AEWA]] ([[Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds]]); [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats]] ([[Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]]); [[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]]

'''International Non-Governmental Organisations:''' [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] ([[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]); [[Wetlands International]]; IAF ([[International Association for Falconry]]); [[Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU|FACE]] ([[Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU|Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the European Union]]); IUGB ([[International Union of Game Biologists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Euro News // Shooting and Conservation - 2012 - November/December&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''National Non-Governmental Organisations:''' The National Delegations of the CIC are also working together with [[NGO]]s of relevance to national or regional aspects of hunting and [[wildlife conservation]].

===&lt;center&gt;Collaborative Partnership on Sustainable Wildlife Management (CPW)&lt;/center&gt;===

The partnership originated in 2011 as an idea from the current Vice-chair of the CPW and present President of the Policy &amp; Law Division of the CIC, Mr. Jan Heino. The Chair of the partnership is Mr. Braulio F. de Souza Dias, Executive Secretary of [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), with the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) holding the secretariat.&lt;ref name="fao_cpw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/wildlife-partnership/en/ |title=Collaborative Partnership on Sustainable Wildlife Management |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPW is a voluntary partnership of international organisations with substantive mandates and programs for the sustainable use and conservation of wildlife resources. The Mission of the CPW is &lt;blockquote&gt;to promote conservation through the sustainable management of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in all biomes and geographic areas and to increase cooperation and coordination on sustainable wildlife management issues among its members and partners.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, the CPW unites twelve international organisations, including the CIC, aiming to allow for a holistic and integrated approach to wildlife issues globally.&lt;ref name="fao_cpw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collaborative Partnership on Sustainable Wildlife Management // Country Side - 2013 - №146 - p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 1st Meeting of the CPW took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] in March 2013 at the occasion of the 16th [[CITES]] Conference of the Parties (CoP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iisd.ca/vol21/enb2183e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIC - FAO===

The collaboration between the CIC and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) dates back to the year 2002. The joint work led to the analysis and documentation of the main weaknesses of current environmental policy and legislation and the priority needs for technical support of countries seeking to improve their legal documents. The outcomes of this partnership on wildlife included a series of joint CIC-FAO publications (Technical Series).

At present the CIC, together with [[FAO]], is working on an international, [[online database]] of [[wildlife management]] legislation entitled [[WildlifeLex]]. It aims to serve as a platform for hosting and linking wildlife management legislations, including key statistics, best practice examples and other relevant materials, from different countries and regions.

==General Assemblies==

The General Assembly is the highest organ of the CIC. The First General Assembly of the CIC was the constituting assembly in [[Paris]] in 1930. Thereafter, it became an annual event, taking place in one of the member countries of the CIC. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CIC General Assemblies.jpg|thumb|335px|right|General Assembly Logos by Year]]  --&gt;Events include not only the meeting of the permanent members, but also partners, representatives of  organisations from [[UN]] agencies, the [[Federation of Associations for Hunting and Conservation of the EU]] (FACE), the [[International Union of Game Biologists]] (IUGB), the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the [[European Landowners' Organisation]] (ELO), the [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE)  and major international conventions such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), as well as government delegations, national and international hunting organisations and wildlife experts.

The core program of the General Assemblies is split into three main parts as per the [[International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation#Divisions|Divisions]]. In addition, there are focused meetings of working groups and experts from different countries.

The Jubilee 60th General Assembly of the CIC took place in the three countries: [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Hungary]], from 26–30 April 2013 – the core area where the concept of the CIC was developed in the early 20th century. Experts gathered to discuss the topic of wildlife management under the motto “Hunting: Conserving Wildlife – Key to Global Cultural Heritage”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cic2013.com/en/ |title=60th CIC General Assembly &amp;#124; 26-30 April, 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213121033/http://www.cic2013.com/en/ |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/sustainable_use_and_livelihoods_specialist_group/sulinews/issue_5/sn5_cic/ |title=Hunting: Conserving wildlife, key to global cultural heritage |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213121726/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/sustainable_use_and_livelihoods_specialist_group/sulinews/issue_5/sn5_cic/ |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 61st General Assembly will be hosted by the Italian Delegation of the CIC, in the city of [[Milan]], from the 23–26 April 2014. ''Hunting, Youth and Biodiversity'' will be the main theme of the 61st General Assembly, with the ''fight against wildlife crime'' forming an important sub-topic, with a Global Summit entitled “Hunters United Against Wildlife Crime” being organised in the framework of the event. A symposium on “Hunting Ungulates between Tradition and Innovation: the Naturalist Hunter for Sustainable Wildlife Management” will precede the events of the 61st General Assembly on the 23 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicmilan2014.com |title=61st CIC General Assembly - Milan |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name “Markhor” comes from [[Pakistan]]’s threatened [[Marco Polo sheep|mountain goat]] species (''Ovis ammon polii''), the population numbers of which have increased substantially in recent years through sustainable [[hunting tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/sustainable_use_and_livelihoods_specialist_group/sulinews/issue_7/sn7_markhor.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226005600/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/sustainable_use_and_livelihoods_specialist_group/sulinews/issue_7/sn7_markhor.cfm |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is presented every two years at the Conference of Parties to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD CoP). The award consists of a bronze statue of a [[Markhor]] and a financial reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yeswehunt.eu/en/blogs/hunting-blogs/jagdzeit-hunter-s-path/does-africa-need-hunting |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220181316/http://yeswehunt.eu/en/blogs/hunting-blogs/jagdzeit-hunter-s-path/does-africa-need-hunting |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Wildlife Photo Prize'''

The Wildlife Photo Prize is an international competition on wildlife [[photography]], which is open to all professional or amateur photographers. This bi-annual prize is awarded for the best photographs of [[wild animals]], both [[mammals]] and [[birds]], living in their [[natural environment]]. The winning photographs are exhibited during the following CIC General Assembly.

*'''Hunting in Art Prize'''

Every two years, the CIC discerns the Hunting in Art prize to artists, in recognition of their efforts to enhance the cultural values of [[nature]] and [[hunting]]. The prize is awarded in the fields of [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[museums]] or a specific exhibit therein, as well as in the field of [[music]].

*'''Young Opinion Research Award'''

The award is aimed at supporting young scientists under the age of 35 whose research projects contribute to the sustainable use of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanhuntinginfo.com/en/news/181-bulletin-september-2013/331-cic-young-opinion-research-award-sept13#.UqnUHCi7n4U |title=CIC – Young Opinion Research Award |publisher=African Hunting Info |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Technical: a work about the research and science of huntable game.
:* Artistic: for exceptionally interesting and artistically valuable publications about huntable game.
:* Literary: for hunting and nature adventures, which communicate the joy of hunting and nature, not only to a small group of people but to a broader public.
:* Environmental: the purpose of this prize is to award published educational works, which support the understanding amongst the general public of the needs of hunting, the hunters, environmental issues, as well as those of [[Game (food)|game]] and its natural habitat.
:* Cultural Prizes: for the lifetime work of an author

==Recommendations and Resolutions==
The CIC serves in an advisory role to the governments and environmental organisations regarding questions on sustainable hunting, wildlife management practices and conservation. Thus, the CIC regularly proposes [[recommendations]] and [[resolution (law)|resolutions]] for consideration by the global community.

==Trophy Evaluation System==
Since its inception in the 1920s, the CIC Trophy Evaluation System (TES) has established itself as the leading [[Trophy hunting|trophy]] scoring system throughout [[Europe]], and further afield. Over time, the system has been adapted in order to account for changes in wildlife management. As part of the restructuring of the old TES, the CIC [[Trophy Measuring Rules and Regulations]] were adopted in 2012. The TES operates through Senior International Trophy Judges (SITJ) and Certified CIC Measurers, who are eligible to measure trophies on behalf of the CIC and to award CIC points. Each SITJ and Certified CIC Measurer receives an individual Identification Card which serves to officially identify qualified CIC measurers. Together, all SITJ make up the CIC Trophy Evaluation Board (TEB) which is responsible for overseeing the TES and for the training of Certified CIC Measurers.

The International Formulae for the Measurement and Evaluation of Trophies of the CIC, previously known as the Red Book, is currently undergoing extensive review and is expected to be published in 2014 as the “CIC Handbook on the Evaluation and Measuring of Hunting Trophies”.

The TES is part of the Applied Science Division, which also cooperates and coordinates its work with the CIC Headquarters, CIC Coordination Forums, and official National Hunting Associations and Trophy Measuring Associations registered with the CIC.&lt;ref&gt;Trophy measuring and BASC – a new initiative getting a head start // Shooting and Conservation - 2008 - March/April - p. 25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIC Publications==
The CIC regularly publishes newsletters, reports and other documents on issues related to its work, in order to raise awareness and provide information about sustainable hunting and relevant topics of concern to conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic-wildlife.org/publications/ |title=Publications &amp;#124; CIC |accessdate=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Koilighugar Waterfall, Jharsuguda.jpg|thumb|Koili Ghoghar]]
'''Koilighugar Waterfall''' is in [[Jharsuguda district]], [[Odisha]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jaikosal.com/2011/03/waterfalls-of-kosal-western-orissa.html |title=Welcoming All The Kosli People: Waterfalls Of Kosal (Western Orissa)|work=jaikosal.com |year=2012|quote=Koilighugar, Jharsuguda Dist |accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
From Gobindpur Chowk in [[National Highway 200 (India)|National Highway 200]], which is between Jharsuguda and [[Raigarh]], take a right turn. A {{cvt|6|km|mi}} drive from there through thick [[Shorea robusta|śāl]] and [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]] forests will take one to Koilighugar [[Waterfall]]. Gobindpur is {{cvt|20|km|mi}} from Belpahar.

==Places of interest==
The Koilighugar Waterfall, around {{cvt|200|ft|m}} in height, is in the [[Lakhanpur, Odisha|Lakhanpur]], near the village Kushmelbahal. The waterfall is in a rivulet named '''Ahiraj''' which originates from the 'Chhuikhanch' forest. After the waterfall, the rivulet flows westwards to merge into the  [[Mahanadi river]]. It is a picturesque beauty spot with its sylvan backdrop.

Inside the fall there is a [[lingam|Shivalingam]] known as ''Maheswarnath''. The lingam is submerged in water and is not ordinarily visible. For the benefit of the pilgrims, another Shivalingam has been created outside the waterfall.

Koilighugar has an annual fair on the occasion of Sivaratri.

'''Kuivasaari''' (''Torra Mjölö'' in [[Finland-Swedish|Swedish]]) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] island in the [[Gulf of Finland]], near [[Helsinki]].  The island gets its name, meaning 'dry island', from the fact that there is no fresh water on the island, and water is instead pumped from the nearby Isosaari island.

The whole island is a military installation and access for civilians is heavily restricted.  A number of [[coastal artillery]] guns are installed there, including some exceptionally heavy {{convert|12|inch|mm|0|adj=on|abbr=out}} pieces.  The island served as an important coastal artillery fort protecting the entrance to Helsinki harbour during the World Wars.

Kuivasaari is located some {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} out into the Gulf of Finland, due south of Helsinki city centre, and was for many years the outermost inhabited island in the Helsinki archipelago (now there is no permanent settlement based on the island).  It lies parallel to the Harmaja lighthouse, and the main shipping route into and out of Helsinki passes between the two.  In fair weather the city of Tallinn, in Estonia on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland is visible from the observation tower.

It only deals with modern times, thus the expansion of the [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Roman Empire]], and [[barbarian]] tribes into Africa is ignored.  A number of regions such as the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] and the [[Sahara Desert]] had no organized states. However King Leopold II of the Belgiums brutally exploited the people and resources of Congo.

This is a '''[[list of extinct languages]] of [[Europe]]''', languages which have undergone [[language death]], have no [[native speakers]] and no [[Historical language|spoken descendant]]. As the vast majority of Europeans speak [[Indo-European languages]], a result of the westward portion of the prehistoric [[Indo-European migrations]], the bulk of the [[Paleo-European languages|indigenous languages of Europe]] became extinct thousands of years ago without leaving any record of their existence as they were superseded by [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] Indo-European languages. A small minority of these extinct languages, however, survived long enough to be [[Attested language|attested]].

On the other hand, many European Indo-European languages themselves, such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]], have also become extinct. In some cases however, it is not known whether a language has a spoken descendant or not. For example, because of the uncertain origin of the [[Albanian language]] — aside from its being an Indo-European language — and because little remains of the ancient languages in question, it is disputed whether [[Dacian language|Dacian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] or [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] have a spoken descendant, Albanian. And because of the scarcity of the evidence, it is not known whether [[Basque language|Basque]] is a descendant of the [[Aquitanian language]].

Although the [[Pomeranian language]] has a spoken descendant, the [[Kashubian language]], the other dialects of Pomeranian are extinct.

[[File:Postleitzahlen oesterreich.svg|thumb|320px|Austrian postal code areas]]
'''[[Postal code]]s in [[Austria]]''' consist of four digits. They were introduced on 1 January 1966. Each code denotes a [[post office]] of the ''[[Österreichische Post]]'' company.

The first digit identifies a geographic delivery area within Austria. The second identifies a routing area. The third defines the route the mail takes either with the car/truck or with the train. The fourth stands for the post office outlet in the routing city.

==Geographic delivery areas==
The geographic delivery area sometimes coincides with the [[States of Austria|state]], as shown in the table below. There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, the [[market town]] of [[Weyer, Austria|Weyer]] has a postal code of 3335, but is situated in [[Upper Austria]] and not in [[Lower Austria]], as the postal code would suggest. However, it is served from a Lower Austrian mail distribution centre. The [[Styria]]n village of Tauchen am Wechsel, part of the [[Pinggau]] municipality has the [[Burgenland]]ian post code 7421, as in the 1966 introduction it was confused with Tauchen near [[Mariasdorf]].

In the Austrian capital [[Vienna]], the second and third digit describe the [[Districts of Vienna|district]] within the city (i.e. 1100: 10th district &amp;ndash; [[Favoriten]]). The [[Vienna International Airport]], officially located in [[Schwechat]], Lower Austria has its own postal code 1300; the [[Vienna International Centre]] (UNO City) in the Vienna [[Donaustadt]] district has the postal code 1400. The post code 1500 is used for [[military mail]] by the [[United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] units of the [[Austrian Armed Forces]].

The municipalities of [[Mittelberg]] in [[Kleinwalsertal]], [[Vorarlberg]], and [[Jungholz]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] have both Austrian and [[Postal codes in Germany|German postal codes]], as they are served by the ''[[Deutsche Post]]'' company.

Disney Channel's "In Concert" series offers viewers a new perspective on up-and-coming artists, and spotlights their lives on- and off-stage. Each show features a specially taped live concert; documentary footage showing the artist pursuing personal and professional passions; and interviews with mentors, friends and family. Most recently, Disney Channel taped an "In Concert" special with international pop sensations B-Witched and Five. The four ladies of B-Witched and the five heartthrobs of Five will star in their first television special, premiering March 27, 1999, 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/PT. Previously, Disney Channel teamed Shawn Colvin, Tatyana Ali and 'N Sync for "Holidays in Concert." Hosted by Shawn Colvin, "Holidays in Concert" featured a specially taped concert performance of favorite holiday music from Epcot at The Walt Disney World Resort, along with stories of family traditions and holiday memories shared by each artist. Past Disney Channel "In Concert" specials include "LeAnn Rimes in Concert," "Ray J in Concert with Brandy," "Jonny Lang in Concert" and "Cleopatra in Concert." "'N Sync in Concert" was credited by RCA Records, 'N Sync's label, with significantly boosting sales of the group's self-titled album (Billboard 8/15/98).&lt;/ref&gt; || 1997 || 2001 || 2001–02 ||

This article constitutes a '''list of rocket launch sites'''. Some of these sites are known as spaceports or cosmodromes. A single rocket launch is sufficient for inclusion in the table, as long as the site is properly documented through a reference. Missile locations with no launches are not included in the list. Proposed and planned sites and sites under construction are not included in the main tabulation, but may appear in condensed lists under the tables.

A shorter list of spaceports for human spaceflight and satellite launches is available in the article [[Spaceport]].

==Table specification==
===Sorting order===
* operational date;
* Countries in alphabetical order within a table;
* Launch sites within a country are sorted chronologically according to start of operations.
rocket names

===Column specification===
* Country – territory of the site (the organisation responsible for the launches may reside elsewhere, as indicated in the notes column;
* Location – Name of launch site (sometimes also province etc.)
* Coordinates – geographical coordinates
* Operational date – the period of years of launch activities
* Number of rocket launches – the total number of launches, including failed launches
* Heaviest rocket launched – total mass at lift-off
* Highest achieved altitude – height in km above launch site
* Notes – comments

[[File:Mt. Elbert.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Elbert]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Colorado|State of Colorado]].]]

The following sortable table lists the '''19 [[Summit|peaks]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[North America]] with at least {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic isolation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]].&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucania map.jpg|thumb|alt=Multi-color map of northern Italy|Map of ancient Lucania]]
'''Lucania''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Λευκανία|Leukanía}}) was an ancient area of [[Southern Italy]]. It was the land of the [[Lucanians|Lucani]], an [[Oscan]] people. It extended from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. It bordered with [[Samnium]] and [[Campania]] in the north, [[Apulia]] in the east, and [[Bruttium]] in the south-west, at the tip of the peninsula which is now called [[Calabria]]. It thus comprised almost all the modern region of [[Basilicata]], the southern part of the [[Province of Salerno]] (the [[Cilento]] area) and a northern portion of the [[Province of Cosenza]]. The precise limits were the river [[Silarus (Sele)|Silarus]] in the north-west, which separated it from Campania, and the [[Bradanus]], which flows into the Gulf of Taranto, in the east. The lower tract of the river [[Lao (river)|Laus]], which flows from a ridge of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the Tyrrhenian Sea in an east-west direction, marked part of the border with Bruttium.

==Geography==
Almost the whole area is occupied by the [[Apennine Mountains]], which here are an irregular group of lofty masses. The main ridge approaches the western sea, and continues from the lofty knot of mountains on the frontiers of [[Samnium]], in a mostly southerly direction, to within a few miles of the [[Gulf of Policastro]]. From then on it is separated from the sea by only a narrow interval until it enters [[Bruttium]]. Just within the frontier of Lucania rises [[Monte Pollino]], {{convert|7325|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the highest peak in the southern [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. The mountains descend in a much more gradual slope to the coastal plain of the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. Thus the rivers which flow to the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] are of little importance compared with those that descend towards the Gulf of Tarentum. Of these the most important are the Bradanus ([[Bradano]]), the Casuentus ([[Basento]]), the Aciris ([[Agri River|Agri]]), and the [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]] ([[Sinni (river)|Sinni]]). The [[Crati|Crathis]], which forms at its mouth the southern limit of the province, belongs almost wholly to the territory of the [[Bruttii]], but it receives a tributary, the [[Sybaris]] (Coscile), from the mountains of Lucania. The only considerable stream on the western side is the Silarus ([[Sele River|Sele]]), which constitutes the northern boundary, and has two important tributaries in the Calor ([[Calore Lucano]] or Calore Salernitano) and the Tanager ([[Tanagro]] or Negro) which joins it from the south.

==Etymology==
There are several hypotheses on the origin of the name Lucania, inhabited by [[Lucani (ancient people)|Lucani]], an [[Oscan|Osco-Samnite]] population from [[central Italy]]. Lucania might be derived from Greek λευκός, ''leukos'' meaning "white", cognate of Latin ''lux'' ("light"). According to another hypothesis, Lucania might be derived from Latin word ''lucus'' meaning "[[Sacred grove|sacred wood]]" (cognate of ''lucere''), or from Greek λύκος, ''lykos'' meaning "[[wolf]]".

==History==
[[File:Grab der Granatäpfel heimkehrender Ritter.jpg|thumb|A mounted [[Lucanians|Lucani]] warrior, fresco from a tomb of [[Paestum]], Italy, c. 360 BC]]
The district of Lucania was so called from the people bearing the name [[Lucani (ancient people)|Lucani]] (Lucanians) by whom it was conquered about the middle of the 5th century BC. Before that period it was included under the general name of [[Oenotria]], which was applied by the Greeks to the southernmost portion of Italy. The mountainous interior was occupied by the tribes known as [[Oenotrians]] and [[Choni people|Choni]], while the coasts on both sides were occupied by powerful [[Greek colonies]] which doubtless exercised a protectorate over the interior (see [[Magna Graecia]]). The Lucanians were a southern branch of the [[Samnium|Samnite]] or [[Sabellic]] race, who spoke the [[Oscan]] language. They had a democratic constitution save in time of war, when a [[dictator]] was chosen from among the regular magistrates. A few [[Oscan inscription]]s survive, mostly in [[Greek character]]s, from the 4th or 3rd century BC, and some [[coin]]s with Oscan legends of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Robert Seymour Conway|Conway]], ''Italic Dialects'', p. II sqq.; [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], ''C.I.L.'' x. p. 2I; [[Hermann Roehl|Roehl]], Inscriptiones Graecae Antiquissimae, 547.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lucanians gradually conquered the whole country (with the exception of the Greek towns on the coast) from the borders of [[Samnium]] and [[Campania]] to the southern extremity of [[Italy]]. Subsequently the inhabitants of the peninsula, now known as [[Calabria]], broke into insurrection, and under the name of [[Bruttians]] established their independence, after which the Lucanians became confined within the limits already described. After this we find them engaged in hostilities with the [[Taranto|Tarentines]], and with [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander]], king of [[Epirus]], who was called in by that people to their assistance, 334 BC. In 298 BC (Livy x. II seq.) they made alliance with [[Rome]], and Roman influence was extended by the colonies of [[Venusia]] (291 BC), [[Paestum]] (273), and above all [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (272). Subsequently they were sometimes in alliance, but more frequently engaged in hostilities, during the [[Samnite wars]]. On the landing of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] in Italy (281 BC) they were among the first to declare in his favor, and found themselves exposed to the resentment of Rome when the departure of Pyrrhus left his allies at the mercy of the Romans. After several campaigns they were reduced to subjection (272 BC). Notwithstanding this they espoused the cause of [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]] (216 BC), and their territory during several campaigns was ravaged by both armies. The country never recovered from these disasters, and under the Roman government fell into decay, to which the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], in which the Lucanians took part with the [[Samnites]] against [[Rome]] (90–88 BC) gave the finishing stroke. In the time of [[Strabo]] the Greek cities on the coast had fallen into insignificance, and owing to the decrease of population and cultivation the malaria began to obtain the upper hand. The few towns of the interior were of no importance. A large part of the province was given up to pasture, and the mountains were covered with forests, which abounded in wild boars, bears and wolves. There were some fifteen independent communities, but none of great importance.

For administrative purposes under the [[Roman empire]], Lucania was always united with the district of the Bruttii, a practice continued by [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html ''Cassiodorus'': Chapter 1, Backgrounds and Some Dates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510135935/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html |date=2005-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two together constituted the third region of [[Augustus]].

==Cities and towns==

The towns on the east coast were [[Metapontum]], a few miles south of the Bradanus; [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]], at the mouth of the Aciris; and Sins, on the river of the same name. Close to its southern frontier stood [[Sybaris]], which was destroyed in 510 BC, but subsequently replaced by [[Thurii]]. On the west coast stood Posidonia, known under the Roman government as [[Paestum]]; below that came Elea ([[Velia]] under the Romans), [[Policastro Bussentino|Pyxus]], called by the Romans Buxentum, and [[Laüs]], near the frontier of the province towards [[Bruttium]]. Of the towns of the interior the most considerable was Potentia, still called [[Potenza]]. To the north, near the frontier of Apulia, was [[Banzi|Bantia]] ([[Acerenza|Aceruntia]] belonged more properly to Apulia); while due south from Potentia was [[Grumentum]], and still farther in that direction were Nerulum and Muranum. In the upland valley of the Tanagrus were [[Atena Lucana|Atina]], [[Forum Popilii]] and Consilinum (near [[Sala Consilina]]); Eburi ([[Eboli]]) and Volceii ([[Buccino]]), though to the north of the [[Sele River|Silarus]], were also included in Lucania. The [[Via Popilia]] traversed the district from north to south, entering it at the northwestern extremity; the [[Via Herculia]], coming southwards from the [[Via Appia]] and passing through Potentia and Grumentum, joined the [[Via Popilia]] near the southwestern edge of the district: while another nameless road followed the east coast and other roads of less importance ran west from Potentia to the [[Via Popilia]], northeast to the [[Via Appia]] and east from Grumentum to the coast at Heraclea.

==Later use==
{{seealso|Theme of Lucania}}
The modern name [[Basilicata]] originates from the 10th century AD, when the area was under [[Byzantine]] control. The region was renamed and divided into Eastern and Western Lucania (''Lucania Orientale'' and ''Lucania Occidentale'') for a short period of time during the [[Carbonari|Carbonari revolution]] of 1820–21, and from the latter half of the 19th century there was campaigning to reinstate the name. The change was made in 1932, in accordance with the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime's]] appropriation of symbols from the Roman Empire, and was thus undone shortly after the war, in 1947. Lucania is still in vernacular use as a synonym to Basilicata.&lt;ref&gt; ''Guida d'Italia: Basilicata, Calabria''. Touring club italiano (1980) {{ISBN|978-88-365-0021-5}} p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AUT 0345.JPG|thumb|250px|A mile marker on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Road]] giving distances from many places]]
[[File:Milestone@Penrhosgarnedd 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Slate milestone near [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]], [[Wales]]]]

A '''milestone''' is one of a series of [[number]]ed markers placed along a [[road]] or [[border|boundary]] at intervals of one mile or occasionally, parts of a mile. They are typically located at the side of the road or in a [[Central reservation|median or central reservation]]. They are alternatively known as '''mile markers''', '''mileposts''' or '''mile posts''' (sometimes abbreviated '''MPs'''). '''Mileage''' is the distance along the road from a fixed commencement point. Commonly the term "milestone" may also refer to markers placed at other distances, such as every kilometre.

Milestones are installed to provide [[Linear referencing|reference points]] along the road. This can be used to reassure [[travel]]lers that the proper path is being followed, and to indicate either [[distance]] travelled or the remaining distance to a destination. Such references are also used by maintenance engineers and emergency services to direct them to specific points where their presence is required. This term is sometimes used to denote a location on a road even if no physical sign is present. This is useful for [[incident report|accident reporting]] and other record keeping (e.g., "an accident occurred at the 13 mile mark" even if the road is only marked with a stone once every 10 miles).

== History ==

=== Roman Empire ===
[[File:Geira Milha XXIX caminho.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] milestone XXIX on Via Romana XVIII – the road linking the [[Iberia]]n cities of [[Braga|Bracara Augusta]] and [[Astorga, Spain|Asturica Augusta]]]]
[[File:Milestone kirkby thore.JPG|thumb|250px|Roman milestone on the former [[A66 road|A66]] between [[Kirkby Thore]] and [[Temple Sowerby]] (no inscription)]]
[[File:Kos Minar 03.jpg|thumb|250 px|Kos Minar (Mughal Milestone), [[National Zoological Park Delhi|Delhi Zoo]], [[New Delhi]], [[India]]]]
Milestones ([[Latin]]: ''Miliarium'') were originally [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[obelisk]]s – made from [[granite]], [[marble]], or whatever local stone was available – and later [[concrete]] posts. They were widely used by [[Roman Empire]] road builders and were an important part of any [[Roman road]] network: the distance travelled per day was only a few miles in some cases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Many Roman milestones only record the name of the reigning emperor without giving any placenames or distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Inscriptions of Britain. I: Inscriptions on stone |last=Collingwood |first=R. G.|year=1965 |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford |author2=Wright, R. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Roman milestones appeared on the [[Appian way]]. At the centre of Rome, the "[[Golden Milestone]]" was erected to mark the presumed centre of the empire: this milestone has since been lost. The Golden Milestone inspired the [[Zero Milestone]] in Washington, D.C., intended as the point from which all road distances in the United States should be reckoned. [[Odometer]]s were used to measure the Roman milestone spacing, most likely based on [[Ancient Greek Technology]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Byzantine Empire ===
A mile-marker monument, the [[Milion]], was erected in the early 4th century AD in [[Constantinople]]. It served as the starting point for measurement of distances for all the roads leading to the cities of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and had the same function as the [[Milliarium Aureum]] of [[Ancient Rome]]. The Milion survived intact until at least the late 15th century. Its fragments were discovered again in the late 1960s. A fragment is re-erected as a pillar.

=== Post-Medieval Europe ===
In [[Europe]], the distance measured typically starts at specified point within a [[city]] or [[town]], as many roads were named for the towns at either end. For example, in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], a plaque near the [[Eleanor cross]] at [[Charing Cross]] is the reference point from which distances from London to other towns and cities are measured. In the UK, milestones are especially associated with [[Turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom|former Turnpike roads]].

The British built many milestones on the [[Malta Colony|island of Malta]]. They consisted of large slabs of local hard rock and they were engraved with the distance to or from a particular location. Many of these were defaced in [[World War II]] to disorientate forces in a [[Operation Herkules|potential invasion]]. Despite this, a very small number of milestones still exist undefaced, and one of these is now in the [[Malta at War Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones salvaged and added to the new museum's collection |url=http://www.maltaatwarmuseum.com/milestones-salvaged-and-added-to-the-new-museums-collection.html |website=Wirt Artna |accessdate=7 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907124041/http://www.maltaatwarmuseum.com/milestones-salvaged-and-added-to-the-new-museums-collection.html |archivedate=7 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Details|Kos Minar}}
The '''Kos Minars''' or ''Mile Pillars'' are medieval milestones that were made by the 16th-century [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Ruler [[Sher Shah Suri]] and later on by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors. These Minars were erected by the Mughal Emperors on the main highways across the empire to mark the distance.
The Kos Minar is a solid round pillar, around {{convert|30|ft}} in height that stands on a masonry platform built with bricks and plastered over with lime. Though not architecturally very impressive, being milestones, they were an important part of communication and travel in a large empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Monumental' treasure house |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-12/ludhiana/28193174_1_archaeologists-city-bus-monuments |date=12 July 2009| accessdate = 2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kos (unit)|Kos]] is an ancient [[India]]n unit of distance. It can represent either a distance of approximately {{convert|1.8|km}} or {{convert|3.2|km}}. [[Minaret|Minar]] is a Persian word for tower. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]] recorded in ''[[Akbar Nama]]'' that in the year 1575 AD, [[Akbar]] issued an order that at every Kos on the way from Agra to Ajmer, a pillar or a minar should be erected for the comfort of the travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/minar_kos.html | title=Kos Minar | publisher=University of Alberta | accessdate=12 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A milestone on the highway |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/A-milestone-on-the-highway/Article1-951130.aspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130923040501/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/A-milestone-on-the-highway/Article1-951130.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 September 2013 |first1=Nivedita |last1=Khandekar |date=27 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern highways ==
{{main article|Highway location marker}}
The historical term ''milestone'' is still used today, even though the "stones" are typically metal [[highway location marker]]s and in most countries use kilometres and metres rather miles and yards. Also found today are more closely spaced signs containing fractional numbers, and signs along railways, beaches and canals.

=== Australia ===
[[Metrication in Australia]] caused the former mile markers to be gradually replaced with 10&amp;nbsp;km markers on highways and country roads, and even these have been removed from most major highways with distances to several towns ahead being shown on signboards. Some mile markers are retained as curiosities (see gallery).

=== Canada ===
Usage varies by province, as highways are under provincial jurisdiction. In Alberta, for example, kilometre markers are green metal signs with white lettering, and are generally placed every 4&amp;nbsp;km starting at the last major intersection to the south or west, depending on whether the route runs north-south or east-west.

=== India ===
[[File:Road Stone Payyambalam.jpg|thumbnail|Milestone in Payyambalam beach, [[Kannur]], India.]]
Milestones on [[Indian highways]] typically have white backgrounds with yellow tops (on national highways) or green tops (on state highways). The names of cities and distances are painted in black. The names of the nearest towns and cities are written along with distance in kilometres. On undivided highways, both sides of the milestones are used, telling the distance to the nearest cities in each direction. The highway number is written on the head of the milestone. The sum of the distances of two nearest cities in each direction from the milestone is listed on the side.

=== Philippines ===
[[File:Philippine highway marker.jpg|thumb|left|Example of a milestone in the Philippines]]
Milestones in the Philippines are found in [[Highways in the Philippines|highways]], one kilometer apart, and are found in pairs, one on each side of the road. These are short yellow concrete posts, with two labels on a white background, written in black. On top is a large "K" (or "KM"), and a number, referencing the distance from the [[Kilometre Zero#Philippines|Kilometer Zero]]. While the national Kilometer Zero is in [[Rizal Park]], each major island has its own Kilometer Zero. The milestones on the [[Luzon]] mainland reference Rizal Park's Kilometer Zero.

The second label is a letter, standing for the first letter of the next town if you're traveling on that direction, then the distance in kilometers, from the town. In the example to the left, a milestone in [[Ortigas Avenue]] in [[Pasig]] says it is {{convert|14|km|mi|sp=us}} from Rizal Park, and {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} from [[Cainta]]. On the other side, the milestone there says it's 
{{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} from [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]].

Most milestones only have labels on one side, facing the driver. Others have labels on all four sides.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Driver location sign}}
In the UK, [[driver location signs]] are placed every {{convert|500|m|yd}} along each side of [[List of motorways in the United Kingdom|motorways]], and along some other major roads. They were first introduced in 2003, and they complement distance marker posts, small roadside posts at {{convert|100|m|yd}} intervals, used for road maintenance and administrative purposes. Both types of sign display a unique location number. The number is given without units but is the distance in kilometres from a designated datum location for the road.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/16049.htm |archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120810121037/http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/16049.htm |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2012-08-10 |title = Driver Location Signs - Frequently Asked Questions |author=[[Highways Agency]] |accessdate = 2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{See also|California postmile|Reference marker (New York)}}
[[File:Intersection of the Bypass Highway and Van Giesen Street 6.jpg|thumb|250 px|Typical mile marker used in the United States]]
In the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], the numbers usually measure the distance to the southern or western [[U.S. state|state]] line, or the route's terminus, if the national southern or western terminus lies in that state. The numbering system for other [[highway]]s varies by state; most use a system mirroring that of the Interstate System, other states, such as [[Illinois]] and [[Kentucky]], use the [[county]] line as the [[zero mile marker]], while others, including [[Missouri]], do not sign mile-markers at all (except on Interstates). [[Arizona]] has a rather unique system, where a route's mileposts continue those from its original host. Often, the [[interchange (road)#Terminology|exits]] are numbered according to the nearest milepost, known as the [[mile-log#Distance-based numbers|mile-log]] system.  From the beginning of the Interstate system until the mid-2000s, most Interstate highways had markers every mile.  Since that time, many states have installed markers every 0.2 mile, and in some metro areas, every 0.1 mile.  Some historic and [[scenic route]]s – such as along the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] in [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] and the [[Overseas Highway]] of the [[Florida Keys]] – use mileposts to mark points of interest or (in the cases of many businesses along the Overseas Highway) as a portion of their address.

=== Myanmar ===
[[File:Naypyitaw Tollbooth.jpg|right|thumb|Present-day use of furlongs on a highway sign near [[Yangon]]]]
[[File:Milepost 358-6 on Yangon-Mandalay Expressway.JPG|right|thumb|Mileposts on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway use miles followed by furlongs]]
In [[Myanmar]], [[furlong]]s are currently used in conjunction with miles to indicate distances on highway signs. Mileposts on the [[Yangon-Mandalay Expressway]] use miles and furlongs.

=== Zimbabwe ===
[[Zimbabwean]] milestones are constructed of cast concrete painted white with the kilometre distance indented and painted black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://poultney.rhodesiana.com/MortsTree.html
|title = Poultney Family - Mort's Tree
|quote = The kilometre marker near the tree - distance from Bulawayo [Photo caption]
|accessdate = 13 April 2012
|date=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no distinction between state and national road-sign markings. They were originally sited every 500 metres by the [[Rhodesian]] Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic, starting at zero from the largest town or city. In 1980 the Zimbabwean government began placing new markers 1&amp;nbsp;km apart and damaged or missing half kilometre markers were no longer replaced.

== Railway mileposts ==
[[File:railmileposts.jpg|thumb|250px|Old and new railway mileposts in the UK, indicating a distance of 33¼ miles from the zero point]]
The [[Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1845/cukpga_18450020_en_6#pb9-l1g104

| title = 94 Milestones
| accessdate = 2008-11-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; compels UK railway companies to provide their passengers with a means of determining the distance travelled (fares were set by distance at this time). Section 94 states:

"The company shall cause the length of the railway to be measured, and milestones, posts, or other conspicuous objects to be set up and maintained along the whole line thereof, at the distance of one quarter of a mile from each other, with numbers or marks inscribed thereon denoting such distances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.railsigns.co.uk/sect26page1/sect26page1.html
| work = Railway Signs and Signals of Great Britain
| title = Section 26: Distance Markers
| accessdate = 2007-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar laws were passed in other countries. On the modern railway, these historical markers are still used as infrastructure reference points. At many points, the distances shown on the markers are based upon points no longer on the network – for example, distances measured via a closed line or from a junction which has subsequently been moved. Whole mileposts are usually supplemented by half and quarter posts. Structure signs often include the mileage to a fair degree of precision; in the UK, a [[chain (unit)|chain]] is the usual accuracy. In the U.S. and Canada, miles are "decimalized", so that, for example, there may be a "milepost 4.83" to mark a junction, crossing, bridge or tunnel.

In [[metrication|metricated]] areas, the equivalent is the "[[point kilométrique]]".

== Boundaries ==
{{main article|Boundary marker}}
[[Surveying|Surveyors]] place milestones to mark the boundaries between the jurisdictions separated by borders. A series of such boundary markers exists at one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) intervals along the [[Boundary Stones (District of Columbia)|borders of the District of Columbia]] in the [[United States]].

'''Mirovia''' or '''Mirovoi''' (from [[Russian language|Russian]] мировой, ''mirovoy'', meaning "global") was a [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] [[superocean]] which may have been a global [[ocean]] surrounding the [[supercontinent]] [[Rodinia]] in the [[Neoproterozoic|Neoproterozoic Era]], about 1 billion to 750 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMenamin |first=Mark A. |first2=Dianna L. |last2=McMenamin |year=1990 |chapter=The Rifting of Rodinia |title=The Emergence of Animals |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-06647-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirovia may be essentially identical to, or the precursor of, the hypothesized [[Pan-African Ocean]], which followed the [[rift]]ing of Rodinia. The [[Panthalassa]] (proto-[[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]) Ocean developed in the Neoproterozoic Era by [[subduction]] at the expense of the global Mirovia ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=Christopher McA |last2=Pisarevsky |first2=Sergei A. |chapter=Rodinia to Gondwanaland: Growth of the Pacific Ocean and Destruction of the Mozambique and Brazilide Oceans |title=GSA Conference, Earth System Processes - Global Meeting (June 24-28, 2001), abstract |url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2001ESP/finalprogram/abstract_8026.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologic evidence suggests that the middle Neoproterozoic, the [[Cryogenian]] period, was an extreme [[ice age]] so intense that Mirovia may have been completely frozen to a depth of 2-km. This is part of the [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis.{{fact|date=October 2015}}

'''Mount Scenery''' is a [[potentially active volcano]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]]. Its [[lava dome]] forms the summit of the [[Saba]] island [[stratovolcano]]. At an elevation of {{convert|887|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp |vnum=1600-01= |title=Saba |accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the highest point in both the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and, since the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] on 10 October 2010, the highest point in the [[Netherlands]] proper.

The Saba volcano is potentially dangerous; the latest eruption was in or around the year 1640 and included explosions and [[pyroclastic flows]].

'''{{transl|ar|ALA|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī}}'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;There is some confusion in the literature on whether al-Khwārizmī's full name is {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|ابو عبد الله محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي}} {{transl|ar|ALA|Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī}} or {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|ابو جعفر محمد بن موسی الخوارزمی}} {{transl|ar|ALA|Abū Ja‘far Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī}}. Ibn Khaldun notes in his encyclopedic work: "The first who wrote upon this branch [algebra] was Abu ‘Abdallah al-Khowarizmi, after whom came Abu Kamil Shoja‘ ibn Aslam." (MacGuckin de Slane). (Rosen 1831, pp. xi–xiii) mentions that "[Abu Abdallah Mohammed ben Musa] lived and wrote under the caliphate of Al Mamun, and must therefore be distinguished from Abu Jafar Mohammed ben Musa, likewise a mathematician and astronomer, who flourished under the Caliph Al Motaded (who reigned A.H. 279–289, A.D. 892–902)." In the introduction to his critical commentary on Robert of Chester's Latin translation of al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'', L.C. Karpinski notes that Abū Ja‘far Muḥammad ibn Mūsā refers to the eldest of the [[Banū Mūsā]] brothers. Karpinski notes in his review on (Ruska 1917) that in (Ruska 1918): "Ruska here inadvertently speaks of the author as Abū Ga‘far M. b. M., instead of Abū Abdallah M. b.

==Life==
Few details of al-Khwārizmī's life are known with certainty.  He was born into a [[Persian people|Persian]]&lt;ref name="Persian"/&gt; family and [[Ibn al-Nadim]] gives his birthplace as [[Khwarezm]]&lt;ref&gt;Cristopher Moore and Stephan Mertens, ''The Nature of Computation'', (Oxford University Press, 2011), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Khorasan]] (modern [[Khiva]], [[Xorazm Region]], [[Uzbekistan]]).

[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] gives his name as Muḥammad ibn Musá al-Khwārizmiyy al-[[Majus|Majūsiyy]] al-Quṭrubbaliyy ({{lang|ar|محمد بن موسى الخوارزميّ المجوسـيّ القطربّـليّ|rtl=yes}}). The [[epithet]] ''al-Qutrubbulli'' could indicate he might instead have come from Qutrubbul (Qatrabbul),&lt;ref&gt;"Iraq After the Muslim Conquest", by [[Michael G. Morony]], {{isbn|1593333153}} (a 2005 facsimile from the original 1984 book), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uhjSiRAwGuEC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=qatrabbul#v=onepage&amp;q=qatrabbul&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;145 ]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[viticulture]] district near Baghdad. However,  Rashed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rashed | first = Roshdi | contribution = al-Khwārizmī's Concept of Algebra | editor-last=Zurayq | editor-first=Qusṭanṭīn | editor2-last=Atiyeh | editor2-first=George Nicholas | editor3-last=Oweiss | editor3-first=Ibrahim M. | title = Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses : Studies in Honor of Constantine K.

{{quote|There is no need to be an expert on the period or a philologist to see that al-Tabari's second citation should read "Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwārizmī ''and'' al-Majūsi al-Qutrubbulli," and that there are two people (al-Khwārizmī and al-Majūsi al-Qutrubbulli) between whom the letter ''wa'' [Arabic '{{lang|ar|و|rtl=yes}}' for the conjunction '[[wikt:و#Etymology 2|and]]'] has been omitted in an early copy. This would not be worth mentioning if a series of errors concerning the personality of al-Khwārizmī, occasionally even the origins of his knowledge, had not been made. Recently, [[Gerald J. Toomer|G.J. Toomer]] ... with naive confidence constructed an entire fantasy on the error which cannot be denied the merit of amusing the reader.}}

Regarding al-Khwārizmī's religion, Toomer writes:
{{quote|Another epithet given to him by al-Ṭabarī, "al-Majūsī," would seem to indicate that he was an adherent of the old [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian religion]]. This would still have been possible at that time for a man of Iranian origin, but the pious preface to al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'' shows that he was an orthodox [[Muslim]], so al-Ṭabarī's epithet could mean no more than that his forebears, and perhaps he in his youth, had been Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="toomer"&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ibn al-Nadim|Ibn al-Nadīm]]'s ''Kitāb al-Fihrist'' includes a short biography on al-Khwārizmī together with a list of the books he wrote. Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work in the period between 813 and 833. After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Baghdad became the centre of scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists from as far as [[China]] and [[India]] traveled to this city, as did al-Khwārizmī {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. He worked in Baghdad as a scholar at the House of Wisdom established by [[Al-Ma'mun|Caliph al-Ma’mūn]], where he studied the sciences and mathematics, which included the translation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]] scientific manuscripts.

[[Douglas Morton Dunlop]] suggests that it may have been possible that Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī was in fact the same person as Muḥammad ibn Mūsā ibn Shākir, the eldest of the three [[Banū Mūsā]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunlop|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and [[cartography]] established the basis for innovation in algebra and [[trigonometry]]. His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations led to ''algebra'', a word derived from the title of his book on the subject, "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sharif.edu/~tabesh/math-education.pdf|title=Mathematics Education in Iran From Ancient to Modern|last= |first=|first2=|date=|website=|others=Shima Salehi ( Stanford University ), Yahya Tabesh ( Sharif University of Technology )|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' written about 820, was principally responsible for spreading the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]]. It was translated into Latin as ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. Al-Khwārizmī, rendered as (Latin) ''Algoritmi'', led to the term "algorithm".

Some of his work was based on Persian and [[Babylonia]]n astronomy, Indian numbers, and [[Greek mathematics]].

Al-Khwārizmī systematized and corrected [[Ptolemy]]'s data for Africa and the Middle East. Another major book was ''Kitab surat al-ard'' ("The Image of the Earth"; translated as Geography), presenting the coordinates of places based on those in the [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'' of Ptolemy]] but with improved values for the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Asia, and Africa.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

He also wrote on mechanical devices like the &lt;!-- [[clock]], al-Biruni? --&gt;[[astrolabe]] and [[sundial]]. &lt;!-- His other contributions include tables of [[trigonometric function]]s, refinements in the geometric representation of [[conic sections]], and aspects of the [[calculus of two errors]]. More al-Biruni? al-Khwārizmī's made a table of sien values. --&gt;

He assisted a project to determine the circumference of the Earth and in making a world map for [[al-Ma'mun]], the caliph, overseeing 70 geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-30|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045366|title=al-Khwarizmi|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in the 12th century, his works spread to Europe through Latin translations, it had a profound impact on the advance of mathematics in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'' ({{lang-ar|الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة}} {{transl|ar|ALA|al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-jabr wal-muqābala}}) is a mathematical book written approximately 820 CE. The book was written with the encouragement of [[Al-Ma'mun|Caliph al-Ma'mun]] as a popular work on calculation and is replete with examples and applications to a wide range of problems in trade, surveying and legal inheritance.&lt;ref name=Algebra_1831_translation_rosen&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "algebra" is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations ({{transl|ar|ALA|al-jabr}}, meaning "restoration", referring to adding a number to both sides of the equation to consolidate or cancel terms) described in this book. The book was translated in Latin as ''Liber algebrae et almucabala'' by [[Robert of Chester]] ([[Segovia]], 1145) hence "algebra", and also by [[Gerard of Cremona]]. A unique Arabic copy is kept at Oxford and was translated in 1831 by F. Rosen. A Latin translation is kept in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karpinski, L.C.|date=1912|title=History of Mathematics in the Recent Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica|journal=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|volume=35|issue=888|pages=29–31|ref=harv|authorlink=L.

It provided an exhaustive account of solving polynomial equations up to the second degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B.|last=Boyer|authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer|title=A History of Mathematics|edition=Second|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|date=1991|chapter=The Arabic Hegemony|page=228|isbn=978-0471543978}}
{{quote|"The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization — respects in which neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed the fundamental methods of "reduction" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc="The Arabic Hegemony" p.&amp;nbsp;229}} "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing" — that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khwārizmī's method of solving linear and quadratic equations worked by first reducing the equation to one of six standard forms (where ''b'' and ''c'' are positive integers)
* squares equal roots (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''bx'')
* squares equal number (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c'')
* roots equal number (''bx'' = ''c'')
* squares and roots equal number (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' = ''c'')
* squares and number equal roots (''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c'' = ''bx'')
* roots and number equal squares (''bx'' + ''c'' = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

by dividing out the coefficient of the square and using the two operations {{transl|ar|ALA|al-jabr}} ({{lang-ar|الجبر}} "restoring" or "completion") and {{transl|ar|ALA|al-muqābala}} ("balancing"). {{transl|ar|ALA|Al-jabr}} is the process of removing negative units, roots and squares from the equation by adding the same quantity to each side. For example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to 5''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40''x''. {{transl|ar|ALA|Al-muqābala}} is the process of bringing quantities of the same type to the same side of the equation. For example, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;14 = ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5 is reduced to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9 = ''x''.

The above discussion uses modern mathematical notation for the types of problems which the book discusses. However, in al-Khwārizmī's day, most of this notation [[History of mathematical notation|had not yet been invented]], so he had to use ordinary text to present problems and their solutions. For
example, for one problem he writes, (from an 1831 translation)
{{quote|If some one says: "You divide ten into two parts: multiply the one by itself; it will be equal to the other taken eighty-one times." Computation: You say, ten less a thing, multiplied by itself, is a hundred plus a square less twenty things, and this is equal to eighty-one things. Separate the twenty things from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots. Halve the roots; the moiety is fifty and a half. Multiply this by itself, it is two thousand five hundred and fifty and a quarter. Subtract from this one hundred; the remainder is two thousand four hundred and fifty and a quarter. Extract the root from this; it is forty-nine and a half. Subtract this from the moiety of the roots, which is fifty and a half. There remains one, and this is one of the two parts.&lt;ref name=Algebra_1831_translation_rosen /&gt;}}
In modern notation this process, with ''x'' the "thing" ({{lang|ar|شيء|rtl=yes}} ''shayʾ'') or "root", is given by the steps,
:&lt;math&gt;(10-x)^2=81 x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;100 + x^2 - 20 x = 81 x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+100=101 x&lt;/math&gt;

Let the roots of the equation be ''x'' = ''p'' and ''x = q''. Then &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{p+q}{2}=50\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;pq =100&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p-q}{2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{p+q}{2}\right)^2 - pq}=\sqrt{2550\tfrac{1}{4} - 100}=49\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
So a root is given by
:&lt;math&gt;x=50\tfrac{1}{2}-49\tfrac{1}{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;

Several authors have also published texts under the name of {{transl|ar|ALA|Kitāb al-jabr wal-muqābala}}, including [[Abū Ḥanīfa Dīnawarī]], [[Abū Kāmil Shujāʿ ibn Aslam]], Abū Muḥammad al-‘Adlī, Abū Yūsuf al-Miṣṣīṣī, [['Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk]], Sind ibn ‘Alī, Sahl ibn Bišr, and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]].

J.J. O'Conner and E.F. Robertson wrote in the ''[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]'':
{{quote|Perhaps one of the most significant advances made by [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arabic mathematics]] began at this time with the work of al-Khwarizmi, namely the beginnings of algebra. It is important to understand just how significant this new idea was. It was a revolutionary move away from the Greek concept of mathematics which was essentially geometry. Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed [[rational number]]s, [[irrational number]]s, geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as "algebraic objects". It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject. Another important aspect of the introduction of algebraic ideas was that it allowed mathematics to be applied to itself in a way which had not happened before.&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Khwarizmi|name=Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

R. Rashed and Angela Armstrong write:
{{quote|Al-Khwarizmi's text can be seen to be distinct not only from the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian tablets]], but also from [[Diophantus]]' ''[[Arithmetica]]''. It no longer concerns a series of [[problem solving|problems to be solved]], but an [[Rhetorical modes#Exposition|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study. On the other hand, the idea of an equation for its own sake appears from the beginning and, one could say, in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | date=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=978-0792325659 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Swiss-American historian of mathematics, [[Florian Cajori]], Al-Khwarizmi's algebra was different from the work of [[Indian mathematicians]], for Indians had no rules like the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;restoration&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;reduction&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorymathema02cajogoog|title=A History of Mathematics|last=[[Florian Cajori]]|publisher=Macmillan|year=1919|isbn=|location=|page=103|quote=That it came from Indian source is impossible, for Hindus had no rules like "restoration" and "reduction" .They were never in the habit of making all terms in an equation positive, as is done in the process of "restoration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the dissimilarity and significance of Al-Khwarizmi's algebraic work from that of Indian Mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is quite unlikely that al-Khwarizmi knew of the work of Diophantus, but he must have been familiar with at least the astronomical and computational portions of Brahmagupta; yet neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made use of syncopation or of negative numbers. Nevertheless, the ''Al-jabr'' comes closer to the elementary algebra of today than the works of either Diophantus or Brahmagupta, because the book is not concerned with difficult problems in indeterminant analysis but with a straight forward and elementary exposition of the solution of equations, especially that of second degree. The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization – respects in which neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics|title=A History of Mathematics|last=[[Carl Benjamin Boyer]]|publisher=|year=1968|isbn=|location=|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Dixit algorizmi.png|thumb|Page from a Latin translation, beginning with "Dixit algorizmi"]]

===Arithmetic===
Al-Khwārizmī's second major work was on the subject of arithmetic, which survived in a Latin translation but was lost in the original Arabic. The translation was most likely done in the 12th century by [[Adelard of Bath]], who had also translated the astronomical tables in 1126.

The Latin manuscripts are untitled, but are commonly referred to by the first two words with which they start: {{lang|la|Dixit algorizmi}} ("So said"), or {{lang|la|Algoritmi de numero Indorum}} ("al-Khwārizmī on the Hindu Art of Reckoning"), a name given to the work by [[Baldassarre Boncompagni]] in 1857. The original Arabic title was possibly {{transl|ar|Kitāb al-Jam‘ wat-Tafrīq bi-Ḥisāb al-Hind}}&lt;ref&gt;Ruska&lt;/ref&gt; ("The Book of Addition and Subtraction According to the Hindu Calculation").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berggren|1986|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khwārizmī's work on arithmetic was responsible for introducing the [[Arabic numerals]], based on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] developed in [[Indian mathematics]], to the Western world. The term "algorithm" is derived from the [[algorism]], the technique of performing arithmetic with Hindu-Arabic numerals developed by al-Khwārizmī. Both "algorithm" and "algorism" are derived from the [[List of Latinised names|Latinized forms]] of al-Khwārizmī's name, ''Algoritmi'' and ''Algorismi'', respectively.

===Astronomy===
[[File:Corpus Christ College MS 283 (1).png|thumb|Page from ''Corpus Christi College MS 283''. A Latin translation of al-Khwārizmī's ''Zīj''.]]

Al-Khwārizmī's {{transl|ar|Zīj al-Sindhind}}&lt;ref name="toomer" /&gt; ({{lang-ar|زيج السند هند}}, "[[zij|astronomical tables]] of ''[[Siddhanta#Astronomy|Siddhanta]]''"&lt;ref name="Thurston1996"&gt;{{citation|last=Thurston|first=Hugh|title=Early Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNpHjqxQQ9oC&amp;pg=PP204|year=1996|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0387948225|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of [[sine]] values.  This is the first of many Arabic ''[[Zij]]es'' based on the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomical]] methods known as the ''sindhind''.&lt;ref name=Kennedy-1956&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1956|pp= 26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains tables for the movements of the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the five [[planet]]s known at the time. This work marked the turning point in [[Islamic astronomy]]. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. &lt;!-- Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of non-traditional methods of study and calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dallal|1999|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; ?????? --&gt;

The original Arabic version (written c. 820) is lost, but a version by the Spanish astronomer [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (c. 1000) has survived in a Latin translation, presumably by [[Adelard of Bath]] (January 26, 1126).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1956|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four surviving manuscripts of the Latin translation are kept at the Bibliothèque publique (Chartres), the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris), the Biblioteca Nacional (Madrid) and the Bodleian Library (Oxford).
&lt;!-- FAILED VERIFICATION!!!
Al-Khwarizmi made several important improvements to the theory and construction of [[sundial]]s, which he inherited from his [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] predecessors. He made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations. His sundial was universal and could be observed from anywhere on the Earth. From then on, sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the [[Salah|time of prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|King|1999a|pp=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow square, an instrument used to determine the linear height of an object, in conjunction with the [[alidade]] for angular observations, was also invented by al-Khwārizmī in 9th-century [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = David A. | year = 2002 | title = A Vetustissimus Arabic Text on the Quadrans Vetus | url = | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 237–255 [238–239] |bibcode = 2002JHA....33..237K }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2010}}

Al-Khwārizmī's ''Zīj al-Sindhind'' also contained tables for the [[trigonometric functions]] of sines and cosine.&lt;ref name=Kennedy-1956/&gt; &lt;!-- CITATION NEEDED alongside the first tables for tangents. --&gt;A related treatise on [[spherical trigonometry]] is also attributed to him.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

[[File:Khiva.jpg|thumb|Statue of Al-Khwārizmī in his birth town [[Khiva]], [[Uzbekistan]].]]
Al-Khwārizmī's third major work is his {{transl|ar|Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ}} ({{lang-ar|كتاب صورة الأرض}}, "Book of the Description of the Earth"),{{refn|The full title is "The Book of the Description of the Earth, with its Cities, Mountains, Seas, All the Islands and the Rivers, written by Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwārizmī, according to the Geographical Treatise written by Ptolemy the Claudian",&lt;!--sic--&gt; although due to ambiguity in the word ''surah'' it could also be understood as meaning "The Book of the Image of the Earth" or even "The Book of the Map of the World".}} also known as his ''Geography'', which was finished in 833. It is a major reworking of [[Ptolemy]]'s 2nd-century ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-30|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Cartography.html|title=The history of cartography|publisher=[[GAP computer algebra system]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524092016/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Cartography.html|archivedate=2008-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one surviving copy of {{transl|ar|Kitāb Ṣūrat al-Arḍ}}, which is kept at the [[Strasbourg University Library]]. A Latin translation is kept at the [[Biblioteca Nacional de España]] in [[Madrid]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The book opens with the list of [[latitudes]] and [[longitudes]], in order of "weather zones", that is to say in blocks of latitudes and, in each [[weather]] zone, by order of longitude. As [[Paul Gallez]]{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} points out, this excellent system allows the deduction of many latitudes and longitudes where the only extant document is in such a bad condition as to make it practically illegible. Neither the Arabic copy nor the Latin translation include the map of the world itself; however, Hubert Daunicht was able to reconstruct the missing map from the list of coordinates. Daunicht read the latitudes and longitudes of the coastal points in the manuscript, or deduces them from the context where they were not legible. He transferred the points onto [[graph paper]] and connected them with straight lines, obtaining an approximation of the coastline as it was on the original map. He then does the same for the rivers and towns.&lt;ref&gt;Daunicht.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Khwārizmī corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate for the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]&lt;ref name=Kennedy-188&gt;Edward S. Kennedy, ''Mathematical Geography'', p.&amp;nbsp;188, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Canary Islands]] to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean; Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of [[longitude]], while al-Khwārizmī almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. He "also depicted the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s as [[Ocean|open bodies of water]], not land-locked [[sea]]s as Ptolemy had done."&lt;ref name=Covington&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Covington|journal=Saudi Aramco World, May–June 2007|date=2007|pages=17–21|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|title=The Third Dimension|accessdate=2008-07-06|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512022044/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|archive-date=2008-05-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī's [[Prime Meridian]] at the [[Fortunate Isles]] was thus around 10° east of the line used by Marinus and Ptolemy. Most medieval Muslim gazetteers continued to use al-Khwārizmī's prime meridian.&lt;ref name=Kennedy-188/&gt;
&lt;!--The majority of the placenames used by al-Khwārizmī match those of Ptolemy, [[Martellus]] and [[Behaim]]. The general shape of the coastline is the same between [[Taprobane]] and [[Cattigara]]. The Atlantic coast of the [[Dragon's Tail]], which does not exist in Ptolemy's map, is traced in very little detail on al-Khwārizmī's map, but is clear and precise on the [[Martellus map]] and on the later [[Behaim]] version.--&gt;

===Jewish calendar===
Al-Khwārizmī wrote several other works including a treatise on the [[Hebrew calendar]], titled {{transl|ar|Risāla fi istikhrāj ta’rīkh al-yahūd}} ({{lang-ar|رسالة في إستخراج تأريخ اليهود}}, "Extraction of the Jewish Era"). It describes the [[Metonic cycle]], a 19-year intercalation cycle; the rules for determining on what day of the week the first day of the month [[Tishrei]] shall fall; calculates the interval between the [[Anno Mundi]] or Jewish year and the [[Seleucid era]]; and gives rules for determining the mean longitude of the sun and the moon using the Hebrew calendar. Similar material is found in the works of [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] and [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref name="toomer" /&gt; &lt;!-- Folkerts / More in Kenedy / Only Sezgin mentions "risala fi" --&gt;

===Other works===
[[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s {{transl|ar|Kitāb al-Fihrist}}, an index of Arabic books, mentions al-Khwārizmī's {{transl|ar|Kitāb al-Taʾrīkh}} ({{lang-ar|كتاب التأريخ}}), a book of annals. No direct manuscript survives; however, a copy had reached [[Nusaybin]] by the 11th century, where its [[metropolitan bishop]], [[Mar]] Elyas bar Shinaya, found it. Elias's chronicle quotes it from "the death of the Prophet" through to 169 AH, at which point Elias's text itself hits a lacuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= LJ Delaporte |title=Chronographie de Mar Elie bar Sinaya |date=1910 |location=Paris |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Arabic manuscripts in Berlin, Istanbul, Tashkent, Cairo and Paris contain further material that surely or with some probability comes from al-Khwārizmī. The Istanbul manuscript contains a paper on sundials; the ''Fihrist'' credits al-Khwārizmī with {{transl|ar|Kitāb ar-Rukhāma(t)}} ({{lang-ar|كتاب الرخامة}}).&lt;!-- This is likely an error in the Fihirst (Dunlop) --&gt; Other papers, such as one on the determination of the direction of [[Mecca]], are on the [[spherical astronomy]].

Two texts deserve special interest on the [[morning width]] ({{transl|ar|Ma‘rifat sa‘at al-mashriq fī kull balad}}) and the determination of the [[azimuth]] from a height &lt;!-- Bestimmung des Azimuts aus der Höhe --&gt; ({{transl|ar|Ma‘rifat al-samt min qibal al-irtifā‘}}). &lt;!-- see Rosenfeld 1993 --&gt;

He also wrote two books on using and constructing [[astrolabe]]s.

'''The Municipal Art Society of New York (MAS)''', founded in 1893, is a non-profit membership organization that protects New York’s legacy spaces, encourages thoughtful planning and urban design, and advocates for inclusive neighborhoods across the five boroughs. 

January 2010, MAS relocated from its longtime home in the historic [[Villard Houses]] on 457 Madison Avenue to the equally famed [[Steinway Hall]]
on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|West 57th Street]] (across the street and east of [[Carnegie Hall]]).  In July 2014, MAS moved into the landmark Look Building at 488 Madison Avenue, across the street from its former Villard home.

==History==
[[File:Richard Morris Hunt memorial Fifth Avenue.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[Fifth Avenue]] memorial to architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], founder of the Municipal Art Society]]
MAS’s advocacy efforts have shaped the city a great deal since its inception in 1893. Some of their early accomplishments include passing the city's [[1916 Zoning Resolution|first zoning laws]], contributing input to the planning of the [[History of the IRT subway before 1918|city’s subway line]], and commissioning public art throughout the city.

By the 1950s, scores of notable Manhattan buildings were lost to redevelopment around the city, and the mission of MAS broadened to include historical preservation. In 1956, the Society successfully lobbied for the passage of the Bard Law, which for the first time allowed cities to take aesthetics, history, and cultural associations into account for zoning laws. The law, named after longtime MAS board member and chief advocate, Albert S. Bard, provided a legal foundation for the New York City Landmarks Law, enacted in 1965.

In 1965, public outrage over the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] and the Brokaw Mansion helped fuel the Society's mission towards preservation. With like-minded groups, they finally succeeded in establishing New York's [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and New York's Landmarks Law.

In 2001, after the demise of [[Trans World Airlines]], the original [[TWA Flight Center|Trans World Flight Center]], completed in 1962 and designed by [[Eero Saarinen]], fell into disuse. During this period, the Municipal Art Society succeeded in 2004 in nominating the facility to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]’s list of the 11 Most Endangered Places.&lt;ref name="mas1"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://mas.org/twa-terminal-named-as-one-of-the-nations-most-endangered-places/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, MAS released with the [[Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance]] a new documentary about the future of the New York waterfront titled [[City of Water]]. In September 2007, the Society opened a major exhibition about Jane Jacobs sponsored by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

==Urban Center==
The Municipal Art Society operates the '''Urban Center''', a gallery on [[Madison Avenue]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|first1=A.

The '''paradise garden''' is a form of [[garden]] of [[History of Iran|Old Iranian]] origin, specifically [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]. Originally denominated by a single noun denoting "a walled-in compound or [[garden]]", from "''pairi''" ("around") and "''daeza''" or "''diz''" ("wall", "brick", or "shape"), [[Xenophon]] Grecized the Persian phrase "''pairi-daeza''" into "''paradeisos''".&lt;ref name=hobhouse&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardens of Persia|author1=Penelope Hobhouse |author2=Erica Hunningher |author3=Jerry Harpur |publisher=Kales Press|year=2004|pages=7–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMFRyiAxZ6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Persian+garden&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Persian%20garden&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the [[hortus conclusus|enclosed garden]] is often referred to as the paradise garden because of additional [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] connotations of "paradise".{{which?|date=December 2018}}

==Qualities==
The essential qualities of the paradise garden derive from its original, arid or semi-arid homeland. The fundamental quality is enclosure of the cultivated area, which excludes the wildness of nature and includes cultivated and irrigated greenery, providing privacy and security. The most common design of the perimeter walls is that of a rectangle, and this forms one of its primary qualities.

Another common quality is the elaborate use of water, often in [[canal]]s, [[pond]]s, or [[rill]]s, sometimes in [[fountain]]s, and less often in [[waterfall]]s. The rectangular or rectilinear design is often extended to the water features, which typically quarter the garden. This design derives from or is echoed in that of the [[Garden of Eden]], which in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' is described as having a central spring that feeds four rivers, which each flow out into the world beyond.

Much of the use and symbolism of the paradise garden is derived from the [[Garden of Eden]]. It was designed to symbolize [[Immortality|eternal life]]. A tree with a spring issuing from its roots especially symbolises this. Additionally, the contrast of a formal garden design with the informality of freely growing plants is a recurring theme in many paradise gardens. Odor and fruit are important elements of this garden.

==Derived garden types==
The paradise garden is one of the few original and fundamental kinds of garden from which all gardens in history derive, sometimes in combinations. In its simplest form, the paradise garden consists of a formal, rectangular pool, having a flow just sufficient to give it movement, and with a dais from which to observe it. However, a pavilion provides more permanent shelter than the original tent. Strictly aligned, formally arranged trees, especially the ''chenar'' or ''[[Platanus]]'', provide shade.

The [[Achaemenid]] kings built paradise gardens within enclosed royal hunting parks, these being a different tradition of landscape gardening, which they inherited from the [[Assyria]]ns, for whom the ritual lion hunt was a rite that authenticated kingship, being far more than a mere sport.

Many of the [[Islamic garden|Islamic horticultural traditions]] and later [[Europe]]an traditions derive from that of the paradise garden. Examples of the paradise garden and its derivations are present in many of the [[History of gardening|historic gardens]] of [[Islam]]ic and [[Europe]]an nations. In the east, by way of the [[Persian garden]] it gave rise to the [[Mughal gardens]] of [[India]], a late example of which is the garden of the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]]. In the farthest west, it informed the paved and tiled courtyards, arcades, and pools and fountains of Moorish [[Andalusia]]. The fundamental design of the [[Gardens of Versailles]] in [[France]] almost replicates the paradise gardens of [[Pasargad]], and the gardens of the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] appear inspired by them. Another example is the [[Terraces (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í Terraces]] and [[Mansion of Bahjí]] on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Israel]], both of which have extensive gardens of intricate design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganbahai.org.il/en/learn-more/design-management/ Yael Hammerman: Distinctive Design of the Bahá’í Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shrub swamps''' — also called '''scrub swamps''' or '''buttonbush swamps''' — are a type of [[freshwater]] [[wetland]] [[ecosystem]] occurring in areas too wet to become [[swamp]]s (“true” or [[freshwater swamp forest]]), but too dry or too shallow to become [[marsh]]es. They are often considered transitional (“mid-successional”) between [[wet meadow]]s or [[fen]]s and conifer or hardwood swamps. 

By some classifications, shrub swamps must have at least 50% shrub cover and less than 20% tree cover. Other definitions specify large shrubs with small trees less than 35 feet in height. Creation of shrub swamps often follows a catastrophic event in a forested swamp (flood, cutting, fire, or windstorm).  Another route of development is via drained meadows and fens which progress to shrub swamps as a transitional state to forested swamps. 

==Development==
As a wet meadow matures it begins to fill in with vegetation and as this decomposes the soil thickens creating high spots ([[hummock]]s) above the water. Shrubs and small trees begin to grow on these. Shrub swamp water comes from run-off, streams and rivers and the water moves in and out of the swamp throughout the year. Consequently, they tend to be drier than wet meadows or forested swamps and permit water intolerant plant species to grow on the hummocks. Shrub swamps typically occur on organic soils, such as [[muck (soil)|muck]] and shallow [[peat soil]]s. Common plants found in the shrub swamps of [[North America]]  include [[alder]]s, [[willow]]s, [[elderberry]] and [[highbush blueberry]].

'''Sidi Bishr''' ({{lang-ar|سيدي بشر}}) is a neighborhood in the [[Montaza, Alexandria|Montaza District]] of [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. Established as a summering site by the Egyptian middle class before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Revolution of 1952]], it has since become one of the largest neighborhoods of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Whatever Happened to the Egyptians?

The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] Church of Saint Mark and Pope Peter—known locally as the Church of the Two Saints—located in Sidi Bishr, was the target of the [[2011 Alexandria bombing]] on 1 January 2011; formerly suspected to be the work of terrorist group the [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]], the Chief Prosecutor of Egypt has since accused the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Interior Ministry]] of carrying out the bombing.&lt;ref name="Interior"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ismail|first1=Farrag|title=Ex-minister suspected behind Alex church bombing|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/07/136723.html|agency=Al Arabiya News|date=February 7, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120182322/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/07/136723.html|archivedate=January 20, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2015, the police headquarters of [[Montaza]] District was the scene of five bombs which exploded, injuring many civilians. Years after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Revolution of 2011]], [[Muslim Brotherhood]] continue to respond to [[Morsi]]'s overthrow and to the crackdown on members of their organization.&lt;ref name="Bombs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bombs wound 10 civilians in Egypt's Alexandria|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2947451/Bombs-wound-10-civilians-Egypts-Alexandria.html|accessdate=14 November 2016|agency=Daily Mail (AFP)|date=February 10, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150815233828/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2947451/Bombs-wound-10-civilians-Egypts-Alexandria.html|archivedate=15 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slivers.PNG|thumb|Examples of sliver polygons]]
'''Sliver Polygons''' is a technical term of the field of [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] and describes unwanted small polygons resulting from layer intersection.

Sliver Polygons are small areas which result from spatial overlays of different GIS layers. Typically sliver polygons occur if slightly different (often manually) digitalized areas are spatially intersected. Sliver polygons often are characterised by long, elongated areas which do not represent an entity in reality and therefore need to be removed.

'''Southern Chile''' is an informal geographic term for any place south of the capital city, [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], or south of [[Biobío River]], the mouth of which is [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], about {{convert|200|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} south of Santiago. Generally cities like [[Temuco]] are considered to be located in the south despite being relatively close to the geographical center of Chile. This is mainly because mainland Chile ended in [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]] until the [[occupation of Araucanía]] (1860s-1880s). Similarly, the [[Southern Chile (wine region)|Southern Chile wine region]] is close to the geographic center of the country, encompassing wine-growing areas in the [[Bío Bío Region]] and [[Araucanía Region]].

Southern Chile may also refer to the [[Zona Sur]] region between Biobío and [[Chacao Channel]], which is often also called the [[Chilean Lake District]]. It may also refer to the [[Zona Austral]], also called the Extreme South.

'''''The Triangle''''' is a three-part US-British-German [[science fiction]] [[miniseries]] concerning the [[Bermuda Triangle]], which first aired on [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in the US December 5–7, 2005. It was written by [[Dean Devlin]], [[Bryan Singer]] and [[Rockne S. O'Bannon]], directed by  [[Craig R. Baxley]], and produced by special effects experts [[Volker Engel]] and [[Marc Weigert]], together with Kelly Van Horn, for Devlin's and Singer's production companies [[Electric Entertainment]] and [[Bryan Singer|Bad Hat Harry Productions]], the [[BBC]], and Engel's and Weigert's production company [[Uncharted Territory, LLC|Uncharted Territory]].

==Plot==
A shipping company employs a team of four people (a [[journalist]], a [[psychic]], a [[meteorology|meteorologist]], and an [[oceanography|oceanographer]]) to discover the secret of the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. With the help of a [[Greenpeace]] survivor and a tycoon they ultimately find out the truth about a high-tech underwater facility operated by the [[United States Navy]] and its relation to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]], determining that the Triangle is a [[wormhole]]. They close the Triangle, destroying it forever, but their efforts at closing the wormhole also disrupt time and cause the Triangle never to have existed in the first place, with everyone who was taken being returned and living out their lives as though nothing had ever happened. In the new Triangle-less [[chronology|timeline]] the only ones who know the Bermuda Triangle ever existed are the team members who destroyed it.

==Cast==
'''[[Sam Neill]] as Eric Benirall'''

Shipping tycoon Eric Benirall has  lost numerous ships in the Bermuda Triangle. Benirall is the architect of an historic expedition. He brings together a team of disparate experts by making them an offer they can't refuse – [[United States dollar|$US]] 5 million each to solve the mystery of the Triangle – but his intentions might not be all that they appear.  Stan (the psychic) eventually figures out the truth after seeing a man that looks just like Eric but with darker hair and a mustache in his reflection in a window with him: he has a twin brother named Winston who was taken by the Triangle and he wants to find him. In the first timeline he leads them to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] who is apparently a friend of his and the Secretary reveals what is believed to be the truth to them. In the second timeline when Howard traveled back in time several hours with the knowledge of the truth, he kicks them out when Winston is mentioned. Ultimately, he comes to his senses and leads a methane tanker out into the middle of the Triangle to stop the Navy. His efforts buy the others the time they need and the Triangle is destroyed.  In the new timeline, he apparently remembers the truth as he sends everyone the $5 million he promised. Also, he has his brother back.

'''[[Eric Stoltz]] as Howard Gregory Thomas'''

Howard Thomas is a reporter for a supermarket tabloid and an "expert" on the Bermuda Triangle. He is a hardcore cynic and a walking encyclopedia of fringe knowledge. Howard is recruited by Benirall to be the team's "ultimate arbiter", applying his experience with debunking the "[[paranormal]]" as a [[Litmus#Uses|Litmus Test]] for the rest of the team's theories. With a young daughter and an ex-wife ([[Shannon Esra]]) to whom he can barely afford to pay alimony, his personal life might be in even worse shape than his career. He is somewhat the true hero of the story because when he notices all is lost, he purposely follows Stan into the triangle and ends up in the past to change things. His efforts allow them to get where they need to be faster and the Triangle is destroyed. In the new timeline, he is still with his wife but they’re having marital problems and are probably headed for a divorce. This time he decides to work it out with her and presumably succeeds.

'''[[Bruce Davison]] as Stan Lathem'''

Stan Lathem is a man with genuine psychic abilities, but he has been reduced to hawking self-promotional tapes at New Age fairs to make a living. Low-key but deeply emotional, Stan is attuned to an entire invisible world filled with clues to the Triangle's origins. His intuition complements the rest of the team's literal and scientific approaches to discovery.  In the first timeline he survives a Triangle effect in which a bridge that he, Howard, and a scientist are crossing is erased from existence; but in the second timeline, when he (by mistake) and Howard (on purpose) are transported back to that point, he dies as Howard tries to save the scientist first and doesn't get to him in time.  He is revived in the new timeline when the Triangle is destroyed.

'''[[Michael E. Rodgers]] as Bruce Geller'''

[[Australia]]n native Bruce Geller is a thrill-seeking (and often reckless) [[professor]] of [[meteorology]] who often reveals his questionable moral fiber. Initially, he joins Benirall's team purely for the money, and he starts by looking for the fastest and easiest way to collect the $5 million payoff. He has a childlike enthusiasm for discovery, however, and his passion for the task at hand soon reveals itself. He is the one that ultimately discovers the truth about the Triangle and, after it is destroyed, ends up in a timeline where he has an injured leg and is married with children. The injury to his leg was the result of a bad stunt, even though the same stunt had worked in the previous timeline.

'''[[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Emily Myredith Patterson'''

Deep ocean resource engineer Emily Patterson has recently been fired from an off-shore drilling company for not backing off from safety concerns that would have shut down their operations. She is a brilliant woman with strong convictions but, despite her multiple degrees and expert knowledge of oceanography (among other subjects), it is financial need that drives her to accept Benirall's far-fetched proposal. She keeps encountering her birth mother while jumping between timelines. In one jump when they sit down to dinner together, Emily asks her mother why she would give her up for adoption when she was one week old. Her mother confessed she had almost given her up because she was alone and worried she couldn’t provide for a baby but, ultimately, she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Emily learns her mother's name through the vision and calls her once everything is over, but her mother does not know her. It is also shown in the new timeline where she has a boyfriend as well.

'''[[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Meeno Paloma'''

Meeno Paloma is a sailor, the sole survivor of a Triangle event that killed the crews of a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[whaling ship]] and a Greenpeace raft. He returns from his ordeal to a loving family, but one that is not quite as he remembers it. Confronted with a son he doesn't know and smaller details that aren't as they should be, Meeno is increasingly tormented by the possibility that either his memory has been damaged... or that he has somehow rejoined a world in which he doesn't belong.  He seems to keep switching between two timelines: one where he has one son and one where he has two. Ultimately, he goes to Howard for help and joins the group's efforts to stop the U.S. Navy from accidentally creating the Triangle.  He suggests they do things the “[[Greenpeace]] way"; he wants to drive his cigarette boat out to where the Navy is attempting to close the Triangle without realizing they are actually creating it. The first attempt fails and the Triangle is created but the second time around, Howard gathers him and everyone sooner and they make it to the Naval Base although Meeno's boat is destroyed by the Navy and captured. The attempt works and in the new timeline created from the Triangle's destruction, he has two sons rather than just the older one from his original timeline.

'''Tri Brata''' ({{lang-ru|Три Брата}}; literally: "three brothers") is a set of three [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s at the entrance to the [[Avacha Bay]]. This picturesque [[stack (geology)|stack]], or [[kekur]], is considered a symbol of [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]].

Local lore suggests that they are three brothers who went to defend the town from a [[tsunami]] and turned to stone.

[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[Raw sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] in the [[New River (California)|New River]] as it passes from [[Mexicali]] to [[Calexico, California]]]]
'''Water pollution''' is the contamination of [[Body of water|water bodies]], usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[marine pollution|ocean]]s, [[aquifer]]s and [[groundwater]]. Water pollution results when [[Contaminant|contaminants]] are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated [[wastewater]] into natural water bodies can lead to [[environmental degradation|degradation]] of [[aquatic ecosystems]]. In turn, this can lead to [[public health]] problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or [[irrigation]]. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, e.g. due to [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]].&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Water pollution can be grouped into [[surface water]] pollution. [[Marine pollution]] and [[nutrient pollution]] are subsets of water pollution. Sources of water pollution are either point sources and non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a [[storm drain]], [[wastewater treatment plant]] or stream. Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as [[Surface runoff|agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted [[bodies of water|water bodies]] can be impacted. The effects can damage individual [[species]] and impact the natural [[Biocoenosis|biological communities]] they are part of.   

The causes of water pollution include a wide range of [[chemical]]s and [[pathogen]]s as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of [[thermal pollution]] is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic" /&gt;{{rp|375}}   

Water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be done. Control of water pollution requires appropriate [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]] and management plans. The infrastructure may include [[wastewater treatment plants]]. [[Sewage treatment|Sewage treatment plants]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]] treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater. [[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for farms, and [[erosion control]] from construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. [[Nature-based solutions]] are another approach to prevent water pollution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Canal-pollution.jpg|thumb|Pollution in the [[Lachine Canal]], Canada]]
Water is typically referred to as polluted when it is impaired by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] contaminants. Due to these contaminants it either does not support a human use, such as [[drinking water]], or undergoes a marked shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish. Natural phenomena such as [[volcano]]es, [[algae bloom]]s, storms, and earthquakes also cause major changes in water quality and the ecological status of water.

Water pollution is a major global problem. It requires ongoing evaluation and revision of [[water resource policy]] at all levels (international down to individual aquifers and wells). It has been suggested that water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and diseases,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |author=Pink, Daniel H. |publisher=Yahoo |title=Investing in Tomorrow's Liquid Gold |date=April 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423172532/https://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/trenddesk/3748 |archivedate=April 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalevents/a/waterdayqa.htm |author=West, Larry |publisher=About.com |title=World Water Day: A Billion People Worldwide Lack Safe Drinking Water |date=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it accounts for the deaths of more than 14,000 people daily.&lt;ref name="death2" /&gt; 

India and China are two countries with high levels of water pollution: An estimated 580 people in [[India]] die of water pollution related illness (including [[waterborne diseases]]) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |title=An overview of diarrhea, symptoms, diagnosis and the costs of morbidity |year=2010 |work=CHNRI |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512231350/http://www.inclentrust.org/uploadedbyfck/file/Diarrhoea-Pneumonia/Lecture%203_1%20Burden%20of%20diarrhea%20in%20children%20in%20India%20-12th%20dec.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90 percent of the [[Water resources of China|water in the cities of China]] is polluted.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-06/07/content_449451.htm China says water pollution so severe that cities could lack safe supplies]". Chinadaily.com.cn. June 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, half a billion Chinese had no access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahn |first1=Joseph |last2=Yardley |first2=Jim |date=2007-08-26 |title=As China Roars, Pollution Reaches Deadly Extremes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/asia/26china.html |newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to the acute problems of water pollution in [[developing country|developing countries]], [[developed countries]] also continue to struggle with pollution problems. For example, in a report on [[water quality]] in the [[United States]] in 2009, 44 percent of assessed stream miles, 64 percent of assessed lake acres, and 30 percent of assessed [[bays]] and [[estuary|estuarine]] square miles were classified as polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=January 2009 |title=Fact Sheet: 2004 National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress |url=https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/2004-national-water-quality-inventory-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Surface water pollution ===
{{see also|Nutrient pollution}}
Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is [[marine pollution]].

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:AngleseyCopperStream.jpg|thumb|upright|A polluted river draining an abandoned [[copper mine]] on Anglesey]]

One common path of entry by [[Contaminant|contaminants]] to the sea are rivers. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations.  

Large [[gyre]]s ([[vortex]]es) in the oceans trap floating [[plastic debris]]. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning any creature that eats it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaikab|first=Gwyneth Dickey|date=2011-03-28|title=Marine microbes digest plastic|url=|journal=Nature|publisher=Macmillan|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=10.1038/news.2011.191|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these long-lasting pieces end up in the stomachs of marine birds and animals. This results in obstruction of digestive pathways, which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation.

There are a variety of secondary effects stemming not from the original pollutant, but a derivative condition. An example is [[silt]]-bearing [[surface runoff]], which can inhibit the penetration of sunlight through the water column, hampering [[photosynthesis]] in aquatic plants.

===Groundwater pollution===
{{Main|Groundwater pollution}}
Interactions between [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] are complex. Consequently, groundwater pollution, also referred to as groundwater contamination, is not as easily classified as surface water pollution.&lt;ref name="circ1139" /&gt; By its very nature, groundwater [[aquifer]]s are susceptible to contamination from sources that may not directly affect surface water bodies. The distinction of point vs. non-point source may be irrelevant. 

Analysis of groundwater contamination may focus on [[soil]] characteristics and site geology, [[hydrogeology]], [[hydrology]], and the nature of the contaminants. Causes of groundwater pollution include: naturally-occurring (geogenic), [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|on-site sanitation]] systems, [[sewage]], [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]], commercial and industrial leaks, [[hydraulic fracturing]], [[landfill leachate]].

==Categories of pollution sources==
Surface water and [[groundwater]] have often been studied and managed as separate resources even though they are interrelated.&lt;ref name="circ1139"&gt;United States Geological Survey (USGS), Denver, CO (1998). [http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/circ1139/ "Ground Water and Surface Water: A Single Resource."] Circular 1139.&lt;/ref&gt; Surface water seeps through the soil and becomes groundwater. Conversely, groundwater can also feed surface water sources. Sources of surface water pollution are generally grouped into two categories based on their origin.

===Point sources===
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Point source pollution at a [[shipyard]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil.]]

{{Further|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}

[[Point source water pollution]] refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, such as a [[water pipe|pipe]] or [[ditch]]. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]], a factory, or a city [[storm drain]]. 

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) defines point source for [[regulation|regulatory]] enforcement purposes.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA), section 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}} (14).&lt;/ref&gt; The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal storm sewer systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. CWA section 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-point sources===
[[Nonpoint source pollution]] refers to diffuse contamination that does not originate from a single discrete source. This type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. A common example is the leaching out of [[nitrogen]] compounds from fertilized agricultural lands.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Brian |title=Water Pollution by Agriculture |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B |date=2008 |volume=363 |pages=659–666 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2176 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Moss2/publication/6173580_Water_Pollution_by_Agriculture/links/53d607050cf220632f3d6bf2.pdf|pmc=2610176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrient [[surface runoff|runoff]] in [[stormwater|storm water]] from "sheet flow" over an [[agricultural field]] or a forest are also cited as examples of non-point source pollution.

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Contaminated storm water washed off of [[parking lot]]s, roads and highways, called [[urban runoff]], is sometimes included  under the category of non-point sources. However, because this runoff is typically channeled into storm drain systems and discharged through pipes to local surface waters, it becomes a point source.

==Contaminants and their sources==
{{Further|Wastewater|Sewage|Industrial wastewater}}

The specific contaminants leading to pollution in water include a wide spectrum of [[chemical]]s, [[pathogen]]s, and physical changes such as elevated temperature and discoloration. While many of the chemicals and substances that are regulated may be naturally occurring ([[calcium]], [[sodium]], iron, [[manganese]], etc.) the [[concentration]] usually determines what is a natural component of water and what is a contaminant. High concentrations of naturally occurring substances can have negative impacts on aquatic flora and fauna.

[[Oxygen]]-depleting substances may be natural materials such as plant matter (e.g. leaves and grass) as well as man-made chemicals. Other natural and anthropogenic substances may cause [[turbidity]] (cloudiness) which blocks light and disrupts plant growth, and clogs the [[gill]]s of some fish species.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact"&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] Fact Sheet No. EPA-841-F-05-001. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alteration of water's physical chemistry includes acidity (change in [[pH]]), [[electrical conductivity]], temperature, and [[eutrophication]]. Eutrophication is an increase in the concentration of chemical nutrients in an [[ecosystem]] to an extent that increases the [[Primary production|primary productivity]] of the ecosystem. Depending on the degree of eutrophication, subsequent negative environmental effects such as [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] (oxygen depletion) and severe reductions in water quality may occur, affecting fish and other animal populations.

===Pathogens===

[[File:Dumping of faecal sludge into the river.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[septage|Fecal sludge]] collected from pit latrines is dumped into a river at the Korogocho slum in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].]]
Disease-causing [[microorganism]]s are referred to as [[pathogen]]s. Pathogens can produce [[waterborne diseases]] in either human or animal hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kFbRYQUqcAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0854046216&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=0-85404-621-6|editor1-last=Harrison|editor1-first=Roy M.|edition=4th|location=Cambridge, UK|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coliform bacteria]], which are not an actual cause of disease, are commonly used as a [[indicator bacteria|bacterial indicator]] of water pollution. Other microorganisms sometimes found in contaminated surface waters that have caused human health problems include:

* ''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]''
* ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Norovirus]]'' and other viruses
* ''[[Helminths|Parasitic worms]] including the [[Schistosoma]] type &lt;ref&gt;USGS. Reston, VA. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-027-01/ "A Primer on Water Quality."] FS-027-01.

Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

High levels of pathogens may result from on-site [[sanitation]] systems ([[septic tank]]s, [[pit latrine]]s) or inadequately treated [[sewage]] discharges.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/sso/control/diseases.htm “Illness Related to Sewage in Water.”] Accessed February 20, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427093431/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/sso/control/diseases.htm |date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older cities with ageing infrastructure may have leaky sewage collection systems (pipes, pumps, valves), which can cause [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s. Some cities also have [[combined sewer]]s, which may discharge untreated sewage during rain storms.&lt;ref name="EPARTC"&gt;EPA. "[https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs."] August 2004.

[[File:muddy USGS.jpg|thumb|right|Muddy river polluted by sediment.]]
Pathogen discharges may also be caused by poorly managed livestock operations.

===Organic, inorganic and macroscopic contaminants===
Contaminants may include [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]] substances. Many of the chemical substances are [[toxic]].&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5D2DQAAQBAJ|title=Aquatic Pollution&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; An Introductory Text|last=Laws|first=Edward A.|date=2018|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781119304500|edition=4th|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229}}

===Change in temperature===
{{Main|Thermal pollution}}
Thermal pollution is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in a change in the physical properties of water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a [[coolant]] by [[power plants]] and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter [[food chain]] composition, reduce species [[biodiversity]], and foster invasion by new [[thermophilic]] species.&lt;ref name="Goel"&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Pollution - Causes, Effects and Control |last=Goel |first=P.K. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-224-1839-2 |url= |accessdate= |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennish"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology of Estuaries&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Anthropogenic Effects |last=Kennish |first=Michael J. |series=Marine Science Series |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=978-0-8493-8041-9 |url= |accessdate= |pages=415–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laws-aquatic"/&gt;{{rp|375}} Urban runoff may also elevate temperature in surface waters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-additional-resources |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=February 2003 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Fact Sheet. EPA 841-F-03-003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution can also be caused by the release of very cold water from the base of reservoirs into warmer rivers.

==Measurement==
[[File:Research- water sampling equipment.jpg|thumb|right|[[environmental science|Environmental scientists]] preparing water autosamplers.]]

Water pollution may be analyzed through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Most involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests. Some methods may be conducted ''[[in situ]]'', without sampling, such as temperature. Government agencies and research organizations have published standardized, validated analytical test methods to facilitate the comparability of results from disparate testing events.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book |editor1-last=Baird |editor1-first=Rodger B. |editor2-last=Clesceri |editor2-first=Leonore S. |editor3-last=Eaton |editor3-first=Andrew D. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Rice |editor4-first=Eugene W. |year=2012 |title=Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater |edition=22nd |url=http://www.standardmethods.org |subscription=yes |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Public Health Association |isbn=978-0875530130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason "grab" samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] intervals.

Sampling for biological testing involves collection of plants and animals from the surface water body. Depending on the type of assessment, the organisms may be identified for [[biosurvey]]s (population counts) and returned to the water body, or they may be dissected for [[bioassay]]s to determine [[toxicity]].
{{Further|Water quality#Sampling and measurement}}

===Physical testing===
Common physical tests of water include temperature, solids concentrations (e.g., [[total suspended solids]] (TSS)) and turbidity.

===Chemical testing===
{{See also|water chemistry analysis|environmental chemistry}}
Water samples may be examined using the principles of [[analytical chemistry]]. Many published test methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds. Frequently used methods include [[pH]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD),&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David|title=Chemistry of the Environment|year=2008|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0-8160-7747-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD),&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;{{rp|104}} nutrients ([[nitrate]] and [[phosphorus]] compounds), metals (including copper, [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], lead and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]), oil and grease, total [[petroleum]] hydrocarbons (TPH), and [[pesticide]]s.

===Biological testing===
{{Main|Bioindicator}}
Biological testing involves the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They are any [[indicator species|biological species]] or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or environmental integrity is present.&lt;ref name="Karr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a group of bio-indicators are the [[copepod]]s and other small water [[crustacean]]s that are present in many water bodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological, or behavioral) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.

==Control of pollution==
===Municipal wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Sewage treatment|Wastewater treatment}}
[[File:Deer Island MA.JPG|right|thumb|[[Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant|Deer Island Wastewater Treatment Plant]] serving Boston, Massachusetts and vicinity.]]
In urban areas of developed countries, municipal [[wastewater]] (or [[sewage]]) is typically treated by centralized [[sewage treatment plants]]. Well-designed and operated systems (i.e., with secondary treatment steps or more advanced treatment) can remove 90 percent or more of the pollutant load in sewage. Some plants have additional systems to remove [[Nutrient|nutrients]] and pathogens, but these more advanced treatment steps get progressively more expensive.

[[Nature-based solutions]] are also being used instead of (or in combination with) centralized treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;UN-Water (2018) [http://www.unwater.org/publications/world-water-development-report-2018/ World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water], Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s or [[Combined sewer|combined sewer overflows]] employ one or more [[environmental engineering|engineering]] approaches to reduce discharges of untreated sewage, including:
* utilizing a [[green infrastructure]] approach to improve storm water management capacity throughout the system, and reduce the [[hydraulic]] overloading of the treatment plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2010 |title=Green Infrastructure Case Studies |chapter=Case Study: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100FTEM.txt |publisher=EPA |pages=49–51 |id=EPA-841-F-10-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* repair and replacement of leaking and malfunctioning equipment&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;
* increasing overall hydraulic capacity of the sewage collection system (often a very expensive option).

=== On-site sanitation and safely managed sanitation ===
{{Further|Sanitation}}
Households or businesses not served by a municipal treatment plant may have an individual [[septic tank]], which pre-treats the wastewater on site and infiltrates it into the soil. This can lead to [[groundwater pollution]] if not properly done.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people currently (in 2017) do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]], according to an estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of access to sanitation often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of [[open defecation]]: during rain events or floods, the [[human feces]] are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple [[pit latrines]] may also get flooded during rain events. The use of safely managed sanitation services would prevent this type of water pollution.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;

===Industrial wastewater treatment===
{{Main article|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
[[File:REDOX DAF unit 225 m3-h-1000 GPM.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dissolved air flotation]] system for treating industrial wastewater.]]
Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease), toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove the pollutants, and then discharge the partially treated [[wastewater]] to the municipal sewer system. Industries generating large volumes of wastewater typically operate their own treatment systems. Some industries have been successful at redesigning their manufacturing processes to reduce or eliminate pollutants, through a process called [[pollution prevention]].

To remove heat from wastewater generated by [[Power station|power plants]] or [[Factory|manufacturing plants]] the following technologies are used:
*[[cooling pond]]s, man-made bodies of water designed for cooling by [[evaporation]], [[convection]], and [[radiation]]
*[[cooling tower]]s, which transfer [[waste heat]] to the [[atmosphere]] through [[evaporation]] or [[heat transfer]]
*[[cogeneration]], a process where waste heat is recycled for domestic or industrial heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Profile of the Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation Industry |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=50000H5P.txt |publisher=EPA |date=September 1997 |id=EPA/310-R-97-007 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural wastewater treatment===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
'''Non point source controls'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Sediment]] (loose [[soil]]) washed off fields is the largest source of [[agricultural pollution]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA-AGFact" /&gt; Farmers may utilize [[erosion control]]s to reduce runoff flows and retain soil on their fields. Common techniques include [[contour plowing]], crop [[mulch]]ing, [[crop rotation]], planting [[perennial]] crops and installing [[riparian buffer]]s.&lt;ref name="NRCS-NCPS"&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Washington, DC.  [https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/technical/cp/ncps/ "National Conservation Practice Standards."] National Handbook of Conservation Practices. Accessed 2015-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"/&gt;{{Rp|pp. 4-95–4-96|date=May 2009}}

Nutrients ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) are typically applied to farmland as commercial [[fertilizer]], animal [[manure]], or spraying of municipal or industrial wastewater (effluent) or sludge. Nutrients may also enter runoff from [[crop residue]]s, [[irrigation]] water, [[wildlife]], and [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|atmospheric deposition]].&lt;ref name="EPA-agmm"&gt;

To minimize pesticide impacts, farmers may use [[Integrated Pest Management]] (IPM) techniques (which can include [[biological pest control]]) to maintain control over pests, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and protect water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/integrated-pest-management-ipm-principles |title=Integrated Pest Management Principles |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=Pest Control and Pesticide Safety for Consumers |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confined-animal-feeding-operation.jpg|thumb|Feedlot in the United States]]
'''Point source wastewater treatment'''&lt;br /&gt;
Farms with large livestock and poultry operations, such as [[factory farm]]s, are called ''concentrated animal feeding operations'' or ''feedlots'' in the US and are being subject to increasing government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/animal-feeding-operations-afos |title=Animal Feeding Operations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Des Moines, IA. [http://www.iowadnr.gov/afo/ "Animal Feeding Operations in Iowa."] Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal [[slurry|slurries]] are usually treated by containment in [[anaerobic lagoon]]s before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. [[Constructed wetland]]s are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with [[straw]] and [[Composting|composted]] at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and friable manure for soil improvement.

===Erosion and sediment control from construction sites===
[[File:Silt fence EPA.jpg|right|thumb|[[Silt fence]] installed on a construction site.]]
Sediment from construction sites is managed by installation of:
* [[erosion control]]s, such as [[mulch]]ing and [[hydroseeding]], and
* [[sediment control]]s, such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. Nashville, TN (2012). [http://tnepsc.org/handbook.asp "Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge of toxic chemicals such as motor fuels and concrete washout is prevented by use of:
* spill prevention and control plans, and
* specially designed containers (e.g. for concrete washout) and structures such as overflow controls and diversion berms.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=February 2012 |title=Concrete Washout |series=Stormwater Best Management Practice |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/national-menu-best-management-practices-bmps-stormwater-documents |publisher=EPA |id=BMP fact sheet. EPA 833-F-11-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control of urban runoff (storm water)===
{{Main|Urban runoff}}
{{See also|Green infrastructure}}
[[File:Trounce Pond.jpg|right|thumb|[[Retention basin]] for controlling [[urban runoff]]]]
Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of storm water, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. Local governments use a variety of storm water management techniques to reduce the effects of urban runoff. These techniques, called [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices for water pollution]] (BMPs) in the U.S., may focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS"&gt;
{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]] techniques, installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |title=Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219220712/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Low-Impact-Development-LID-and-Other-Green-Design-Strategies.cfm |archive-date=2015-02-19 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, constructed [[wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. [https://www.casqa.org/resources/bmp-handbooks/municipal-bmp-handbook "Municipal BMP Handbook."] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. [http://www.njstormwater.org/bmp_manual2.htm "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal pollution from runoff can be controlled by storm water management facilities that absorb the runoff or direct it into [[groundwater]], such as bioretention systems and infiltration basins. Retention basins tend to be less effective at reducing temperature, as the water may be heated by the sun before being discharged to a receiving stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-PDS" /&gt;{{Rp|p. 5–58|date=May 2012}}

'''World energy consumption''' is the total [[energy]] used by the entire human [[civilization]]. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every [[energy development|energy source]] applied towards humanity's endeavours across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, World Energy Consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

Institutions such as the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), and the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA) record and publish energy data periodically. Improved data and understanding of World Energy Consumption may reveal systemic trends and patterns, which could help frame current energy issues and encourage movement towards collectively useful solutions.

Closely related to energy consumption is the concept of total [[primary energy]] supply (TPES), which - on a global level - is the sum of energy production minus storage changes. Since changes of energy storage over the year are minor, TPES values can be used as an estimator for energy consumption. However, TPES ignores conversion efficiency, overstating forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency (e.g. [[coal]], gas and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]]) and understating forms already accounted for in converted forms (e.g. [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic]] or [[hydroelectricity]]). The IEA estimates that, in 2013, total primary energy supply (TPES) was 1.575 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Watt hour|Wh]] (= 157.5 PWh, 157,500 TWh, 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s, or 13,541 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]) or about 18 TW-year.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title= IEA - Key world energy statistics, 2015 |url=ftp://ftp.energia.bme.hu/pub/energetikai_alapismeretek/KeyWorld_Statistics_2015.pdf|accessdate=6 April 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000–2012 coal was the source of energy with the largest growth. The use of oil and natural gas also had considerable growth, followed by hydropower and renewable energy. Renewable energy grew at a rate faster than any other time in history during this period. The demand for nuclear energy decreased, in part due to nuclear disasters (e.g. [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] 1979, [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] 1986, and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] 2011).&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="undp"&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf World Energy Assessment] (WEA). UNDP, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, World Energy Council, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, expenditures on energy totalled over 6 trillion USD, or about 10% of the world [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Europe spends close to one-quarter of the world's energy expenditures, North America close to 20%, and Japan 6%.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Desbrosses, [http://www.leonardo-energy.org/blog/world-energy-expenditures World Energy Expenditures], Leonardo Energy, Nov. 28 2011 (accessed 30 January 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

World [[primary energy|total primary energy supply]] (TPES), or "primary energy" differs from the world final energy consumption because much of the energy that is acquired by humans is lost as other forms of energy during the process of its refinement into usable forms of energy and its transport from its initial place of supply to consumers. For instance, when oil is extracted from the ground it must be refined into gasoline, so that it can be used in a car, and transported over long distances to gas stations where it can be used by consumers. World final energy consumption refers to the fraction of the world's primary energy that is used in its final form by humanity.

Also, one needs to bear in mind that there are different [[Energy quality|qualities of energy]]. Heat, especially at a relatively low temperature, is low-quality energy, whereas electricity is high-quality energy. It takes around 3&amp;nbsp;kWh of heat to produce 1&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity. But by the same token, a kilowatt-hour of this high-quality electricity can be used to pump several kilowatt-hours of heat into a building using a heat pump. And electricity can be used in many ways in which heat cannot. So the "loss" of energy incurred when generating electricity is not the same as a loss due, say, to resistance in power lines

In 2014, world primary energy supply amounted to 155,481&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hour (TWh) or 13,541&amp;nbsp;[[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]], while the world final energy consumption was 109,613&amp;nbsp;TWh or about 29.5% less than the total supply.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2016"/&gt; World final energy consumption includes products as lubricants, asphalt and petrochemicals which have chemical energy content but are not used as fuel. This non-energy use amounted to 
9,723 TWh (836 Mtoe) in 2015.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2017"/&gt;

The United States [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) regularly publishes a report on world consumption for most types of primary energy resources. For 2013, estimated world energy consumption was 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; joules, or 157,481&amp;nbsp;TWh. According to the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] the total world energy consumption in past years was 143,851 TWh in 2008, 133,602&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, 117,687&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000, and 102,569&amp;nbsp;TWh in 1990.&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2015" /&gt; In 2012 approximately 22% of world energy was consumed in North America, 5% was consumed South and Central America, 23% was consumed in Europe and Eurasia, 3% was consumed in Africa, and 40% was consumed in the Asia Pacific region.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

===Electricity generation===
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2013, 16,503&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2008, 15,105&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2005, and 12,116&amp;nbsp;TWh in 2000. 
By the end of 2014, the total installed electricity generating capacity worldwide was nearly 6.142 [[Terawatt|TW]] (million MW) which only includes generation connected to local [[electricity grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Electricity - Installed generating capacity, 2014 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2236.html#xx|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition there is an unknown amount of heat and electricity consumed off-grid by isolated villages and industries. 
In 2014, the share of world energy consumption for electricity generation by source was coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. 
Coal and natural gas were the most used energy fuels for generating electricity. 
The world's electricity consumption was 18,608&amp;nbsp;TWh {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} in 2012. 
This figure is about 18% smaller than the generated electricity, due to grid losses, storage losses, and self-consumption from power plants ([[gross generation]]). 
[[Cogeneration]] (CHP) power stations use some of the heat that is otherwise wasted for use in buildings or in industrial processes.

In 2016 while total world energy came from 80% fossil fuels, 10% biofuels, 5% nuclear and 5% renewable (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal), only 18% of that total world energy was in the form of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/shell-scenarios-energy-models/world-energy-model/_jcr_content/par/textimage.stream/1510344160326/d62f12b8fe88e85dc3349c38b1ca5e44cc22c5ccc6f70beed634020cfb527c82/shell-world-energy-model.pdf pg4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the other 82% was used for heat and transportation.

Recently there has been a large increase in international agreements and national Energy Action Plans, such as the EU 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, to increase the use of renewable energy due to the growing concerns about pollution from energy sources that come from fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Global energy: perspectives"&gt;{{cite book |last= Nakićenović |first= Nebojša |last2= Grübler|first2= Arnulf |last3= McDonald|first3= Alan | date= 1998 |title= Global energy: perspectives |location= Cambridge, New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0521642000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such initiative was the United Nations Development Programme's World Energy Assessment in 2000 that highlighted many challenges humanity would have to overcome in order to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="undp"/&gt; From 2000–2012 renewable energy grew at a rate higher than any other point in history, with a consumption increase of 176.5 million tonnes of oil. During this period, oil, coal, and natural gas continued to grow and had increases that were much higher than the increase in renewable energy. The following figures illustrate the growth in consumption of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas as well as renewable sources of energy during this period.&lt;ref name="BP-Review-2013"/&gt;

[[File:Japan energy and GDP.svg|thumb|right|'''GDP and energy consumption in Japan, 1958–2000:''' The data shows the correlation between GDP and energy use; however, it also shows that this link can be broken. After the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 the energy use stagnated while Japan's GDP continued to grow, after 1985, under the influence of the then much cheaper oil, energy use resumed its historical relation to GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/chouki/index.htm |title= Historical Statistics of Japan |publisher= Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The energy consumption growth in the G20 slowed down to 2% in 2011, after the strong increase of 2010. The economic crisis is largely responsible for this slow growth. For several years now, the world energy demand is characterized by the bullish Chinese and Indian markets, while developed countries struggle with stagnant economies, high oil prices, resulting in stable or decreasing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/energy-press-releases/sluggish-growth-world-energy-demand-in-2011.php|title=Sluggish growth of World energy demand in 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] data from 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person increased 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the EU-27 block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.

In 2008, total worldwide primary energy consumption was 132,000 terawatt-hours ([[TWh]]) or 474 exajoules ([[exajoules|EJ]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |work= Statistical Review of World Energy 2009 |publisher= [[BP]] |url= http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |title= Consumption by fuel, 1965–2008 |format= XLS |date= 8 June 2009 |accessdate= 24 October 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130726202544/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20–%20Consumption'!A1 |archivedate= 26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primary energy demand increased to 158,000 TWh (567&amp;nbsp;EJ).&lt;ref name=EIAIES2015&gt;{{cite web |title= International Energy Statistics|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy consumption in the [[Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors|G20]] increased by more than 5% in 2010 after a slight decline of 2009. In 2009, world energy consumption decreased for the first time in 30 years by 1.1%, or about 130 million tonnes of oil equivalent ([[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]]), as a result of the financial and economic crisis, which reduced world GDP by 0.6% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enerdata.net/enerdatauk/press-and-publication/publications/world-energy-statistics-supply-and-demand.php|title=World Energy Statistics – Energy Supply &amp; Demand |publisher= Enerdata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This evolution is the result of two contrasting trends: Energy consumption growth remained vigorous in several developing countries, specifically in Asia (+4%). Conversely, in OECD, consumption was severely cut by 4.7% in 2009 and was thus almost down to its 2000 levels. In North America, Europe and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], consumptions shrank by 4.5%, 5% and 8.5% respectively due to the slowdown in economic activity. China became the world's largest energy consumer (18% of the total) since its consumption surged by 8% during 2009 (up from 4% in 2008). Oil remained the largest energy source (33%) despite the fact that its share has been decreasing over time. Coal posted a growing role in the world's energy consumption: in 2009, it accounted for 27% of the total.

Most energy is used in the country of origin, since it is cheaper to transport final products than raw materials. In 2008, the share export of the total energy production by fuel was: oil 50% (1,952/3,941&amp;nbsp;Mt), gas 25% (800/3,149&amp;nbsp;bcm) and hard coal 14% (793/5,845&amp;nbsp;Mt).&lt;ref name=IEA20109&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] and [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key_stats_2009.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2009] oil page 11, gas p.13, hard coal (excluding brown coal) p. 15 and electricity p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the world's high energy resources are from the conversion of the sun's rays to other energy forms after being incident upon the planet. Some of that energy has been preserved as fossil energy, some is directly or indirectly usable; for example, via solar PV/thermal, wind, hydro- or wave power. The total solar irradiance is measured by satellite to be roughly 1361 watts per square meter ''(see [[solar constant]])'', though it fluctuates by about 6.9% during the year due to the Earth's varying distance from the sun. This value, after multiplication by the cross-sectional area intercepted by the Earth, is the total rate of [[Solar energy#Energy from the Sun|solar energy]] received by the planet; about half, 89,000&amp;nbsp;TW, reaches the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= William |last= Schreiber |url= http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/196/schreiber.html |title= Solving the Energy Problem |work= MIT Faculty Newsletter |date=May–June 2007 |accessdate= 2016-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimates of remaining non-renewable worldwide energy resources vary, with the remaining fossil fuels totaling an estimated 0.4&amp;nbsp; yottajoule ([[Yottajoule|YJ]]) or 4 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules, and the available nuclear fuel such as [[uranium]] exceeding 2.5&amp;nbsp;YJ. Fossil fuels range from 0.6 to 3&amp;nbsp;YJ if estimates of reserves of [[methane clathrates]] are accurate and become technically extractable. The total power flux from the sun intercepting the Earth is 5.5&amp;nbsp;YJ per year, though not all of this is available for human consumption. The IEA estimates for the world to meet global energy demand for the two decades from 2015 to 2035 it will require investment of $48 trillion and "credible policy frameworks."&lt;ref name="IEAreport"&gt;{{cite news |title= IEA estimates $48tn investments till 2035 to meet global energy demands |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/energy-supply-requires-40-trillion-investment-to-2035-iea-says.html |accessdate= 4 June 2014 |publisher= [[Bloomberg News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to IEA (2012) the goal of limiting warming to 2&amp;nbsp;°C is becoming more difficult and costly with each year that passes. If action is not taken before 2017, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be locked-in by energy infrastructure existing in 2017. Fossil fuels are dominant in the global [[energy mix]], supported by $523 billion subsidies in 2011, up almost 30% on 2010 and six times more than subsidies to renewables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/English.pdf IEA World Energy Outlook 2012 Executive Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===
[[Global warming]] [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] resulting from energy production are an [[environmental problem]]. Efforts to resolve this include the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (1997) and the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015), international governmental agreements aiming to [[Climate change mitigation|reduce harmful climate impacts]], which a number of nations have signed. Limiting global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, thought to be a risk by the [[Stockholm Environmental Institute|SEI]], is now doubtful.

To limit global temperature to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in [[carbon emissions]] in industrial countries by 2050, if the population is 10 billion in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Energiläget 2050 by prof. Cristian Azar and Kristian Lindgren [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers]] [[Göteborg]] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the basic problem. Hypothetically, according to [[Robert Engelman]] (Worldwatch institute), in order to prevent collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).&lt;ref&gt;''State of the world 2009'', [[Worldwatch Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenhouse gases]] are not the only emissions of energy production and consumption. Large amounts of pollutants such as [[sulphurous oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[particulate matter]] (PM) are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; the [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biomass]] [[combustion]] is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|title= Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to producing air pollution like [[fossil fuel]] combustion, most biomass has high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/PFPI-biomass-carbon-accounting-overview_April.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil fuels ===
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

The twentieth century saw a rapid twenty-fold increase in the use of fossil fuels. Between 1980 and 2006, the worldwide annual growth rate was 2%.&lt;ref name=EIA/&gt; According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]]'s 2006 estimate, the estimated 471.8&amp;nbsp;EJ total consumption in 2004, was divided as given in the table above, with fossil fuels supplying 86% of the world's energy:

====Coal====
{{Main article|Coal|List of countries by coal production}}

In 2000, China accounted for 28% of world coal consumption, other Asia consumed 19%, North America 25% and the EU 14%. The single greatest coal-consuming country is China. Its share of the world coal production was 28% in 2000 and rose to 48% in 2009. In contrast to China's ~70% increase in coal consumption, world coal use increased 48% from 2000 to 2009. In practice, the majority of this growth occurred in China and the rest in other Asia.&lt;ref name="energisve2010Coal"/&gt; China's energy consumption is mostly driven by the industry sector, the majority of which comes from coal consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Damien. "China's Coming Decade of Natural Gas". ''Asia's Uncertain LNG Future, NBR Special Report''. November 2013. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

World annual coal production increased 1,905&amp;nbsp;Mt or 32% in 6 years in 2011 compared to 2005, of which over 70% was in China and 8% in India. Coal production was in 2011 7,783&amp;nbsp;Mt, and 2009 6,903&amp;nbsp;Mt, equal to 12.7% production increase in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012, 2010 and 2006 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

If production and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This is much more than needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in the world. According to [[James Hansen]] the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[Coal mining|coal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/true-cost-coal.pdf The True Cost of Coal] 27 November 2008 pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Energy in Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Energy in Australia|Australia]] exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of all the world coal import in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Key statistics 2012 IEA&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil ====
{{Main article|Petroleum|List of countries by oil production|List of countries by oil consumption}}

Coal fueled the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century. With the advent of the automobile, aeroplanes and the spreading use of electricity, [[Petroleum|oil]] became the dominant fuel during the twentieth century. The growth of oil as the largest fossil fuel was further enabled by steadily dropping prices from 1920 until 1973. After the oil shocks of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]], during which the price of oil increased from 5 to 45 US dollars per barrel, there was a shift away from oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. 792&lt;/ref&gt; Coal, natural gas, and nuclear became the fuels of choice for electricity generation and conservation measures increased energy efficiency. In the U.S. the average car more than doubled the number of miles per gallon. Japan, which bore the brunt of the oil shocks, made spectacular improvements and now has the highest energy efficiency in the world.&lt;ref name = "IEAKey"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= International Energy Agency |title= Key World Energy Statistics |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 }} pp. 48–57&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 2008, the use of fossil fuels has continued to grow and their share of the energy supply has increased. From 2003 to 2008, coal was the fastest growing fossil fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers needed on book sources --&gt;

It is estimated that between 100 and 135 billion tonnes of oil has been consumed between 1850 and the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090507072830.htm How Much Oil Have We Used?], [[Science Daily]], 8 May 2009. Retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Natural Gas ====
{{Main article|Natural Gas|List of countries by natural gas production|List of countries by natural gas consumption}}

In 2009, the world use of natural gas grew 31% compared to 2000. 66% of this growth was outside EU, North America, Latin America, and Russia. Others include the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The gas supply increased also in the previous regions: 8.6% in the EU and 16% in the North America 2000–2009.&lt;ref name="energiläget2010G"/&gt;

Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from [[Renewable resource|resources]] that are not significantly depleted by their use, such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]] and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thebulletin.org/myth-renewable-energy |title= The myth of renewable energy |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date= 2011-11-22 |accessdate= 2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy is gradually replacing conventional fuels in four distinct areas: [[electricity generation]], [[solar hot water|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[motor fuel]]s, and [[Stand-alone power system|rural (off-grid)]] energy services.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;REN21 (2010).

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like [[Renewable energy in China|China]] and the [[Renewable energy in the United States|United States]] heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title= Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author= [[REN21]] |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate= 4 September 2014 |year= 2014 |pages= 13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.

From 2000 to 2013 the total renewable energy use has increased 6,450 TWh and total energy use 40,500 TWh.

==== Hydro ====
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower}}

Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the kinetic energy of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between 2003 and 2009.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with {{convert|721|TWh|PJ|abbr=on|order=flip}} of production in 2010, representing around 17% of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] in Brazil, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title= Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |publisher= Worldwatch Institute |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|worlds top 10 renewable electricity producers]] are primarily hydroelectric, one is wind.

==== Marine energy ====
{{Main article|Ocean energy}}
[[Marine energy]], also known as ''ocean energy'' and ''marine and hydrokinetic energy'' (MHK) includes [[tidal power|tidal]] and [[wave power|wave]] power and is a relatively new sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream [[turbine]]s in fast-moving [[river]]s, ocean current turbines in areas of strong [[marine current]]s, and [[ocean thermal energy converter]]s in deep tropical waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tethys |url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wind ====
{{Main article|Wind power|Wind power by country}}

Wind power is growing at the rate of 17% annually, with a worldwide [[Installed wind power capacity|installed capacity]] of 432,883&amp;nbsp;megawatts (MW) at the end of 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/graphs/ |title= GWEC Global Statistics |author= Global Wind Energy Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;Lars Kroldrup.

==== Solar ====
{{Main article|Solar energy|Solar power|Solar power by country}}

Solar energy, radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], has been harnessed by humans since [[ancient history|ancient times]] using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] and [[solar architecture]], which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. The [[International Energy Agency]] projected that solar power could provide "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions would be reduced to very low levels."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s and [[solar thermal collector]]s to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Geothermal ====
{{Main article|Geothermal energy|Geothermal power}}

[[Geothermal energy]] is used commercially in over 70 countries.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[MIT]] |title= The Future of Geothermal Energy |url= http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 7 February 2007 |archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110310030646/http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf |archive-date= 10 March 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, {{convert|200|PJ|TWh}} of electricity was generated from geothermal resources, and an additional {{convert|270|PJ|TWh}} of geothermal energy was used directly, mostly for space heating. In 2007, the world had a global capacity for {{val|10|u=GW}} of electricity generation and an additional {{val|28|u=GW}} of [[geothermal heating|direct heating]], including extraction by [[geothermal heat pumps]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century |title= Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 |year= 2006 |accessdate= 3 April 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |archivedate= 18 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Ingvar B. |last1= Fridleifsson, |first2= Ruggero |last2= Bertani |first3= Ernst |last3= Huenges |first4= John W. |last4= Lund |first5= Arni |last5= Ragnarsson |first6= Ladislaus |last6= Rybach |date= 11 February 2008 |title= The possible role and contribution of geothermal energy to the mitigation of climate change |conference= IPCC Scoping Meeting on Renewable Energy Sources |editor= O.

==== Bio energy ====
{{Main article|Biomass|Biogas|Biofuel}}

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century biomass was the predominant fuel, today it has only a small share of the overall energy supply. Electricity produced from [[biomass]] sources was estimated at 44&amp;nbsp;GW for 2005. Biomass electricity generation increased by over 100% in Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. A further 220&amp;nbsp;GW was used for heating (in 2004), bringing the total energy consumed from biomass to around 264&amp;nbsp;GW. The use of biomass fires for cooking is excluded.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; World production of [[Ethanol fuel|bioethanol]] increased by 8% in 2005 to reach {{convert|33|GL|usgal|lk=on}}, with most of the increase in the United States, bringing it level to the levels of consumption in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt; [[Biodiesel]] increased by 85% to {{convert|3.9|GL|usgal}}, making it the fastest growing renewable energy source in 2005. Over 50% is produced in Germany.&lt;ref name="Renewables2006" /&gt;

[[File:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|World energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]]

Energy consumption is loosely correlated with [[Gross National Product#Gross National Product|gross national product]] and climate, but there is a large difference even between the most highly developed countries, such as Japan and Germany with an energy consumption rate of 6&amp;nbsp;kW per person and the [[Energy use in the United States|United States]] with an energy consumption rate of 11.4&amp;nbsp;kW per person. In developing countries, particularly those that are sub-tropical or tropical such as India, the per person energy use rate is closer to 0.7&amp;nbsp;kW. Bangladesh has the lowest consumption rate with 0.2&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

The US consumes 25% of the world's energy with a share of global GDP at 22% and a share of the world population at 4.59%.&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esa.un.org/UNPP/ |title= World Population Prospects |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= 7 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |archive-date= 21 March 2007 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant growth of energy consumption is currently taking place in China, which has been growing at 5.5% per year over the last 25 years. Its population of 1.3 billion people (19.6% of the world population&lt;ref name="World Population Prospects" /&gt;) is consuming energy at a rate of 1.6&amp;nbsp;kW per person.

One measurement of efficiency is [[energy intensity]]. This is a measure of the amount of energy it takes a country to produce a dollar of gross domestic product.

The table to the right shows the amounts of energy consumed worldwide in 2012 by four sectors, according to the [[Energy Information Administration]] of the [[US Department of Energy]]:
*Residential (heating, lighting, and appliances)
*Commercial (lighting, heating and cooling of commercial buildings, and provision of water and sewer services)
*Industrial users (agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction)
*Transportation (passenger, freight, and pipeline)
Of the total 120 PWh ({{val|120e15|ul=Wh}}) consumed, 19.4 were in the form of electricity, but this electricity required 61.7 PWh to produce. Thus the total energy consumption was around 160 PWh (ca {{val|550e15|ul=Btu}}).&lt;ref name=EIA2016/&gt; The efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy efficiency measures and technological improvements. |url= http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |publisher= e8.org |accessdate= 21 January 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204112155/http://www.e8.org/index.jsp?numPage=138 |archivedate= 4 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }} Article by group of ten leading electricity companies&lt;/ref&gt; The new generation of gas-fired plants reaches a substantially higher efficiency of 55%. Coal is the most common fuel for the world's electricity plants.&lt;ref name="coal"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldcoal.org/assets_cm/files/PDF/coal_fact_card_2006.pdf |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517000455/http://www.worldcoal.org/assets_cm/files/PDF/coal_fact_card_2006.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2016-05-17 |title= Coal Facts 2006 Edition |publisher= [[World Coal Institute]] |format= PDF |date= September 2006 |accessdate= 8 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report gives different values for the sectors, apparently due to different definitions. According to this, total world energy use per sector in 2008 was industry 28%, transport 27% and residential and service 36%.

The '''Zugspitze''', ({{IPA-de|ˈtsukʃpɪtsə}}; [[Southern Bavarian]]: ''Zugspitz'') at 2,962&amp;nbsp;m (9,718&amp;nbsp;ft) above [[Normalhöhennull|sea level]], is the highest peak of the [[Wetterstein Mountains]] as well as the highest [[mountain]] in [[Germany]]. It lies south of the town of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], and the [[Austria–Germany border]] runs over its western summit. South of the mountain is the ''Zugspitzplatt'', a high [[karst]] [[plateau]] with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are three glaciers, including the two largest in Germany: the [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]] with an area of 30.7 [[hectare]]s and the [[Höllentalferner]] with an area of 24.7 hectares. The third is the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern Schneeferner]] which covers 8.4 hectares.

The Zugspitze was first climbed on 27 August 1820 by [[Josef Naus]], his survey assistant, Maier, and [[mountain guide]], Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are three [[normal route]]s to the summit: one from the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] valley to the northeast; another out of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (''Österreichische Schneekar''). One of the best known ridge routes in the [[Eastern Alps]] runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubiläumsgrat]]'') to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the [[Hochblassen]] and the [[Alpspitze]]. For mountaineers there is plenty of nearby accommodation. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the [[Münchner Haus]] and on the western slopes is the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]].

Three [[Aerial lift|cable cars]] run to the top of the Zugspitze. The first, the [[Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car]], was built in 1926 by the German company ''Adolf [[Bleichert]] &amp; Co'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Bleicherts-Wire-Ropeways-ebook/dp/B00DJZ6QSI/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373230767&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=bleichert%27s Peter von Bleichert "Bleichert's Wire Ropeways"]&lt;/ref&gt; and terminated on an [[arête]] below the summit at 2.805 m.a.s.l, the so-called Kammstation, before the terminus was moved to the actual summit at 2.951 m.a.s.l. in 1991. A [[rack railway]], the [[Bavarian Zugspitze Railway]], runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where a second cable car takes passengers to the top. The rack railway and the [[Eibsee Cable Car]], the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine [[ski lift]]s cover the [[ski area]] on the ''Zugspitzplatt''. The weather station, opened in 1900, and the research station in the [[Schneefernerhaus]] are mainly used to conduct climate research.

== Geography ==
The Zugspitze belongs to the [[Wetterstein]] range of the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. The [[Austria–Germany border]] goes right over the mountain. There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit  but, since Germany and Austria are now both part of the [[Schengen zone]], the border crossing is no longer manned.

The exact height of the Zugspitze was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from {{convert|2690|-|2970|m|ft}}, but it is now generally accepted that the peak is {{convert|2962|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]] as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian State Survey Office. The lounge at the new café is named "2962" for this reason.

=== Location ===
[[File:ZugspitzeJubilaeumsgratHoellental.JPG|right|thumb|View from the [[Alpspitze]] of the Zugspitze summit and the [[Höllentalferner]] glacier in 2007]]
At {{convert|2962|m|ft}} (eastern peak) the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of the Zugspitze massif. This height is referenced to the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|Amsterdam Gauge]] and is given by the [[Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zugspitze.de/diebzb/pdf_ulpr/Zugspitze-Hoehe.pdf |title=Zugspitze XXL:Deutschlands höchster Berg zeigt seine wahre Größe |author=Eva-Maria Greimel |publisher=Presseinformation Bayerische Zugspitzbahn Bergbahn AG | format= PDF |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same height is recorded against the [[Metres above the Adriatic|Trieste Gauge]] used in Austria, which is 27&amp;nbsp;cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three [[Summit (topography)|peaks]]: the east, middle and west summits (''Ost-, Mittel-'' and ''Westgipfel''). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, which is also the only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as {{convert|2964|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHiebeler|Hiebeler (1985)]], p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain rises eleven kilometres southwest of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and just under six kilometres east of [[Ehrwald]]. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the west summit; thus the Zugspitze massif belongs to the German state of [[Bavaria]] and the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (Bundesland)|Tyrol]]. The municipalities responsible for it are [[Grainau]] and [[Ehrwald]]. To the west the Zugspitze massif drops into the valley of the River [[Loisach]], which flows around the massif towards the northeast in a curve whilst, in the east, the streams of ''Hammersbach'' and [[Partnach]] have their source. To the south the ''Gaistal'' valley and its river, the [[Leutascher Ache]], separate the Wetterstein Mountains from the [[Mieming Chain]]. To the north at the foot of the Zugspitze is the lake of [[Eibsee]]. The next highest mountain in the area is the [[Acherkogel]] ({{convert|3008|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the [[Stubai Alps]], which gives the Zugspitze a [[topographic isolation]] value of 24.6&amp;nbsp;kilometres. The reference point for the [[prominence]] is the [[Parseierspitze]] ({{convert|3036|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). In order to climb it from the Zugspitze, a descent to the [[Fern Pass]] ({{convert|1216|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is required, so that the prominence is {{convert|1746|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10012 |title=Zugspitze |publisher=peakbagger.com |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zugspitze Massif
[[File:Zugspitze-Luftbild.JPG|right|thumb|Annotated aerial photograph of the Zugspitze massif]]
The [[massif]] of the Zugspitze has several other peaks. To the south the ''Zugspitzplatt'' is surrounded in an arc by the ''Zugspitzeck'' ({{convert|2820|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Schneefernerkopf]] ({{convert|2874|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Wetterspitzen]] ({{convert|2747|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Wetterwandeck]] ({{convert|2698|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the [[Plattspitzen]] ({{convert|2679|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the ''Gatterlköpfen'' ({{convert|2490|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The massif ends in the ''Gatterl'' ({{convert|2024|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[wind gap (geographical feature)|wind gap]] between it and the [[Hochwanner]]. Running eastwards away from the Zugspitze is the famous Jubilee Ridge or ''Jubiläumsgrat'' over the [[Höllentalspitzen]] towards the [[Alpspitze]] and [[Hochblassen]]. The short crest of the ''Riffelwandkamm'' runs northeast over the summits of the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] ({{convert|2626|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the ''Riffelköpfe'' ({{convert|2459|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), to the Riffel wind gap (''Riffelscharte'', {{convert|2161|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). From here the ridge of the ''Waxensteinkamm'' stretches away over the [[Riffelspitzen]] to the [[Waxenstein]].&lt;ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"&gt;''[[Alpine Club Map]] 4/2 – Wetterstein und Mieminger Gebirge Mitte'' (1:25,000). 5th edition.

;Zugspitzplatt
[[File:Zugspitze-Wettersteinkamm.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Zugspitzplatt'' above the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley in 2006]]
The ''Platt'' or ''Zugspitzplatt'' is a [[plateau]] below the summit of the Zugspitze to the south and southeast which lies at a height of between {{convert|2000|and|2650|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It forms the head of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and has been shaped by a combination of [[weathering]], [[karst]]ification and [[glaciation]]. The area contains [[roches moutonnée]]s, [[Sinkhole|dolines]] and [[limestone pavement]]s as a consequence of the [[ice age]]s. In addition [[moraine]]s have been left behind by various [[glacial period]]s. The ''Platt'' was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today 52% of it consists of [[scree]], 32% of [[bedrock]] and 16% of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umweltgeol-he.de/WerdenfelserGeotope.Wetterstein.ZugspitzplattUndPlattumrahmung.htm |title=Zugspitzplatt und Plattumrahmung |author=Engelbrecht, Hubert |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
From a climatic perspective the Zugspitze lies in the [[temperate zone]] and its prevailing winds are [[Westerlies]]. As the first high [[orographic]] obstacle to these Westerlies in the Alps, the Zugspitze is particularly exposed to the weather. It is effectively the north barrier of the Alps (''Nordstau der Alpen''), against which moist air masses pile up and release heavy precipitation. At the same time the Zugspitze acts as a protective barrier for the Alpine ranges to the south. By contrast, [[Föhn]] weather conditions push in the other direction against the massif, affecting the region for about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. These  warm, dry air masses stream from south to north and can result in unusually high temperatures in winter. Nevertheless, frost dominates the picture on the Zugspitze with an average of 310&amp;nbsp;days per year.

For the decades from 1961 to 1990 – designated by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] as the "normal period" – the average annual precipitation on the Zugspitze was 2,003.1&amp;nbsp;[[Precipitation measurement|mm]]; the wettest month being April with 199&amp;nbsp;mm, and the driest, October with 108.8&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Mittelwerte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&amp;T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadaten%2Fkldaten__kostenfrei%2Fausgabe__mittelwerte__node.html__nnn%3Dtrue |title=Klimadaten: Mittelwerte 1961–1990 |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst | format= ZIP/Exel |access-date=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison the values for 2009 were 2,070.8&amp;nbsp;mm, the wettest month being March with 326.2&amp;nbsp;mm and the driest, January, with 56.4&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Monatsdaten"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&amp;T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadatenzentren%2FNKDZ%2Fkldaten__akt%2Fausgabe__monatswerte__node.html__nnn%3Dtrue |title=Klimadaten: Fortlaufende Monatswerte (Station: 10961 Zugspitze) |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst | format= |access-date=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature in the normal period was −4.8&amp;nbsp;Celsius, with July and August being the warmest at 2.2&amp;nbsp;°C and February, the coldest, with −11.4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Mittelwerte"/&gt; By comparison the average temperature in  2009 was −4.2&amp;nbsp;°C, the warmest month was August at 5.3&amp;nbsp;°C and the coldest was February at −13.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Monatsdaten"/&gt; The average sunshine during the normal period was 1,846.3&amp;nbsp;hours per year, the sunniest month being  October with 188.8&amp;nbsp;hours and the darkest being December  with 116.1&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Mittelwerte"/&gt; In 2009 there were 1,836.3&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine, the least occurring in February with just 95.4&amp;nbsp;hours and the most in April with 219&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name="Monatsdaten"/&gt; In 2009, according to the weather survey by the [[German Met Office]], the Zugspitze was the coldest place in Germany with a mean annual temperature of −4.2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Mechthild Henneke: ''Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009''. In: ''[[Südkurier]]'' dated 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest measured temperature on the Zugspitze was −35.6&amp;nbsp;°C on 14 February 1940. The highest temperature occurred on 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9&amp;nbsp;°C. A [[squall]] on 12 June 1985 registered 335&amp;nbsp;km/h, the highest measured wind speed on the Zugspitze. In April 1944 meteorologists recorded a snow depth of 8.3&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/KU/KUPK/Wir__ueber__uns/Praesenz/Wetterwarten/Zugspitze,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Zugspitze.pdf |title=Wetterwarte Zugspitze |publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst | format=PDF |access-date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fz75ff"&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;75ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays, snow completely melts during summer, but in the past snow might resist the summer months, the last case when the snow failed to melt during the whole summer season was in 2000.

=== Geology ===
[[File:Zugspitze 1.jpg|right|thumb|The north face of the Zugspitze seen from the [[Eibsee]] lake]]
All mountain-building strata consists of [[sedimentary rock]]s of the [[Mesozoic]] era, that were originally laid down on the seabed. The base of the mountain comprises [[muschelkalk]] beds; its upper layers are made of [[Wetterstein limestone]]. With steep rock walls up to 800&amp;nbsp;metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper [[Triassic]] that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine [[coralline alga]]e in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ore. These [[mineral]]s were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from the foot of the Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze it can be seen that this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Beulke: ''Alpenvereinsführer Wetterstein''. 4th edition. [[Bergverlag Rother]], Munich 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;20ff, {{ISBN|978-3-7633-1119-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flora ===
The flora on the Zugspitze is not particularly diverse due to the soil conditions, nevertheless the vegetation, especially in the meadows of ''Schachen'', the ''Tieferen Wies'' near Ehrwald, and in the valleys of Höllental, Gaistal and Leutaschtal is especially colourful.

[[File:Eibsee &amp; Zugspitze.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Eibsee]] in front of the Zugspitze: woods on the northern shore]]
The shaded and moist northern slopes of the massif like, for example, the [[Naturwaldreservat Wettersteinwald|Wettersteinwald]], are some of the most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The [[mountain pine]] grows at elevations of up to  1,800&amp;nbsp;metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of [[spruce]] and [[fir]], but [[honeysuckle]], [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]], poisonous [[herb paris]], [[meadow-rue]] and [[Veronica (plant)|speedwell]] also occur here. [[Dark columbine]], [[alpine clematis]], blue and yellow [[monkshood]], [[stemless carline thistle]], [[false aster]], [[golden cinquefoil]], [[round-leaved saxifrage]], [[wall hawkweed]], [[alpine calamint]] and [[Myosotis alpestris|alpine forget-me-not]] flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst [[cinquefoil]], [[sticky sage]], [[butterbur]], [[alpenrose]], [[Turk's cap lily]] and [[fly orchid]] thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. [[Lily of the valley]] and [[Daphne (plant)|daphne]] also occur, especially in the Höllental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPfanzelt|Pfanzelt (1966)]], p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south the scene changes to [[larch]] (mainly in the meadow of ''Ehrwalder Alm'' and the valleys of Gaistal and Leutaschtal) and [[pine]] forests and into mixed woods of [[beech]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]]. Here too, mountain pine grows at the higher elevations of over 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres.

Relatively rare in the entire Zugspitze area are trees like the [[Lime (tree)|lime]], [[birch]], [[rowan]], [[juniper]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]]. The most varied species of [[moss]], that often completely cover limestone rocks in the open, occur in great numbers.

[[Bilberry]], [[cranberry]] and [[cowberry]] are restricted to dry places and [[lady's slipper orchid]] occurs in sheltered spots. Below the [[Waxenstein]] are fields with [[raspberries]] and occasionally [[Fragaria vesca|wild strawberries]] too. The [[alpine poppy]] and [[purple mountain saxifrage]] both thrive up to a very great height. On the scree slopes there are [[Thlaspi|penny-cress]] and [[mouse-ear chickweed]] as well as [[Dryas octopetala|mountain avens]], [[alpine toadflax]], [[Lamiaceae|mint]] and {{illm|Saxifraga moschata|fr|Saxifraga moschata}}. Following snowmelt [[Sedum atratum|dark stonecrop]] and [[snow gentian]] are the first to appear, their seeds beginning to germinate as early as August. Other well-known alpine plants like [[edelweiss]], [[Gentiana|gentian]]s and, more rarely, [[cyclamen]] also flower on the Zugspitze.

=== Fauna ===
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Alpendohle 2.jpg|thumb|[[chough|Alpine chough]]s on the ''Zugspitzeck'']]
The rocks around the Zugspitze are a habitat for [[chamois]], whilst [[Alpine marmot|marmot]]s are widespread on the southern side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently [[alpine chough]]s, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are [[mountain hare]] and the [[hazel dormouse]]. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the [[golden eagle]], [[rock ptarmigan]], [[snow finch]], [[alpine accentor]] and [[brambling]]. The [[Eurasian crag martin|crag martin]] which has given its name to the ''Schwalbenwand'' ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.

The [[viviparous lizard]] inhabits rocky terrain, as does the black [[alpine salamander]] known locally as the ''Bergmandl'', which can be seen after rain showers as one is climbing. Butterflies like [[Apollo (butterfly)|Apollo]], [[Thor's fritillary]], [[Lycaenidae|gossamer-winged butterfly]], [[geometer moth]], [[Erebia|ringlet]] and [[Skipper (butterfly)|skipper]] may be seen on the west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPfanzelt|Pfanzelt (1966)]], p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; The woods around the Zugspitze are home to [[red deer]], [[red squirrel]], [[weasel]], [[capercaillie]], [[hazel grouse]] and [[black grouse]]. On the glaciers live [[glacier flea]]s (''Desoria saltans'') and [[Tardigrade|water bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;116ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glaciers ===
Three of Germany's five glaciers are found on the Zugspitze massif: the [[Höllentalferner]] the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern]] and [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]].

;Höllentalferner
[[File:Höllentalferner E.JPG|thumb|The Höllentalferner in 2009]]
The Höllentalferner lies northeast of the Zugspitze in a [[cirque]] below the Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubiläumsgrat]]'') to the south and the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]. Its accumulation zone is formed by a [[depression (geology)|depression]], in which large quantities of [[avalanche]] snow collect. To the south the ''Jubiläumsgrat'' shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf.htm |title=Höllentalferner |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406025231/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf.htm |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times the Höllentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 [[hectares]]. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period between 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and now has an area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf/htf_topo.htm |title=Fläche und Höhen des Höllentalferners |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913061650/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf/htf_topo.htm |archivedate=13 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Schneeferner
[[File:Nördlicher Schneeferner.JPG|thumb|The Northern Schneeferner and winter sport infrastructure in 2009]]
Southwest of the Zugspitze, between the ''Zugspitzeck'' and [[Schneefernerkopf]], is the Northern Schneeferner which has an eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 hectares (2006) it is the largest German glacier. Around 1820 the entire ''Zugspitzplatt'' was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (''Plattgletscher'') only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable [[terrain]] that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season.

At the beginning of the 1990s, ski slope operators began to cover the Northern Schneeferner in summer with artificial sheets in order to protect it from sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/nsf.htm |title=Nördlicher Schneeferner |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2007/05/18/a0139 |title=Pflaster für den Gletscher. |author=Max Hägler |publisher=taz.de |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Schneeferner reached its last high point in 1979, when its area grew to 40.9 hectares. By 2006 it had shrunk to 30.7 hectares. The glacier head then lay at 2,789 m and the foot at 2,558&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/nsf/nsf_topo.htm |title=Fläche und Höhen des Nördlichen Schneeferners |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Schneeferner is surrounded by the peaks of the [[Wetterspitzen]] and the [[Wetterwandeck]]. It is also a remnant of the once great ''Platt Glacier''. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up as far as the [[arête]] and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared as the snow has receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf.htm |title=Südlicher Schneeferner |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406030143/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf.htm |archivedate=6 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf/ssf_topo.htm |title=Fläche und Höhen des Südlichen Schneeferners |author=Wilfried Hagg |publisher=Bayerische Gletscher |access-date=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caves ===
Below the ''Zugspitzplatt'' [[chemical weathering]] processes have created a large number of [[cave]]s and [[abîme]]s in the Wetterstein limestone. In the 1930s the number of caves was estimated at 300. By 1955 62 caves were known to exist and by 1960 another 47 had been discovered. The first cave explorations here took place in 1931. Other, largest exploratory expeditions took place in 1935 and 1936 as well as between 1955 and 1968. During one expedition, in 1958, the Finch Shaft (''Finkenschacht'') was discovered. It is 131&amp;nbsp;metres deep, 260&amp;nbsp;metres long and has a watercourse. There is a theory that this watercourse could be a link to the [[source (river)|source]] of the River [[Partnach]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;According to this theory there is a lake underneath the ''Zugspitzplatt'' that feeds the Partnach. Calculations show that the ''Platt'' produces 350 litres of water per second; the source of the Partnach however delivers at least 500 (and possibly up to several thousand litres). The difference is put down to a cave lake that also supplies the Partnach.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;136ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lochstein.de/hoehlen/D/bayalpen/all_inn/zugspitze/zugspitze.htm |title=Landschaft und Höhlen des Zugspitzplatts |author=Franz Lindenmayr |access-date=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
[[Image:Schema Umgebung Zugspitze.svg|right|thumb|Surrounding area]]
From the early 14th century, geographic names from the Wetterstein Mountains began to be recorded in treaties and on maps, and this trend intensified in the 15th century. In 1536 a border treaty dating to 1500 was refined in that its course was specified as running over a ''Schartten'' ("wind gap" or "col").&lt;ref name="Hauslauer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Johannes Haslauer |chapter="Nur für sehr geübte Steiger". Voralpinistische Annäherungen an das Wettersteingebirge und die Zugspitze |editor=Walter Theil |title=Alpenvereinsjahrbuch – Berg 2010 |volume=134 |publisher=Alpenvereinsverlag |location=Munich |year=2009 |page=163 |isbn=978-3-937530-50-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century the reference to this landmark in the treaty was further clarified as ''"now known as the Zugspüz"'' (''jetzt Zugspüz genant'').&lt;ref name="Hauslauer"/&gt; The landmark referred to was a wind gap on the summit of the Zugspitze and is used time and again in other sources. During the [[Middle Ages]] ''Scharte'' was a common name for the Zugspitze.&lt;ref name="Hauslauer"/&gt;

The Zugspitze was first mentioned by name in 1590. In a description of the border between the [[County of Werdenfels]] and Austria, it states that the same border runs ''"from the Zugspitz and over the Derle"'' (''von dem Zugspitz und über den Derle"'')&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fritz Schmitt |year=1979 |title=Alpinmonographie: Wetterstein – Täler, Grate, Wände |publisher=Bergverlag Rother |location=Ottobrunn |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to a bridge over the River [[Loisach]]. Another border treaty in 1656 states: ''"The highest Wetterstein or Zugspitz"'' (''"Der höchste Wetterstain oder Zugspitz"'').&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; There is also a map dating to the second half of the 18th century that shows ''"the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] in the County of Werdenfels"''. It covers the Reintal valley from the Reintaler Hof to the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and shows prominent points in the surrounding area, details of tracks and roads and the use pasture use. This includes a track over the then much larger Schneeferner glacier to the summit region of the  Zugspitze. However the map does not show any obvious route to the summit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kurt Brunner &amp; Thomas Horst |url=http://retro.seals.ch/openurl?rft.issn=1015-8480&amp;rft.issue=35&amp;rft.date=2007&amp;lPage=3 |title=Eine Karte des Zugspitzgebiets (18. Jh.) und die Wirrnisse um die Erstbesteigung |journal=Cartographica Helvetica |volume=Heft 35 |year=2007 |pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Zugspitze is probably derived from its ''Zugbahnen'' or avalanche paths. In winter avalanches sweep down from the upper slopes of the massif into the valley and leave behind characteristic avalanche remnants in the shape of rocks and scree.
Near the [[Eibsee]] lake there are several [[land lot|plots of land]] with the same root: ''Zug'', ''Zuggasse'', ''Zugstick'', ''Zugmösel'' or ''Zugwankel''.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; Until the 19th century the name ''der Zugspitz'' ([[grammatical gender|male gender]]) was commonplace. It was described as ''die Zugspitze'' ([[grammatical gender|female gender]]) for the first time on a map printed in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHiebeler|Hiebeler (1985)]], p.&amp;nbsp;252.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''Zugspitz'' is still used in the [[Bavarian dialect]].

== Summit cross ==
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Gipfelkreuz Bayern.jpg|thumb|Summit cross on the Zugspitze]]
Since 1851 there has been a [[summit cross]] on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the erection of a cross on the summit was the priest, Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the [[Hoher Peißenberg]] mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that ''"the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would see that his head too was crowned with dignity."''&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610&amp;nbsp;[[South German gulden|Gulden]] and 37&amp;nbsp;[[Kreuzer (coin)|Kreuzer]], was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14&amp;nbsp;foot high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854.

After 37 years the cross had to be taken down after suffering numerous lightning strikes; its support brackets were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881–1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and  15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There it remained for about 111&amp;nbsp;years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by American soldiers who used the cross as target practice in 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]]. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, a replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where it was flown to the summit by [[helicopter]]. The new cross has a height of 4.88&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;35ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000&amp;nbsp;euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern/wege-und-ziele/zugspitze-gipfelkreuz-einweihung-ID1239715496338.xml |title=Zugspitze – Das Gipfelkreuz steht wieder |publisher=BR-online |access-date=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Zugspitze (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of the summit]]
The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on 27 August 1820. The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl. However, local people had conquered the peak over 50 years earlier, according to a 1770 map discovered by the Alpenverein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1877123,00.html |title=Locals had climbed peak before it was 'conquered' |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 September 2006 | location=London | first=Luke | last=Harding | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, the northern part of the Zugspitze was given to Bavaria as a present by Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary Franz Joseph I as a marriage present to his wife Princess Elisabeth ("Sissi"). Since then the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of Bavaria and later of Germany.

On 7 January 1882 the first successful winter assault on the Zugspitze was accomplished by F. Kilger, H. and J. Zametzer and H. Schwaiger.

Pilot, Frank Hailer, caused a stir on 19 March 1922, when he landed a plane with skids on the Schneeferner glacier. On 29 April 1927 [[Ernst Udet]] succeeded in taking off from the Schneeferner with a [[glider (sailplane)|glider]]; he landed at [[Lermoos]] after a 25-minute flight. The glider had been disassembled into individual parts and transported up the Zugspitze by cable car. In the winter of 1931/32, a post office was set up on the Zugspitze by the German Imperial Post Office or ''[[Reichspost]]''. It still exists today in the ''Sonnalpin'' restaurant and has the postal address: ''82475 Zugspitze''. In 1931, four years after the first glider flight, the first [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] took off from the Zugspitze

In April 1933, the mountain was occupied by of 24 [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]], who hoisted a [[swastika]] flag on top the tower on the weather station. A month later, SA and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] deployed on the Schneeferner in the shape of a swastika. On 20 April 1945 the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] dropped bombs on the Zugspitze that destroyed the valley station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway and the hotel on the ridge. After the war the Allies seized the railway and Schneefernerhaus.

[[File:Above Garmisch-Partenkirchen.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Alpspitze and Zugspitze from Mt. Wank]] 
Shortly after World War II the [[US military]] took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. Room rates, including meals, were US $1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of US $0.25 per hour.

In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (''[[Deutsche Bundespost]]'') began operating a [[Microwave transmission|microwave radio station]] at the summit. In September of that year, three [[artiste]]s walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on a tightrope on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (''Gatterlmesse'') has been held on the ''Gatterl'' mountain to commemorate the four members of the [[Bavarian Border Police]] who died in an avalanche in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zugspitzbahn.at/zugspitzbahn/de/gatterlmesse.html |title=Gatterlmesse 2009 |author= |work=Tiroler Zugspitzbahn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425001015/http://www.zugspitzbahn.at/zugspitzbahn/de/gatterlmesse.html |archivedate=25 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 a fire destroyed the ridge hotel by the mountain station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The [[1976 Friuli earthquake]] was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist feared that the observation tower might collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 a [[chapel]] was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, [[Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], in October on the feast of [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]. On 25 March, an [[automated teller machine]] was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;116ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, the Zugspitze extreme mountain run has been held annually. In July 2008 there were repercussions in the [[mass media|media]] when, as the result of a sudden drop in temperature, two participants died of exhaustion and hypothermia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/450/448184/text/|title=Zwei Tote bei Extrem-Berglauf – Staatsanwaltschaft untersucht Zugspitz-Drama|author=|publisher=sueddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=14 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722115948/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/450/448184/text/|archive-date=22 July 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August 2009 the Swiss, Freddy Nock, walked along a cable of the [[Zugspitze Glacier Cable Car]] from the ''Zugspitzplatt'' to the summit.

== Alpinism ==

=== First ascent ===
[[File:01 Joseph Naus 1824.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Josef Naus in 1824 by H. v. Aggenstein]]
There are several theories about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th-century map describes the route ''"along the path to the Zugspitze"'' (''"ybers blath uf Zugspitze"'')&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives a realistic duration of 8.5&amp;nbsp;hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that [[smuggler]]s used routes over the Zugspitze summit.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, in the course of this work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von Coulon, had reached the summit. Since Coulon worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed on 9 Apr 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; had asked about the route through the Reintal valley to the Northern  Schneeferner. The lieutenant was taking part in a survey exercise by the Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau (''Königlich Bairischen Topographischen Bureau'') for the Atlas of Bavaria (''Atlas von Bayern'') in the [[Werdenfelser Land]]. On 26 August, the three of them climbed in a group together with [[Captain (Army)|Captain]] Jetze and Lieutenant Antlischek up to the shepherd's hut of ''Angerhütte''.

On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier set off for the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they attempted to reach the West Summit along the west ridge. Their first attempt failed, but a second was successful and they finally reached the West Summit around 11:45 am, where they left behind a ''[[bergstock]]'' and cloth to mark their success. A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August they returned to the shepherd's hut at about 3 in the morning. The mountain guide, Tauschl, was given payment of two gulden and 42 kreuzer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;9ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsequent ascents ===
[[File:Max Wolfinger Zug-Spitz am Eib-See 1864.jpg|thumb|The Zugspitze in 1864 (oil by Max Wolfinger)]]
In 1823, Simon Resch and the sheep ''Toni'' became the first to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the mountain guide, Johann Barth. Because Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lit on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed for a third time by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's [[Marie of Prussia|Crown Princess Marie]]. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853, Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze.

The first crossing from the West to the East Summit was achieved in 1857 by Dr.&amp;nbsp;Härtringer from Munich and mountain guide, Joseph Ostler. The Irish brother, Trench, and Englishman, Cluster, succeeded in climbing the West Summit on 8 July 1871 through the Austrian Cirque (''Österreichische Schneekar'') under the guidance of brothers, Joseph and Joseph Sonnweber. The route through the Höllental valley to the Zugspitze was first used on 26 September 1876 by Franz Tillmetz and Franz Johannes with guides, Johann and Joseph Dengg. The first winter ascent of the West Summit took place on 7 Januar 1882; the climbers being Ferdinand Kilger, Heinrich Schwaiger, Josef and Heinrich Zametzer and Alois Zott. The Jubilee Arête (''Jubiläumsgrat'') was first crossed in its entirety on 2 September 1897 by Ferdinand Henning. The number of climbers on the Zugspitze rose sharply year on year. If the summit had been climbed 22 times in 1854, by 1899 it had received 1,600 ascents.  Before the construction of a cable car in 1926 there had already been over 10,000 ascents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;16ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normal routes ===
;Zugspitzplatt via the Reintal or Gatterl
[[File:Reintal vom Gatterl HQ.jpg|thumb|View from the ''Gatterl'' into the Reintal]]
The easiest of the normal routes runs through the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and is that followed during the first ascent. At the same time it is also the longest climb. Its start point is the ski stadium ({{convert|730|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. The route runs through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and along the Partnach river to the Bock Hut ({{convert|1052|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), where the Reintal begins. Above the Partnach, which has meanwhile sunk underground, the route runs up to the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1370|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). From there the climb is relatively gentle to start with, but then becomes steeper. From the hut the track runs through the ''Brunntal'' up to the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{convert|2057|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), which stands on the eastern rim of the ''Zugspitzplatt''. Here it meets the alternative route from Ehrwald via the Gaistal and the ''Gatterl'' at the Reintal Way. The route now runs over the ''Zugspitzplatt'' towards the Northern Schneeferner. The protected section of the climb to the Zugspitze summit begins above the ''Sonn-Alpin'' restaurant at ''Point 2815''. The route climbs through a height of 2,232&amp;nbsp; metres and the true duration is between eight and ten hours.&lt;ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;113f.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Höllental
[[File:Hoellentalangerhuette Richtung Zugspitze.jpg|thumb|View from the Höllentalanger Hut towards the Zugspitze]]
The ascent starts in [[Hammersbach (Grainau)|Hammersbach]] ({{convert|758|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) through the [[Höllental (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] along the ''Hammersbach'' stream. The path runs through the Höllental Gorge (''Höllentalklamm'') and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026&amp;nbsp;metre long gorge with a total length of 288&amp;nbsp;metres. Another 569&amp;nbsp;metres of path was dynamited into the rock in the shape of a half profile, whilst 120&amp;nbsp;metres was led over [[footbridge]]s and  49&amp;nbsp;metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 [[gold mark]]s. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Schwarz |chapter=Der Bau des Höllentalklammweges 1902 bis 1905 |editor=Walter Theil |title=Alpenvereinsjahrbuch – Berg 2009 |volume=Vol. 133 |publisher=Alpenvereinsverlag |location=Munich |year=2008 |page=252ff |isbn=978-3-937530-29-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the ''Stangensteig'' path. After the gorge the route heads for the  [[Höllentalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1381|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), after which it crosses the ''Höllentalanger'' stream. Above that the ''Brett'' is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the ''Grünen Buckel'' the trail runs up to the Höllentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the [[randkluft]] because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a ''[[klettersteig]]'' to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of {{convert|2204|m|ft|abbr=on}}, for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the Höllental route on the ''Riffelsteig'' path from Eibsee. This path crosses the ''Riffelscharte'' wind gap and meets the route before the ''Brett''.&lt;ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Austrian Cirque
A third ascent runs across the Austrian Cirque or ''Österreichische Schneekar''. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee ({{convert|950|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or the village of Ehrwald ({{convert|1000|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The two trails merge above the cirque of ''Gamskar''. Thereafter the routhe continues to the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]] ({{convert|2209|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and through the ''Österreichische Schneekar'', at the end of which a ''klettersteig'' begins. During this section the route climbs through the ''Stopselzieher'', a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs {{convert|2012|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.&lt;ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jubilee Ridge (''Jubiläumsgrat'') ===
[[File:Jubiläumsgrat West HQ.jpg|thumb|Western section of the arête: view from the Middle Höllentalspitze to the Zugspitze]]
One of the best-known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps is the [[Jubilee Ridge]], which runs eastwards from the Zugspitze to the  [[Hochblassen]] ({{convert|2707|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and crosses the Inner ({{convert|2737|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), Middle ({{convert|2740|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and Outer [[Höllentalspitzen|Höllentalspitze]] ({{convert|2716|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) as well as the [[Vollkarspitze]] ({{convert|2630|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Along the way the route branches off towards ''Grießkarscharte'' ({{convert|2463|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and to the Alpspitze ({{convert|2628|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Between 1909 and 1915 the ridge was partially secured with wire cables by the German Alpine Club section at Munich. Originally the route was called the Jubilee Way (''Jubiläumsweg''), but after a tragic rescue attempt in 1979 the rather erroneous and misleading term, which suggested it was just a normal trail, was replaced by the name ''Jubiläumsgrat'', a ''Grat'' being a sharp ridge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchott|Schott (1987)]], p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crossing, which is not a pure ''klettersteig'', several unprotected sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to [[climbing grade]] III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty ([[Klettersteig|D]]). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around  I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer Höllentalspitze is the ''Höllengrat Hut'' ({{convert|2684|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[bothy]] where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the ''Brunntalgrat'' ridge and joins the route in the area of the Inner Höllentalspitze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=1496 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819073802/http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=1496 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 August 2006 |title=Tourenbuch: Jubiläumsgrat Zugspitze |publisher=bergsteigen.at |access-date=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accommodation ===
[[File:WienerNeustaedterHuette.JPG|thumb|The Wiener-Neustädter Hut in 2006]]
There are numerous [[mountain hut]]s in the area of the Zugspitze. One base is the [[Höllentalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1381|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the Höllental valley with 88 [[Matratzenlager|mattress spaces]]. Accommodation in the Reintal is provided by the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{convert|1370|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) with 90 bedspaces and on the edge of the ''Zugspitzplatt'' by the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{convert|2051|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) with 108 bedspaces. The Knorr Hut was the first hut in the entire Wetterstein Mountains when it was built in 1855. All the huts are open from May to October depending on the weather. On the top of the Zugspitze are three more huts: the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]], the [[Münchner Haus]] and the [[Schneefernerhaus]].

;Wiener-Neustädter Hut
The first hut on the Zugspitze was the [[Wiener-Neustädter Hut]] (''Wiener-Neustädter-Hütte'', {{convert|2209|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) built in 1884. It acts as a base for the ''klettersteig'' through the ''Österreichische Schneekar'' that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is operated by the [[Austrian Tourist Club]] and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The [[winter room]] is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities.

;Münchner Haus
{{main article|Münchner Haus}}
[[File:Münchner Haus.JPG|thumb|Münchner Haus in 2005]]
There has been an accommodation hut just underneath the west summit since 1883. At that time the [[Alpine Club section]] at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although further development of the summit for tourism was criticised, more and more members supported the construction of a larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the [[Münchner Haus]] ({{convert|2959|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}). First, in 1896, a 200&amp;nbsp;square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21&amp;nbsp;kilometre long telephone cable and a 5.5&amp;nbsp;kilometre long [[lightning conductor]]. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 people stay there each year, in addition to day visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;89ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Schneefernerhaus
The [[Schneefernerhaus]] ({{convert|2656|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) was built in 1930 as the station of the [[Bavarian Zugspitze Railway]]. In June 1931 the attached [[hotel]] was opened. After the war, US Forces commandeered the house as a "recreation facility". It was not released until 1952 and was then renovated, opening in December that same year. On 15 May 1965 it was hit by a serious avalanche. The avalanche had been triggered above the house and swept over the sun terrace. Ten people lost their lives and 21 were seriously injured. At the end of the 1980s the station was moved and, in January 1992, the hotel and restaurant closed. Between 1993 and 1997 it was extensively converted into a research station, that opened in 1996. During the building work there was a fire in 1994 that completely destroyed the fifth floor and the roof space.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRitschel|Ritschel &amp; Dauer (2007)]], p.&amp;nbsp;69ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==

=== Winter sports ===
[[File:Zugspitze Airview 01.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial photograph]]
For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can be followed to the top. Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days, or a few hours for the very fit.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Food and lodging is available on some trails. In winter the Zugspitze is a popular [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] destination, with several slopes on both sides. The Zugspitzplatt is Germany's highest ski resort, and thus normally has sufficient snow throughout the winter.

=== Climbing ===
At the Zugspitze's summit is the ''Münchner Haus'', a [[mountain hut]] (''Alpenhütte''), a facility built by the [[German Alpine Club]] (''Deutscher Alpenverein''). For more than a hundred years, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the [[Global Atmosphere Watch]].

[[File:Viewfromzugspitze.jpg|left|thumb|View from the Zugspitze platform looking toward [[Austria]]]]
Climbing up the Zugspitze can involve several routes. The large difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is {{convert|2200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, making the climb a challenge even for trained [[mountaineer]]s.

On the [[Germany|German]] side, from [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], climbers go either through the [[Hölle Valley (Wetterstein)|Höllental]] ("Valley of Hell") or the Reintal. The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours. This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic [[gorge]], then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit. Climbers can stay for the night at two alpine huts, the "Reintalangerhütte" or the "Knorrhütte".

The more popular, but harder route is through the Höllental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the Höllentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the "Höllentalangerhütte", where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the [[Höllentalferner]], the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. ''[[Klettersteig]]'' equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours.

From the Austrian village of [[Ehrwald]], there are also two variants. One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard. It includes a ''via ferrata'', and there is a hut called "Wiener Neustädter Hütte" by the Austrian Alpine Club. An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called "Gatterl", joining the Reintal path at the Knorrhütte.
