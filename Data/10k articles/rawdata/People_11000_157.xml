'''Ayi Kwei Armah''' (born 28 October 1939) is a [[Ghanaian]] writer best known for his novels including ''[[The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born]]'' (1968), ''[[Two Thousand Seasons]]'' (1973) and ''The Healers'' (1979). He is also an essayist, as well as having written poetry, short stories, and books for children.

==Early life and education==
Ayi Kwei Armah was born in the port city of [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] in [[Ghana]] to [[Fante language|Fante]]-speaking parents, descending on his father's side from a royal family in the [[Ga people|Ga nation]].&lt;ref name="styles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/armah.htm |title=Ayi Kwei Armah |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410021202/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/armah.htm |archivedate=10 April 2008 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1953 to 1958 Armah attended the Prince of Wales's College (now better known as [[Achimota School]]), and won a scholarship to study in the United States, where he was between 1959 and 1963.&lt;ref name=PAW45&gt;Siga Fatima Jagne and Pushpa Naidu Parekh (eds), "Ayi Kwei Armah (1939–)", in ''Postcolonial African Writers: A Bio-bibliographical Critical Sourcebook'', Routledge, 1998, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Groton School]] in [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], [[Massachusetts|MA]], and after graduating he entered [[Harvard University]], receiving a degree in [[sociology]]. He then moved to [[Algeria]] and worked as a translator for the magazine ''Révolution Africaine''. In 1964, he returned to Ghana, where he was a scriptwriter for Ghana Television and later taught English at the Navrongo Secondary School.

Between 1967 and 1968, he was editor of ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'' magazine in [[Paris]]. From 1968 to 1970, Armah studied at [[Columbia University]], obtaining his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in [[creative writing]]. In the 1970s, he worked as a teacher in [[East Africa]], at the College of National Education, Chang'ombe, [[Tanzania]], and at the [[National University of Lesotho]]. He subsequently taught at the University of Massachusetts in [[Amherst College|Amherst]], Cornell University, and at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He has lived in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], since the 1980s.

In the village of Popenguine, about 70 km from Dakar, he established his own publishing house, Per Ankh: the African Publication Collective,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authorscalendar.info/armah.htm "Ayi Kwei Armah (1939–)"], Books and Writers.&lt;/ref&gt;  through which his own books are now available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stores.bbkwan.com/ "Welcome to Per Ankh Publishers"]. Per Ankh Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Beginning his career as a writer in the 1960s, Armah published poems and short stories in the Ghanaian magazine ''[[Okyeame]]'', and in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''New African''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?id=347&amp;lang=en "Biography of Ayi Kwei Armah"], African Success.&lt;/ref&gt; His first novel, ''[[The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born]]'', was published in 1968, and tells the story of a nameless man who struggles to reconcile himself with the reality of post-independence Ghana.

In ''Fragments'' (1970), the protagonist, Baako, is a "been-to" - a man who has been to the United States and received his education there. Back in Ghana he is regarded with superstitious awe as a link to the Western lifestyle. Baako's grandmother Naana, a blind-seer, stands in living contact with the ancestors. Under the strain of the unfulfilled expectations Baako finally breaks. As in his first novel, Armah contrasts the two worlds of materialism and moral values, corruption and dreams, two worlds of integrity and social pressure.

''Why Are We So Blest?'' (1972) was set largely in an American university, and focused on a student, Modin Dofu, who has dropped out of Harvard. Disillusioned Modin is torn between independence and Western values. He meets a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] black African named Solo, who has already suffered a mental breakdown, and a white American girl, Aimée Reitsch. Solo, the rejected writer, keeps a diary, which is the substance of the novel. Aimée's frigidity and devotion to the revolution leads finally to destruction, when Modin is killed in the desert by OAS revolutionaries.

The trans-Atlantic and African [[slave trade]]s are the subject of Armah's ''[[Two Thousand Seasons]]'' (1973), in which a pluralized communal voice speaks through the [[history of Africa]], its wet and dry seasons, from a period of one thousand years. [[Arab]] and [[European ethnic groups|European]] oppressors are portrayed as "predators," "destroyers," and "zombies". The novel is written in allegorical tone, and shifts from autobiographical and realistic details to philosophical pondering, prophesying a new age.

''The Healers'' (1979) mixed fact and fiction about the fall of the [[Ashanti Empire]]. The healers in question are traditional medicine practitioners who see fragmentation as the lethal disease of Africa.

Armah remained silent as a novelist for a long period until 1995, when he published ''[[Osiris Rising]]'', depicting a radical educational reform group that reinstates [[ancient Egypt]] at the centre of its curriculum.

Belonging to the generation of [[African literature|African writers]] after [[Chinua Achebe]] and [[Wole Soyinka]], Armah has been said to "epitomize an era of intense despair."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fraser, ''The Novels of Ayi Kwei Armah'', Heinemann, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Armah's later work in particular has evoked strong reaction from many critics. While ''Two Thousand Seasons'' has been called dull and verbose, or the product of a "philosophy of paranoia, an anti-racist racism – in short, Negritude reborn"&lt;ref&gt;Bernth Lindfors, in Derek Wright (ed.), ''Critical Perspectives on Ayi Kwei Armah'', 1992, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Soyinka has written that Armah's vision "frees itself of borrowed philosophies in its search for unifying, harmonizing ideal for a distinctive humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Wole Soyinka, ''Myth, Literature and the African World'', 1976, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an essayist, Armah has dealt with the identity and predicament of Africa. His main concern is for the creation of a [[pan-African]] agency that will embrace all the diverse cultures and languages of the continent. Armah has called for the adoption of [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] as the continental language.

[[File:Pinocchio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pinocchio, by [[Enrico Mazzanti]] (1852–1910), the first illustrator (1883) of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'']]
'''Carlo Lorenzini''', better known by the [[pen name]] '''Carlo Collodi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkarlo kolˈlɔːdi}}; 24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), was an [[Italians|Italian]] author, humorist,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|last=Marrone|first=Gaetana|last2=Puppa|first2=Paolo|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781579583903|location=New York|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-Collodi&lt;/ref&gt; widely known for his [[fairy tale novel]] ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.

==Early life==
Collodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826. His mother Angiolina Orzali was a seamstress from the town of [[Collodi (Italy)|Collodi]] from which he took the stage-name and his father, Domenico Lorenzini was a cook and both worked for the Marquis Ginori Lisci.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Collodi was the eldest in the family&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multi-Grade Readers Theatre: Stories about Short Story and Book Authors|last=Barchers|first=Suzanne|last2=Pfeffinger|first2=Charla|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781598848014|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he had 10 siblings but seven died at a young age. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. He lived there with his grandmother. After attending primary school, he was sent to study at a seminary called Colle Val d'Elsa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An account explained that Ginori offered financial aid but the boy found that he did not want to be a priest so he continued his education at the College of the Scolopi Fathers in Florence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales, Children, and the Culture Industry|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0415918502|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he started working at the bookstore Libreria Piatti, where he assisted Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Career==
During the [[Italian unification|Italian wars of Independence]] in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper ''Il Lampione'' in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854 he published his second newspaper, ''Lo scaramuccia'' ("The Controversy").&lt;ref name="JZ"&gt;Jack Zines. «Introduction». In: Carlo Collordi. ''Pinnochio''. Penguin Books 2002. {{ISBN|0-14-243706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenzini's first publications were in his periodicals. A debut came in 1856 with the play ''Gli amici di casa'' and parodic guidebook ''Un romanzo in vapore'', both in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinocchio.it/?idcnt=885&amp;lang=en Carlo Collodi: other works]; pinocchio.it&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860, he published his first notable work called ''Il signor Alberi ha ragione!'' (Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother's hometown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Collodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as ''Il Fanfulla''; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including ''[[Macchiette]]'' (1880), ''[[Occhi e nasi]]'' (1881), ''[[Storie allegre]]'' (1887).&lt;ref name="MarronePuppa2006"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gaetana Marrone |author2=Paolo Puppa |title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA485 |date=26 December 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-45530-9 |pages=485–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterward so he turned to children's literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1875, for instance, he completed ''Racconti delle fate'', a translation of French fairy tales by [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote ''[[Giannettino]]'' (inspired by [[Alessandro Luigi Parravicini]]'s ''Giannetto''), the ''[[Minuzzolo]]'', and ''Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino'', a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character [[Giannettino]].&lt;ref name="MarronePuppa2006" /&gt;

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through [[allegory]]. In 1880 he began writing ''Storia di un burattino'' (''Story of a [[Marionette]]''), also called ''Le avventure di [[Pinocchio]]'', which was published weekly in ''[[Il Giornale per i Bambini]]'', the first Italian newspaper for children.&lt;ref name="MarronePuppa2006" /&gt; Pinocchio was adapted into [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|a 1940 film by Disney]] {{citation needed span|text=that is considered to be one of Disney's greatest.|date=August 2018}}

Lorenzini died in Florence in 1890.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2836">'''Charles Taylor''' (died 1816) was a Manchester [[calico printer]] and dyer, who later became Secretary of the [[Society of Arts]].

==Biography==

Little is known about his origins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson,|first=W. O.|title=Industrial Britain under the Regency|year=1968|pages=169, n43}}&lt;/ref&gt; but  he was an M. D. He was a partner in the Manchester firm of Taylor and Maxwell, [[fustian]] manufacturers, dyers and printer, and was involved with the development of printing machinery for calico in about 1770.  About 1785 Taylor set up a dye-house in Manchester for [[Turkey Red]] dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric |title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor and Maxwell were early experimenters in the use of 'dephlogisticated marine acid' (chlorine) following the work of [[Berthollet]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Scheele|Scheele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Musson, A. E.|first=Robinson, Eric|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution|year=1969|pages=251–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was suggested to Taylor by Dr [[Richard Kirwan]] F.R.S. and according to the article on 'Bleaching' in ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'', which Taylor wrote:
:''... a whole piece of calico, in the state received from the loom, was in the spring of 1788 actually bleached white, printed in permanent colours and produced in the Manchester market ready for sale, having undergone all these operations in less than 48 hours by the joint efforts of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Baker and Mr Taylor, which is perhaps the first time an entire piece, either in France or England, that fully ascertained the real merits of a new mode of bleaching, and certainty that it might be generally useful in commerce.''

In 1788 they took as an apprentice [[James Watt, Jr.]] (1769-1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Revd Dr Richard L.|title=James Watt :adversity through trial|year=2006|publisher=Landmark Publishing|isbn=1-84306-193-7|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor retired from his Manchester business in 1800 and in February of that year was appointed Secretary to the [[Society of Arts]], a post he held until his death in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Society of Arts|year=1818|volume=35|pages=viii–ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Henry Trueman|title=A History of the Royal Society of Arts|year=1913|pages=344–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher J. Scarver''' (born July 6, 1969) is an American convicted [[murder]]er who is best known for murdering serial killer and [[Cannibalism in humans|cannibal]] [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] at [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]], [[Portage, Wisconsin]], in 1994. Scarver used a 20-inch (51&amp;nbsp;cm) metal bar he removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room to beat Dahmer and another convicted murderer, [[Jesse Anderson]]. Both Dahmer and Anderson died later from their injuries. Scarver was sentenced to two further life sentences for the killings. 
==Early life==
Scarver is the second of five children and was born and raised in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; He attended [[James Madison Academic Campus|James Madison High School]] before [[dropping out]] in the eleventh grade.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; Eventually his mother forced him to leave the house because of his increasing [[alcoholism]].

Scarver was hired as a trainee [[carpenter]] in a Wisconsin Conservation Corps job program.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; He said that he had been promised by Edward Patts, a supervisor, that upon completion of this program he would be hired full-time, but Patts was dismissed, and as a result, Scarver's full-time position never materialized.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;

==Murder conviction==
On June 1, 1990, Scarver went to the Wisconsin Conservation Corps training program office and found Steve Lohman, the supervisor who had replaced Edward  Patts. Scarver demanded money from Lohman. When Scarver received only $15 from Lohman, Scarver shot Lohman in the head. At the same time, he demanded money from site manager John Feyen. According to authorities, Scarver said, "Do you think I'm kidding, [[Adolf Hitler|Mr. Hitler]]? I need more money." Scarver shot Lohman twice more before Feyen was able to run away after giving a $3,000 check to Scarver.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sentinel3/&gt; 

Scarver was convicted and sentenced to life in prison&lt;ref name=pioneer/&gt; and sent to the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin]], in 1992.&lt;ref name=sentinel1/&gt; While imprisoned, he complained of experiencing [[messiah complex|messianic delusions]], and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].

==Conduct in prison==
On the morning of November 28, 1994, Scarver was assigned to a work detail with two other inmates, [[Jesse Anderson]] and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], that included cleaning the prison gymnasium toilet. When [[corrections officer]]s left the three unsupervised, Scarver beat the other two men with a {{convert|20|in|cm|adj=on}} metal bar that he had removed from a piece of exercise equipment in the prison weight room. When he returned to his cell early, an officer asked him why he was not still working. During that time two officers found Dahmer and Anderson.&lt;ref name=trib/&gt;&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; Scarver said that Dahmer had taunted other inmates by constructing "severed limbs" out of food and ketchup.&lt;ref name=trib2/&gt;

Dahmer was pronounced dead while on the way to the hospital, while Anderson died two days later. After being found competent to stand trial,&lt;ref name=sentinel2/&gt; Scarver received two more life sentences for these murders.&lt;ref name=trib2/&gt;

In 2005, Scarver brought a federal civil rights suit against officials of the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility&lt;ref name=court/&gt; in which he argued that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to his constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=Poplar/&gt; Scarver stated that he spent 16 months in solitary confinement as a result of the Dahmer killing.&lt;ref name=letters/&gt; A district court judge dismissed the suit against several of the defendants and ruled that the actions of the remaining officials could not be considered unlawful. Scarver unsuccessfully appealed the decision in 2006.&lt;ref name=court/&gt; Later, federal district court judge [[Barbara Crabb]] ordered that Scarver and about three dozen other seriously mentally ill inmates be relocated from the Wisconsin facility. Scarver was eventually relocated to the [[Centennial Correctional Facility]] in Colorado.&lt;ref name=th/&gt;

In 2012, an agent representing Scarver announced that Scarver was willing to write a tell-all book about the killing of Dahmer.&lt;ref name=sjmn/&gt;&lt;ref name=huff/&gt;&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=dj/&gt;

In 2015, Jamie Schram of the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Scarver had believed that Dahmer was unrepentant for his crimes. Schram reported that Dahmer would taunt fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into severed limbs and drizzling packets of ketchup on them to simulate blood. It also reported that, although Scarver had not interacted with Dahmer before killing him, he knew that Dahmer was very unpopular with fellow inmates and had seen him get into several altercations with other prisoners. Scarver was reported to have said that he was revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that he carried in his pocket a news article detailing the atrocities. Immediately before murdering Dahmer, Scarver allegedly presented the newspaper clipping to him and asked him whether the account was true. Scarver was reported to have said that prison staff left him alone with Dahmer because they wanted Dahmer dead and they knew that Scarver hated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schram |first1=Jamie |title=Why I killed Jeffrey Dahmer |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/28/meet-the-prisoner-who-murdered-killer-cannibal-jeffrey-dahmer/ |accessdate=2015-04-29 |work=New York Post |date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 blog post, however, Scarver disputed some of these statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= New York Post's False Reporting |url= https://414scarversolutions.wordpress.com/2015/05/11/new-york-posts-false-reporting/ |accessdate= 2015-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Señal del rey de Aragón en el Libro del conocimiento.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Page of a manuscript of the [[Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms]] (14th century) showing the coat of arms of Aragon.]]

The so-called '''Bars of Aragon, Royal sign of Aragon, Royal arms of Aragon, Four Bars, Red Bars''' or '''Coat of arms of the [[Crown of Aragon]]''', which bear four red [[Pale (heraldry)|paletts]] on gold background, depicts the familiar coat of the [[Kings of Aragon]].&lt;ref name=leon&gt;" Léon Jéquier. Actes du II Colloque international d'héraldique". Breassone.1981. Académie internationale d'héraldique. Les Origines des armoiries. Paris. {{ISBN|2-86377-030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the [[Senyera|flag]] because this latter uses [[fess]]es. It is one of the oldest coats of arms in Europe dating back to a seal of [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Raymond Berengar IV]], Count of Barcelona and Prince of Aragon, from 1150.&lt;ref name=leon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Adam Even. "L'heraldique catalane au moyen age" in Hidalguia, 22, Mayo–Junio 1957. Madrid. p465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palos"&gt;Faustino Menéndez-Pidal. "Palos de oro y gules" in Studia in honorem prof. M. de Riquer (pars quarta). Quaderns Crema.1991.p669. {{ISBN|84-7727-067-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martí de Riquer. "Heràldica catalana: des l'any 1150 al 1550". Quaderns Crema.1982. {{ISBN|84-85704-34-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, this symbol has been adopted and/or included in their arms by several former territories related to the Crown of Aragon, like the [[Coat of arms of Spain|arms of Spain]], which wears it in its third quarter whereas the kings of Spain are heirs of those of Aragon; the shield of [[Andorra]], which also shows it in its third quarter. It is also the main element of the arms of the present Spanish Autonomous Communities of [[Catalonia]], Valencian Community and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the fourth quarter of the Spanish Autonomous Community of [[Aragon]]; of the French regions of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] (Department of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], whose territory regroups the old province of [[Roussillon]] and [[French Cerdagne]]); and in the Italian provinces of [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio de Calabria]], [[Province of Catanzaro|Catanzaro]] in Calabria and [[Province of Lecce|Lecce]] in Apulia. It figures also in numerous located municipal blazons in the territories of the Crown, either by explicit concession of the king, or because they were cities or towns of ''realengo'' (that is, directly dependent on the Crown and subject to no kind of [[manorialism]]); and others outside it, in which case the symbol is because of the presence of the king or knights of the Crown at some moment of their local history.

These pallets of gules are commonly named in popular usage and culture as the ''"red bars"''&lt;ref&gt;«E es cert quel senyal per los molts alts Reys darago atorgat e confermat a la dita Ciutat era e es lur propri senyal Reyal de bastons o barres grogues e vermelles». ''Manual de Consells de 1377'' (Archivo Histórico Municipal de Valencia, años 1375–1383, n. 17, sig. A)&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''"four bars"''.&lt;ref&gt;«Estará formado por dos óvalos: uno exterior de trazo grueso y uno interior de trazo delgado, con las cuatro barras inscritas y sobrepasando el óvalo interior hasta alcanzar el exterior».

==History==
[[File:Arms of Aragonese Monarchs (13th-15 centuries).svg|right|thumb|150px|Version of the coat of arms of the kings, created by the king [[Peter IV of Aragon]], with the blue and white cross flag attributed by the Ceremonious to the old Aragonian kings and the pales of the Aragon Kings and Barcelonian counts.&lt;ref name="libro.uca.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne5.htm|work=A History of Spain and Portugal|title=Chapter Five The Rise of Aragón-Catalonia|accessdate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Originally it was the familiar emblem of the [[Kings of Aragon]] and [[House of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=leon/&gt; In 1137, when [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[County of Barcelona]] merged by [[dynastic union]]&lt;ref name="bison_31"&gt;{{cite book|title=The medieval Crown of Aragon. A short story|chapter=II. The age of the Early Count-Kings (1137–1213) (The Principate of Ramon Berenguer IV 1137–1162)|year=1986|editor=Clarendon Press – Oxford|authorlink=T.N. Bisson|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the marriage of [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]] and [[Petronila of Aragon]], these titles were finally borne by only one person when their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] ascended to the throne in 1162. Slowly the various entities and territories over which the [[House of Aragon]]-[[House of Barcelona|Barcelona]] ruled and came to rule came to be called the [[Crown of Aragon]].

"The new ruler of the united dynasty (Raymond Berenger IV of Barcelona) called himself count of Barcelona and "prince" of Aragón."&lt;ref name="libro.uca.edu"/&gt;

The son of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronila, Alfonso II, inherited both the titles of King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona, in a style that would be maintained by all its successors to the crown. Thus, this union was made while respecting the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories.

It constitutes the third quarter section of the [[Coat of Arms of Spain|coat of arms of the Kingdom of Spain]].

==Theories of origin==

===Theories of Catalan origin===
The oldest ''evidence'' where the arms can be seen is from 1150, in a seal of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0083412 see picture]&lt;/ref&gt; The seal evidence is disputed by some Aragonese authors who claim that the first documented evidence dates from the time of Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona) reign&lt;ref name="gea"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=20407&amp;voz_id_origen=1080 "Palos de Aragón"] Entry on Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa&lt;/ref&gt;

As a pre-heraldic symbol, the ''red bars'' on a yellow background are found on the Romanesque tombs of Barcelona's Count [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'estopes]], who died in 1082, and his great-grandmother Ermessenda, who died in 1058, wife of Count Ramon Borrell I,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedresdegirona.com/capelles_cat_20.htm original Romanesque tomb of Ermessenda]&lt;/ref&gt; both of whose tombs were at the portico of the old Romanesque Cathedral of Girona; it is not sure that the 15 bars of gold appearing in a painting are contemporary to the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;This theory was rejected by the member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués. ''Cfr.'', ''Símbolos de España'' (2000). Madrid: Centro de Estudios Políticos y Constitucionales,  pp. 95–138. {{ISBN|978-84-259-1110-1}}: In 1982 it was given great importance to the discovery of red and golden vertical stripes on the exterior of the sarcofagus of Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'Estopes († 1082) and which is attributted to Ermesenda de Carcasona when opening the tombs of the cathedral of Girona worked (labrado) on century XIV by mandate of Peter IV. It was attempted to present the finding as the definitive proof of the origin of the bars in the counts of Barcelona previous to Ramon Berenguer IV.

What would have been conclusive [is] that those pigments were not used on the XIV [...] It could only be concluded that such paintures are not posterior to 1365, when the sarcofagus was covered with the new tomb [...]

Moreover, the paintures are in a good state of conservation and without retouches[,] how could they have resisted three centuries in its old emplacement on the entry of the temple since the century XI until the XIV? It's very probable that the sarcofagus were decorated by outside, on the said manner, in times of Peter IV; there are news of having procured this king in 1384 heraldic ornamentations of old tombs of his ancestors (RUBIÓ Y LLUCH, Antonio, Documents per l'historia de la cultura catalana mig-eval, II, Barcelona, 1921, p. 296.). But the objection of most weight proceeds from other considerations [...]

It would have to be accepted that were used then emblematic ornamentations on tombs. [...] It doesn't exist, of course, any such case, be it known by material proof or by reference. [...] Pedro IV accepted prolongating the use of his arms to the ascenstors by varony [meaning by male line], that's why were his bars figurated on the new tombs of Gerona. [...] the first authentic testimonial of the arms that use the Kings of Aragon is found on the seals of Ramon Berenguer IV, whose oldest mark is from year 1150. Since in them he titles [himself] already Prince of Aragon, the matrixs result posterior to 1137. On those seals we find already the pallets or bars in the [blocado, I don't know the translation of this word] shield of the equestrian representations of the Count and maybe on the ensign of his lance [...]

The struggle for finding the antecedents is directed to attributing it to the anterior counts of Barcelona, aliens to the Kingdom of Aragon. [...] [Ramon Berenguer IV] was a full right member of the Royal House of Aragon, as the traditional juridic formula of "marriage at home". In {{Citation|author=Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués|title=Símbolos de España|publisher=Madrid: Centro de Estudios Políticos y Constitucionales, pp. 95–138.|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a proof that relates the arms to the Counts of Barcelona lineage and the pre-heraldic forms indicate pre-heraldic times, before the second Third of the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marti de Riquer. "Llegendes històriques catalanes. Quaderns Crema. 2000.pag.16. Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-7727-296-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Aragonese origin===
The exact origin of the ''four bars'' symbol is obscure, and for long it has been explained by legends, now proven false. The first undisputed evidences are from the [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona)]] reign.&lt;ref name="gea" /&gt;

Even though a purely Aragonese origin for the ''four bars'' symbol has been proposed, the main point held by Aragonese authors (Fatás, Ubieto, Montaner), partially supported by some Catalan historians like Ferran de Segarra,&lt;ref&gt;Ferran de Sagarra, ''Sigillografia catalana'', 1932, apud F. Menéndez Pidal de Navascués (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cCLL5mbUA-wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''El escudo de España'']. Madrid: Real Academia Matritense de Heráldica y Genealogía; Hidalguía, p. 107. {{ISBN|978-84-88833-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the key evidence for the Catalan origin, the Marseilles seals, is dubious. The lines in the monochrome Marseilles seals are interpreted as mere scratchings by some, and as representation of a shield reinforcement by others.&lt;ref name="gea" /&gt; This theory was rejected by Aragonese member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez-Pidal.&lt;ref name="palos" /&gt;

A second point put forward by Aragonese authors is that [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] was the ''de facto'' ruler of Aragon, even if only his son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] would become ''[[de jure]]'' king of Aragon. Therefore, any symbol associated with Ramon Berenguer IV can also be attributed to the then budding [[Crown of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="gea"/&gt;

'''Dal Joon Lee''' (born [[May 30]], [[1939]] in [[Wonju]] ([[South Korea]]), † [[September 19]], [[2010]]) was an American [[table tennis]] player. He participated in four world championships in the 1960s and 1970s and won six consecutive [[World Table Tennis Championships|U.S. Open Table Tennis Championships]].

== Career ==
Dal Joon Lee began playing table tennis at the age of 8, after watching his older brothers and sisters. During the [[Korean War]], his father, two brothers and a sister were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/21/archives/king-of-table-tennis.html|title=King of Table Tennis Dal‐Joon Lee|last=Eskenazi|first=Gerald|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued playing table tennis soon after and, through intensive training, became a skilled player. He won the Korean Championship consecutively between 1960 and 1964.

He began playing professionally under the flag of [[South Korea]]. In 1960, he competed in the [[Asian Table Tennis Championships|Asian Championships]], where he came second in the men’s singles tournament, losing to the Japanese player, [[Ichiro Ogimura]]. Previously in the competition, he had won victories against Japan’s [[Nobuya Hoshino]] (then 16th in the [[International Table Tennis Federation#ITTF World Ranking|world rankings]]) and [[Teruo Murakami]] (WRL 4th place).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Boggan]]: [https://d3mjm6zw6cr45s.cloudfront.net/2017/02/SCI_News_Nr_90.pdf ''In Memoriam: Dal-Joon (DJ) Lee, 1939-2010 (USA)'' at Swaythling Club International News] No. 90, March 2011, page 20 (accessed 2 July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Asian Games in 1962, he reached the final in the team competition. In 1964, he became the national South Korean champion. He then emigrated to the [[United States|USA]].

In the mid-1960s, he performed in [[exhibition game]]s along with [[Richard Bergmann]] for the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].

From 1968 to 1973, Lee won the [[List of USA Table Tennis champions|U.S. Open Table Tennis Championships]] six times in a row. Between 1969 and 1975, he was nominated for all four [[World Table Tennis Championships|World Championships]], but never came close to medal ranks.

In the season of 1977/78 he was an active player in Germany for the sports team TSV Selk.

In 1983, he was inducted into the Table Tennis Hall of Fame of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Table-Tennis/History/Hall-of-Fame/Profiles/Dal-Joon-Lee|title=USA Table Tennis Hall of Fame Profile - Dal Joon Lee|work=Team USA|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Dal Joon Lee married Linda Williams in 1967. They had a son together (* 1968). In 1975, he entered into a second marriage with the South Korean table tennis player, He-Ja, who played in the mid-1970s at the [[Bundesliga (table tennis)|German Bundesliga]] club TSV Kronshagen and participated in the [[1979 World Table Tennis Championships]]. From this marriage, Lee had three children.

On Sept. 19, 2010, Lee died of [[Cholangiocarcinoma|bile duct cancer]] at the age of 71.

'''Edmund Sidney Pollock Haynes''' (26 September 1877 &amp;ndash; 5 January 1949), best known as '''E. S. P. Haynes''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] lawyer and writer.

==Biography==

The son of a London solicitor, Haynes was a [[King's Scholar]] at [[Eton College]] and a winner of a [[Brackenbury Scholarship]] at [[Balliol College]].  Haynes practised in the same offices at 9 New Square, Lincoln's Inn, where his father had practised.  A prolific author, he was a well-known figure in London's literary circles from 1900 to his death in 1949. His daughter was novelist [[Renée Haynes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogen, Anna. (2016). ''Women's University Fiction, 1880–1945''. Routledge. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''[[The Servile State]]'' is dedicated to Haynes.

==Skepticism==

Haynes was an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald W. Clark|Clark, Ronald William]]. (1968). ''The Huxleys''. McGraw-Hill. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]], his book ''The Belief in Personal Immortality'' (1913) was skeptical of the claims of [[Parapsychology|psychical research]] and [[afterlife|life after death]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1950). ''A Rationalist Encyclopaedia: A Book of Reference on Religion, Philosophy, Ethics, and Science''. Watts. p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Efraim Zuroff''' (born August 5, 1948) is an American-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] historian and [[Nazi hunter]] who has played a key role in bringing indicted Nazi and fascist war criminals to trial. Zuroff, the director of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] office in [[Jerusalem]], is the coordinator of Nazi war crimes research worldwide for the Wiesenthal Center and the author of its annual "Status Report" on the worldwide investigation and prosecution of Nazi war criminals which includes a [[List of Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center|list of "most wanted" Nazi war criminals]]. &lt;!-- He is especially known for having been involved in the exposure, extradition to Croatia, and conviction in [[Zagreb]] of former [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] commandant [[Dinko Šakić]], who was found living in [[Argentina]]. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Irrelevant for the lede. This content is already presented under [[Efraim Zuroff#Work]] --&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[New York City]], Zuroff moved to [[Israel]] in 1970 after completing his undergraduate degree in history (with honors) at [[Yeshiva University]] and high school studies at [[Yeshiva University High School for Boys]]. He obtained an M.A. degree in Holocaust studies at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the [[Hebrew University]], where he also completed his Ph.D., which chronicles the response of Orthodox Jewry in the [[United States]] to the [[Holocaust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=April 4, 2012|title=Q &amp; A with Dr. Efraim Zuroff|magazine=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami]]|issue=65|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the rescue attempts launched by the [[Vaad Hatzalah|Vaad ha-Hatzala]] rescue committee established by American Orthodox [[rabbis]] in 1939.

In 2000, [[Yeshiva University Press]] and KTAV Publishing House published his study of the history of the [[Vaad Hatzalah|Vaad ha-Hatzala]], which was awarded an Egit Grant for Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Literature by the Israeli General Federation of Labor ([[Histadrut]]) and also received the 1999-2000 Samuel Belkin Literary Award for the best book published by a Yeshiva University alumnus in the field of Jewish studies.

==Career==

===Simon Wiesenthal Center===
In 1978, he was invited to be the first director of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] in [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name=jc20100204/&gt; where he played a leading role in establishing the Center’s library and archives and was historical advisor for the Center’s Academy award-winning documentary ''Genocide''. He returned to [[Israel]] in 1980, where he served as a researcher for the [[U.S. Justice Department]]’s Office of Special Investigations.&lt;ref name=jc20100204/&gt; His efforts assisted in the preparation of cases against numerous [[Nazi war criminals]] living in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=jc20100204/&gt;

He rejoined the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center|Wiesenthal Center]] in 1986 and uncovered the postwar escape of hundreds of Nazi war criminals to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]] and other countries.&lt;ref name=jc20100204/&gt; He continued to coordinate the center's international efforts to bring [[Holocaust]] perpetrators to justice. These efforts have influenced the passage of special laws in Canada (1987), Australia (1989) and Great Britain (1991) which enable the prosecution in those countries of Nazi war criminals.

Since the dismemberment of the [[Soviet Union]] and the fall of [[Communism]], Zuroff has played a major role in the efforts to convince [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]] and other post-Communist societies to confront the widespread complicity of their nationals in the crimes of the Holocaust and to prosecute local Nazi collaborators. His public advocacy on these issues has been instrumental in the submission by Lithuania and Latvia of indictments ([[Aleksandras Lileikis|Lileikis]], [[Kazys Gimžauskas|Gimžauskas]], [[Algimantas Dailidė|Dailidė]]) and/or extradition requests ([[Konrāds Kalējs|Kalējs]], [[Antanas Gecevičius|Gecas]]) against local Holocaust perpetrators.

In 1993, Zuroff was appointed by the then [[Foreign Minister of Israel|Foreign Minister]] [[Shimon Peres]] to serve on the joint Israeli-Lithuanian commission of inquiry established to deal with pardons issued by the authorities of Lithuania, which had recently regained independence, to people suspected of Nazi war crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.lv/books?id=yFoDJUq4qjQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=zuroff+lithuania+1991+rehabilitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MKnV6vgkZf&amp;sig=YnwM77nfsr8thqL3zCgLZLhVxcU&amp;hl=lv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjm-2v1NTeAhUxhqYKHTCfB78Q6AEwAXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=zuroff&amp;f=false|title=Lithuania: The Rebirth of a Nation, 1991-1994|last=Ashbourne|first=Alexandra|date=1999|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739100271|location=|pages=80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has succeeded to date in achieving the cancellation by the Lithuanian authorities of approximately 200 rehabilitations granted to individuals who had participated in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. In 2000 he claimed to have exposed the rehabilitations granted by the government of [[Latvia]] to alleged  Nazi war criminals and has led the efforts to cancel these pardons.

Zuroff played an important role in the exposure, arrest, extradition and prosecution of [[Dinko Šakić]], the former commandant of the [[Ustasha]] [[concentration camp Jasenovac]]. In early October 1999, Šakić, who lived for more than 50 years in [[Argentina]], was sentenced in [[Zagreb]] to 20 years’ imprisonment (which was the maximum penalty under Croatian law at the time) for his crimes in the first-ever trial of a Nazi war criminal in a post-Communist country.
[[File:Predstavnici jevrejske zajednice na obeležavanju 70. godišnjice Novosadske racije.JPG|thumb|Zuroff in Novi Sad on 70th anniversary of [[Novi Sad Raid]].]]

In his book ''Occupation: Nazi-Hunter; The Continuing Search for the Perpetrators of the Holocaust'' (KTAV; Hoboken, 1994), Zuroff chronicles the belated efforts to prosecute Nazi war criminals in western democracies and explains the rationale for such efforts several decades after the crimes. The book was published in German by Ahriman Verlag. Starting in June 1999, Zuroff's activities as a Nazi-hunter were the subject of several television documentaries. The first, entitled ''The Nazi-Hunter'', was produced by [[ZDF]] (German Channel 2) in 1999; the second, entitled ''The Last Nazi-Hunter'', was produced by [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]] (German Channel 1-regional station) in 2004 and the third, ''The Final Hunt for the Nazis'', by [[France 3]] (Channel 3), was broadcast in December 2005.

===Operation Last Chance===
In 2002, together with [[Aryeh Rubin]], the founder of the [[Targum Shlishi Foundation]] of [[Miami, Florida]], Zuroff launched [[Operation Last Chance]], which offers financial rewards for information which will facilitate the prosecution and punishment of Nazi war criminals. To date, the project has been initiated in [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] (all in 2002); [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Austria]] (2003); [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]] (2004) and [[Germany]] (2005). On January 15, 2008, the prize was increased from $10,000 to $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crossland |first=David |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,528540,00.html |title=Operation Last Chance: Nazi Hunters More Than Double Reward to $25,000 |work=Der Spiegel |date=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book on the hunt for Nazi war criminals, ''Chasseur de nazis'' (Paris: Michel-Lafon, 2008), written together with French journalist Alexandre Duyck, continues with the story of the renewed efforts spearheaded by Zuroff to hold Holocaust perpetrators accountable, especially in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, and focuses on the results achieved by "Operation: Last Chance". That book was published in Serbian by the Zavod za udzbenike publishing company under the title ''Lovac na naciste'' in 2009 and in Polish by Wydawnictwo Dolnoslaskie under the title ''Lowca Nazistow'' in 2010.

Zuroff almost completely rewrote the French book about Operation Last Chance in a volume published in English in 2009 by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]: ''Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Efraim |last=Zuroff |title=Operation Last Chance: One Man's Quest to Bring Nazi Criminals to Justice |year=2009 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=0-230-61730-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That book was published in German by Prospero Verlag in late 2011 under the title ''Operation Last Chance; Im Fadenkreuz des "Nazi Jaegers"'' and updated versions were published in 2012 in Serbian, Hungarian, and Finnish. In 2013, Propero Verlag published an updated German version.

In 2006, his exposure in [[Budapest]] of convicted but unpunished Hungarian gendarme war criminal Dr. [[Sándor Képíró]], who was said to be among the officers responsible for the [[1942 raid in Novi Sad|mass murder of approximately 2,000 civilians]] in the city of [[Novi Sad]], led to a criminal investigation against him, with his trial opening on May 5, 2011. A lawsuit by Képíró against Zuroff for libel, was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oster |first=Marcy |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/05/03/3087501/hungarian-court-acquits-zuroff-of-libel |title=Hungarian court acquits Nazi hunter Zuroff of libel |publisher=JTA |date=May 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507064444/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/05/03/3087501/hungarian-court-acquits-zuroff-of-libel |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2011, the first-degree judgment declared Sándor Képíró's innocence, but the prosecution appealed against the sentence. Kepiro died in early September 2011, before the appeal was heard. [[Charles Zentai]], who is accused of murdering an 18-year-old Jew, was located by Zuroff and the Hungarian government asked for his extradition from [[Australia]] to stand trial in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zentai loses appeal against extradition hearing |date=April 16, 2007 | publisher=ABC News | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-04-16/zentai-loses-appeal-against-extradition-hearing/2243306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the not guilty verdict, László Karsai, the leading Hungarian Holocaust historian and son of a Holocaust survivor, criticized Zuroff by saying:
{{block quote|Honestly, I wish Zuroff would stop doing what he's doing. I mean: with this kind of methods he uses, with so little evidence, he tries to drag people through the mire. This can't be done to anyone, can't be done even to a former gendarmerie officer either. Karsai accused Zuroff of being a hysterical, [[narcissistic]] Nazi-hunter, working only to earn a good living, and claimed that the Wiesenthal Center made such a publicity to the case in order to justify its own existence before the sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarhirlap.hu/kronika/megbukott_a_nacivadasz.html Magyar Hírlap - Megbukott a nácivadász]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/07/18/kepiro_itelet/|title=Felmentették Képíró Sándort|first=Miklósi|last=Gábor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aribert Heim====
Zuroff, continued the hunt for the Nazi war criminal [[Aribert Heim]] after [[Simon Wiesenthal]] died in 2005. On July 6, 2008, Zuroff headed to [[South America]] as part of a public campaign to capture [[Aribert Heim]].&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7496715.stm| title=Most-wanted Nazi sought in Chile | publisher=BBC News | date=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated on July 15, 2008, that he was sure Heim was alive and the groundwork had been laid to capture him within weeks.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7506679.stm |title= SS doctor 'still alive in Chile'| publisher=BBC News |date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2009, his hunt for [[Aribert Heim]], who committed war crimes in the Mauthausen concentration camp, was the subject of a BBC documentary entitled ''The Search for Dr. Death'', and a fifth documentary ''Tzayad ha-Natzim ha-Acharon (The Last Nazi-Hunter)'', was broadcast on Israeli Channel 10 on Holocaust Memorial Day in 2012.

Zuroff was lukewarm in his reaction to the reported death of Heim in Cairo in 1992. He observed in February 2009 that:
{{bq|quote=There's no body, no corpse, no DNA, no grave.... Keep in mind these people [Heim's children] have a vested interest in being declared dead - it's a perfectly crafted story; that's the problem, it's too perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7872790.stm |title=Nazi hunters' doubt over 'death' |publisher=BBC News |date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Zuroff concedes, however, that Heim had undoubtedly lived in hiding in Egypt.&lt;ref name="iht.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fisher-Ilan |first=Allyn |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/02/05/us-warcrimes-nazi-idUSTRE5146FY20090205 |title=Nazi-hunters cast doubt over Heim death reports |publisher=Reuters |date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aribert Heim had reportedly killed "hundreds of inmates at the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] concentration camp in Austria by injecting gasoline into their hearts and performing surgery and severing organs without anaesthesia" notes Zuroff.&lt;ref name="iht.com"/&gt; In a 2011 interview he called Heim, "his biggest failure." In the light of fresh revelations about the extent to which the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and West German intelligence co-operated with Nazi criminals after the war, Zuroff said he thought it quite possible that Heim worked for West German intelligence and that this may have been the reason that he was never prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Tony (May 10, 2011). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/time-is-short-in-the-last-nazi-hunters-quest-for-justice-2281625.html "Time is short in the last Nazi hunters quest for justice"]. ''The Independent''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications and other activities===
Over the years Zuroff has published more than 350 articles on various topics relating to the Holocaust, as well as other issues of concern in the Jewish world. His publications have appeared in scholarly journals such as ''[[Yad Vashem Studies]]'', ''[[Simon Wiesenthal Center Annual]]'', ''[[Jewish Political Studies Review]]'', and ''[[American Jewish History]]'', as well as in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]'' (Germany), ''[[die Tageszeitung]]'' (Germany), ''[[Profil (magazine)|Profil]]''(Austria), ''[[Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'', ''[[Jerusalem Report]]'', ''[[Maariv]]'', ''[[Haaretz]]'', ''[[Yediot Achronot]]'', ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', ''[[Eretz Acheret]]'', and other publications.

Zuroff has lectured extensively to audiences all over the world regarding the efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. During the years 1992-1999, he served in the Education Corps of the Israeli Defense Forces (reserves) and lectured to thousands of soldiers about his work.

In 1995 and 1996, Zuroff was invited to [[Rwanda]] to assist the local authorities in their efforts to bring to justice the perpetrators of the genocide which took place in that country in spring 1994, and he has served as an official advisor to the Rwandan government.

==Honors==
In recognition of his efforts as a Nazi-hunter and Holocaust scholar, Zuroff was nominated by Serbian President [[Boris Tadić]] and the members of parliament of the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] as a candidate for the 2008 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

On January 22, 2009, he was granted the honorary citizenship of the Serbian city of [[Novi Sad]], in appreciation for the exposure of Sándor Képíró, who allegedly helped organize the murder of the city's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2009&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=56545 |title=Zuroff Novi Sad honorary citizen |publisher=B92 |date=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2010, Zuroff was decorated with the [[Order of Duke Trpimir]] by Croatian President [[Stjepan Mesić]] for special contributions against historical revisionism and for the reaffirming of antifascist foundations of the modern Republic of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_02_18_416.html |work=[[Narodne novine]] |title=Odluka kojom se odlikuje Efraim Zuroff Redom kneza Trpimira s ogrlicom i danicom |date=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2017, the President of Serbia [[Tomislav Nikolic]] awarded the Gold Medal for Merit to Dr. Efraim Zuroff&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lzb.lt/en/2017/02/21/serbian-president-awards-efraim-zuroff-gold-medal/ Serbian President Awards Efraim Zuroff Gold Medal]{{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for "exceptional achievements" and his "selfless dedication to defending the truth about the suffering of Jews, and also Serbs, Roma and other nations during World War II".&lt;ref&gt;[https://israelnewsonline.org/nazi-hunter-awarded-gold-medal-by-serbian-president/ Nazi hunter awarded gold medal by Serbian president]{{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Shippagan]], [[New Brunswick]] and received a teaching certificate from the Moncton Technical Institute. Before entering politics, Robichaud was a teacher and businessman. He served on the municipal council for [[Saint-Louis-de-Kent, New Brunswick|Saint-Louis-de-Kent]] from 1971 to 1974.

Robichaud was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] representing the [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] of [[Westmorland—Kent]], New Brunswick.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 election]], he was re-elected representing [[Beauséjour (electoral district)|Beauséjour]].

In 1990, he resigned his seat in order to allow newly elected [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader [[Jean Chrétien]] to enter the House of Commons through a [[by-election]].

Robichaud served as Special Assistant to the [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] until returning to the House in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1578">'''Floksmenn''' is a [[Folklore|folktale]] from the [[Faroe Islands]]. 

The story centers on  the easternmost village  of [[Hattarvík]] on  [[Fugloy]] during  the [[Middle Ages]]. The tale of the Floksmenn is of a ''flok'' or group  of [[rebels]]. The most notorious of the rebels, (as the Danish governmental and officials in [[Tórshavn]] referred to them) were '''Høgni Nev''', '''Rógvi Skel''', '''Hálvdan Úlvsson ''' and '''Sjúrður við Kellingará''' from the village of [[Hattarvík]]. These men controlled and savaged the northern parts of the Faroe Islands for a long time. This is one of the most important [[separatist]] tales of the Faroe Islands. 

The more intelligent Sjúrður við Kellingará was forced to go the more militant way of rebellion by Høgni Nev and Hálvdan Ulvsson, who were more criminally-minded than Sjúrður við kellingará. All four men were later caught and sentenced to death, but Sjúrður við kellingará was shown mercy and granted amnesty. The story is that he could not live with the crimes that he and the others had committed under their "little" rebellion and asked to be executed with the other floksmenn.

[[File:Gaetano_Arturo_Crocco.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gaetano Crocco on an unknown date]]
'''Gaetano Arturo Crocco''' (26 October 1877 – 19 January 1968) was an Italian scientist and aeronautics pioneer, the founder of the Italian Rocket Society, and went on to become [[Italy]]'s leading space scientist. He was born in [[Naples]].

In 1927, Crocco begun working with [[solid-propellant]] [[rocket]]s and, in 1929, designed and built the first [[liquid rocket propellants|liquid-propellant]] rocket motors in Italy. He began work with [[monopropellant]]s (fuel and [[oxidizer]] combined in one chemical liquid) in 1932, making him one of the first researchers in this field.

As head of the School of [[Aeronautics]] of the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], he performed research on flight mechanics, structural design, and high-altitude flight in addition to his work in [[rocket propulsion]].

Because of his early efforts in aeronautics, Italian satellites were launched starting in the 1960s.
The [[San Marco programme]] was a cooperative effort of [[NASA]] and the Italian Space Commission, with NASA providing launch vehicles, use of its facilities, and training of Italian personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/San_Marco_satellites.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aeronautical space activities ==

G.A. Crocco is a pioner both in aeronautics and astronautics. In 1898 he was serving in the Italian Army Engineers Corps in the Wireless Dept. when he met Captain [[Maurizio Moris]]. Moris, heading a Specialists Brigade, was deeply interested in the new field of aeronautics: he took Crocco in his staff starting a lifelong cooperation. At the time the Specialists Brigade was testing anchored balloons on the Bracciano Lake, north of Rome.  Since 1904 Crocco started experimenting with airships. In 1906, together with Ottavio Ricaldoni he developed Airship 1 featuring a revolutionary semi-rigid flexible structure. On October 31, 1908, piloting an improved version of the airship, the N1, supplied with a rudder and direction indicators, Crocco flew from Vigna di Valle to Rome and back, covering 50 miles in one hour and a half. N1 was the first airship ever to fly over Rome at an attitude of 500 mt (1500&amp;nbsp;ft). In 1912 Crocco and Rinaldoni tested an hydroplane on the Bracciano lake while experimenting with airships together with other researchers (one of them, Umberto Nobile, would become eventually a famous polar explorer). In the meantime Crocco kept studying propellers’ shapes and sections and in 1914 drew plans for a closed-circuit wind tunnel to be built in Rome. In 1923 Crocco started studying space flight, jet propulsion and rocket fuels. In 1927 the Aeronautic Experimental Institute where Crocco was working, obtained a 200,000 ItL financing (equivalent to today’s 1million Euro) to develop black-powder-fuelled rockets to be tested later in a BPD firing range at Segni, east of Rome. He moved onto research on liquid fuels, drawing plans for the first Italian-built combustion chamber, tested in 1930 with the help of his son, Luigi Crocco. The outbreak of WWii and lack of financing confined Crocco to academic activities: he directed the Aeronautic Engineering School from 1935 to 1942 and then again from 1948 to 1952, when [[Luigi Broglio]] succeeded him in the post. In those years Crocco wrote hundreds of papers and patented so many inventions that his students used to say in mock poetry "Everything I use or see, Oh my Crocco is made by thee." 

After WW II Crocco went back to his old passions, missiles and astronautics, creating in 1950 an informative course on superior ballistics within the Aeronautic Engineering School. In the inaugural speech he spoke extensively on man-made satellites and rocket trajectories. In  1951 he founded the Italian Rocket Association (AIR) to rally all the fans of the new astronautic science. In 1951, a full decade before the [[Gagarin]] space flight, he held a meeting on the problems of a manned spaceship re-entry in the atmosphere. Later on he devised a [[Multistage rocket#Tandem vs parallel staging design|parallel-stage rocket]], a method more rarely applied than tandem stages. 

== The ‘Crocco Mission’ or ‘Crocco Grand Tour’ ==
 
In 1956 Crocco, more than 80 years old, produced what is considered his most important contribution to world astronautics: in his “One-Year Exploration-Trip Earth-Mars-Venus-Earth” paper presented at the Seventh Congress of the International Astronautical Federation IAF, Rome, in 1956, he suggested exploiting the Mars and Venus gravitational fields as propelling forces to cut dramatically the travelling time of a space capsule. This ‘gravitational slingshot’ or ‘[[gravity assist]]’ or ‘swing-by’ method was such that the [[NASA]] recommended the study of his theories and especially his swing-by maneuvers contracting firms working on interplanetary flight and its perspectives.

Basing his calculations on Hohmann’s orbit, the sci-fi writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] had stated once that an Earth to Mars flight with a minimum fuel consumption would require at least 259 days. Then another 425 days should elapse on the Red Planet to re-align the planets so as to travel back again in 259 days. Crocco deemed this period too long and drew his own calculations exploiting Mars gravity pull to fly over the planet without landing. Mars gravity would deflect the spaceship’s trajectory towards the Earth cutting the flight’s overall length to less than a year, the only objection being the poor quality of data gathered passing over Mars at an altitude of more than a million miles. But, Crocco added, should the spaceship be re-directed towards Venus and not the Earth, it would fly over Mars at a much  closer range: observation by the astronauts would be much more satisfactory, and moreover they could observe Venus as well, still keeping the trip’s time under a year. He calculated 113 days from Earth to Mars, 154 to reach Venus from Mars and 98 days from Venus back to Earth and affirmed that the first occasion for this ‘Crocco Grand Tour’ would be occurring in 1971.  Such missions have not been attempted but many interplanetary [[space probe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have used similar [[gravity assist]] manoeuvres.

'''George Morren''' or '''Georges Morren''' (20 July 1868-21 November 1941†) was a [[Belgian]] sculptor, [[Impressionist]] and engraver.

== Career ==
George Morren, third child of A.H. Van der Wouwer, and Arthur Morren, a wealthy merchant of grain in Antwerp, was born in [[Ekeren]], the northern district of Antwerp, during the reign of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]. He grew up in a bourgeois and [[Francophile]] family. His upbringing included an artistic education. The painter and friend of the family [[Emile Claus]] who taught him and his brothers several times a week served as his first mentor. In 1888 Claus convinced Arthur Morren to enter his son at the [[Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen]] but he left after a short time, disliking the conformist teaching methods.&lt;ref  name="rkd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/57822|title=Netherlands Institute for Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888 he moved to Paris, where he frequented the studios of Alfred Roll, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Eugène Carrière. He began working in an Impressionist style. In 1889 Morren was acquainted with [[Henry van de Velde]]. Thanks to van de Velde, he attended the trade fairs in Brussels, the exhibitions of the [[Les XX|Société des Vingt]], the art exhibitions of the freelance painters in [[Paris]] ([[Third French Republic]]) and the Belgian and foreign artists of the [[Avantgarde]]. Under the influence of Henry van de Velde, Morren made some works between 1890 and 1892, featuring closely and regularly spaced dots of contrasting color, conforming to [[Pointillism|pointilist]] theories of the French painter [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref  name="Benezit Dictionary of Artists"&gt;{{cite book|title=Benezit Dictionary of Artists|isbn=978-0199773787|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1892, eschewing the shortened painting process which was associated with [[Neo-Impressionism]], he began to work in a more spontaneous manner, creating more space for emotions. Influenced by the ideas of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] painters [[William Morris]] and [[Walter Crane]], both advocates of applied art, he took part between 1893 and 1900 in the creation of jewelry, articles of daily use, wallpaper, etc. During this time, he also completed his artistic training in Paris. He was active in the [[Atelier]] of French painters [[Alfred Philippe Roll]], [[Eugène Carrière]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Henri Gervex]]. He became one of the most eager admirers of the French Impressionists.  After three years in Paris he returned to Antwerp where he participated in several avant-garde groups, particularly Als ik Kan, L’Association pour l’Art, [[La Libre Esthétique]] and Eenigen. In the latter he was a founder-member in 1902. Morren created light-flooded paintings, exhibited at the fairs [[La Libre Esthétique]] in Brussels, the 'Vie et Lumière', and at numerous international exhibitions between 1895 and 1913. Contributing to [[Luminism (Impressionism)|Luminism]] he reached the summit of his second major artistic period between 1904 and 1907 ('' Le mois des roses et L'été '') which ended on the eve of the [[World War One]].&lt;ref name="George Morren (Critique d'Art)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Bernard (Critique d'art.)|title=George Morren|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lhn0ZwEACAAJ|year=1950|publisher=A l'enseigne de la sirène}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 he married Juliette Melges. The couple lived in Antwerp for ten years before moving to Brussels in 1910. He also acquired a property in France, near the town [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. It was in this idyllic environment, not far from the estates of the French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] whom he visited several times where he spent most of his time. Towards 1913, he entered a new creative period. The colors in his new works were more subdued. He used grated rough [[pigments|pigment]] and [[pastels]]. Morren remained faithful to impressionist ideals and did not participate in new trends, such as [[Cubism]] or [[Expressionism]]. He dealt with the scenes of everyday life ('La pergola', 1929), interiors, still lifes ('' Pivoines '', 1919), landscapes and portraits. His palette became darker and his paintings developed a solemnity and clarity of expression ('Le sommeil', 1922).&lt;ref name="Benezit Dictionary of Artists" /&gt;

He returned to Belgium in 1926 exhibiting works from his entire creative period in the Galerie Georges Giroux in Brussels. The press unanimously praised the [[retrospective]] but it drew less attention from the public. In 1931 a new retrospective took place at the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles]]. This time the exhibition was a great success and attracted a wide audience.&lt;ref name="Benezit Dictionary of Artists" /&gt;

In a letter of 1934 he wrote that he had destroyed or altered some of his earlier works. In his last creative period ('' période de synthèse '') he turned to a smooth painting style. The lacquer layer used is thin and distributed over a large area similar to a [[watercolor]]. If some form of Impressionism occasionally appeared in the landscapes, it showed less glimmer. Color was increasingly used independently of the play of light and shadows disappeared. More emphasis was placed on the aesthetics of the transient with constantly changing color variations ('' Le bâton de rouge '', 1941).&lt;ref name="George Morren (Critique d'Art)" /&gt;

In 1936 his wife died. A year later, he married Orpha Demets (Born November 1911). George Morren died in his home in Brussels on the 21st of November 1941 during his preparation for a new retrospective at the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels. This took place in April 1942. It was overshadowed by the German occupation during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Benezit Dictionary of Artists" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5661">{{lang|mga|'''Glewlwyd Gafaelfawr'''}}; "Brave Grey Mighty Grasp," is a hero, warrior and porter in [[Welsh mythology|tradition]] and [[Arthurian mythology]], in which he appears as a knight in [[King Arthur|Arthur's]] retinue and chief gatekeeper of his court. He is one of the earliest characters to be associated with Arthur and appears in a number of texts, including ''[[Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch ac Olwen]]'', ''[[Three Welsh Romances|Geraint fab Erbin]], [[Three Welsh Romances|Iarlles y Ffynnon]], Pa Gur yv y Porthur'' and the [[Welsh Triads]]. 

==Role in Welsh tradition==
===''Culhwch ac Olwen'', and ''Pa Gur yv y Porthaur''===

After being cursed by his [[stepmother]] such that he may marry no one but [[Olwen]], daughter of the giant [[Ysbaddaden]], [[Culhwch|Culhwch ap Cilydd]] seeks assistance from his cousin Arthur to win her hand in marriage. He arrives at his court at [[Celliwig]] but is denied by the Glewlwyd, the chief porter. Culhwch threatens to wreak havoc unless he is granted entry to the court and, eventually, Glewlwyd relents. In a bombastic speech given in this tale, Glewlwyd recounts his history to Arthur, in which he claims to have been in different exotic locations across the world and [[Otherworld]], often alongside Arthur:

{{cquote|
:''Two thirds of my life have gone by and two thirds of yours''

:''I have been in Caer Se and Asse, in Sach and Salach'',

:''In Lotor and Ffotor, in Greater [[India]] and Lesser India''

:''And in the battle between the two Ynyrs when the twelve hostages were brought from [[Norway]]''.

:''I have been in [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], in the islands of [[Corsica]]'',

:''In Caer Brythwch and Brythach and in Nerthach''.

:''I was there when you overcame the troops of Gleis son of Merin, when you killed Mil the Black the son of  Dugum''.

:''I was there in the eastern part of the world when you conquered [[Greece]]'',

:''in Caer Oeth and Anoeth, and in Caer Nefenhyr.''

:''We have seen handsome noble-looking men but I have never seen a man like the one who now stands at the entrance of the gate.''&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Culhwch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Culhwch]] entering Arthur's Court in the Welsh tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', 1881]]

This passage is closely related to the narrative of the tenth-century poem {{lang|mga|'''[[Pa gur|Pa Gur yv y Porthaur]]'''}}; "What man is the porter," in which Glewlwyd is the titular gatekeeper of fortress to which Arthur and his men are seeking admittance. To prove their right of entry Arthur relates the feats and achievements of his men; particularly those of [[Sir Kay|Cai]] and [[Bedivere|Bedwyr]].

Later on in ''Culhwch ac Olwen'', Glewlwyd leads his servants during the [[Hunting of Twrch Trwyth|hunt]] for the man-turned-boar, [[Twrch Trwyth]], and three of them, Huandaw, Gogigwr and [[Penpingion]], are killed in the process, mortally wounded by the quarry. Glewlwyd is left with Llaesgymyn, "a man who was no use to anyone" as  his sole remaining servant.
&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===

Glewlwyd is named twice in the [[Welsh Triads]]. He is listed as one of the twenty-four ordained knights of Arthur's court and is regarded as one of the "Three Offensive Knights of Arthur’s Court", alongside [[Sanddef]] and [[Morfran]]. They are known as the offensive knights because it is "repugnant to anyone to refuse them anything: Sanddef because of his beauty, Morfran because of his ugliness, and Glewlwyd because of his size and his strength and his ferocity." He is further named as the lover of Dyfyr Golden-Hair, one of the Three Famous Maidens of Arthur's Court.&lt;ref&gt;(Davies, Sioned. The Mabinogion, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 254.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Three Welsh Romances|The Lady of the Fountain]]'', the tale of the knight [[Owain mab Urien|Owain]], Glewlwyd is present at Arthur's court at [[Caerleon]], once again in the role of gatekeeper, "greeting guests and foreigners, beginning to honour them, telling them the customs and habits of the court, and informing those who had the right to go to the hall or chamber or who merited lodging."&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the romance of ''[[Three Welsh Romances|Geraint fab Erbin]]'', Glewlwyd is once again chief gatekeeper at Caerleon, although it is stated "he did not trouble himself over this service except on one of the three important festivals."&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, Jeffrey. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the rest of the year, his duties are shared by his seven assistants: Gryn, [[Penpingion]], Llaesgymyn, Gogyfwlch, Gwrddnei Cat-Eye, Drem ap Dremidydd and Clust fab Clusfeinydd.

Glewlwyd is further mentioned in satirical fifteenth or sixteenth parody, ''Araith Iolo Goch'', in which a certain "amorous-mannered, grief-pallored, pale-cheeked youth" from [[Gwynedd]] seeks the heart of a maiden from [[Powys]]. In a conversation between the lady and her suitor, Glewlwyd's great strength is alluded to. Glewlwyd is described as "the man who lifted the cauldron down from the fire with one hand in the court of Toron of the three islands of Britain, with the sliced meat of seven oxen boiling in it". Whether or not this refers to a genuine tradition concerning Glewlwyd's exploits, or is merely an invention on the author's part, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/themabinogi/araithiologoch] ''Araith Iolo Goch''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28975">In the modern world, [[personal names]] among people of [[Greek language]] and [[Greek culture|culture]] generally consist of a [[given name]], a [[patronymic]] and a [[family name]]. 

==History==
[[Ancient Greek personal names|Ancient Greeks generally had a single name]], often qualified with a patronymic, a clan or tribe, or a place of origin. Married women were identified by the name of their husbands, not their fathers.

Hereditary family names or surnames began to be used by élites in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. Well into the 9th century, they were rare. But by the 11th and 12th centuries, élite families often used family names.&lt;ref&gt;Donald M. Nicol, ''The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits, 1250-1500'', 1996, {{isbn|0521576237}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander P. Kazhdan, Michael McCormick, "Social Composition of the Byzantine Court", ''in'' Henry Maguire, ed., ''Byzantine Court Culture from 829 to 1204'', 2004, {{isbn|0884023087}}, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Family names came from placenames, nicknames, or occupations.&lt;ref name="odfn"&gt;Patrick Hanks, Richard Coates, Peter McClure, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland'', 2016, {{isbn|0192527479}}, p. lii&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear when stable family surnames became widely used. Though élite families often had stable family names, many of the "last names" used by Greeks into the 19th century were either patronymics or nicknames. It is also possible that family names were simply not recorded because [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administrative practice preferred patronymics, and did not require surnames.&lt;ref&gt;Hamish Forbes, "Early modern Greece: liquid landscapes and fluid populations" ''Hesperia Supplements'' '''40''': 111-135 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, patronymic surnames became common.

For personal names, from the first century CE until the nineteenth century CE, [[paganism|pagan]] names from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] were mostly replaced by names from [[Christian]] scriptures and tradition. With the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]] and the development of [[Greek nationalism]], names from antiquity became popular again.&lt;ref name = Mackridge&gt;[[cite|Peter Mackridge, ''Language and National Identity in Greece, 1766-1976'', Oxford, 2009, p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family names may be patronymic in origin or else based on occupation, location, or personal characteristic. These origins are often indicated by prefixes or suffixes. Traditionally a woman used a feminine version of her father's family name, replacing it with a feminine version of her husband's family name on marriage. In modern Greece, a woman keeps her father's family name for life but may use a husband's name. 

In official documents in modern Greece, people are given three names: a given name, a patronymic and a family name. 

==Given names==
Until the late 18th century, almost all Christian Greeks were named for [[Saint#Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox saints]] from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments and early [[Christian]] tradition. Since then, names of both deities and mortals from antiquity have been popular as well.&lt;ref name = Mackridge/&gt;

Male names usually end in -ας, -ης, and -ος, but sometimes ancient forms are also used. Female names almost always end in -α and -η, though a few end in -ώ with -ου being possible.

Since antiquity, there has been a strong tradition of naming the first son after the paternal grandfather and the second after the maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;"Naming practices" in British Academy and Oxford University, ''Lexicon of Greek Personal Names'', [http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/practices.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a continuation of names in the family line.

There is a strong clustering of first names by locality according to patron saints, famous churches or monasteries. Examples include:
* ''Spyridon'' and ''Spyridoula'' in [[Corfu]], 
* ''Gerasimos'' in [[Kefalonia]], 
* ''Dionysia'' and ''Dionysios'' in [[Zakynthos]], 
* ''Andreas'' and ''Andriana'' in [[Patras]], 
* ''Markella'' and ''Markos'' in the Aegean Islands, long under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule,
* ''Savvas'' among families from [[Asia Minor]],  
* ''Emmanuel'' or ''Manolis'', ''Joseph'' or ''Sifis'', ''Manousos'', and ''Mēnas'' in [[Crete]].
* ''Tsambikos'' or ''Tsampika''/''Mika'' in [[Rhodes]].

When Greek names are used in other languages, they are sometimes rendered phonetically, such as ''Eleni'' for Ἑλένη, and sometimes by their equivalents, like ''Helen'' in English or ''Hélène'' in French. In the United States, there are also [[Anglicization of names#Greek given names|conventional anglicizations]] based on phonetic similarity rather than etymology, for example James or Jimmy for Δημήτρης/Dimitris (nickname Ντίμης/Dimi, hence Jimmy), when the English name James is a derivative of Ἰάκωβος/ Iakovos.

== {{Anchor|Greek_surnames}}Family names==

Greek family names are most commonly patronymics but may also be based on occupation, personal characteristics or location. The [[feminine gender|feminine]] version is usually the [[genitive case|genitive]] of the family name of the woman's father or husband; so, for example, Mr. Yannatos and Mrs. [[Savina Yannatou|Yannatou]].

As a result of their codification in the Modern Greek state, surnames have [[Katharevousa]] forms even though Katharevousa is no longer the official standard. Thus, the Ancient Greek name Eleutherios forms the Modern Greek proper name Lefteris. In the past, people in speaking used the family name followed by the given name, so John Eleutherios was called Leftero-giannis. In modern practice he is called Giannis Eleftheriou, where Giannis is the popular form of the formal Ioannis but Eleftheriou is an archaic genitive. For women the surname is usually a Katharevousa genitive of a male name, whereas back in Byzantine times there were separate feminine forms of male surnames, such as ''Palaiologína'' for ''Palaiológos'' which nowadays would be ''Palaiológou''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hart, Anne |title=Search Your Middle Eastern And European Genealogy: In The Former Ottoman Empire's Records And Online |publisher=ASJA Press |location= |year=2004 |page=123 |isbn=0-595-31811-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimitri.8m.com/surnames.html|title=Main page|accessdate=19 December 2008|work=Database of Greek surnames|publisher=Dimitrios J.|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122022220/http://dimitri.8m.com/surnames.html|archive-date=22 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, women would change their surname on first marrying to that of their husband in the genitive case, so marking the change of dependence to husband from father. In early Modern Greek society, women were named with ''-aina'' as a feminine suffix on the husband's given name, for example "Giorgaina" signifing "wife of George". Nowadays, a woman's surname does not change upon marriage but she can use the husband's surname socially. Children usually receive the paternal surname, though some children receive the maternal surname in addition or exclusively.&lt;ref name=oxnames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgpn.ox.ac.uk/names/modern.html |title= The Transition of Modern Greek Names |accessdate=19 December 2008|work= Lexicon of Greek Personal Names |publisher=Oxford University|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In official documents, the father's name in the genitive will be inserted between a person's first and last names. For example, if John Papadopoulos has a daughter named Mary and a son named Andrew, they will be referred to as ''María Ioánnou Papadopoúlou'' and ''Andréas Ioánnou Papadópoulos''. If Mary then marries George Demetriádes, she may retain her original name or choose to be called ''María Geōrgíou Demetriádou''.  If she is widowed, she will revert to her father's patronymic but retain her husband's surname to become ''María Ioánnou Demetriádou''.

'''Herbert Chevalier Haseltine''' (1877–1962) was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[France|French]]/[[United States|American]] [[animalier]] [[sculpture|sculptor]], most known as an [[Equestrian sculptor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artist.christies.com/Haseltine-Herbert-1877-1962-26164.aspx|title=Herbert Haseltine|publisher=''[[Christie's]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stahl |first=Joan |title=American Artists in Photographic Portraits: From the Peter A.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Rome]], then still Lazio and not part of Italy as such, the son of the wealthy [[United States|American]] landscape painter [[William Stanley Haseltine]] (1835–1900) who was  associated with the [[Hudson River School]] and [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]], he studied at [[Harvard University]]. After graduating in 1899, Haseltine went to [[Munich Academy]] in [[Germany]] to study drawing and then to the [[Académie Julian]] in [[Paris, France]] where he studied painting.

==Career==
After his first piece of sculpture met with success, he pursued that artistic avenue. Inspired by the gathering of artists from around the world to the [[Montparnasse Quarter]] of Paris, Haseltine chose to make Paris his home for the next thirty-five years until the [[German occupation of France during World War II]]. He moved to the United States where he remained until 1947 at which time he returned to France.
[[File:Sir John Dill statue@arlington nation cemetery.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Equestrian statue]] of Sir [[John Dill]] statue at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] by Haseltine.]] In 1940 he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1946.

Haseltine sculpted a variety of animals but is best known for his equestrian sculptures, most notably the 1934 life-size statue of the [[thoroughbred]] [[race horse]] [[Man o' War]] at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] and "George Washington on Horseback", [[Bronze|Gilded bronze]] statue at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] made in 1959.&lt;ref name="George Washington on Horseback"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculptures! | year=1993 | title=George Washington on Horseback(sculpture)  | work=SOS! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!6543~!0#focus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also traveled to India, where he made an oversized statue of one of the ancestors of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Nawanagar State|Nawanagar]],  Jam Shri Rawalji in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159479392 |title=A model of the monument to Jam Shri Rawalji:  plaster with gilding and polychrome |publisher=''[[Sotheby's]]'', New York }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can still be seen there. He replicated many of his large works in table-top sizes. The author of a number of books on animalier art, Haseltine was well connected in [[American upper class]] society and did a three-year project to create a work for heiress [[Barbara Hutton]]. This project included two horses heads which were gilded bronze, with precious and semi precious stones. After her death the heads disappeared and resurfaced a few years ago at an auction in New York.

==Personal life==
During the time he lived in Paris at the Impasse Raffet (XVIeme Quartier) near the Rue Jasmin, he led a very colourful life.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Attached to American Embassy, Paris, 1914-1915, Decorated Chevalier Legion of Honor in 1922, He entertained a lot of guests in his beautiful house, which was once depicted in the French Magazine "Maison &amp; Jardin".{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Amongst his guests were Arthur Rubinstein, Cary Grant, Teddy Roosevelt Jr and Charles Lindbergh. He also had a lot of contacts to highest Russian Royalty. His wife, the former Madeleine Keith, was born in England and died in 1979 in Paris.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The house was subsequently sold to the owner of Paris Match.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} His daughter Helen Heather Haseltine married an Austrian Count by the name of Paul Maria Prosper Toggenburg (b. 09-04-1904 in Trento,  d.02-07-1964 in Ritten, Trentino-Südtirol, Italy) so becoming Gräfin Toggenburg, her descendants live in Italy and Austria now.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By his son, William Marshall, he has two grandchildren, of which one, Carla, is a well-respected sculptor in her own right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Herbert Haseltine died in Paris, in 1962. He was buried at the Protestant Cemetery Caius Cestius in Rome, where are also the graves of his parents, of his brothers Stanley Lane, Charles Marshall and his sister Mildred princess Rospigliosi.

==Gezi protests==
On May 28, 2013, [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|protests began]], initially to contest the urban development plan for Istanbul's [[Taksim Gezi Park]]. Mass demonstrations spread across the country from Istanbul while riot police brutally tried to suppress the protesters.

During a meeting held between the Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], some cabinet members and representatives of students, academics and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s on June 12, 2013, Erdoğan told that he was informed late and incomplete about the course and the extent of the events in Taksim. He added that he had summoned the highest-ranked local civil servant responsible and censured him, who hereupon cried. One of the participants told afterwards the daily ''[[Vatan]]'' that they perceived the person meant was Governor of Istanbul Hüseyin Avni Mutlu.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt; Governor Mutlu denied this statement and asserted that the prime minister did not use the word "governor".&lt;ref name="r2"/&gt;

==Arrest==
Mutlu was suspended from his position as a governor on July 17, 2016, shortly after the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], which was allegedly orchestrated by the [[Gülen Movement]]. He was accused of having ties to the organization behind the takeover attempt. On July 26, he was detained as part of the investigation into the failed coup. He was arrested on August 5, 2016.&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;

In 2005, ''Checking Out of London'' was released, a rock album produced with [[Nick Magnus]], and with the majority of the lyrics by [[Nick Clabburn]]. This was followed up in 2015 with a second rock album, ''Another Life'', also with the involvement of Magnus and Clabburn.

==With Nick Magnus==
Since being in Steve Hackett's band together, John and Nick Magnus have often collaborated, recording and performing together many times.

==With Marco Lo Muscio==
John has worked alongside Italian organist [[Marco Lo Muscio]] throughout the 2009s, often performing organ/piano/flute duets in live performances across Europe (UK, Italy, Germany, Poland, France). There are few recordings of them together, though Hackett played on Lo Muscio's ''The Book of Bilbo and Gandalf'' album, and they collaborated on the Playing The History project with [[Steve Hackett]].

==With Nick Fletcher==
Since 2012, John has collaborated with Classical guitarist [[Nick Fletcher (guitarist)|Nick Fletcher]]. They have performed as a flute/guitar duo across England and recorded two albums of instrumental music, the first of which also featured Steve Hackett.

==John Hackett Band==
In 2005, a short lived band existed to promote ''Checking Out of London'', featuring Nick Magnus on keyboards and Tony Patterson on vocals, along with various members of the [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] tribute band, [[ReGenesis (band)|ReGenesis]].

To support the release of ''Another Life'', a trio was formed with John (guitars, keys, vocals), [[Nick Fletcher (guitarist)|Nick Fletcher]] (lead guitar) and [[Duncan Parsons]] (percussion, vocals), which was soon expanded to a full band with the addition of [[Jeremy Richardson (musician)|Jeremy Richardson]] (bass, guitars, vocals) and Duncan moving to full drum kit.

The band started public performances as the John Hackett Band in 2016, their debut album ''We Are Not Alone'' was released in 2017 through [[Esoteric Recordings|Esoteric Antenna]] Records as a double CD set of a studio album and a live album recorded in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://teamrock.com/news/2017-07-25/the-john-hackett-band-announce-we-are-not-alone] TeamRock.com July 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19166">This is a list of the  ''' biological mothers of Ottoman sultans'''. There were thirty-six sultans of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in twenty-one generations. (During early days the title ''Bey'' was used instead of ''Sultan'') Throughout 623-years history the sultans were the members of the same house, namely the [[Ottoman Dynasty|House of Ottoman]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Osmanlı Hanedanı'').

== Mothers of the Ottoman Sultans ==
This list is distinct from the list of [[List of Valide Sultans|Valide Sultans of the Ottoman Empire]]. [[Valide Sultan]] was the title of the mother of the reigning sultan. The mothers who died before their sons' accession to throne, never assumed the title of [[Valide Sultan]] like [[Roxelana|Hürrem]], [[Muazzez Sultan|Muazzez]], [[Mihrişah Kadın|Mihrişah]],{{sfn|Bahadıroğlu|2009|p=355}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-1297/sultan-iii-mustafa-han.html | title = Sultan III. Mustafa Han | accessdate = 2009-02-06 | publisher = [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Şermi Kadın|Şermi]].{{sfn|Bahadıroğlu|2009|p=363}} On the other hand, step mothers who were not the biological mothers but raised the princes whose mothers had died assumed the title of [[Valide Sultan]] like [[Perestu Kadın|Perestu]]. So there were Valide Sultans who were not the mothers, and there were mothers who were not the Valide Sultans.

After college, Kriegsman worked for Cognitive Systems, Inc. (started by notable AI researcher [[Roger Schank]]), developing large scale rule-based, statistical, and text-processing AI systems. He later integrated those three technologies in a paper he wrote for IEEE.&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;Kriegsman, Mark and Ralph Barletta.

Based on user feedback, Clearway pulled AdScreen just two days later.&lt;ref name="AdScreen2"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-218742.html "Firm pulls ad blocking software"], CNET News, December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Kriegsman's fascination with computers caught the attention of a local newspaper in 1979, when he was 13. Lucy Meyer of the New Jersey ''Summit Herald'' reported that "Mark... likes to make up programs, sometimes patterns and sometimes short programs 'that just pop into my head.'&lt;ref name="SummitHerald"&gt;Meyer, Lucy. "Are Computers Taking the Place of Yule Sleds and Bicycles?" ''Summit Herald'', Summit, NJ, December 13, 1979, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; He parlayed this skill and interest into writing computer games; at age 15 he released his first game, "StarBlaster", and later his second, "Panic Button."&lt;ref name="GiantList"&gt;[http://www.dadgum.com/giantlist/ The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers], last accessed April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Hampshire College]] in Amherst Massachusetts, where he studied cognitive science. After graduation, Kriegsman worked for Cognitive Systems, Inc., and later went on to found several successful technology companies, starting with Document.com and later including Clearway and [[Veracode]].

Kriegsman is a descendant of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]], leader of the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, as well as of early Santa Fe merchants Willi and Flora Spiegelberg. Willi was the Mayor of Santa Fe from 1884–1886.&lt;ref name="Flora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storiesuntold.org/women/flora_text.html|title=Flora Spiegelberg|website=www.storiesuntold.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FiermanPapers"&gt;[http://knet.asu.edu/archives/?getObject=ualib:117437 "Floyd S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21961">The '''Merry Pranksters''' were cohorts and followers of American author [[Ken Kesey]] in 1964.

Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters lived [[Commune (intentional community)|communally]] at Kesey's homes in [[California]] and [[Oregon]], and are noted for the [[Sociology|sociological]] significance of a lengthy [[road trip]] they took in the summer of 1964, traveling across the United States in a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] painted school bus called ''Furthur'' or ''[[Further (bus)|Further]]'', organizing parties and giving out [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/KeseyPrs.htm |title=Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters |publisher=Univie.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time they met many of the guiding lights of the mid-1960s [[Counterculture of the 1960s|cultural movement]] and presaged what are commonly thought of as [[hippies]] with odd behavior, tie-dyed and red, white and blue clothing, and renunciation of normal society, which they dubbed [[The Establishment]]. [[Tom Wolfe]] chronicled their early escapades in ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'';  Wolfe also documents a notorious 1966 trip on ''Further'' from Mexico through Houston, stopping to visit Kesey's friend, novelist [[Larry McMurtry]].  Kesey was in flight from a drug charge at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/152088-ken-keseys-magic-trip-and-extreme-tango/ |title=Ken Kesey's Magic Trip and Extreme Tango |last=Anderson, Kurt |date=2011-08-12 |work=Studio 360 |access-date=2017-07-28 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable members of the group include Kesey's best friend [[Ken Babbs]], [[Carolyn Garcia|Carolyn "Mountain Girl" Garcia]], [[Lee Quarnstrom]], and [[Neal Cassady]]. [[Stewart Brand]], [[Dorothy Fadiman]],&lt;ref name="electric-koolaid-acid-test"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]|page=5|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Foster (cartoonist)|Paul Foster]], [[Dale Kesey]] (his cousin), George Walker, [[Grateful dead#Formation(1965–1966)|the Warlocks]] (now known as the [[Grateful Dead]]), [[Del Close]] (then a lighting designer for the Grateful Dead), [[Wavy Gravy]], [[Paul Krassner]], and Kentucky Fab Five writers [[Ed McClanahan]] and [[Gurney Norman]] (who overlapped with Kesey and Babbs as creative writing graduate students at [[Stanford University]]) were associated with the group to varying degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

These events are also documented by one of the original pranksters, Lee Quarnstrom, in his memoir, ''When I Was a Dynamiter''.

==Origin of name==
In an interview on [[BBC World Service]] in August 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSD Road Trip|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0253hsr?ocid=socialflow_twitter|website=BBC World Service|accessdate=2017-07-28|date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Babbs]] suggested that the name "The Merry Pranksters" was his idea:

{{quote|Kesey and George Walker and I were out wandering around and the rest of the gang were sitting around a fire in Kesey's house in La Honda, and when we came back it was dark and Mike Hagen called out "Halt! Who goes there?"

And just out of the blue I said, "'Tis I, the intrepid traveller, come to lead his merry band of pranksters across the nation, in the reverse order of the pioneers! And our motto will be 'the obliteration of the entire nation' ... not taken literally of course, we won't blow up their buildings, we'll blow their minds!}}

Although a great many friends and associates spent time with Kesey at his [[La Honda, California]] ranch in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] south of [[San Francisco]], the core group of 14 people who became the 'Merry Band of Pranksters' that drove across the country in 1964 were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-07-28|title=Cathryn Marie Casamo|url=http://www.cathryncasamo.com/themagicbus1.htm|website=www.cathryncasamo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://furthurdowntheroad.org/index.php/history/merry-pranksters/ |title=Merry Pranksters &amp;#124; History |publisher=Furthurdowntheroad.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastward bus journey==
[[Image:Furthur 05.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Furthur (bus)|Furthur]]'', [[Ken Kesey]] and the Merry Pranksters' second bus]]

On June 17, 1964, Kesey and 13 Merry Pranksters boarded ''[[Furthur (bus)|Furthur]]'' at Kesey's ranch in [[La Honda, California]], and set off eastward. Kesey wanted to see what would happen when [[hallucinogenic]]-inspired spontaneity confronted what he saw as the banality and [[conformity]] of American society. Ken Babbs has suggested that the bus trip reversed the historic American westward movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cavallo, Dominick |date=1999|title=A Fiction of the Past: The Sixties in American History|pages= 110–11|location= New York|publisher= St. Martin's Press|isbn= 0-312-21930-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip's original purpose was to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' (1964) and to visit the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]] in New York City. The Pranksters were enthusiastic users of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[amphetamine]]s, and [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and in the process of their journey are said to have "turned on" many people by introducing them to these drugs.&lt;ref name="Studio 360: Episode #1232"&gt;Studio 360: Episode #1232&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychedelically painted bus's stated destination — "further" — was the Merry Pranksters' goal: a destination that could be reached only through the expansion of one's own perception of reality.&lt;ref name="Studio 360: Episode #1232"/&gt;

Novelist [[Robert Stone (novelist)|Robert Stone]], who met the bus on its arrival in New York, wrote in his memoir ''[[Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties]]'' (2007) that those accompanying Kesey on the trip were [[Neal Cassady]] (described by Stone as "the world's greatest driver, who could roll a joint while backing a 1937 [[Packard]] onto the lip of the [[Grand Canyon]]"), Ken Babbs ("fresh from the [[Vietnam War|Nam]], full of radio nomenclature, and with a command voice that put cops to flight"), Jane Burton ("a pregnant young philosophy professor who declined no challenges"), George Walker, Sandy Lehmann-Haupt (dis-MOUNT), Mike Hagen (Mal Function), Ron Bevirt (Hassler), Chuck Kesey, Dale Kesey, John Babbs, Steve Lambrecht and Paula Sundstren (aka Gretchin Fetchin, Slime Queen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stone, Robert|title=Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties| page= 120|publisher= HarperCollins|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zane Kesey and Simon Babbs edited the video and audio clips made by the Pranksters on the trip to produce a DVD (1999) called simply ''The Acid Test'', which is distributed by Key-z Productions.

==Hells Angels==
Kesey and the Pranksters also had a relationship with the [[outlaw motorcycle gang]] the [[Hells Angels]], whom Kesey introduced to LSD. The details of their relationship are documented in Wolfe's above-mentioned book, in [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s book, ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' (1966), and in [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s poem about the Kesey/Angels relationship, titled "First Party at Ken Kesey's with Hell's Angels" (December 1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ginsberg, Allen|title= Collected Poems 1947-1980|publisher= Harper Perennial Library Edition |date=1988|page= 374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later events==
In 1969, ''Further'' and the Pranksters (minus Kesey) attended the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] rock festival. In the same year, they attended the [[Texas pop festival|Texas Pop Festival]] at [[Lewisville, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=About.com|url=http://www.texaspopfestival.com/about.HTM|title=Texas Pop Festival|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128065724/http://www.texaspopfestival.com/about.HTM|archivedate=2010-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kesey's ''Demon Box'' ([[1986 in literature|1986]]), a collection of short pieces, several about the Merry Pranksters, was a critical success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15016784 |title=Demon box |last=Kesey |first=Ken |date=1987 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140085303 |location=New York, NY |oclc=15016784}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent novel, ''Sailor Song'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sailor Song |last=Kesey |first=Ken |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=9780140139976}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not, with critics complaining it was too spacey for comprehension.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In 1994, Kesey toured with the Pranksters, performing ''[[Twister (play)|Twister: A Ritual Reality in Three Quarters Plus Overtime if Necessary]]'', a play he wrote in 1989 about the millennium, influenced by [[L. Frank Baum]]'s Wizard of Oz works.

The Merry Pranksters filmed and audiotaped much of what they did on their bus trips. Some of this material has surfaced in documentaries, including the BBC's ''[[Dancing In the Street]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=IMDb|title=Dancing In the Street|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375293/|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Pranksters have released footage on their own, and a version of the film edited by Kesey is available through his son Zane's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kesey, Zane (Producer)| title=Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search for a Kool Place |date=2011|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2201111/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1a }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 1997, Kesey appeared with the Merry Pranksters at a [[Phish]] concert during a performance of the song "Colonel Forbin's Ascent" from the album ''[[The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday]]'' (1987).
Kesey and the Pranksters also helped stage [[Enit Festival|The Enit Festival]], held at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] on November 22, 1997, with [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Funky Tekno Tribe]], [[Goldie]], and [[Res Fest]] rounding out the bill.

The original Prankster bus is at Kesey's farm in Oregon. In November 2005, it was pulled out of the swamp by Zane Kesey and family and a group of the original Merry Pranksters with the intent of restoring it.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10792061/from/RL.5/ |title=Ken Kesey's original magic bus being restored|work= MSNBC |date=January 20, 2006|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002728584_keseybus09m.html |title=Kesey's bus on magic road to resurrection (Associated Press) |last=Barnard |first=Jeff |date=9 January 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=18 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524035030/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002728584_keseybus09m.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]] sought to acquire the bus, which is no longer operable, but Kesey refused, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to prank the Smithsonian by passing off a phony bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kesey's Merry Prank: Bus Isn't The Original -- Smithsonian Says It Doesn't Want '47 Model {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19901102&amp;slug=1101869|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Kesey#Death|Kesey died]] of complications due to [[liver cancer]] in November 2001. [[Ken Babbs]] attempts to keep the Prankster spirit alive through his Skypilot Club website, a spoof of 1950s comic book clubs that encourages psychedelic ideals and "mind-expanding" experiences, particularly through immersion in love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Further|url=http://www.skypilotclub.com|website=www.skypilotclub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2003, Babbs hosted a memorial to Kesey with [[String Cheese Incident]] and various other old and new Pranksters. It was held at the [[McDonald Theatre]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]]. The proceeds helped to raise money for the ''Ken Kesey Memorial'' sculpture designed by Peter Helzer. The bronze sculpture depicted a life-size Kesey reading to three children while seated on a curved granite bench covered with quotations from Kesey's novels ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1962) and ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' (1964). (Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer [[Brian Lanker]] supplied the image.) Other benefactors for the project include [[Bob Weir]], [[Paul Newman]] (who starred in the 1971 film adaptation of ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (film)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'') and [[Michael Douglas]] (who produced the 1975 film version of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'').

In 2005, Zane Kesey asked a friend, Matthew Rick, also known as Shady Backflash, to put on a 40th anniversary of his father's [[Acid Tests]]. Matthew gathered a small group of promoters, including Rob Robinson from New York, to help him produce the event, which was held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on October 31, 2005. It was known as AT40. Zane has hosted several Acid Test parties since then, including the 2011 Pop Quiz AT in Oakland CA.

==2011 documentary==
[[Alex Gibney]] and Alison Ellwood directed a [[documentary film]] ''[[Magic Trip (2011 film)|Magic Trip]]'' (2011) about the Merry Pranksters, which was released on August 5, 2011.

==50th Anniversary Trip==
In April 2014, Zane, along with friend Derek Stevens, announced a [[Kickstarter]] to fund a 50th anniversary Furthur Bus Trip, offering donors a chance to ride ''Further''. The fundraiser was successful, and the trip took place between June and September 2014.&lt;ref name=kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|website=Kickstarter|url= http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/furthur50/furthur-bus-50th-anniversary-trip |title=Furthur Bus 50th Anniversary "Trip"|date=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 participants were invited to ride on legs of the trip as a new batch of Merry Pranksters. The 2014 journey was over 15,000 miles, 53 different events, took place in 29 different states and was 75 days of Merry Prankster mayhem and fun on the road.  A group of filmmakers from Canada are producing a documentary about the project slated for release in 2016 under the title ''Going Furthur''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Film - Going Furthur|url=http://goingfurthur.com/|website=Going Furthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mustafa Bouyali''' ([[Arabic language|Ar.]] مصطفى بويعلي) was the leader of the [[Algerian Islamic Armed Movement]], a guerrilla group based around [[Larbaa, Blida|Larbaa]] south of [[Algiers]], from 1982 to 1987.

Born in 1940, Bouyali fought for the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in the [[Algerian War of Independence]], becoming a captain.  In the 63-65 period, he joined the maquis of the [[Socialist Forces Front|FFS]], leading to his exclusion from the FLN.  He later became an electrician, and had seven children. Near the end of the 1970s, he fell under the influence of imam [[Abdelhadi Doudi]] of the [[El-Achour Mosque]], in the south of Algiers and began preaching at this Mosque in 1980.

In 1979, he formed the "Group for Defense against the Illicit", intended to pressure the government to adopt policies seen as reflecting Islamic values, such as implementation of the [[sharia]].  As his efforts failed, he began considering the possibility of an armed effort, and started stockpiling weapons from mid-1981.  In April 1982, a confrontation occurred between his group and the police in which his brother Mokhtar was shot; this incident convinced him that violence was called for.

In July 1982, Bouyali took to the maquis, with significant support in local towns, particularly [[Larbaa, Blida|Larbaa]].  The "Group for Defense against the Illicit" announced its transformation into the [[Algerian Islamic Armed Movement]] (MAIA).  According to the government, it planned a variety of attacks, including the assassination of the Prime Minister, which were forestalled by the arrest of 23 of its members in mid-December.  Further arrests were made in January 1983.  However, Bouyali himself evaded the security forces, and fled abroad (probably either [[Iran]] or [[Libya]]).

In May 1984, the government released some 92 of his supporters.  Within a few months, he returned, reestablished his contacts, reconstituted the MAIA in February 1985, and began fighting again.  In August, the group mounted two prominent operations - an armed robbery at a factory in Algiers on the 21st, and an attack on a police barracks in [[Soumaa]] on the 27th, killing a police cadet and taking weaponry.  They painted the phrase "Allah the Avenger is with us!" across the gates of the barracks at Soumaa, to indicate that their motive was not simple criminality.  Over the next two years, his group would continue its campaign, inflicting losses on government forces when pursued, but more generally targeting institutions it saw as un-Islamic, such as girls' schools, libraries, restaurants, and cinemas.  On February 3, 1987, Bouyali finally fell in an ambush by the security services, and the movement was destroyed.  Its surviving members were put on trial in July, with 5 of the 202 tried receiving the death penalty and 15 acquitted.  The last of these were released on July 29, 1990.  In 1991, several of these, led by [[Abdelkader Chebouti]], reconstituted the organization as the [[Armed Islamic Movement]].  Shortly afterwards, some, such as [[Mansour Meliani]], split with it to found the notably more violent [[Armed Islamic Group]].

'''Optical Mechanics, Inc.''' or '''OMI''' is a high-end American [[telescope]] and optics instrument manufacturer. OMI was founded in 2002 and produces observatory telescopes, [[Lidar]] telescopes, optical tube assemblies, telescope mirrors and reflective coatings for mirrors. OMI mirrors are used by other telescope makers such as [[Obsession Telescopes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obsessiontelescopes.com/optics/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also taking on custom projects, they produced the 48-inch Dob, a {{convert|48.875|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[aperture]], {{f/}}4, [[Dobsonian]] telescope  called "Barbarella" and featured in [[Astronomy Technology Today]] magazine (June 2008 Issue).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lowreyobservatory.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opticalmechanics.com/48Dob/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; OMI is located in the US state of [[Iowa]]. OMI procured the assets of the former optics company Torus Technologies.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=13772]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2003856297BR559_1788/IN%20RE%20MULHERIN]&lt;/ref&gt; OMI has an optics shop where it does work on telescopes.&lt;ReF&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2003856297BR559_1788/IN%20RE%20MULHERIN]&lt;/ref&gt;

OMI produced the 60&amp;nbsp;cm, f/10 telescope for [[TUBITAK National Observatory]] in [[Turkey]].

In 2005 his first production ''[[Silent Voices (film)|Silent Voices]]'', a docudrama about domestic violence, premiered on British television, based on the real-life accounts of children who had witnessed their parents being beaten.

In 2007 Atherton was the first and only producer-director to have had his work shown on the Piccadilly Circus Coca-Cola Billboard with [[The Ballet of Change]], a ballet of film and music telling the histories of four of London's most historic landmarks. {{fact|date=November 2018}}

'''Paul Masson''' (1859 &amp;ndash; 1940) was an early pioneer of [[California]] [[viticulture]] and successful popularizer of Californian [[sparkling wine]].

==Biography==
Masson emigrated from the [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] region of [[France]] in 1878 to [[California]], [[United States]], where he met [[Rancho San Juan Bautista|Charles Lefranc]], one of a number of French immigrants who had expanded the [[viticulture]] introduced into the [[Santa Clara Valley]] by the [[Spanish missions in California|Catholic mission]] fathers.  Masson went back to France in 1880, but later returned to California due to the depression in the French wine industry caused by the [[phylloxera|Phylloxera plague]].  According to the Paul Masson company web site, in 1892 Masson's first [[sparkling wine]] under the name "[[Champagne (wine)|champagne]]" was introduced at [[Almaden Valley|Almaden]], and Masson eventually became known as the "Champagne King of California". Masson is buried at [[Oak Hill Memorial Park]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

==Winery==
Masson shifted part of his production to the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] above [[Saratoga, California]] and built his "chateau" on a knob overlooking the [[Santa Clara Valley]] in 1905. Now known as "The [[Mountain Winery]]", the Paul Masson Mountain Winery is on the [[National Park Service]]'s [[National Register of Historic Places]], though it ceased making wines in 1952. Instead, it serves as a conferencing and events venue - various events are held at the winery, such as concert series, weddings, and other special events.  A famous chess tournament was held there annually for a number of years in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/santaclara/mas.htm  Paul Masson Mountain Winery] National Park Service. Retrieved from on 2004-12-28&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2000, the then-current owners of the site hired winemaker Jeffrey Patterson to restart winemaking on site. The vineyards were reestablished at the Mountain Winery in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History and Legacy of Our Estate|url=http://www.mountainwinery.com/our-wines/estate-wine-history-legacy|website=mountainwinery.com|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
[[File:Orson Welles Paul Masson Tasting party insert.png|350px|right|thumb|[[Orson Welles]] presented a series of distinctive ads for Paul Masson from 1978 to 1981.]]
{{Main article|Orson Welles Paul Masson advertisements}}
The Paul Masson brand is best remembered for its 1978-1981 marketing association with actor-director [[Orson Welles]], who promised for Masson: "We will sell no wine before its time."&lt;ref name="beethoven"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSs6DcA6dFI |title=Orson Welles for Paul Masson |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=1980 |website=YouTube |publisher=Darian Glover |access-date=2017-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An infamous, widely circulated and much-parodied outtake for one commercial from the campaign features Welles attempting to deliver his lines while severely inebriated.&lt;ref name="Outtakes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFevH5vP32s |title=Original Takes for Orson Welles Wine Commercial |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=1980 |website=YouTube |publisher=grimscribe126 |access-date=2017-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles was eventually fired as a spokesman for the brand in 1981, after answering a question about Paul Masson on a TV chat show, saying that he was now on a diet and so no longer drank wine; he was (briefly) replaced as spokesman by [[Sir John Gielgud]].&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |date=2006 |title=Whatever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career |location=Lexington, Kentucky |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0813124100}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|225}}

Despite the ads' success at the time, the Paul Masson brand has suffered from a long-term image problem, particularly since its founder's death in 1940, in being synonymous with low-end wines. As ''The New York Times'' observed in 1990: "While many consumers know them - who can forget Orson Welles's breathy incantation of 'We will sell no wine before its time' for Masson - they lack cachet."&lt;ref name="TroubledWinery" /&gt;

==Paul Masson and NASA==
In the 1970s [[NASA]] bought Masson Rare Cream Sherry for a [[Skylab]] mission and packaged some for testing on a [[Reduced gravity aircraft|"zero-G" aircraft]]. Unfortunately, the smell quickly permeated the cabin making astronauts physically sick, and public pressure over taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon their plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BourlandCT/BourlandCT_4-7-06.htm | title= Edited Oral History Transcript - Charles T. Bourland | first=Jennifer | last=Ross-Nazzal | date=7 April 2006 | publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The Paul Masson winery and brand were owned for many years by The Seagram Company, Ltd, the global wine and spirits company (along with minority share owners).  In the 1980s, Seagram also acquired the Taylor California Cellars brand (and production facilities) from Coca-Cola, based on the premise promoted by then Seagram Strategic Planning head, Mary Cunningham, that the only way to succeed in the wine business was to approach Gallo's massive sales volume. Over the next twenty years, the wine industry would dramatically segment itself with, essentially, all the large volume brands falling by the wayside.  Internal competition and resulting cannibalization dramatically reduced the combined sales of Paul Masson and Taylor (as it did with Almaden and Inglenook, also owned by a single parent company).&lt;ref name="TroubledWinery" /&gt;

These changes meant that the Paul Masson brand was sold to Vintners International in 1987.&lt;ref name="TroubledWinery"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD81130F931A25756C0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=New York Times|date=12 May 1990|title=A Troubled Winery Where Debt Is Aging|author=Lawrence M. Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vintners was in turn purchased by the Centera Wine Company (formerly "Canandaigua") of New York in 1993, as part of Vintner's bankruptcy proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-13|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD9173CF935A2575AC0A965958260| title=Canandaigua to Acquire Vintners|author=Lawrence M. Fisher|date=16 September 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Canandaigua was then renamed [[Constellation Brands]] in 2000.

In 2008, Wine Group LLC of San Francisco purchased the Paul Masson winery, which had ceased making wine in 1952, and now serves as a conferencing and events center. Wine Group LLC subsequently removed the Paul Masson name and renamed it "[[Mountain Winery|The Mountain Winery]]". Wine Group LLC also purchased two California wine brands from Constellation Brands, including the Paul Masson table wine range, currently consisting of three types of bottle sold - white, red, and rosé, made from grapes grown elsewhere in California. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands in New York continues to manufacture and sell the profitable Paul Masson brandies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/02/25/daily50.html Wine Group buys Almaden, Inglenook brands, Paul Masson winery, for $134M] San Francisco Business Times&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Morton Shand''' (21 January 1888 – 30 April 1960), known as '''P. Morton Shand''', was an English journalist, architecture critic (an early proponent of [[modernism]]), wine and food writer, entrepreneur and [[Pomology|pomologist]]. He is also the paternal grandfather of [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].

==Life==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
Shand, the son of the writer and barrister [[Alexander Faulkner Shand]] and his wife Augusta Mary Coates, was born in [[Kensington]], [[London]].  He was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]], as well as studying at the [[Sorbonne]], Paris, and in [[Heidelberg]], Germany.&lt;ref name="AW"&gt;Alan Windsor, ''Letters from Peter Behrens to P. Morton Shand, 1932–1938'', Architectural History, Vol. 37, (1994), pp. 165–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shand was married four times. His first marriage was to [[Edith Marguerite Harrington]] in April 1916, with whom he had a son, [[Bruce Shand]], father to [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].  They divorced in 1920.

Shand's second marriage was to Alys Fabre-Tonnerre, in 1920, with whom he had a daughter named Sylvia.  They divorced in 1926, his wife having petitioned on the grounds of his adultery.

Shand's third marriage was to Georgette Thérèse Edmée Avril, who he married a month after the divorce decree for his second marriage was granted. They divorced in 1931, without having had any children.

Shand's fourth marriage was to Sybil Mary Sissons (previously Mrs. Slee) in 1931, with whom he had one daughter named [[Elspeth Howe, Baroness Howe of Idlicote|Elspeth]]. Elspeth married [[Geoffrey Howe]], later Baron Howe of Aberavon, who was then a lawyer and later a politician. Elspeth became a life peer in her own right as ''Baroness Howe of Idlicote''. Shand's step-daughter, Mary (Sybil's daughter from her first husband naval Commander John Ambrose Slee) married architect Sir [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

Shand died on 30 April 1960 (age 72) in [[Lyon]], France. The poet [[John Betjeman]] and the French wine expert [[André Simon (wine)|André Simon]] wrote addenda to Shand's obituary in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Obit addenda"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Betjiman|first1=John|last2=Simon|first2=André L.|authorlink1=John Betjeman|authorlink2=André Simon (wine)|title=Mr. P. Morton Shand|work=The Times|date=6 May 1960|location=London|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Shand studied history at King's College, Cambridge, gaining his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1914. Shand served in the First World War with the [[Royal Fusiliers]] regiment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/british-army-service-records-1914-1920?firstname=philip&amp;firstname_variants=true&amp;lastname=shand&amp;yearofbirth=1888&amp;yearofbirth_offset=2 Results for British Army Service Records 1914–1920]&lt;/ref&gt; and immediately afterwards, due to his fluent French and German, he was appointed as superintendent of all German prisoners' camps in France.&lt;ref name="Obit addenda"/&gt;

Already in 1914 he had translated from German to English [[Arthur Schnitzler]]'s play ''Liebelei'', under the title ''Playing with Love''. Though his first major publications from that time were on food and wine, he began to also build a reputation as an architecture critic, working in particular for ''Architectural Review'', where he had been influential in steering the journal's then proprietor and sometimes editor Hubert de Cronin Hastings in favour of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Glancey, "Townscape and the AR: Humane urbanism in the 20th century", ''Architectural Review'', 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in Lyon, France, in the early 1920s, he was invited by the editor of the [[Architectural Association|''Architectural Association Journal'']] to review the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Exposition Internationale des Artes Décoratifs]] in Paris of 1925.&lt;ref name="AW" /&gt; In reviewing the exposition, he coined the term "Swedish grace" to describe the Scandinavian design of the time, evident in the work of among others [[Gunnar Asplund]], though by that time a new, modernist architecture and design was emerging, as evident at the exposition in the work of its prime mover [[Le Corbusier]].&lt;ref&gt;Katherine E. Nelson, Raul Cabra, ''New Scandinavian Design'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Nordic Classicism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shand's first book on architecture, ''Modern Theatres and Cinemas'' was published in 1930 and featured many of those buildings he had encountered in Germany during the late 1920s, arguing that there the cinema had emerged as a separate design typology, not an adaptation of traditional theatre design.

Shand was befriended by some of the leading figures in European modernist architecture, including [[Peter Behrens]], Le Corbusier, head of the [[Bauhaus]] Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto and Swiss historian-critic [[Sigfried Giedion]], keeping correspondence with each of them. He also developed close links with architects back in the UK, encouraging their participation in the modernist debate. Shand translated from German to English Gropius's 1925 book ''Die neue Architektur und das Bauhaus'', published in 1930 as ''The New Architecture and the Bauhaus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uea.ac.uk/lib/libinf/find/archives/pritchard/pp29.htm SERIES PP/29&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Shand with furniture designer and entrepreneur [[Jack Pritchard]] helped with Gropius's emigration from Germany to the UK in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Campbell M |title=What tuberculosis did for modernism: the influence of a curative environment on modernist design and architecture |journal=Med Hist |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=463–88 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16562331 |pmc=1251640 |doi= 10.1017/s0025727300009169|url=}}, note 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier and Giedion had been prime movers in the foundation of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) in 1928, in the promotion of the cause of modernist architecture and town planning. Giedion was its first and only general secretary. There had been no British participants in the first CIAM conference in 1928. But in January 1929 Shand wrote to Gropius suggesting Howard Robinson, head of the [[Architectural Association]] school of architecture and Shand's own cousin, as the British CIAM representative. When this did not work out, Shand recommended Japan-born, Canada-educated architect [[Wells Coates]]. Shand, together with architects Coates, [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[F. R. S. Yorke]] were the founding members of the [[MARS Group]] (Modern Architectural Research Group), which operated from 1933 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designmuseum.org/design/the-mars-group The MARS Group / Designing Modern Britain – Design Museum : – Design/Designer Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The group came into existence at the prompting of Giedion, after Shand wrote to him.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Paul Mumford, ''The CIAM discourse on urbanism, 1928–1960'' (2000), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Shand, Coates, Yorke and three other members of the Mars Group attended their first CIAM congress in 1933, which took place on board an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July that year.

A series of articles under the title ''Scenario for a Human Drama'', in ''Architectural Review'' of 1934–5, was Shand's attempt to document and place the contemporary architecture in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-18443458.html Theme: Centenary, 1935–1951.

Shand was sued for bankruptcy in March 1933, with the court case taking place in August that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/33913/supplements/1240 London Gazette, Applications for Discharge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, however, with Geoffrey Boumphrey, he founded a company Finmar to import Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]]'s furniture into the UK,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Davies, "Finmar and the Furniture of the Future: The Sale of Alvar Aalto’s Plywood Furniture in the UK, 1934–1939", ''Design History'', 1998, 11 (2): 145–156.&lt;/ref&gt; for the purposes of which he set up an exhibition of Aalto's furniture and experimental wood reliefs at the [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]] department store in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studio-international.co.uk/architecture/aalto07.asp Alvar Aalto: Through the Eyes of Shigeru Ban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he visited Finland with Jack Pritchard and Graham Reid and saw Aalto's [[Paimio Sanatorium]] and the [[Artek (company)|Artek]] furniture factory which made the furniture sold in the UK by Finmar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uea.ac.uk/lib/libinf/find/archives/pritchard/ppchronology.htm  Jack Pritchard Chronology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his early enthusiasm for modernism in design and architecture, by the late 1950s he was far more critical towards the results of modern architecture, writing that:
{{quote|text=I have frightful nightmares, and no wonder for I am haunted by a gnawing sense of guilt in having, in however minor and obscure degree, helped to bring about, anyhow encouraged and praised, the embryo searchings that have now materialized into a monster neither of us [Shand or [[Betjeman]]] could have foreseen: Contemporary architecture (= the piling up of gigantic children's toy bricks in utterly dehumanized and meaningless forms), 'Art' and all that.

Shand demonstrated his knowledge of food and wine in articles and books published during the 1920s. He set out his viewpoint at the beginning of the 300-page ''A Book of Food'' (1927): "This is frankly a book of prejudices, for all food is a question of likes and dislikes. One may be tolerant about religion, politics, and a hundred and one other things, but not about the food that one eats."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Parker Bowles, ''A woman who can't make soup should not be allowed to marry ...

The '''Radioactive Chicken Heads''' are an American band formed in [[Santa Ana, California]] in 1993. Operating anonymously under the guise of mutant chickens and vegetables, the Chicken Heads' music is primarily a mix of [[punk rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[ska punk]], a blend the band advertises as "[[genetic engineering|Genetically Modified]] Punk Rock".

Originally formed under the name '''Joe and the Chicken Heads''', the Chicken Heads first established a cult following within the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] punk and ska scene for their over-the-top theatrical stage shows utilizing a wide variety of props and costumed characters, all of which tie into an elaborate [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads#Band mythology|fictional mythology]] which serves as the basis for many of the band's songs and videos. Following their name change in 2004, the Chicken Heads have since focused more on multi-media projects centered on this mythology, including music videos, concept albums, [[YouTube]] skits, stage plays, a [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads#Badd Bunny Breakout|role-playing computer game]] and an independently-produced [[television pilot]].

To date, the band has released three studio albums and one compilation under the name "Radioactive Chicken Heads", with one studio album, one EP and six self-produced demo cassettes released during their time as "Joe and the Chicken Heads". Their most recent album, ''Tales From The Coop'', was released in October 2017.

== History ==

===Joe and the Chicken Heads (1993-2004)===
[[File:JoeandtheChickenHeads.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Joe and the Chicken Heads, as they appeared in 1998.]]
In a rare out-of-character interview, lead singer Carrot Topp explained that the genesis of the Radioactive Chicken Heads began with two [[comic book]]s he had written as a teenager, one about a gang of mutant vegetables called The Vegamatics and another called "Joe and the Chicken Heads" about a kid named Joe who sings with a rock band made up of headless chickens.&lt;ref name="CT+ACinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alternativetosleeping.com/carrot-topp-radioactive-chicken-heads-interview-2311 |title=Carrot Topp (Radioactive Chicken Heads) Interview |date=February 3, 2011 |publisher=Alternative to Sleeping}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering the comedy metal band [[Green Jellÿ]], a group renowned for their use of puppets and costumes, Carrot Topp ultimately decided to apply these concepts and visuals to a rock band combining elements of both comic books, creating the band's distinctive masks and props himself.&lt;ref name="CT+ACinterview" /&gt;

Joe and the Chicken Heads were officially formed in late 1993, though the band didn't play their first show until February 26, 1994, at a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] in [[Orange, California]]. Despite recording several demo tapes and appearing on numerous local [[compilation album|compilations]] during the mid-1990s, the Chicken Heads performed few live shows until the arrival of the late 1990s ska revival helped the band attract a wider following within the Orange County's booming ska and punk scene, sharing the stage with such notable ska acts as [[Link 80]], [[Slow Gherkin]] and [[Bim Skala Bim]] and receiving regular airplay on [[KUCI]]{{'}}s influential [[Ska Parade]] radio show, which hosted many up and coming local ska and punk bands. The band's outrageous costumes and live shows soon began attracting publicity both positive and negative from local papers and [[zine]]s including ''[[OC Weekly]]'', ''[[LA Weekly]]'', ''[[Daily Trojan|The Daily Trojan]]'', ''[[X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly|X-TRA]]'' and ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'', with ''[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]]'' magazine inexplicably describing them as "more fun than a shopping spree in a Mexican supermarket".&lt;ref name="ChickenXtra"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=September 1998 |publisher=[[X-TRA Contemporary Art Quarterly]] |title=X-Records |issue=23 |author=Robinson, Ty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaximumRCH"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHZbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Joe+%26+the+Chicken+heads%22&amp;dq=%22Joe+%26+the+Chicken+heads%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi98d6ez-XJAhVL6GMKHdPCDikQ6AEIHDAA |publisher=[[Maximumrocknroll]] |date=2000 |issue=208 |title=CD Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThrasherChicken"&gt;{{cite magazine |date=August 1999 |issue=223 |title=Show reviews |publisher=[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]] |author=Harris, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1997, following a staged altercation with [[The Aquabats]], the Chicken Heads waged a mock rivalry against the costumed superhero-themed band, a feud which was even covered in the ''OC Weekly'' newspaper at a time when both bands were experiencing notable local popularity. Though this rivalry never reached its fruition onstage, the Chicken Heads received a jokingly disparaging reference on the Ska Parade's infamous "[[GWAR]] vs. The Aquabats" radio skit the same year, wherein Aquabats lead singer The MC Bat Commander, turning down an offer to save the world because his band won't get paid, remarks "with that kind of motivation, you can probably get Joe and the Chicken Heads".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonska.net/news/gwar-vs-the-aquabats/1336/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Chicken Heads made their national television debut playing the song "Pest Control" on a Halloween-themed episode of ''[[The Gong Show#Later incarnations|Extreme Gong]]'', a short-lived revival of the 1970s ''[[The Gong Show|Gong Show]]'' game show which aired on the [[Game Show Network]]. Although the band were "gonged" mid-performance, signifying that the call-in voters disapproved of their act and wanted them to stop, the Chicken Heads finished their song anyway, claiming that they were playing so loud that they couldn't hear the gong.&lt;ref name="ChickenGong"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tricks-and-treats-abound-as-game-show-network-unveils-halloween-episode-of-extreme-gong-77187342.html |title=Tricks and Treats Abound as Game Show Network Unveils Halloween Episode of EXTREME GONG |date=October 28, 1998 |publisher=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe and the Chicken Heads independently released their first and only album ''Keep on Cluckin{{'}}'' in May 2000, featuring 26 songs which had been recorded over the span of three years. In wake of the album's release, the Chicken Heads began playing shows with much more frequency, forming a touring relationship with their original inspirations Green Jellÿ while also sharing bills with punk bands including the [[Angry Samoans]], [[D.I. (band)|D.I.]], [[Litmus Green]] and [[The Briefs]]. In May 2002, the band released their final work as Joe and the Chicken Heads, a five-track [[mini CD single]] entitled ''Family Album''.

===The Radioactive Chicken Heads (2004-present)===
====''Growing Mold'' and early activity (2004-2007)====
After a period of time performing as "The Rock N' Roll Chicken Heads" and "The Chicken Heads", Joe and the Chicken Heads permanently changed their name to "The Radioactive Chicken Heads" in mid-2004. According to their website, the "official" tongue-in-cheek reason behind the name change was due to "new government regulations which require all radioactive farm products to be labeled clearly".&lt;ref name="OCRoolz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2007-04-19/music/mutant-puppet-rock-band-roolz/ |title=Mutant Puppet Rock Band Roolz |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=April 19, 2007 |author=Reason, Rex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson |first= Noel.  |title= Band Name Book |publisher= Boston Mills Press |date=September 2008 |isbn= 1-55046-487-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Radioactive Chicken Heads self-released their first album under their new name, ''[[Growing Mold]]'', in March 2005. Mixed, engineered and featuring instrumental contributions by avant-garde composer [[Ego Plum]], ''Growing Mold'' eschewed the [[skacore]] influence of the band's early work in favor of exploring more eclectic and experimental musical territory, resulting in a combination of sounds ''(un)Leash'' magazine described as "like early [[Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]] meets [[Dead Kennedys]] meets [[gothabilly]] monster mash". While ''Growing Mold'' never reached the radar of any major music publications, the album was praised by local university papers and [[alternative weekly|alternative weeklies]], with [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]]{{'}}s ''Highlander'' dubbing the Chicken Heads "one of the best bands you've probably never heard of" and ''OC Weekly'' calling the album "funny" and "amusingly campy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-07-21/music/poetic-greatness/ |title=Poetic Greatness! |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=July 21, 2005 |author=Kane, Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the single "I Eat Kids", a cover of a [[Barry Louis Polisar]] song, was selected for airplay on the nationally syndicated [[Dr. Demento]] Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd05.0731.html |title=The Dr. Demento Show #05-31 - July 31, 2005 |publisher=The Demented Music Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, the Chicken Heads made another brief appearance on national television when they were invited to perform on an episode of ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'' as part of an ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' spoof called "Tyra's Got Talent", which featured weird and unusual talent acts.&lt;ref name="OCRoolz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChickenTop10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/top-ten-horror-punk-bands-6598250 |title=Top Ten Horror Punk Bands |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=October 31, 2014 |author=Distefano, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carrot Topp, the Chicken Heads were actually a last minute replacement for another act, an [[Elvis impersonator]] in a [[chicken suit]] called "Elvis Poultry", who couldn't make the shoot.&lt;ref name="CT+ACinterview" /&gt; The band performed the song "Our Last Song" before a mostly confused studio audience, ultimately losing out to John the Running Painter, a painter on a treadmill, by an audience vote of 73% to 27%.&lt;ref name="OCRoolz" /&gt;

====''Music for Mutants'', ''Poultry Uprising'' and national touring (2008–2017)====
[[File:RadioactiveChickenHeadsSantaAna.png|thumb|right|300px|The Chicken Heads playing in Santa Ana in April 2016.]]
Following further local touring within Southern California's club circuit, the Chicken Heads self-released their third album ''Music for Mutants'' in the summer of 2008, finding the band returning to a more aggressive punk rock sound. In promotion of the album, the Chicken Heads embarked on their first national tour supporting Green Jellÿ and hard rock band [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] on what was called the "Hollywood Freak Show", a tour spanning nearly sixty shows in thirty states.&lt;ref name="ChickenTop10" /&gt; During this tour, all three bands toured as the same amalgamated line-up of musicians, virtually changing only the costumes and lead singers between sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2010/04/06/green-jelly-best-interview-ever/ |title=Green Jellÿ: Best Interview Ever |author=Slevin, Patrick |publisher=[[The Aquarian Weekly]] |date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodygoodhorror.com/bgh/concert-review-green-jelly |title=Concert Review: Green Jelly |date=November 3, 2008 |publisher=Bloody Good Horror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, the Chicken Heads began focusing on producing [[music video]]s showcasing the band's prop work and theatricality. Between 2007 and 2010, four music videos were independently filmed for the songs "I Looked Into the Mirror", "Pest Control", "Badd Bunny" and "I Eat Kids", each one heavily featuring elaborate puppetry, costuming and cartoonish set design. This period also found the Chicken Heads receiving new exposure in low-budget horror films, recording on [[Count Smokula]]{{'}}s song "Poultrygeist" for the soundtrack to the 2008 [[Troma Entertainment]] production ''[[Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead]]'' and writing the theme song to the horror comedy ''[[Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer]]'', which featured [[stop motion animation|stop-motion animated]] cameos from the band members during the film's opening credits sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2096438 |title=Playlist: Get in Nerds, We're Going to Comic-Con! |publisher=[[Moviepilot]] |date=July 18, 2014 |author=Dennis, Catrina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityweekly.net/TheDailyFeed/archives/2012/11/13/atom-the-amazing-zombie-killer |date=November 13, 2012 |publisher=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]] |author=Sheehan, Gavin |title=Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Chicken Heads released ''Poultry Uprising'', a 14-song collection of rarities and unreleased tracks dating as far back to the band's earliest years as Joe and the Chicken Heads. The same year, lead singer Carrot Topp produced a [[compilation album]] on the Chicken Heads' own label Snail Sounds Records entitled ''We're Not Kidding!'', a [[tribute album|tribute]] to children's musician [[Barry Louis Polisar]], featuring sixty artists including [[The Vespers]], [[DeLeon (band)|DeLeon]], [[Rebecca Loebe]], [[Tor Hyams]], [[In the Audience]] and a duet between Polisar and the Chicken Heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/15/03/20/a_different_drummer_40_years_of_funny_with_barry_louis_polisar |title=A Different Drummer: 40 Years Of Funny With Barry Louis Polisar  |author=Weinstein, Elizabeth |date=March 20, 2015 |publisher=[[WAMU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''We're Not Kidding!'' received high praise from children's publications, winning the 2010 [[Parents' Choice Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=28283 |title=We're Not Kidding! A Tribute to Barry Louis Polisar |publisher=[[Parents' Choice Award|Parents' Choice Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicken Heads launched an [[Indiegogo]] campaign in November 2011 to help fund production on both a 15-minute prospective [[television pilot]] based on the band's fictional exploits and the release of a DVD including music videos and a live concert performance filmed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/radioactive-chicken-heads-behind-the-mutants |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads - Behind the Mutants|publisher=[[Indiegogo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the campaign ultimately failed to meet its funding goal, the band continued work on numerous projects over the next two years, filming seven more music videos for both the band's original songs, including "Deviled Egg", directed by Hollywood special effects artist [[Jim Ojala]], which was highlighted on horror channel [[Fearnet]] as their "Music Video of the Week",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/horror-music-video-week-radioactive-chicken-heads-deviled-egg |title=Music Video of the Week: Radioactive Chicken Heads - "Deviled Egg" |publisher=[[Fearnet]] |author=Burkart, Gregory |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humorous punk rock covers of popular songs, most notably the [[Imagine Dragons]] [[Grammy Award]]-winning song "[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]", which was released as a single. In July 2013, the Chicken Heads self-released ''[[The Radioactive Chicken Heads#Badd Bunny Breakout|Badd Bunny Breakout]]'', a comedic [[role-playing game|RPG]] [[computer game]] based on the band's characters and mythology and featuring a soundtrack of [[16-bit]] remixes of the group's songs.&lt;ref name="DyingChicken"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Radioactive Chicken Heads release RPG video game ''Badd Bunny Breakout'' |date=July 14, 2013 |publisher=Dying Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicken Heads appeared once again on national television in 2012 when they were featured on a segment of the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] reality show ''[[List of programs broadcast by TLC|My Crazy Obsession]]'' which focused on Zizi Howell, a woman obsessed with carrots. Howell was filmed going to a Chicken Heads concert at a Freak Show Wrestling event in Las Vegas, where she joined the band onstage and conducted a brief interview with Carrot Topp.&lt;ref name="MCOHP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/22/my-crazy-obsession-zizi-loves-carrots-video_n_1371880.html |title='My Crazy Obsession' Features Zizi Howell And Her Extreme Love For Carrots |date=March 22, 2012 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MCODM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2118829/My-Crazy-Obsession-Zizi-Howell-covered-body-tattoos-carrots.html |title=A 35-carrot nut: Woman so obsessed with vegetable she's covered her body in tattoos of it |date=March 22, 2012 |author=Lau, Kristie |publisher=[[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RadioactiveChickenHeadsTarzana.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Chicken Heads performing in Tarzana, California in November 2016.]]
In December 2014, the Chicken Heads released a parody cover of [[Elvis Presley]]{{'}}s "[[Burning Love]]", re-written as the [[Hanukkah]]-themed "Burning [[Latke]]". ''[[Heeb]]'', a satirical [[Jews|Jewish]] magazine, singled it out as one of the "Worst Hanukkah Videos Of 2014", criticizing the "too obvious" parody lyrics but nevertheless praising the rest of the Chicken Heads' work as "genuinely fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heebmagazine.com/worst-hanukkah-videos-2014/53653 |title=The Worst Hanukkah Videos of 2014 |date=December 15, 2014 |publisher=[[Heeb]] |author=B'Ayin, Zayin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicken Heads spent most of 2015 touring sporadically, including a three-show engagement in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] in May. The band received further international attention when [[Poland|Polish]] radio network [[Antyradio]] ranked the Chicken Heads #18 on their list of the "Top 20 Rock and Metal Freaks", a list of costumed and theatrical rock bands, and in 2014 ''OC Weekly'' ranked them ninth on their list of the top ten [[horror punk]] bands.&lt;ref name="ChickenTop10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pl&amp;u=http://www.antyradio.pl/Newsy/Duperele/TOP-20-rockowych-i-metalowych-dziwadel-2886&amp;prev=search |publisher=[[Antyradio]] |date=May 29, 2015 |author=Wodyński, Marcin |title=Top 20 rock and metal freaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 and 2015, the band appeared on [[KNBC]]{{'}}s ''[[1st Look]]'' and [[KABC-TV]]{{'}}s ''Eye on LA'', respectively, on local interest shows highlighting the [[California Institute of Abnormalarts]], both of which featured the Chicken Heads performing on the venue's stage in specially-recorded segments.&lt;ref name="WeirdChicken"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/it-doesnt-get-any-weirder-than-this-north-hollywood-spot-5050634 |title=It Doesn't Get Any Weirder Than This North Hollywood Spot |date=September 9, 2014 |author=Hermann, Andy |publisher=''[[LA Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCHEOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc7.com/society/eye-on-la-gets-spooky-with-the-best-halloween-themed-spots-in-the-city/1038617/ |title=Eye on L.A. gets spooky with the best Halloween-themed spots in the city |date=October 17, 2015 |publisher=[[KABC-TV]] |author=Malave, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2015, [[The Steve Allen Theater]] hosted ''The Radioactive Chicken Heads Tanksgiving Special'', a surrealist three-act comedy play featuring the music of and live accompaniment by the Chicken Heads, written and directed by composer and frequent Chicken Heads collaborator [[Ego Plum]]. Set in a [[dystopia]]n [[alternate history]] where [[Colonel Sanders]] is depicted as an imperialist dictator presiding over a land where rock music is outlawed, the play follows a quartet of Chicken Head puppets who discover and subsequently learn to play rock and roll music in an attempt to overthrow Sanders' regime. In addition to the Chicken Heads, the play's cast included [[GWAR]]{{'}}s Hunter Jackson (as his [[Techno Destructo]] persona), [[Haunted Garage]]{{'}}s [[Dukey Flyswatter]] and Mike Odd of [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] and [[Mac Sabbath]] in speaking roles.

====''Tales From The Coop'' and current activity (2017-present)====
On August 14, 2017, the Chicken Heads appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] revival of ''[[The Gong Show]]'', marking the band's second appearance on a ''Gong Show'' incarnation following 1998's ''Extreme Gong''. The band performed a cover of [[The Trashmen]]{{'}}s 1963 hit "[[Surfin' Bird]]", but were gonged after 41 seconds by guest judge [[Jack Black]].&lt;ref name="RCHGong2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/radioactive-chicken-heads-surfin-bird-the-gong-show/ |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads Perform ‘Surfin’ Bird’ on ‘The Gong Show’ + Get Eliminated Almost Instantly |publisher=[[Loudwire]] |date=August 25, 2017 |author=Hartmann, Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, the Chicken Heads released a music video of their recording of "Surfin' Bird" to YouTube.

After several years in production, the Chicken Heads independently released their fourth album ''[[Tales From The Coop]]'' on October 13, 2017. Produced by the Chicken Heads, [[Dave Klein (musician)|Dave Klein]], [[Jeff Forrest]] and Star Mendoza, ''Tales From The Coop'' takes the form of a [[concept album]] centered on the band's fictional backstory and menagerie of villains, featuring musical guest appearances from Klein, Dukey Flyswatter, [[Stolen Babies|Dominique Lenore Persi]], [[Count Smokula]] and [[Mac Sabbath|Ronald Osbourne]], as well as a songwriting co-credit by [[Sleepy Brown]] of [[Organized Noise]].

==Musical style and influences==
Over the last twenty years, the Chicken Heads have featured an erratic and frequently rotating line-up of musicians and instrumentalists, and have performed with as many as four to twelve musicians at a time over the course of their career. The band has sometimes included upwards of three guitarists on stage and often utilize a keyboardist and/or an accordionist, while their [[horn section]], when present, has ranged from a three-piece ensemble of trumpet, trombone and saxophone to a single trumpet. At one point in 1998, the band even included a [[violin]]ist as part of their stage show.&lt;ref name="ChickenXtra" /&gt; As of 2017, the band maintains a steadier line-up of between six and eight musicians, typically featuring a trumpeter and keyboardist, along with an additional one or two members on costume accompaniment.

Originally inspired by comedy metal bands [[Green Jellÿ]] and [[GWAR]], the Chicken Heads' first incarnation as Joe and the Chicken Heads produced their most abrasive material, boasting a sound predominantly grounded in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] and mixed with elements of [[ska punk]] and [[funk rock]].&lt;ref name="MaximumRCH" /&gt; Contemporary reviews of the band's shows drew comparisons such as "[[Fishbone]] meets GWAR" or "GWAR meets [[The Aquabats]]", while some reviewers coined unique terms like "[[doom metal|doom]] ska" and "chicken-doom-ska-rock" to describe their mix of styles.&lt;ref name="ThrasherChicken" /&gt;

Following their name change to The Radioactive Chicken Heads, the band began transitioning into a less thrashy and more melodic style of punk rock, emphasizing an offbeat eclectic edge inspired by the likes of [[The Residents]] and [[Oingo Boingo]], while also expanding their sound into occasional one-off genre experiments in styles ranging from [[reggae]] to [[rockabilly]]. The Chicken Heads' 2005 album ''[[Growing Mold]]'' featured a mix of punk, rock and [[blues]] songs interspersed with accordion and [[marimba]]-driven instrumentals, while their 2008 follow-up ''Music for Mutants'' returned to an entirely punk, rock and metal-oriented sound although with an increased use of keyboards and brass instruments. The ''OC Weekly'' has described the band's current style as a cross "between GWAR and [[The B-52s]]...a sound that might work well scoring a [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Ed Wood]] or [[Russ Meyer]] film", while ''[[Loudwire]]'' summarized them as "the [[Dead Kennedys]] on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]".&lt;ref name="RCHOCcapsule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-09-09/calendar/the-radioactive-chicken-heads/ |title=The Radioactive Chicken Heads |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |author=Ferguson, Brandon |date=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/10-bands-you-wont-believe-actually-exist/ |title=10 Bands You Won't Believe Actually Exist |date=April 4, 2016 |author=Hartmann, Graham |publisher=[[Loudwire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrically, the Chicken Heads have cited song parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] and children's musician [[Barry Louis Polisar]] as primary influences, and incorporate a similar style of [[pun]]s and [[surreal humour|absurdist humor]] into their songwriting.&lt;ref name="RCHOCcapsule" /&gt; Many of the band's songs center around their fictional backstory as mutant chickens, sometimes focusing on specific band members and stage villains, or references to bird-related popular culture such as "Headless Mike", an ode to the 1940s carnival attraction [[Mike the Headless Chicken]]. During their "Joe" era, the band performed many [[parody music|parody versions]] of popular punk rock songs, including "Put the Cheese Away (Keep It Refrigerated)", a spoof of [[The Offspring]]{{'}}s "[[Come Out and Play (song)|Come Out and Play (Keep 'Em Separated)]]", and "Just for the Taste of It", which repurposed [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]{{'}}s "[[Salvation (Rancid song)|Salvation]]" into a commercial jingle for [[Diet Coke]].

==Band mythology==
Having initially originated as a comic book concept, The Radioactive Chicken Heads have maintained an elaborate fictional narrative regarding the [[origin story|origins]] and [[Fictional universe|universe]] of their characters, detailed and expanded upon through their official press biographies, in-character interviews, song lyrics, music videos, video game and television pilot.&lt;ref name="BroowahaRCH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broowaha.com/articles/3406/radioactive-chickenheads-the-best-music-mutants-can-play |title=Radioactive Chicken heads: The Best Music Mutants Can Play |date=April 7, 2008 |publisher=[[Broowaha]] |author=Schwind, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RCHCarrotRabbit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Carrot Topp being attacked by Badd Bunny at the 2013 [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] [[Zombie Walk]].]]

The Chicken Heads' origin stories can be separated into two distinct eras, delineated by the band's name change from "Joe and the Chicken Heads" into "The Radioactive Chicken Heads". As "Joe and the Chicken Heads", the group's story began on Uncle Max's farm, an otherwise normal California farm located underneath a series of high-tension electromagnetic [[Electric power transmission|power lines]] and regularly subject to government-led experiments in [[genetic engineering]] which produced massively-sized sentient vegetables, among which was the seven-foot tall carrot, Carrot Topp. Finding themselves bored with farm life, Carrot Topp and the other mutant vegetables started a punk rock band called The Vegematics, an endeavor which soon ended in tragedy when Badd Bunny, a rabbit mutated into an evil ten-ton beast by the same radiation, broke into their rehearsal space and devoured most of the members.&lt;ref name="OffRCHbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioactivechickenheads.com/bio.html |title=The Radioactive Chicken Heads biography |date=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221051826/http://www.radioactivechickenheads.com/bio.html |archivedate=December 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Spring, Badd Bunny sabotaged Uncle Max's annual [[Egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]] by beating up the [[Easter Bunny]] and planting dozens of "genetically modified super-sized-mega-jumbo eggs" around the farm, hatching an army of gigantic mutant chickens. Max's nephew, a slightly unbalanced farmhand named Joe, saw a lucrative business opportunity and taught each of the chicken beasts how to play instruments, eventually debuting on the [[agricultural show|county fair]] circuit as the nation's premiere man/chicken musical combo: "Joe and the Chicken Heads". Ultimately, the rising tensions of "artistic differences" within the band drove Joe to behead his bandmates and sell their meaty bodies to an unnamed "[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]", leaving Carrot Topp to save his poultry pals by taking their heads and sewing them onto an assortment of human bodies he collected from the dumpster behind the local [[cryogenics]] lab, starting a whole new band bent on rock and roll stardom.&lt;ref name="OffRCHbio" /&gt;

Although elements of the Chicken Heads' original origin story served as the basis for the 2013 video game ''Badd Bunny Breakout'', the band's official backstory was almost entirely [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] following their name change to "The Radioactive Chicken Heads" in 2004, completely removing the character of Joe and the setting of Uncle Max's farm. As most thoroughly detailed in ''Tales From The Coop'' and "The Radioactive Chicken Heads Show", Carrot Topp and the Chicken Heads are instead presented as the accidental creations of Dr. Baron Von Kluckinstein, a maniacal [[mad scientist]] conducting experiments on vegetables and poultry to make super-sized "[[Genetically modified food|frankenfoods]]". Kept as prisoners in his secret laboratory, the Chicken Heads eventually break out to live freely as a vegetable/poultry punk band, all the while fighting off Dr. Kluckinstein's sizable menagerie of monsters and creatures ordered to bring them back to captivity.

===Live shows===
[[File:RCHLivevillains.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A typical collection of oddities at a Chicken Heads show in Los Angeles in March 2013.]]
In a similar vein to other bands with fictionalized personas like [[GWAR]] and [[The Aquabats]], the Chicken Heads are known for staging wild, theatrical live shows utilizing various props and costumed characters tying loosely into their thematic aesthetic. Due to the band members' attempt to retain [[anonymity]], the Chicken Heads are rarely seen without their trademark masks and costumes and never grant interviews outside of their character personas, and thus always perform in full costume; although Carrot Topp sings while holding a [[Microphone#Dynamic microphone|dynamic microphone]], a [[wireless microphone|wireless]] [[headset (audio)|headset microphone]] is used on the inside of his mask to provide voice clarity.

Every Chicken Heads show regularly features a host of extraneous characters outside of the main musicians, including both non-musician members who dance and interact with the audience during the band's set and "villains" who appear onstage to engage Carrot Topp in [[stage combat|staged combat]]. These villains are mostly specific to the songs being played by the band, such as Badd Bunny and Liquid Fat appearing during their respective eponymous songs or "[[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chucky Cheeze]]" for "Pest Control", or thematically match the subject of the song, such as "Evil Carrot", a skeletal version of Carrot Topp, who appears during the song "I Looked Into the Mirror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigwheelmagazine.com/show_reviews/green-jelly-45-grave-rosemarys-billygoat-frankenstein-radioactive-chicken-heads-at-the-knitting-factory-hollywood-ca-june-13-2009/ |title=Green Jelly – 45 Grave – Rosemary’s Billygoat – Frankenstein – Radioactive Chicken Heads – at The Knitting Factory – Hollywood, CA |date=June 13, 2009 |publisher=Big Wheel Magazine |author=Problems, Jo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigwheelmagazine.com/show_reviews/radioactive-chicken-heads-at-the-viper-room-hollywood-ca/ |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads – at The Viper Room – Hollywood, CA |date=January 21, 2012 |author=Problems, Jo |publisher=Big Wheel Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional music venues and festivals, the Chicken Heads have also performed within a wide variety of unconventional events and settings. Most notably, the band have been featured musical guests at [[Sinn Bodhi]]{{'}}s [[Sinn Bodhi#Freakshow Wrestling (2011-present)|Freakshow Wrestling]] throughout California and Nevada, as well as musical lead-ins for the award-winning Los Angeles production of [[Re-Animator: The Musical]] and select theatrical engagements of [[Richard Elfman]]{{'}}s 1980 film ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'', often performing alongside Elfman himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/as-we-see-it/2014/aug/27/freakshow-wrestling-returns-end-world-party/ |title=‘It’s ‘Pee-wee’s Playhouse’ on acid’: Freakshow Wrestling returns |date=August 27, 2014 |author=Rilling, Deanna |publisher=[[Las Vegas Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/05/10/re-animator-the-musical-now-with-ravaging-rock-band-openers |title=Re-Animator: The Musical - Now with ravaging rock band openers |date=May 10, 2011 |author=Lecaro, Lina |publisher=[[LA Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/06/fans_got_lost_at_the_forbidden.php |title=Fans Got Lost At the "Forbidden Zone" Shadow Cast Screening in Long Beach's Art Theatre |author=Vega, Priscella |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicken Heads have also remained a common fixture at the [[California Institute of Abnormalarts]], a [[North Hollywood]] nightclub and museum famous for its extensive [[sideshow]] and [[carnival]] memorabilia which exclusively hosts offbeat musical groups, [[burlesque]] and [[freak show]]s, having first played there in 2000 and having since been featured in the venue's numerous promotional materials and media coverage.&lt;ref name="WeirdChicken" /&gt;

==''Badd Bunny Breakout''==
[[File:RCHBBBcover.jpg|CD cover for ''Badd Bunny Breakout''|right|thumb|200px]]
On July 13, 2013, the Chicken Heads, in collaboration with independent game company Patient Corgi, released ''Badd Bunny Breakout'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[computer game]] modeled and styled after classic [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]]-era RPGs such as ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''. First announced on the band's website on September 6, 2012, ''Badd Bunny Breakout'' spent roughly a year in development, designed by Ian Luckey and Colleen Luckey with creative input by the Chicken Heads. The game was released as a free digital download on Patient Corgi's website, with a limited pressing of "Collector's Edition" [[CD-ROM]]s being made available through the Chicken Heads' website and live shows.&lt;ref name="DyingChicken" /&gt;

The soundtrack for ''Badd Bunny Breakout'' consists primarily of SNES-inspired [[16-bit]] remixes of the Chicken Heads' songs, composed by co-developer Ian Luckey, a member of the San Diego [[video game music]] cover band [http://kirbysdreamband.bandcamp.com/ Kirby's Dream Band]. A 49-track soundtrack album was packaged with the CD-ROM release and also made available for free download through both Patient Corgi's website and the Chicken Heads' [[Bandcamp]] account.

In promotion of the game, the Chicken Heads hosted and performed at a game release party at the [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] Theater inside Los Angeles' Meltdown Comics on the day of ''Badd Bunny Breakout''{{'}}s release, where the game was displayed for public play. The following week, the band performed a set at the 2013 Gam3rcon, an independent [[gaming convention]] which coincides with the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], playing to an audience of roughly 3000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gam3rcon.com/1/post/2013/07/gam3rcon-recap-saturday-and-sunday.html |title=Gam3rCon Recap: Saturday and Sunday |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=www.gam3rcon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicken Heads subsequently performed at the 2014 and 2015 Gam3rcons, and has since shared bills with several video game-themed bands, most notably having performed several times each with [[The Protomen]], [[The Megas (band)|The Megas]] and [[Random (musician)|Mega Ran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nerdgeist.com/2014/07/14/guide-to-gam3rcon-parties-during-sdcc-2014/ |publisher=Nerdgeist |date=July 14, 2014 |author=Tang, Jenny |title=Guide to Gam3rcon Parties during SDCC 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/325273-radioactive-chicken-heads |title=The Radioactive Chicken Heads |publisher=[[Songkick]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production on a Radioactive Chicken Heads-themed television pilot began as early as late 2011, when the band - with video director Kyle Caraher - launched a crowdfunding campaign on [[Indiegogo]] to help finance ''Behind the Mutants'', a documentary-styled short about the origins of the Chicken Heads, as well as the release of a DVD with never before seen footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/radioactive-chicken-heads-behind-the-mutants#/ |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads - Behind the Mutants |date=December 2011 |publisher=[[Indiegogo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was promoted by a video interview between the series' antagonist, Dr. Baron von Kluckinstein (played by artist Thom Foolery), and actress [[Allison Scagliotti]], though no mention was made if Scagliotti had any further involvement with the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is7kkEIlPsc |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads: Behind The Mutants with Allison Scagliotti |date=December 10, 2011 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the campaign only raised $1,537 of its desired $5,000 goal; though the Chicken Heads confirmed through Indiegogo that the amount was still enough to start pre-production, filming took place intermittently over a period of five years. During this time, the format of the pilot was significantly altered from its original [[mockumentary]] style into three individual segments based on the band's songs. In an Indiegogo update dated June 22, 2017, the band finally announced that principal photography was wrapped and post-production work was near completion. Throughout June and July 2017, the Chicken Heads released three promotional music videos edited together from footage from the three segments of the pilot: "The Sky is Falling", "Pox" and "Bird Brain".&lt;ref name="IndiegogoUpdates"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/radioactive-chicken-heads-behind-the-mutants#/updates/all |title=Radioactive Chicken Heads - Behind the Mutants - Updates |publisher=[[Indiegogo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2017, ''The Radioactive Chicken Heads Show'' received its world premiere as part of the OC Film Fiesta [[film festival]] in the Chicken Heads' hometown of [[Santa Ana, California]], where several of the members appeared following the screening to host an in-character Q&amp;A and perform a brief acoustic set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocweekly.com/dont-go-in-the-lake-special-screenings-oct-12-19-8492877/ |title=Don’t Go In the Lake [Special Screenings, Oct. 12-19] |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=October 12, 2017 |author=Coker, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.masamedia.org/ocfilmfiesta2017/index.php/musicians-on-film-at-afm-local-7 |title=Film Fiesta Celebrates Musicians |date=October 2017 |publisher=Masa Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next week, the pilot was screened as part of the Planet 9 Film Festival at the [[California Institute of Abnormalarts]] in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], where it was also accompanied by an acoustic set by the Chicken Heads.&lt;ref name="IndiegogoUpdates" /&gt; Finally, the pilot was released to YouTube in individual segments on November 21 ("Bird Brain"), December 23 ("Pox") and January 22, 2018 ("The Sky is Falling"). As of 2018, there has been no official announcement as to whether or not further episodes will be filmed.

==Band members and characters==
Since their original inception, the Chicken Heads have preferred to operate under complete anonymity, presenting themselves as a band of specific characters rather than costumed musicians; as such, there are no real names publicly attributed to the band members past or present, instead only the characters they portray. However, over the course of their decades-long career as a band, the Chicken Heads have experienced countless fluctuations in their typically five to ten-member line-up, and thus different characters play or used to play different instruments than the ones listed below.

The following roster reflects the Chicken Heads' current line-up as of 2017, according to both the liner notes of ''Tales From The Coop'' and subsequent updates to their official social media, while the timelines are those of the characters rather than the musician(s).

'''Rikki Jai''' is an [[Indo-Trinidadian]] [[chutney music|chutney]] and [[chutney-soca]] artiste born '''Samraj Jaimungal''' in Friendship Village, [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], [[Victoria County, Trinidad and Tobago|Victoria County]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

==Career==
Jai's 1988 debut single "Sumintra" told the tale of an [[Indo-Trinidadian]] woman from [[Debe]] who informed her [[boyfriend]] of her preference for [[Soca music|soca]] over the music of Indian artist [[Lata Mangeshkar]]. Jai returned the following year with "Pumping", then "Bolo" and "Show Me Yuh Motion". His 1993 song "Wine on a Bumsee" signalled Jai's exit from the soca world, opting for the "chutney soca" arena, in which he continues to perform. Jai released ''Chutney Vibrations'', a compilation with soca chutney rhythms and his re-reading of the Juma.
His most commercially successful release is "Mor Tor" featuring fellow Trini soca star [[Machel Montano]]. In 2007 he released songs such as "Aj Bhi Jeen" and "Bodekidal", followed by "Barman". Jai has won Chutney Soca Monarch a record-breaking six times. In 2011, he won his 6th title with the song "White Oak and Water".{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 2001 he tied for first place (with [[Bunji Garlin]]) for the "Young King" title and placed second in 2010's "Chutney Soca Monarch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,122996.html |author=Seeta Persad|title=Bigger cash prizes for Chutney artistes in 2011|date=25 June 2010|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was crowned champion at the 2011 Chutney Soca Monarch, and walked away with $2 million in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,136196.html|title=Rikki Jai wins $2M|date=21 February 2011|work=Trinidad and Tobago Newsday|accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Gabriel Mugabe''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ʊ|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|b|i}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|Mugabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-sn|muɡaɓe|lang}}; born 21 February 1924) is a [[Zimbabwe]]an revolutionary and politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Zimbabwe]] from 1980 to 1987 and then as [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] from 1987 to 2017. He chaired the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) group from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|ZANU – Patriotic Front]] (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]], during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a [[Marxist–Leninist]], although after the 1990s self-identified only as a [[socialist]]. His policies have been described as [[Robert Mugabe#Ideology|Mugabeism]].

&lt;!--Early life and revolutionary activity--&gt;
Mugabe was born to a poor [[Shona people|Shona]] family in [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama]], [[Southern Rhodesia]]. Following an education at [[Kutama College]] and the [[University of Fort Hare]], he worked as a school teacher in Southern Rhodesia, [[Northern Rhodesia]], and Ghana. Angered that Southern Rhodesia was a British colony governed by a [[White people in Zimbabwe|white minority]], Mugabe embraced [[Marxism]] and joined African nationalist protests calling for an independent black-led state. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of [[sedition]] and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to [[Mozambique]], established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw ZANU's role in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], fighting [[Ian Smith|Ian Smith's]] predominantly white government. He reluctantly took part in the peace negotiations brokered by the United Kingdom that resulted in the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. The agreement dismantled the short-lived [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] and resulted in the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|1980 general election]], at which Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory. Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and—despite his Marxist rhetoric and professed desire for a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]]—adhered largely to [[mainstream economics|mainstream]], conservative economic policies. His calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing [[white flight]].

&lt;!--Premiership and Presidency--&gt;
Relations with [[Joshua Nkomo|Joshua Nkomo's]] [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) declined, with Mugabe's government crushing ZAPU-linked opposition in [[Matabeleland]] during the [[Gukurahundi]] between 1982 and 1985; at least 10,000 people, mostly [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians, were killed by Mugabe's [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]]. Internationally, he sent troops into the [[Second Congo War]] and chaired the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (1986–89), the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (1997–98), and the [[African Union]] (2015–16). Pursuing [[decolonisation]], Mugabe emphasised the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|redistribution of land]] controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a "willing seller-willing buyer" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged the violent seizure of white-owned land. Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, drastic economic decline, and international sanctions. Opposition to Mugabe grew, although he was re-elected in [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2002|2002]], [[Zimbabwean general election, 2008|2008]], and [[Zimbabwean general election, 2013|2013]] through campaigns dominated by violence, [[electoral fraud]], and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. In 2017, members of his own party [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état|ousted him in a coup]], replacing him with former Vice President [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]].

&lt;!--Reception and legacy--&gt;
Having dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and divisive figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]] and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been accused of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, [[corruption in Zimbabwe|widespread corruption]], [[Racism in Zimbabwe|anti-white racism]], [[Human rights in Zimbabwe|human rights abuses]] and [[crimes against humanity]].

==Early life==

===Childhood: 1924–1945===
Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born on 21 February 1924 at the [[Kutama, Zimbabwe|Kutama Mission]] village in Southern Rhodesia's [[Zvimba District]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=17|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=19}} His father, Gabriel Matibiri, was a carpenter while his mother Bona taught Christian [[catechism]] to the village children.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3pp=19, 21|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=15}} They had been trained in their professions by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]s, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] apostolic order which had established the mission.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} Bona and Gabriel had six children: Miteri (Michael), Raphael, Robert, Dhonandhe (Donald), [[Sabina Mugabe|Sabina]], and Bridgette.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=17}} They belonged to the Zezuru clan, one of the smallest branches of the [[Shona language|Shona tribe]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Mugabe's paternal grandfather was Constantine Karigamombe, alias "Matibiri", a strong powerful figure, who served King [[Lobengula]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|title=Mugabe's grandfather served King Lobengula|publisher=Bulawayo|date=23 September 2017|auhor=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107223825/http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-118372.html|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=19}} while also becoming a devout Catholic.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=3}} Mugabe excelled at school,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} where he was a secretive and solitary child,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=20}} preferring to read alone rather than playing sport or socialising with other children.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=20–21}} He was taunted by many of the other children, who regarded him as a coward and a [[mother's boy]].{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=6–7}}

Circa 1930, Gabriel had an argument with one of the Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family were expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere.{{sfn|Blair|2002|pp=17–18}} They settled in a village about seven miles away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of [[diarrhoea]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Holland|3y=2008|3p=224}} Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at [[Bulawayo]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=21|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=15}} He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=21}}

Loubiere died shortly after and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the Mugabe family to return to Kutama.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=18}} In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=15|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} O'Hea nurtured the young Mugabe; shortly before his death in 1970 he described the latter as having "an exceptional mind and an exceptional heart".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=16}} As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the [[Irish War of Independence]], in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=21|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} After completing six years of elementary education, in 1941 Mugabe was offered a place on a teacher training course at [[Kutama College]]; Mugabe's mother could not afford the tuition fees, which were paid in part by his grandfather and in part by O'Hea.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=14|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=18|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=21|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=16}} As part of this education, Mugabe began teaching at his old school, thus earning £2 per month, which he used to support his family.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}} In 1944, Gabriel returned to Kutama with his three new children, but died shortly after, leaving Robert to take financial responsibility for both his three siblings and three half-siblings.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=18|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=16}}  Having attained a teaching diploma, Mugabe left Kutama in 1945.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=22}}

===Teaching career: 1945–1960===
Over the following years, Mugabe taught at various schools around Southern Rhodesia,{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=16|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=19|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=22}} among them the Dadaya Mission school in [[Zvishavane|Shabani]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=16|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2pp=16–17}} There is no evidence that Mugabe was involved in political activity at the time, and did not participate in the country's [[1948 in Southern Rhodesia|1948 general strike]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=19}} In 1949 he won a scholarship to study at the [[University of Fort Hare]] in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=16|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=19|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=22|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=17}} There he joined the [[African National Congress]],{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=17|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} and attended [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African [[communism|communists]] who introduced him to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=16|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=22}} He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=17|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=22–23}} In 1952, he left the university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=19|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} In later years he described his time at Fort Hare as the "turning-point" in his life.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=17}}

[[File:Kwame Nkrumah (JFKWHP-AR6409-A).jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mugabe was inspired by the example set by Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah.]]
Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1952,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=19|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=23}} by which time—he later related— he was "completely hostile to the [colonialist] system".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=23}} Here, his first job was as a teacher at the Driefontein Roman Catholic Mission School near [[Mvuma|Umvuma]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=17|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} In 1953 he relocated to the Highfield Government School in [[Harare|Salisbury]]'s [[Mbare|Harari township]] and in 1954 to the Mambo Township Government School in [[Gwelo]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=17}} Meanwhile, he gained a [[Bachelor of Education]] degree by correspondence from the [[University of South Africa]],{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} and ordered a number of Marxist tracts—among them [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Capital]]'' and [[Friedrich Engels]]' ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]''—from a London mail-order company.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=18|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=23}} Despite his growing interest in politics, he was not active in any political movement.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=23}} He joined a number of inter-racial groups, such as the [[Capricorn Africa Society]], through which he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=18–19}} [[Guy Clutton-Brock]], who knew Mugabe through this group, later noted that he was "an extraordinary young man" who could be "a bit of a cold fish at times" but "could talk about [[Elvis Presley]] or [[Bing Crosby]] as easily as politics".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=19|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2pp=18–19}}

From 1955 to 1958, Mugabe lived in neighbouring [[Northern Rhodesia]], where he worked at Chalimbana Teacher Training College in [[Lusaka]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} There he continued his education by working on a second degree by correspondence, this time a [[Bachelor of Public Administration|Bachelor of Administration]] from the [[University of London International Programmes]] through distance and learning. {{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=17}} In Northern Rhodesia, he was taken in for a time by the family of [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], whom Mugabe inspired to join the liberation movement and who would later go on to be [[President of Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/emmerson-mnangagwa-zimbabwe-crocodile-171124062910487.html|title=Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe's 'Crocodile'?|last=Marima|first=Tendai|date=24 November 2017|work=[[Al Jazeera News]]|access-date=25 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Mugabe moved to Ghana to work at St Mary's Teacher Training College in [[Takoradi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=21|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=19|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=23}} He taught at Apowa Secondary School, also at Takoradi, after obtaining his local certification at [[Achimota School|Achimota College]] (1958–1960), where he met his first wife, [[Sally Mugabe|Sally Hayfron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalblackhistory.com/2012/02/robert-mugabe-early-years.html|title=Robert Mugabe: The Early Years - Global Black History|date=2012-02-17|work=Global Black History|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209104945/http://www.globalblackhistory.com/2012/02/robert-mugabe-early-years.html|archivedate=9 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mugabe, "I went [to Ghana] as an adventurist.

==Revolutionary activity==

===Early political career: 1960–1963===
While Mugabe was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Southern Rhodesia African National Congress]], founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=33–34|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=24–25}} This was replaced by the more radically oriented [[National Democratic Party (Rhodesia)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP), founded in January 1960.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=35|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=26}} In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=24|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=26}} The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist [[Leopold Takawira]], urged them to stay.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=26}}

[[File:Joshua Nkomo (1978).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nkomo became one of the leading figures of resistance to white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia.]]

In July 1960, Takawira and two other NDP officials were arrested; in protest, Mugabe joined a demonstration of 7,000 people who planned to march from Highfield to the Prime Minister's office in Salisbury. The demonstration was stopped by riot police outside Stoddart Hall in Harare township.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=25–26|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=26|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=43}} By midday the next day, the crowd had grown to 40,000 and a makeshift platform had been erected for speakers. Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited to speak to the crowd.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=27|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=26|3a1=Holland|3y=2008|3p=13}} Following this event, Mugabe decided to devote himself full-time to activism, resigning his teaching post in Ghana (after having served two years of the four-year teaching contract).{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=27}} He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by [[Chitepo]] on the procedural aspects. Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=37|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=27|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=44}} Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=37}} He helped to form the NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female [[ululation]] into its meetings.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=37–38}} In February 1961 he married Hayfron in a Roman Catholic ceremony conducted in Salisbury; she had converted to Catholicism to make this possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=38|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=20|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=27|4a1=Holland|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Norman|5y=2008|5p=44}}

The British government held a Salisbury conference in 1961 to determine Southern Rhodesia's future. Nkomo led an NDP delegation, which hoped that the British would support the creation of an independent state governed by the black majority. Representatives of the country's white minority—who then controlled Southern Rhodesia's government—were opposed to this, promoting continued white minority rule.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=27–28}} Following negotiations, Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. Mugabe and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=39–40|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=28}} Following the conference, Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=28}} Mugabe spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=42|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=29|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=44}} Many of its members re-grouped as the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) several days later,{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=43|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=29|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=44}} with Mugabe appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=44}}

Racial violence was growing in the country, with aggrieved black Africans targeting the white community.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=29}} Mugabe deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in the overthrow of British colonial dominance and white minority rule. This contrasted with Nkomo's view that African nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage the British government to grant their demands.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=29}} Nine months after it had been founded, ZAPU was also banned by the government,{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=43|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=29|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=44}} and in September 1962 Mugabe and other senior party officials were arrested and restricted to their home districts for three months.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=43|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=29|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=44}}  Both Mugabe and his wife were in trouble with the law; he had been charged with making subversive statements in a public speech and awarded bail before his trial.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=45|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=31}} Hayfron had been sentenced to two years imprisonment—suspended for 15 months—for a speech in which she declared that the British Queen [[Elizabeth II]] "can go to hell".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=45–46|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=31}}

The rise of African nationalism generated a white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing [[Rhodesian Front]] winning the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962|December 1962 general election]]. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full independence from the United Kingdom.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=45|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=30}} Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, it was time to move towards armed resistance.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=30}} Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in [[Dar es Salaam]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=44–45|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=30–31}} He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the [[Tanganyika]]n city.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=46–47|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=31}} There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, [[Julius Nyerere]], who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=47|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=31}}

In August, Hayfron gave birth to Mugabe's son, whom they named Nhamodzenyika, a Shona term meaning "suffering country".{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=48|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=20|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=32|4a1=Holland|4y=2008|4p=14|5a1=Norman|5y=2008|5p=45}} Mugabe insisted that she take their son back to Ghana, while he decided to return to Southern Rhodesia.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=49|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=32}} There, African nationalists opposed to Nkomo's leadership had established a new party, the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), in August; [[Ndabaningi Sithole]] became the group's president, while appointing Mugabe to be the group's secretary-general ''in absentia''.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=49|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=32|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=46}} Nkomo responded by forming his own group, the People's Caretaker Council, which was widely referred to as "ZAPU" after its predecessor.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=32}} ZAPU and ZANU violently opposed one another and soon gang warfare broke out between their rival memberships.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=33}}&lt;ref name="struggleforzimbabwe7071"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Struggle for Zimbabwe|last1=Martin|first1=David|last2=Johnson|first2=Phyllis|date=July 1981|edition=First |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|isbn=978-0-571-11066-7|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at [[Sinoia]], and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near [[Chegutu|Hartley]], killing its inhabitants.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=55–56}} The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=55|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=34}} There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding;{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=56}} Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, [[Enos Nkala]], and [[Edgar Tekere]].{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=34}} He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=34}} During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=22|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=34}}

[[File:Ian Smith 1950s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|While Mugabe was imprisoned, Ian Smith became leader of Rhodesia.]]
While imprisoned, Mugabe learned that his son had died of [[encephalitis]] at the age of three. Mugabe was grief-stricken and requested a leave of absence to visit his wife in Ghana. He never forgave the prison authorities for refusing this request.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=57–58|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2pp=21–22|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3pp=34–35|4a1=Holland|4y=2008|4pp=27–28}} Claims have also circulated among those who knew him at the time that Mugabe was subjected to both physical and mental torture during his imprisonment.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=158}} According to Father Emmanuel Ribeiro, who was Mugabe's priest during his imprisonment, Mugabe got through the experience "partly through the strength of his spirituality" but also because his "real strength was study and helping others to learn".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=152}}

While Mugabe was imprisoned, in August 1964, the Rhodesian Front government—now under the leadership of [[Ian Smith]]—banned ZANU and ZAPU and arrested all remaining leaders of the country's African nationalist movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=33|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=51}} Smith's government made a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence from the United Kingdom]] in November 1965, renaming Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia; the UK refused to recognise the legitimacy of this and imposed economic sanctions on the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=55|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=21|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3pp=35–36|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=54}}

In 1972, the African nationalists launched a guerrilla war against Smith's government.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=36–37}} Among the revolutionaries, it was known as the "Second Chimurenga".{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Alao|2y=2012|2p=21}} Paramilitary groups based themselves in neighbouring Tanzania and Zambia, although many of their fighters were inadequately armed and trained.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=61}} ZANU's military wing, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), consisted largely of Shona. It was based in neighbouring Mozambique and gained funds from the People's Republic of China. ZAPU's military wing, the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), was instead funded by the [[Soviet Union]], was based in Zambia, and consisted largely of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=36–37|3a1=Alao|3y=2012|3p=20}}

Mugabe and other senior ZANU members had growing doubts about Sithole's leadership, deeming him increasingly irritable and irrational.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=66}} In October 1968 Sithole had tried to smuggle a message out of the prison commanding ZANU activists to assassinate Smith. His plan was discovered and he was put on trial in January 1969; desperate to avoid a death sentence, he declared that he renounced violence and his previous ideological commitments.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=66–68|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=55}} Mugabe denounced Sithole's "treachery" in rejecting ZANU's cause, and the executive removed him as ZANU President in a [[vote of no confidence]], selecting Mugabe as his successor.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=68|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=22|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=56}} In November 1974, the ZANU executive voted to suspend Sithole's membership of the organisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=72|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=57}}

Fearing that the guerrilla war would spread south, the South African government pressured Rhodesia to advance the process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=22|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=57}} After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=22|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=37|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=59}} He moved in with his sister Sabina at her home in Highfield township.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=22}} He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=37}} recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=23}} This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the [[Manyika tribe|Manyika]] and [[Karange]] groups of Shona.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=76–78}}

===Guerrilla war: 1975–1979===
[[File:Flag of ZANU-PF.svg|thumb|right|The flag of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)]]
In March 1975, Mugabe resolved to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious to take control of ZANU's guerrilla campaign.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=4}} After his friend [[Maurice Nyagumbo]] was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and a sympathetic nun then assisted him and [[Edgar Tekere]] in smuggling themselves into Mozambique.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=23|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=4–5}} Mugabe remained in exile there for two years.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=5}} Mozambique's Marxist President [[Samora Machel]] was sceptical of Mugabe's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in [[Quelimane]] although kept him under partial [[house arrest]], with Mugabe requiring permission to travel.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=80–81|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=23}} It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=23}}

Mugabe travelled to various ZANLA camps in Mozambique to build support among its officers.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=81}} By mid-1976, he had secured the allegiance of ZANLA's military commanders and established himself as the most prominent guerrilla leader battling Smith's regime.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=23}} In August 1977, he was officially declared ZANU President at a meeting of the party's central committee held in [[Chimoio]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=101|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=62}} 
During the war, Mugabe remained suspicious of many of ZANLA's commanders and had a number of them imprisoned.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, [[Wilfred Mhanda]], for suspected disloyalty.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} After Tongogara was killed in a car accident in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe may have had some involvement in it, although these rumours were never substantiated.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2pp=55–56}}

Mugabe remained aloof from the day-to-day military operations of ZANLA, which he entrusted to [[Josiah Tongogara]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=23}} In January 1976, ZANLA launched its first major infiltration from Mozambique, with nearly 1000 guerrillas crossing the border to attack white-owned farms and stores.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=83|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=60}} In response, Smith's government enlisted all men under the age of 35, expanding the Rhodesian army by 50%.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=83|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=60}} ZANLA's attacks forced large numbers of white landowners to abandon their farms; their now-unemployed black workers joined ZANLA in their thousands.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=100}} By 1979, ZANLA were in a position to attack a number of Rhodesian cities.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=115–116}} Over the course of the war, at least 30,000 people were killed.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=10}} As a proportion of their wider population, the whites lost a higher number of fatalities,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=10}} and by the latter part of the decade the guerrillas were winning.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=109}}

[[File:Mugabe76Romania.jpg|thumb|left|Mugabe in a meeting with Romanian communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in 1979]]
Mugabe focused on the propaganda war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=23}} In these, he presented himself as a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]], speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Fidel Castro]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=88|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=61}} His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=88}} He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western embassies in Mozambique,{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=89}} and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=99, 109, 114|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2pp=61, 63–64}}

Mugabe called for the overthrow of Rhodesia's predominantly white government, the execution of Smith and his "criminal gang", the expropriation of white-owned land, and the transformation of Rhodesia into a [[communist state|one-party Marxist state]].{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=7}} He repeatedly called for violence against the country's white minority,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=11}} referring to white Rhodesians as "blood-sucking exploiters", "sadistic killers", and "hard-core racists".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} In one typical example, taken from a 1978 radio address, Mugabe declared: "Let us hammer [the white man] to defeat. Let us blow up his citadel. Let us give him no time to rest. Let us chase him in every corner. Let us rid our home of this settler vermin".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=11}} For Mugabe, armed struggle was an essential part of the establishment of a new state.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=2}} In contrast to other black nationalist leaders like Nkomo, Mugabe opposed a negotiated settlement with Smith's government.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=2}} In October 1976 ZANU nevertheless established a joint-platform with ZAPU known as the Patriotic Front.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=92–94|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=61}}
In September 1978 Mugabe met with Nkomo in Lusaka. He was angry with the latter's secret attempts to negotiate with Smith.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=112}}

=== Lancaster House Agreement: 1979 ===
Under pressure from South African Prime Minister [[B. J. Vorster]], Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule could not be prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|1979 general election]] which resulted in [[Abel Muzorewa]], a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister of the reconstituted [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]]. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=117|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=63}} At the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979]], held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise the country's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule.{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=118–120}}

[[File:Lancaster House (5880536589).jpg|thumb|right|Lancaster House in London's West End]]
The negotiations took place at [[Lancaster House]] in London and were led by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Peter Carington]].{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=58}} Mugabe refused to attend these London peace talks,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=6–7}} opposing the idea of a negotiated as opposed to military solution to the Rhodesian War.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=122|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=60}} Machel insisted that he must, threatening to end Mozambican support for the ZANU-PF if he did not.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=60|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=69|4a1=Tendi|4y=2011|4p=310}} Mugabe arrived in London in September 1979.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=122|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=7}} There, he and Nkomo presented themselves as part of the "Patriotic Front" but established separate headquarters in the city.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=38|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=58}} At the conference the pair were divided in their attitude; Nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while Mugabe played up to his image as a Marxist revolutionary, with Carington exploiting this division.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=61}} Throughout the negotiations, Mugabe did not trust the British and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1pp=122–23|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=7–8}}

The [[Lancaster House Agreement]] called for all participants in the Rhodesian Bush War to agree to a ceasefire, with a British governor, [[Christopher Soames]], arriving in Rhodesia to oversee an election in which the various factions could compete as political parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=8|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=67}} It outlined a plan for a transition to formal independence as a sovereign republic under black-majority rule, also maintaining that Rhodesia would be renamed Zimbabwe, a name adopted from the Iron Age archaeological site of [[Great Zimbabwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=11|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=69}} The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges,{{sfn|Tendi|2011|p=313}} with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1a2=Simpson|1y=1981|1p=127|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=67|3a1=Tendi|3y=2011|3p=311}} By insisting on the need for a democratic black majority government, Carington was able to convince Mugabe to compromise on the other main issue of the conference, that of land ownership.{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=62–63}} Mugabe agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and US governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=63}} 
Mugabe was opposed to the idea of a ceasefire, but under pressure from Machel he agreed to it.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=8}} Mugabe signed the agreement, although felt cheated,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=8}} remaining disappointed that he had never achieved a military victory over the Rhodesian forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=235|2a1=Tendi|2y=2011|2p=313}}

===Electoral campaign: 1980===
Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe was greeted by a supportive crowd.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=9|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=70}} He settled into a house in [[Mount Pleasant, Harare|Mount Pleasant]], a wealthy white-dominated suburb.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=13|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=71}} Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any [[white flight]] after the election would cause economic damage as it had in Mozambique.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=9|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Tendi|3y=2011|3p=313}} Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=9}} Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=38|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=70}} He formed ZANU into a political party, known as [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF).{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=70}} Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election on the basis of the country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=12}} For many in the white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=11}}

[[File:Mugabe 1979 a.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mugabe on a visit to the Netherlands in 1979]]
During the campaign, Mugabe survived two assassination attempts.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=11|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=71}} In the first, which took place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=11|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=71}} In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a [[Masvingo|Fort Victoria]] rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=11|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=71}} Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=11}} In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with [[Peter Walls]], the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, and asked him to remain in his position in the event of a ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=12}}

The electoral campaign was marred by widespread [[voter intimidation]], perpetrated by Nkomo's ZAPU, [[Abel Muzorewa]]'s [[United African National Council]] (UANC), and Mugabe's ZANU-PF.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=10|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=73}} Commenting on ZANU-PF's activities in eastern Rhodesia, Nkomo complained that "the word ''intimidation'' is mild. People are being terrorised. It is ''terror''."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=10}} Reacting to ZANU-PF's acts of voter intimidation, Mugabe was called before Soames at Government House. Mugabe regarded the meeting as a British attempt to thwart his electoral campaign.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=10–11}} Under the terms of the negotiation, Soames had the power to disqualify any political party guilty of voter intimidation.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=11}} Rhodesia's security services, Nkomo, Muzorewa, and some of his own advisers all called on Soames to disqualify ZANU-PF. After deliberation, Soames disagreed, believing that ZANU-PF were sure to win the election and that disqualifying them would wreck any chance of an orderly transition of power.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=11}}

In [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|the February election]], ZANU-PF secured 63% of the national vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an [[Majority of the entire membership|absolute majority]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=12|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=13|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=73}} ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=12}} Mugabe was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=156}} Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=13|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=xiii|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=74}}

Mugabe took his [[oath of office]] on 17 April 1980.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=9}} He gave a speech at Salisbury's [[Rufaro Stadium]] announcing that Rhodesia would be renamed "Zimbabwe" and pledged racial reconciliation.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=14–15}} Soames aided Mugabe in bringing about an orderly transition of power; for this Mugabe remained grateful, describing Soames as a good friend.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=14}} Mugabe unsuccessfully urged Soames to remain in Zimbabwe for several more years,{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=14|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=72}} and also failed to convince the UK to assume a two-year "guiding role" for his government because most ZANU-PF members lacked experience in governing.{{sfn|Tendi|2011|p=311}} Although ZANU-PF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, Mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=14}} Mugabe moved into the Premier's residence in Salisbury, which he left furnished in the same style as Smith had left it.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=41}}

Across the country, statues of [[Cecil Rhodes]] were removed and squares and roads named after prominent colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=48}} In 1982 Salisbury was [[List of placename renaming in Zimbabwe|renamed]] Harare.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=48|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=78}} Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design [[National Heroes Acre (Zimbabwe)|Heroes' Acre]], a monument and complex in western Harare to commemorate the struggle against minority rule.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=77}} Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that a stable and prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=47}} The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25&amp;nbsp;million three-year aid package.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=47}} The UK financed a land reform program,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=46}} and provided military advisers to aid the integration of the guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces|new Zimbabwean military]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=46|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=75}} Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=59}} As Prime Minister, Mugabe retained Walls as the head of the armed forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=14|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=74}}

Mugabe's government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=78}} In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=48}} In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=14}} From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew by an average of 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and [[real income]] declined.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} In 1980, Zimbabwe had just 177 secondary schools, by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}}

A new leadership elite were formed, who often expressed their newfound status through purchasing large houses and expensive cars, sending their children to private schools, and obtaining farms and businesses.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=81}} To contain their excesses, in 1984 Mugabe drew up a "leadership code" which prohibited any senior figures from obtaining more than one salary or owning over 50-acres of agricultural land.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=81}} There were exceptions, with Mugabe giving permission to General [[Solomon Mujuru]] to expand his business empire, resulting in him becoming one of the Zimbabwe's wealthiest people.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=82}} Growing corruption among the socio-economic elite generated resentment among the wider population, much of which was living in poverty.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=83}}

ZANU-PF also sought to establish its own business empire, founding the M&amp;S Syndicate in 1980 and the Zidoo Holdings in 1981.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=82}} By 1992, the party had fixed assets and businesses worth an estimated Z$500&amp;nbsp;million (US$75&amp;nbsp;million).{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=82}} In 1980, ZANU-PF used Nigerian funds to set up the [[Mass Media Trust]], through which they bought out a South African company that owned most of Zimbabwe's newspapers.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1pp=80–81|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=75}} The white editors of these newspapers were sacked and replaced by government appointees.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=81|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=75}} These media outlets subsequently became a source of the party's propaganda.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=81|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=75}}

At independence, 39% of Zimbabwe's land was under the ownership of around 6000 white large-scale commercial farmers, while 4% was owned by black small-scale commercial farmers, and 41% was 'communal land' where 4 million people lived, often in overcrowded conditions.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=120}} The Lancaster House agreement ensured that until 1990, the sale of land could only take place on a "willing seller-willing buyer" basis. The only permitted exceptions were if the land was "underutilised" or needed for a public purpose, in which case the government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating the owner.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=119}} This meant that Mugabe's government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=119}} Its targets was to resettle 18,000 black families on 2.5&amp;nbsp;million acres of white-owned land over three years. This would cost £30&amp;nbsp;million (US$60&amp;nbsp;million), half of which was to be provided by the UK government as per the Lancaster House Agreement.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=120}}

In 1986, Mugabe became chair of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), a position that he retained until 1989.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=85}} As the leader of one of the [[Front Line States]], the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the anti-apartheid movement.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=85}}

===Race relations===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The wrongs of the past must now stand forgiven and forgotten. If ever we look to the past, let us do so for the lesson the past has taught us, namely that [[oppression]] and racism are inequalities that must never find scope in our political and social system.

An evil remains an evil whether practised by white against black or black against white.|salign=right |source=— Mugabe's speech after his 1980 victory{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=15}} }}

Mugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=14|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=41}} He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property.{{sfn|Tendi|2011|pp=313–314}} He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1pp=14–15|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=42, 44|3a1=Holland|3y=2008|3p=107|4a1=Norman|4y=2008|4p=74}} met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=15|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=45}} and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and [[Ken Flower]] with his apparent sincerity.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1pp=13, 15|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=42}} With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved during the early years of Mugabe's regime.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=45}} In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=46}}

Nevertheless, many white Zimbabweans complained that they were the victims of [[racial discrimination]].{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=50}} Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=46}} There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 17,000 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=46|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=75}} Mugabe's government had pledged support for the [[African National Congress]] and other [[anti-apartheid movement|anti-apartheid]] forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=47}} To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=47}} In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=51|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2pp=36–37|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|2p=76}}

In December 1981, a bomb struck ZANU-PF headquarters, killing seven and injuring 124.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=52|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=77}} Mugabe blamed South African-backed white militants.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=52}} He criticised "reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements" in the white community, stating that despite the fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and "are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage our economy, and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=52}} Increasingly he criticised not only the militants but the entire white community for holding a monopoly on "Zimbabwe's economic power".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=52–53}} This was a view echoed by many government ministers and the government-controlled media.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=50}} One of these ministers, Tekere, was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white-owned farmhouse, killing an elderly farmer; they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt. Tekere was acquitted of murder although Mugabe dropped him from the cabinet.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=49}}

Racial mistrust and suspicion continued to grow.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=53}} In December 1981, the elderly white MP [[Wally Stuttaford]] was accused of being a South African agent, arrested, and tortured, generating anger among whites.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=53|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=77}} In July 1982, South African-backed white militants destroyed 13 aircraft at [[Gweru-Thornhill Air Base|Thornhill]].

===Relations with ZAPU and the Gukurahundi===
{{Main article|Gukurahundi}}
[[File:Zimbabwe African People's Union flag.png|thumb|right|The flag of ZAPU, which were largely eliminated by ZANU-PF in the Gukurahundi]]
Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a ceremonial role with no governmental power; the first President was [[Canaan Banana]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=74}} Mugabe had previously offered the position to Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=39|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=74}} Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=39}} Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=59–60}} In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=60}} Tekere and [[Enos Nkala]] were particularly adamant that there should be a crackdown on ZAPU.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=60}} After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in [[Entumbane]], street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=61|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=76}}

In January 1981, Mugabe demoted Nkomo in a cabinet reshuffle; the latter warned that this would anger ZAPU supporters.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=61}} In February, violence between ZAPU and ZANU-PF supporters broke out among the battalion stationed at [[Ntabazindune]], soon spreading to other army bases, resulting in 300 deaths.{{Sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=61–62}} An arms cache featuring land mines and anti-aircraft missiles were then discovered at Ascot Farm, which was part-owned by Nkomo. Mugabe cited this as evidence that ZAPU were plotting a coup, an allegation that Nkomo denied.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=62, 64|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=77}} Likening Nkomo to "a cobra in the house", Mugabe sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=63|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=78}}

Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA had deserted their positions and engaged in [[banditry]].{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=60}} In [[Matabeleland]], ZIPRA deserters who came to be known as "dissenters" engaged in robbery, holding up buses, and attacking farm houses, creating an environment of growing lawlessness.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=64}} These dissidents received support from South Africa through its [[Operation Mute]], by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=64}} The government often conflated ZIPRA with the dissenters,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=66}} although Nkomo denounced the dissidents and their South African supporters.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=65}} Mugabe authorised the police and army to crack down on the Matabeleland dissenters, declaring that state officers would be granted legal immunity for any "extra-legal" actions they may perform while doing so.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=65}} During 1982 he had established the [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]], an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans; membership was drawn largely from Shona-speaking ZANLA soldiers and were answerable directly to Mugabe.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=65|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=77}} In January 1983, the Fifth Brigade were deployed in the region, overseeing a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions, and massacres of those accused of being sympathetic to the dissidents.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=30|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=67}} The scale of the violence was greater than that witnessed in the Rhodesian War.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=67}} Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=70}} Mugabe acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that "we can't tell who is a dissident and who is not".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=33}} The ensuing events became known as the "Gukurahundi", a Shona word meaning "wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=31}}

[[File:Matabeleland.svg|thumb|left|The Gukurahundi took place in Zimbabwe's western provinces of Matabeleland (pictured)]]
In 1984 the Gukurahundi spread to Matabelelend South, an area then in its third year of drought. The Fifth Brigade closed all stores, halted all deliveries, and imposed a curfew, exacerbating starvation for a period of two months.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=32|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=69}} The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bulawayo|Bishop of Bulawayo]] accused Mugabe of overseeing a project of systematic starvation.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=70}} When a Roman Catholic delegation provided Mugabe with a dossier listing atrocities committed by the Fifth Brigade, Mugabe refuted all its allegations and accused the clergy of being disloyal to Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=67–68}} He had the [[Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe]]'s suppressed.{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=148–149}} In 1985, an [[Amnesty International]] report on the Gukurahundi was dismissed by Mugabe as "a heap of lies".{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=73|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=79}} Over the course of four years, approximately 10,000 civilians had been killed, and many others had been beaten and tortured.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=75|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=109}} Genocide Watch later estimated that approximately 20,000 had been killed.{{sfn|Tendi|2011|p=308}}

[[Margaret Thatcher]]'s UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans.{{sfnm|1a1=Holland|1y=2008|1p=66|2a1=Tendi|2y=2011|2pp=308–309}} The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President [[Ronald Reagan]] welcoming Mugabe to the [[White House]] in September 1983.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=34}} In October 1983, Mugabe attended the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1983|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=34}} In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was "an act of madness&amp;nbsp;... it was wrong and both sides were to blame".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=74}} Meredith argued however that Mugabe and his ZANU-PF were solely to blame for the massacres.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=74}} Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU-PF one-party state.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=32|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=74}}

There was further violence in the build-up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from ZANU-PF Youth Brigades.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=71}} Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=71}} Mugabe then appointed Nkala as the new police minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=71–73}} To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU-PF.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=34|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=73|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=79}} The merger between the two parties left ZANU-PF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=36|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=79}} and established Zimbabwe as a ''de facto'' one-party state.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=34}}

===Constitutional and economic reform: 1987–1995===
[[File:President Zimbabwe , Robert Mugabe bezoekt Nederland Robert Mugabe , kop, Bestanddeelnr 932-1922.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister Mugabe in 1982]]
In late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=36}} On 30 December it declared Mugabe to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=79|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=80}} This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare martial law, and run for an unlimited number of terms.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=79}} According to his biographer Martin Meredith, Mugabe now had "a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=79}} The constitutional amendments also abolished the twenty parliamentary seats reserved for white representatives,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=36|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=80}} and left parliament less relevant and independent.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=80}}

In the build-up to the 1990 election, parliamentary reforms increased the number of seats to 120; of these, twenty were to be appointed by the President and ten by the Council of Chiefs.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=36|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=89}} This measure made it more difficult for any opposition to Mugabe to gain a parliamentary majority.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=89}} The main opposition party in that election were the [[Zimbabwe Unity Movement]] (ZUM), launched in April 1989 by Tekere;{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=36|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=87|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=80}} although a longstanding friend of Mugabe, Tekere accused him of betraying the revolution and establishing a dictatorship.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=80}} ZANU-PF propaganda made threats against those considering voting ZUM in the election; one television advert featured images of a car crash with the statement "This is one way to die. Another is to vote ZUM. Don't commit suicide, vote ZANU-PF and live."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=91}} In the election, Mugabe was re-elected President with nearly 80% of the vote, while ZANU-PF secured 116 of the 119 available parliamentary seats.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=36|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=93}}

Although Mugabe had long hoped to convert Zimbabwe into a one-party state, in 1990 he officially "postponed" these plans as both Mozambique and many Eastern Bloc states transitioned from one-party states to multi-party republics.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=97}} Following the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU-PF removed references to "Marxism-Leninism" and "[[scientific socialism]]" in its material, although Mugabe maintained that "socialism remains our sworn ideology".{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=97|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=81}} That year, Mugabe pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a [[structural adjustment programme]] provided by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=37|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=136}} This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs;{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=37}} Mugabe's government implemented some although not all of its recommendations.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=37|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=136}} The reforms encouraged employers to cut their wages, generating growing opposition from the [[Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=38}}

By 1990, 52,000 black families had been settled on 6.5&amp;nbsp;million acres. This was insufficient to deal with the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=121}} That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=122}} The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 black families on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=122}} Zimbabwe's [[Commercial Farmers Union]] argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=122–123}}

Concerns about the proposed measure—particularly its denial of the right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=122}} The US, UK, IMF, and [[World Bank]] threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=123}} Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=123–124}} Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=124}} In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as [[Witness Mangwede]], who was leased a 3000-acre farm in [[Hwedza]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1pp=126–127|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2pp=127–128}} Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44&amp;nbsp;million for land redistribution—halted its payments.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=127|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=98}}

In January 1992, Mugabe's wife died.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=96|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=81}} In April 1995, ''Horizon'' magazine revealed that Mugabe had secretly been having an affair with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 and that she had borne him a son and a daughter.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=107|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=80}} His secret revealed, Mugabe decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe, [[Patrick Chakaipa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=108|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=82}} The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of Mugabe and Marufu's relationship.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=108|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=148}} To house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at Borrowdale.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=109}} In the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 1995|1995 parliamentary election]]—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU-PF gained 147 out of 150 seats.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=38}} Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=127}}

===Economic decline: 1995–2000===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the mid-1990s Mugabe had become an irascible and petulant dictator, brooking no opposition, contemptuous of the law and human rights, surrounded by sycophantic ministers and indifferent to the incompetence and corruption around him. His record of economic management was lamentable. He had failed to satisfy popular expectations in education, health, land reform, and employment. And he had alienated the entire white community. Yet all the while Mugabe continued to believe in his own greatness. Isolated and remote from ordinary reality, possessing no close friends and showing clear signs of paranoia, he listened only to an inner circle of conspiratorial aids and colleagues. Whatever difficulties occurred he attributed to old enemies—Britain, the West, the old Rhodesian network—all bent, he believed, on destroying his "revolution".|salign=right |source=— Mugabe biographer [[Martin Meredith]]{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=131}} }}

Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=39}} By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=17}} By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=39}} As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=71}} In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=39|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=123}} To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=39|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=83}} In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=39|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=110}}

Mugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=42|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=17, 128}} He called on supporters "to strike fear in the hearts of the white man, our real enemy",{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=17}} and accused his black opponents of being dupes of the whites.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=18}} Amid growing internal opposition to his government, he remained determined to stay in power.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=17}} He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leader.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=68}}

Mugabe also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an "un-African" import from Europe.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=129}} He described gay people as being "guilty of sub-human behaviour", and of being "worse than dogs and pigs".{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=131|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=115}} This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values but also from an awareness that militant [[homophobia]] would distract attention from the country's problems.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=129}} In August 1995, he was due to open a human rights-themed [[Zimbabwe International Book Fair]] in Harare but refused to do so until a stall run by the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe group was evicted.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=129–130}}

[[File:Tony Blair crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright|UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, with whom Mugabe had a particularly antagonistic relationship]]
In 1996, Mugabe was appointed chair of the defence arm of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=147–148}} Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Congo to side with President [[Laurent Kabila]] in the [[Second Congo War]].{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=148}} He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=148}} He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=148}} Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US$1&amp;nbsp;million a day, contributing to its economic problems.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=148}} Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=41|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=148}} However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential trade terms in minerals from Kabila's government.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=148}}

In January 1999, 23 military officers were arrested for plotting a coup against Mugabe. The government sought to hide this, although it was reported on by journalists from ''[[The Standard (Zimbabwe)|The Standard]]''. The military subsequently illegally arrested the journalists and tortured them.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=41|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=149–150}} This brought international condemnation, with the EU and seven donor nations issuing protest notes.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=151}} Lawyers and human rights activists protested outside parliament until being dispersed by riot police,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=151}} and the country's Supreme Court judges issued a letter condemning the military's actions.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=151–152}} In response, Mugabe publicly defended the use of extra-legal arrest and torture.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=153}}

In 1997, [[Tony Blair]] was elected Prime Minister of the UK; his [[New Labour]] government expressed reticence toward restarting the land resettlement payments promised by the Lancaster House Agreement, with minister [[Clare Short]] rejecting the idea that the UK had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=133|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2pp=95, 97}} This attitude fuelled anti-imperialist sentiment across Africa.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=102}} In October 1999, Mugabe visited Britain; in London, the human rights activist [[Peter Tatchell]] attempted to place him under [[citizen's arrest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=134|2a1=Holland|2y=2008|2p=95}} Mugabe believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=135}} It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=135}} with Mugabe expressing scorn for what he called "Blair and company".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=136}} In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=138}} In December 1999, the IMF terminated financial support for Zimbabwe, citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=49|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=119}}

To meet growing demand for constitutional reform, in April 1999 Mugabe's government appointed a 400-member Constitutional Commission to draft a new constitution which could be put to a referendum.{{sfnm|1a1=Sithole|1y=2001|1p=163|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=163}} The [[National Constitutional Assembly]]—a pro-reform pressure group established in 1997—expressed concern that this commission was not independent of the government, noting that Mugabe had the power to amend or reject the draft.{{sfn|Sithole|2001|p=163}} The NCA called for the draft constitution to be rejected, and in a [[Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2000|February 2000 referendum]] it was, with 53% against to 44% in favour; turnout was under 25%.{{sfnm|1a1=Sithole|1y=2001|1p=164|2a1=Blair|2y=2002|2p=58|3a1=Meredith|3y=2002|3p=165}} It was ZANU-PF's first major electoral defeat in twenty years.{{sfn|Sithole|2001|p=165}} Mugabe was furious, and blamed the white minority for orchestrating his defeat, referring to them as "enemies of Zimbabwe".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=138}}

===Land seizures and growing condemnation: 2000–2008===
{{Main article|Land reform in Zimbabwe}}
[[File:Morgan Tsvangirai Oslo 2009 A.jpg|thumb|right|Morgan Tsvangirai led the MDC to growing success in opposing Mugabe's regime in the 2000 parliamentary election.]]
The [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2000|June 2000 parliamentary elections]] were Zimbabwe's most important since 1980.{{sfn|Sithole|2001|p=160}} Sixteen parties took part, although the [[Movement for Democratic Change (prior to 2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC)—led by trade unionist [[Morgan Tsvangirai]]—was particularly successful.{{sfn|Sithole|2001|p=160}} During the election campaign, MDC activists were regularly harassed and in some cases killed.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=178–179}} The [[Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum]] documented 27 murders, 27 rapes, 2466 assaults, and 617 abductions, with 10,000 people displaced by violence; the majority, although not all, of these actions were carried out by ZANU-PF supporters.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=158}} Observers from the [[European Union]] (EU) ruled that the election was neither free nor fair.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1pp=165–166|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=86}} The vote produced 48% and 62 parliamentary seats for ZANU-PF and 47% and 57 parliamentary seats for the MDC.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=164|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=188|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=86}} For the first time, ZANU-PF were denied the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through constitutional change.{{sfn|Sithole|2001|p=160}} ZANU-PF had relied heavily on their support base in rural Shona-speaking areas, and retained only one urban constituency.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=188}}

In February 2000, the land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=167}} The government referred to the attackers as "war veterans" although the majority were unemployed youth too young to have fought in the Rhodesian War.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=167}} Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against white land owners, although the government had paid Z$20&amp;nbsp;million to [[Chenjerai Hunzvi]]'s [[Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association|War Veterans Association]] to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU-PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=73|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=169}} Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=169}} Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=180}} He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=171}} In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=184}}

In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court ruled that the land invasions were illegal; they nevertheless continued,{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=76|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=170}} and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=200|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=17–8}} After the [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe|Supreme Court]] also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring chief justice [[Anthony Gubbay]] to do so.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1pp=198–199, 214–219|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2pp=204–205|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=105}} ZANU-PF member [[Godfrey Chidyausiku]] was appointed to replace him, while the number of Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=218, 238|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=207}} In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=223}}
The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=899}} A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertiliser.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=900}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The courts can do whatever they want, but no judicial decision will stand in our way&amp;nbsp;...

Africa is for Africans, Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans.|salign=right |source=— Mugabe on the land seizures{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=203}} }}

The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=236|2a1=Howard-Hassmann|2y=2010|2p=899}} Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=899}} By October 2003, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that half of the country's population were [[food insecure]], lacking enough food to meet basic needs.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=901}} By 2009, 75% of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=901}} Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. In 2000, the country's GDP was US$7.4&amp;nbsp;billion; by 2005 this had declined to US$3.4&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=122}} Inflation resulted in economic crisis.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=900}} By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=122}} By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000% and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=135}} Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=901}}

Other sectors of society were negatively affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed,{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=903}} and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=903}} The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a [[cholera]] outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=904}} The ruined economy also impacted the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=907}} In 2007, the [[World Health Organization]] declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=122}} The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated,{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=121}} and there was a rise in [[poaching]], including of [[endangered species]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=121}} Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=121}}

In October 2000, the MDC's MPs attempted to [[impeachment|impeach]] Mugabe, although were thwarted by the [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the House]], Mugabe-loyalist [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=196|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=86}}
ZANU-PF increasingly equated itself with Zimbabwean patriotism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ndlovu-Gatsheni|1y=2009|1p=1140|2a1=Onslow|2a2=Redding|2y=2009|2p=68}} with MDC supporters being portrayed as traitors and enemies of Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1140}} The party presented itself as being on the progressive side of history, with the MDC representing a counter-revolutionary force that seeks to undermine the achievements of the ZANU-PF revolution and of decolonisation itself.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=69}} Mugabe claimed that the build-up to the 2002 presidential election represented "the third Chimurenga" and that it would set Zimbabwe free from its colonial heritage.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=191}} In the build-up to the election, the government changed the electoral rules and regulations to improve Mugabe's chances of victory.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=226}} New security legislation was introduced making it illegal to criticise the President.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=226}} The defence force commander, General Zvinavashe, stated that the military would not recognise any election result other than a Mugabe victory.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=227}} The EU withdrew its observers from the country, stating that the vote was neither free nor fair.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=227}}
The election resulted in Mugabe securing 56% of the vote to Tsvangerai's 42%.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=228–229}} In the aftermath of the election Mugabe declared that the state-owned Grain Marketing Board had the sole right to import and distribute grain, with the state distributors giving food to ZANU-PF supporters while withholding it from those suspected of backing the MDC.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=231|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2pp=88–89}} In 2005, Mugabe instituted [[Operation Murambatsvina]] ("Operation Drive Out the Rubbish"), a project of forced slum clearance; a UN report estimated that 700,000 were left homeless.
Since the inhabitants of the shantytowns overwhelmingly voted MDC, many alleged that the bulldozing was politically motivated.&lt;ref name="telegraphtatters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/06/03/wzim03.xml|title=Mugabe's raids leave townships in tatters|date=6 March 2005|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=22 May 2010|first=Charles|last=Moore|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408002545/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2005%2F06%2F03%2Fwzim03.xml|archivedate=8 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power-sharing with the MDC: 2008–2013===

{{Main article|Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008}}

In March 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. In the former, ZANU-PF secured 97 seats to the MDC's 99 and the rival [[Movement for Democratic Change – Ncube|MDC – Ncube]]'s 9.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=143}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zimbabwemetro.com/2008/04/02/final-house-of-assembly-results/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080616052813/http://zimbabwemetro.com/2008/04/02/final-house-of-assembly-results/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 June 2008 |title=Final House of Assembly Results |work=[[Zimbabwe Metro]] |accessdate=28 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the [[Zimbabwe Electoral Commission]] announced the presidential vote results, confirming that Tsvangirai secured 47.9%, to Mugabe's 43.2%. As neither candidate secured 50%, a run-off vote was scheduled.{{sfnm|1a1=Norman|1y=2008|1p=157|2a1=Kebonang|2y=2012|2p=10}}
Mugabe saw his defeat as an unacceptable personal humiliation.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=963}} He deemed it a victory for his Western, and in particular British, detractors, whom he believed were working with Tsvangirai to end his political career.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=963}} ZANU-PF claimed that the MDC had rigged the election.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=144}}

[[File:Mugabe - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|left|Mugabe in 2011]]

After the election, Mugabe's government deployed its 'war veterans' in a violent campaign against Tsvangirai supporters.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=146}} Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=905}} 
There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to [[gang rape]] by Mugabe supporters.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=905}} Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=905}} These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government.{{sfn|Kebonang|2012|p=9}} UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-Moon]] expressed concern about the violence,{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=173}} which was also unanimously condemned by the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which declared that a free and fair election was "impossible".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=173}} 40 senior African leaders—among them [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Kofi Annan]], and [[Jerry Rawlings]]—signed an open letter calling for an end to the violence.{{sfn|Norman|2008|pp=170–171}}

In response to the violence, Tsangirai pulled out of the run-off.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=74}} In the second round, Mugabe was pronounced victor with 85.5% of the vote, and immediately re-inaugurated as President.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=175}}&lt;ref name="CNN2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2008/06/29/mugabe-wins-by-9-to-1-margin/ |title=Mugabe wins by 9-to-1 margin |work=The CNN Wire |date=29 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528140238/http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2008/06/29/mugabe-wins-by-9-to-1-margin/ |archive-date=28 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SADC oversaw the establishment of a power-sharing agreement; brokered by Mbeke, it was signed in September 2008.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview |title=edition.cnn.com, Rivals sign Zimbabwe power-share deal |publisher=CNN |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232421/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Under the agreement, Mugabe remained President while Tsvangerai became Prime Minister and the MDC's [[Arthur Mutambara]] became Vice Prime Minister.{{sfn|Kebonang|2012|p=11}} The cabinet was equally divided among MDC and ZANU-PF members.{{sfn|Kebonang|2012|p=11}} ZANU-PF nevertheless displayed unwillingness to share power,{{sfn|Chigora|Guzura|2011|p=24}} and were anxious to prevent any sweeping political changes.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=63}} 
Under the power-sharing agreement, a number of limited reforms were passed.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=965}} In early 2009, Mugabe's government declared that—to combat rampant inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=904}} This helped to stabilise prices.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=904}} ZANU-PF blogged many of the proposed reforms although a new constitution was passed in March 2013.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=965}}

===Later years: 2013–2017===
[[File:Grace Mugabe with Robert Mugabe 2013-08-04 11-53.jpeg|thumb|left|Mugabe and his wife in 2013]]
Declaring that he would "fight like a wounded animal" for re-election,{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=963}} Mugabe approached the [[Zimbabwean general election, 2013|2013 elections]] believing that it would be his last.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=964}} He hoped that a decisive electoral victory would secure his legacy, signal his triumph over his Western critics, and irreparably damage Tsvangirai's credibility.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=964}} The opposition parties believed that this election was their best chance for ousting Mugabe.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|pp=27–28}} They portrayed him as a feeble old man who was being told what to do by the military,{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=967}} although at least one academic observer argued that this was untrue.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=967}}

In contrast to 2008, there was no organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=969}} The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election so as not to undermine its credibility,{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=965}} particularly in the eyes of the SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=965}} Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence,{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=965}} and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=966}} The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|pp=38–39}}

ZANU-PF won a landslide victory, with 61% of the presidential vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|p=28}} The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|p=28}} During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views out of fear of reprisals.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|pp=35–36}} The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF.{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|pp=41–42}} ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as [[LGBT rights]].{{sfn|Gallagher|2015|pp=43–44}}

===Coup d'état and resignation===
{{Main article|2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état}}
On 6 November 2017, Mugabe sacked his first vice president, [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]]. This fueled speculation that he intended to name Grace his successor. Grace was very unpopular with the ZANU-PF old guard. On 15 November 2017, the [[Zimbabwe National Army]] placed Mugabe under [[house arrest]] as part of what it described as an action against "criminals" in Mugabe's circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/zimbabwe-military-chief-treasonable-conduct/index.html|title=Zimbabwe in turmoil after apparent coup|last=CNN|first=David McKenzie, Brent Swails and Angela Dewan,|publisher=CNN|access-date=15 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114223043/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/14/africa/zimbabwe-military-chief-treasonable-conduct/index.html|archivedate=14 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe confined to home as army takes control |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 November 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/nov/15/zimbabwe-army-control-harare-coup-robert-mugabe-live |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115032508/https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/nov/15/zimbabwe-army-control-harare-coup-robert-mugabe-live |archive-date=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Stunned Zimbabweans face uncertain future without Mugabe |date=16 November 2017 |newspaper=SBS News |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/11/16/stunned-zimbabweans-face-uncertain-future-without-mugabe |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119134528/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/11/16/stunned-zimbabweans-face-uncertain-future-without-mugabe |archive-date=19 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with both major parties supporting the motion, Mugabe's impeachment and removal appeared all but certain.

As per the constitution, both chambers met in joint session to debate the resolution. The debate took place at a conference centre, since Parliament House was not large enough for a joint sitting. Hours after the debate began, the Speaker of the House of Assembly read a letter from Mugabe announcing that he had resigned, effective immediately.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42071488|title=Zimbabwe's President Mugabe 'resigns'|date=21 November 2017|publisher=BBC News|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121155642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42071488|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mugabe and his wife negotiated a deal before his resignation, under which he and his kin are exempted from prosecution, his business interests will remain untouched, and he is set to receive a payment of at least $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Zimbabwe: Robert Mugabe to get $10m payoff and immunity for his family|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=26 November 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |language=en-GB |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/robert-mugabe-payoff-family-immunity-zimbabwe-zanu-pf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128003810/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/robert-mugabe-payoff-family-immunity-zimbabwe-zanu-pf |archivedate=28 November 2017 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mugabe, Mphoko due for big payout |date=11 December 2017 |newspaper=Daily News |url=https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2017/12/11/mugabe-mphoko-due-for-big-payout |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213181921/https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2017/12/11/mugabe-mphoko-due-for-big-payout |archive-date=13 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that Mugabe had resigned voluntarily, despite some of the ex-president's subsequent comments.&lt;ref name="Voluntary"&gt;{{Cite news|date=17 July 2018 |title=Zimbabwe Court Says Mugabe Stepped Down Freely, Voluntarily |newspaper=Voice of America |url=https://www.voazimbabwe.com/a/zimbabwe-mugabe-resigned-voluntarily-freely/4486081.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718111705/https://www.voazimbabwe.com/a/zimbabwe-mugabe-resigned-voluntarily-freely/4486081.html |archive-date=18 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency==
Mugabe was given full [[diplomatic immunity|diplomatic status]] in late December 2017 and was entitled to a house, up to 23 staff members, and personal vehicles, according to a government gazette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/robert-mugabes-lavish-retirement-package-includes-firstclass-flights-a-fivebedroom-house-and-23-a3728106.html|title=Robert Mugabe's lavish retirement package includes first-class flights, a five-bedroom house and 23 staff|first=Hatty|last=Collier|publisher=Evening Standard|date=28 December 2017|accessdate=8 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109064226/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/robert-mugabes-lavish-retirement-package-includes-firstclass-flights-a-fivebedroom-house-and-23-a3728106.html|archivedate=9 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first interview since being removed from presidency, Mugabe stated on 15 March 2018 that he was ousted in a "coup d'état" which must be undone. He stated that he would not work with Mnangagwa and termed his presidency as "illegal" and "unconstitutional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/robert-mugabe-zimbabwe-disgraceful-coup-must-be-undone|title=Robert Mugabe says 'disgraceful' Zimbabwe coup must be undone|publisher=The Guardian|work=Agence-France Presse|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=15 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315234748/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/16/robert-mugabe-zimbabwe-disgraceful-coup-must-be-undone|archivedate=15 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a lawsuit brought by two political parties, the [[Liberal Democrats (Zimbabwe)|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Revolutionary Freedom Fighters]], and others, the court found that the resignation was legal, and that Mnangagwa, as vice president, duly took over the presidency.&lt;ref name="Voluntary" /&gt; As Zimbabweans prepared to participate in the country's first election without Mugabe in almost 30 years, on the eve of the election on 29 July 2018, Mugabe made a surprise press conference where he stated his wish not to vote for President Mnangagwa and [[ZANU-PF]], the party he founded.

==Ideology==
Mugabe embraced [[African nationalism]] and [[anti-colonialism]] during the 1960s.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2015|p=1}} Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised "Mugabeism" as a [[populism|populist]] movement that was "marked by ideological simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and multi-class character",{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1141}} further noting that it was "a broad church".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1150}} He also characterised it as a form of "left-nationalism",{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1142}} which consistently railed against [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]].{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1143}} He also argued that it was a form of [[nativism (politics)|nativism]],{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|pp=1146–1147}} which was permeated by a strong "cult of victimisation" in which a binary view was propagated where [[Africa]] was a "victim" and the [[Western world|West]] was its "tormentor".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1148}} He suggested that it had been influenced by a wide range of ideologies, among them forms of [[Marxism]] like [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], as well as African nationalist ideologies like [[Nkrumaism]], ''[[Ujamaa]]'', [[Garveyism]], ''[[Négritude]]'', [[Pan-Africanism]], and African neo-traditionalism.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1141}}
Mugabism sought to deal with the problem of white settler racism by engaging in a project of [[reverse racism]] that sought to deny white Zimbabweans citizenship by constantly referring to them as "''amabhunu''/Boers", thus enabling their removal from their land.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1151}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Mugabeism as a form of populist reason is a multifaceted phenomenon requiring a multi-pronged approach to decipher its various meanings. At one level it represents pan-African memory and patriotism and at another level it manifests itself as a form of radical left-nationalism dedicated to resolving intractable national and agrarian questions. Yet, to others, it is nothing but a symbol of crisis, chaos and tyranny emanating from the exhaustion of nationalism.| salign=right |source=— Sabelo J Ndlovu-Gatsheni{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1154}} }}

ZANU-PF claimed that it was influenced by [[Marxism–Leninism]] although Onslow and Redding stated that in contrast to the Marxist emphasis on the urban [[proletariat]] as the main force of socio-economic change, Mugabe's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=69}} As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU-PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=69}} The English academic Claire Palley met Mugabe in 1962, later noting that "he struck me as not so much a doctrinaire Marxist but an old-fashioned African nationalist",{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=43}} while Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was "just rhetoric" with "no genuine vision or belief behind it".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=49}} Carington noted that while Mugabe used Marxist rhetoric during the Lancaster House negotiations, "of course he didn't actually practice what he preached, did he? Once in office he became a capitalist".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=65}} 
Mugabe has stated that "[[socialism]] has to be much more [[Christian]] than [[capitalism]]".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=15}} The Zimbabwean scholar [[George Shire]] described Mugabe's policies as being "broadly-speaking" [[Social democracy|social-democratic]].{{sfn|Shire|2007|p=33}}

During the 1980s, Mugabe indicated his desire to transform Zimbabwe from a multi-party state into a one-party state.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=29}} In 1984 he stated that "the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=29}} The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was "more complex than pure venial dictatorship", but that it was an "ideo-dictatorship".{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=68}}

Ndlovu-Gatsheni argued that since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be dominated by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|pp=1139–1140}} References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in Mugabe's speeches.{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=964}} The scholar of [[African studies]] Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to "take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security".{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=xii}}

David Blair stated that "Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude [[Marxism]], couched in the ponderous English of the mission school", remarking that they were heavily informed by [[Karl Marx]], [[Mao Zedong]], and [[Frantz Fanon]], and displayed little originality.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair noted that Mugabe's writings called for "[[Planned economy|command economics]] in a peasant society, mixed with anti-colonial nationalism", and that in this he held "the same opinions as almost every other African guerrilla leader" of that period.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Mugabe argued that following the overthrow of European colonial regimes, Western countries continued to keep African countries in a state of subservience because they desired the continent's natural resources while preventing it from industrialising.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=239}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Президент России Владимир Путин с Президентом Зимбабве Робертом Мугабе 3.jpg|thumb|Mugabe meeting Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2015]]

Mugabe is of average height, measuring a little over {{convert|1.70|m}},{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and exhibits what his biographer David Blair described as "curious, effeminate mannerisms".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Mugabe took great care with his appearance, typically wearing a three-piece suit,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} and insisting that members of his cabinet dressed in a similar Anglophile fashion.{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=109–110}} On taking power in 1980, Mugabe's hallmark was his wide-rimmed glasses,{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=14}} and he was also known for his [[toothbrush moustache|tiny moustache]].{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Unlike a number of other African leaders, Mugabe did not seek to mythologise his childhood.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=17}} He avoided smoking and drinking,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=23}} and—according to his first biographers, David Smith and Colin Simpson—had "enormous affection for children".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|p=48}} During his early life he had an operation on his genitals which generated rumours that he had only one testicle or half a penis; such rumours were used by opponents to ridicule him and by supporters to bolster the claim that he was willing to make severe sacrifices for the revolutionary cause.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=174}}

Mugabe spoke English fluently with an adopted English accent when pronouncing certain words.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} He was also a fan of the English game of [[cricket]], stating that "cricket civilizes people and creates good gentlemen".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} David Blair noted that this cultivation of British traits suggested that Mugabe respected and perhaps admired Britain while at the same time resenting and loathing the country.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Holland suggested that these Anglophile traits arose in early life, as Mugabe—who had long experienced the anti-black racism of Rhodesian society—"grasped Englishness as an antidote" to the "self-loathing" induced by societal racism.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=211}}

The academic Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that Mugabe was "an extremely complex figure, not easily captured by conventional categories".{{sfn|Tendi|2011|pp=307–308}} Similarly, David Blair described him as an "exceptionally complex personality".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Smith and Simpson noted that the Zimbabwean leader had been "a serious young man, something of a loner, diligent, hard-working, a voracious reader who used every minute of his time, not much given to laughter: but above all, single-minded".{{sfn|Smith|Simpson|1981|pp=15–16}} Blair commented that Mugabe's "self-discipline, intelligence and appetite for hard work were remarkable",{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} adding that his "prime characteristics" were "ruthlessness and resilience".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=24}} Blair argued that Mugabe shared many character traits with Ian Smith, stating that they were both "proud, brave, stubborn, charismatic, deluded fantasists".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=244}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=With his poor childhood development record, even minor criticism would be experienced as a wound by Mugabe. He is a person who cannot tolerate difference. Being profoundly doubtful about himself, he is oversensitive to the idea that he is not as good as everyone else. People are either with him or against him. Differences of opinion are provocative and hurtful to Mugabe, who may think that compromise reduces him.| salign=left |source=— Heidi Holland{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=52}} }}

Meredith described Mugabe as having a "soft-spoken demeanour,&amp;nbsp;... broad intellect, and&amp;nbsp;... articulate manner", all of which disguised his "hardened and single-minded ambition".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=37}}  Ndlovu-Gatsheni characterised him as "one of the most charismatic African leaders", highlighting that he was "very eloquent" and was able to make "fine speeches".{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1142}} [[Jonathan Moyo]], who briefly served as Mugabe's information minister before falling out with him, stated that the President could "express himself well, that is his great strength".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=183}}
Tendi stated that although he had a natural wittiness, Mugabe often hid this behind "an outwardly pensive and austere manner and his penchant for ceremony and tradition".{{sfn|Tendi|2013|pp=964–965}} Heidi Holland suggested that due to his "dysfunctional" upbringing, Mugabe had a "fragile self-image",{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=51}} describing him as "a man cut off from his feelings, devoid of ordinary warmth and humanity".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=67}} According to her, Mugabe had a "marked emotional immaturity",{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=84}} and was homophobic,{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=95}} as well as racist and xenophobic.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=83}}

According to Meredith, Mugabe presented himself as "articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory" after his 1980 election victory.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=14}} Blair noted that at this period of his career, Mugabe displayed "genuine magnanimity and moral courage" despite his "intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred" toward the members of the former regime.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=17}} Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, [[Michael Pallister]], head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having "a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner".{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=7}} The British diplomat [[Peter Longworth]] stated that in private, Mugabe was "very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the man you meet with the man ranting on television".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=25}} Norman stated that "I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=119}}

[[Colin Legum]], a journalist with ''[[The Observer]]'', argued that Mugabe had a "paranoidal personality", in that while he did not suffer from clinical paranoia, he did behave in a paranoid fashion when placed under severe and sustained pressure.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=26}} Mugabe biographer Andrew Norman suggested that the leader may have suffered from [[antisocial personality disorder]].{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=163}}
Several Mugabe biographers have observed that he had an obsession with accruing power.{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=25|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=16}} According to Meredith, "power for Mugabe was not a means to an end, but the end itself."{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=233}} Conversely, Onslow and Redding suggested that Mugabe's craving for power stemmed from "ideological and personal reasons" and his belief in the illegitimacy of his political opposition.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=69}} Denis Norman, a white politician who served in Mugabe's cabinet for many years, commented that "Mugabe isn't a flashy man driven by wealth but he does enjoy power. That's always been his motivation".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=125}}

===Marriages and children===

According to Holland, Mugabe's first wife, [[Sally Hayfron]], was Mugabe's "confidante and only real friend",{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=25}} being "one of the few people who could challenge Mugabe's ideas without offending him".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=21}}

Their only son, Michael Nhamodzenyika Mugabe, born 27 September 1963, died on 26 December 1966 from cerebral malaria in Ghana where Sally was working while Mugabe was in prison. [[Sally Mugabe]] was a trained teacher who asserted her position as an independent political activist and campaigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/01/past.politics |title=FO's fight over Mugabe's wife |work=The Guardian |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2009 |first=Owen |last=Bowcott |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829194743/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/01/past.politics |archivedate=29 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mugabe called on Zimbabwe's media to refer to his wife as "Amai" ("Mother of the Nation"),{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=96}} although many Zimbabweans resented the fact that she was a foreigner.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=23}} She was appointed as the head of ZANU-PF's women's league,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=96}} and was involved in a number of charitable operations, although was widely regarded as corrupt in these dealings.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=24}} During Mugabe's premiership she suffered from renal failure, and initially had to travel to Britain for [[dialysis]] until Soames arranged for a dialysis machine to be sent to Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=76}}

While married to Hayfron, in 1987 Mugabe began an extra-marital affair with his secretary, [[Grace Marufu]]; she was 41 years his junior and at the time was married to [[Stanley Goreraza]]. In 1988 she bore Mugabe a daughter, Bona, and in 1990 a son, Robert.{{sfnm|1a1=Meredith|1y=2002|1p=96|2a1=Norman|2y=2008|2p=80}} The relationship was kept secret from the Zimbabwean public, although Hayfron was aware of it.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=96}}
According to her niece Patricia Bekele, with whom she was particularly close, Hayfron was not happy that Mugabe had an affair with Marufu but "she did what she used to tell me to do: 'Talk to your pillow if you have problems in your marriage. Never, ever, humiliate your husband.' Her motto was to carry on in gracious style".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=22}} Hayfron died in 1992 from a chronic kidney ailment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DA1331F93BA15752C0A964958260 |title=The New York Times, "Obituaries: Sally Mugabe, Zimbabwe President's Wife, 60", 28 January 1992 |work=The New York Times |date=28 January 1992 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hayfron's death in 1992, Mugabe and Marufu were married in a large Catholic wedding ceremony in August 1996.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=108}}
As [[First Lady of Zimbabwe]], Grace gained a reputation for indulging her love of luxury, with a particular interest in shopping, clothes, and jewelry.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|pp=108–109}} These lavish shopping sprees have led to her receiving the nickname "Gucci Grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nehandaradio.com/2014/11/16/gucci-grace-mugabe-worlds-first-female-dictator/ |title=Is 'Gucci' Grace Mugabe about to be the world's first female dictator? |work=Nehanda Radio |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2015 |first=Ian |last=Birrell |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402214602/http://nehandaradio.com/2014/11/16/gucci-grace-mugabe-worlds-first-female-dictator/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She too developed a reputation for corruption.{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=109}} In 1997, [[Grace Mugabe]] gave birth to the couple's third child, [[Chatunga Bellarmine]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/744174.stm|title=Mugabe: Freedom fighter turned autocrat|publisher=BBC News|last=Winter|first=Joseph|accessdate=1 July 2008|date=10 May 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123095912/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/744174.stm|archivedate=23 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The story of Robert Mugabe is a microcosm of what bedevils African democracy and economic recovery at the beginning of the 21st century. It is a classic case of a genuine hero—the guerrilla idol who conquered the country's former leader and his white supremacist regime—turning into a peevish autocrat whose standard response to those suggesting he steps down is to tell them to get lost. It is also the story of activists who try to make a better society but bear the indelible scars of the old system. Mugabe's political education came from the autocrat Ian Smith, who had learnt his formative lessons from imperious British colonisers.| salign=right |source=— Heidi Holland{{sfn|Holland|2008|pp=xiv–xv}} }}

By the twenty-first century, Mugabe was regarded as one of the world's most controversial political leaders.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2009|p=1139}} According to ''[[The Black Scholar]]'' journal, "depending on who you listen to&amp;nbsp;... Mugabe is either one of the world's great tyrants or a fearless nationalist who has incurred the wrath of the West."{{sfn|Shire|2007|p=32}} He has been widely described as a "dictator", a "tyrant", and a "threat",{{sfn|Shire|2007|p=35}} and has been referred to as one of Africa's "most brutal" leaders.{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=xi}} At the same time he continued to be regarded as a hero in many [[Third World]] countries and received a warm reception when travelling throughout Africa.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=214}} For many in Southern Africa, he remained one of the "grand old men" of the African liberation movement.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=911}}

According to Ndlovu-Gatsheni, within ZANU-PF, Mugabe was regarded as a "demi-god" who was feared and rarely challenged.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2015|p=2}} Within the ZANU movement, a [[cult of personality]] began to be developed around Mugabe during the Bush War and was consolidated after 1980.{{sfn|Ndlovu-Gatsheni|2015|p=13}} Mugabe had a considerable following within Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Tendi|2013|p=966}} with David Blair noting that "it would be wrong to imply that he lacked genuine popularity" in the country.{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=38}} Holland believed that the "great majority" of Zimbabwe's population supported him "enthusiastically" during the first twenty years of his regime.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=192}} His strongholds of support were Zimbabwe's Shona-dominated regions of [[Mashonaland]], [[Manicaland]], and [[Masvingo]], while he remained far less popular in the non-Shona areas of Matabeleland and [[Bulawayo]],{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=38}} and among the Zimbabwean diaspora living abroad.{{sfn|Onslow|Redding|2009|p=71}}

At the time of his 1980 election victory, Mugabe was internationally acclaimed as a revolutionary hero who was embracing racial reconciliation,{{sfn|Meredith|2002|p=15}} and for the first decade of his governance he was widely regarded as "one of post-colonial Africa's most progressive leaders".{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=xx}} David Blair argued that while Mugabe did exhibit a "conciliatory phase" between March 1980 and February 1982, his rule was otherwise "dominated by a ruthless quest to crush his opponents and remain in office at whatever cost".{{sfn|Blair|2002|p=46}} In 2011, the scholar Blessing-Miles Tendi stated that "Mugabe is often presented in the international media as the epitome of the popular leader gone awry: the independence struggle hero who seemed initially a progressive egalitarian, but has gradually been corrupted through his attachment to power during a long and increasingly repressive spell in office."{{sfn|Tendi|2011|p=307}} Tendi argued that this was a misleading assessment, because Mugabe had displayed repressive tendencies from his early years in office, namely through the repression of ZAPU in Matabeleland.{{sfn|Tendi|2011|p=308}} Abiodun Alao concurred, suggesting that Mugabe's approach had not changed over the course of his leadership, but merely that international attention had intensified in the twenty-first century.{{sfn|Alao|2012|p=xi}}
For many Africans, Mugabe exposed the [[double standards]] of Western countries; the latter had turned a blind eye to the massacre of over 20,000 black Ndebele civilians in the Gukarakundi but strongly censured the Zimbabwean government when a small number of white farmers were killed during the land seizures.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=214}}

[[File:Demonstration against Mugabe.JPG|thumb|left|Example of foreign criticism: a demonstration against Mugabe's regime next to the Zimbabwe embassy in London (mid-2006).]]
During the guerrilla war, Ian Smith referred to Mugabe as "the apostle of Satan".{{sfnm|1a1=Blair|1y=2002|1p=13|2a1=Meredith|2y=2002|2p=14|3a1=Norman|3y=2008|3p=162|4a1=Alao|4y=2012|4p=4}} George Shire expressed the view that there was "a strong racist animus" against Mugabe within Zimbabwe, and that this had typically been overlooked by Western media representations of the country.{{sfn|Shire|2007|p=33}} Mugabe has himself been accused of racism; [[John Sentamu]], the [[Uganda]]-born [[Archbishop of York]] in the United Kingdom, called Mugabe "the worst kind of racist dictator", for having "targeted the whites for their apparent riches".&lt;ref&gt;Sentamu, John, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/16/comment.foreignpolicy Saving Zimbabwe is not colonialism, it's Britain's duty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128105246/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/16/comment.foreignpolicy |date=28 November 2016 }}, ''The Observer'' 16 September 2007.

One just wants to weep. It's very sad."{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=162}} South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] was also critical of Mugabe, referring to him as a politician who "despise[s] the very people who put [him] in power and think[s] it's a privilege to be there for eternity".{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=162}}

Writing for the ''[[Human Rights Quarterly]]'', Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann claimed that there was "clear evidence that Mugabe was guilty of crimes against humanity".{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=909}} In 2009, [[Gregory Stanton]], then President of the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]], and Helen Fein, then Executive Director of the [[Institute for the Study of Genocide]], published a letter in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stating that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the [[International Criminal Court]].{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=917}} Australia and New Zealand had previously called for this in 2005,{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=917}} and a number of Zimbabwean NGOs did so in 2006.{{sfn|Howard-Hassmann|2010|p=917}}

A 2005 article from the New American titled "Democide in Zimbabwe" says that Mugabe reduced the population of Zimbabwe a few millions in just a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Democide+in+Zimbabwe.-a0134782923|title=Democide in Zimbabwe|last=|first=|date=July 2005|website=The Free Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=no|access-date=Dec 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Mugabe received an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from him at the advice of the UK government in 2008.{{sfn|Norman|2008|p=174}} Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the [[University of Edinburgh]] withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | work=The Times | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article1896047.ece | title=Mugabe stripped of degree by Edinburgh | accessdate=4 July 2007 | first1=Shirley | last1=English | first2=David | last2=Lister | date=7 June 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012204017/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article1896047.ece | archivedate=12 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }} See also: {{cite news|work=The New York Observer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/15/highereducation.internationaleducationnews|title=Edinburgh University revokes Mugabe degree|author=Paul Kelbie|date=15 July 2007|accessdate=28 June 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831180901/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/15/highereducation.internationaleducationnews|archivedate=31 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6724271.stm|title=Mugabe stripped of degree honour|publisher=BBC|date=6 June 2007|accessdate=4 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912175134/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6724271.stm|archivedate=12 September 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite news |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/mugabe-loses-honorary-degree-from-umass/?hp |title=Mugabe loses Honorary Degree from UMass |work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2008 |first=Mike |last=Nizza |date=13 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002081032/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/mugabe-loses-honorary-degree-from-umass/?hp |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2008, the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; this is the first time one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/06/umass_revokes_m.html |title=UMass revokes Mugabe's honorary degree |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=28 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220192434/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/06/umass_revokes_m.html |archivedate=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Sherman''' (April 19, 1721 – July 23, 1793) was an early [[United States|American]] [[politician|statesman]] and [[lawyer]], as well as a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]]. He is the only person to have signed all four great state papers of the United States: the [[Continental Association]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Articles of Confederation]], and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/nsh/sherman.cfm Roger Sherman] Architect of the Capitol. Retrieved February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], Sherman established a legal career in [[Litchfield County, Connecticut]] despite a lack of formal education. After a period in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]], he served as a Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789. He represented Connecticut at the [[Continental Congress]] and signed the [[Continental Association]], which provided for a [[boycott]] against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] following the imposition of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. He was also a member of the [[Committee of Five]] that drafted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He later signed both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. In 1784, he was elected as the first mayor of [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

Sherman served as a delegate to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]], which produced the United States Constitution. After [[Benjamin Franklin]], he was the oldest delegate present at the convention. Along with [[James Wilson]], he proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], which counted three-fifths of the [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] population for the purposes of representation in the [[United States House of Representatives]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. He favored granting the federal government power to raise revenue and regulate commerce, but initially opposed efforts to supplant the Articles of Confederation with a new constitution. He ultimately came to support the establishment of a new constitution, and proposed the [[Connecticut Compromise]], which won the approval of both the larger states and the smaller states.&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787" /&gt;

After the ratification of the Constitution, Sherman represented Connecticut in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1789 to 1791. He served in the [[United States Senate]] from 1791 to his death in 1793.

==Early life==
Sherman was born into a farm family located in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], near Boston. His father was William and mother Mehetabel Sherman. Mehetabel's father was Benjamin Wellington and her mother was Elizabeth Sweetman, whose christening date was March 4, 1687 (or 1688), and she died on April 12, 1776. William and Mehetabel had seven children, William Jr., Mehetabel, Roger (1721), Elizabeth (married James Buck), Nathaniel (became a Reverend), Josiah (also became a Reverend), and Rebecca (married Joseph Hartwell Jr.). After Elizabeth was born (1723), the Shermans left Newton and settled in the south precinct of Dorchester, that three years later became the township of [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]] and located {{Convert|17|miles}} south of Boston, when Roger was two. William married Rebecca Cutler on July 15, 1714.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsdi1776.com/signers-by-state/roger-sherman/ Roger Sherman's family]: ''The Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence''.

Josiah Sherman]: From Archive.org, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Stoughton where Sherman grew up became part of [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] in 1797. Sherman's education did not extend beyond his father's library and grammar school, and his early career was spent as a shoe-maker. However, he had an aptitude for learning, and access to a good library owned by his father, as well as a [[Harvard]]-educated parish minister, the Rev. Samuel Dunbar, who took him under his wing.

In 1743, due to his father's death, Sherman moved (on foot) with his mother and siblings to [[New Milford, Connecticut]], where in partnership with his brother William (wife Ruth),&lt;ref&gt;''Sherman genealogy, including families of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, England'', p. 142; published 1920, author Sherman, Thomas Townsend (born 1853). Retrieved 2016-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; he opened the town's first store. He very quickly introduced himself in civil and religious affairs, rapidly becoming one of the town's leading citizens and eventually town clerk of New Milford. Due to his mathematical skill he became county surveyor of [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]] in 1745, and began providing astronomical calculations for almanacs in 1759.

==Marriages and family==

==Legal, political career==
[[Image:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|320px|thumb|right|The ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' by [[John Trumbull]] depicts the [[Committee of Five]] (Sherman is the second person on the left) presenting its work to Congress.]]Sherman is especially notable in United States history for being the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States, the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the [[Continental Association|Articles of Association]], the [[Articles of Confederation]], and the [[United States Constitution]]. [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], who did not sign the [[Continental Association|Articles of Association]], signed the other three. John Dickinson also signed three, the Continental Association, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.  He was involved with the Declaration of Independence but abstained, hoping for a reconciliation with Britain.

Despite the fact that Sherman had no formal legal training, he was urged to [[Reading law|read]] for the bar exam by a local lawyer and was admitted to the Bar of [[Litchfield, Connecticut]] in 1754, during which he wrote A Caveat Against Injustice&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Roger [http://www.rogershermansociety.org/caveat.htm A Caveat Against Injustice]&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen to represent New Milford in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]] from 1755 to 1758 and from 1760 to 1761.

Sherman was appointed justice of the peace in 1762 and judge of the court of common pleas in 1765. During 1766, Sherman was first elected to the [[Connecticut Senate|Governor's Council]] of the [[Connecticut General Assembly]], where he served until 1785.

Sherman served as Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789, when he left to become a member of the [[United States Congress]].

[[File:A Front View of Yale College and the College Chapel New Haven printed by Daniel Bowen.jpg|thumb|320px|upright|''A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel'', Daniel Bowen, 1786]]
Sherman was also appointed treasurer of [[Yale University|Yale College]], and awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree. He was a professor of religion for many years, and engaged in lengthy correspondences with some of the theologians of the time.

During February 1776, Sherman, [[George Wythe]], and [[John Adams]] were members of a committee responsible for establishing guidelines for U.S. embassy officials in Canada with the committee instructions that included, ''"You are to declare that we hold sacred the rights of conscience, and may promise to the whole people, solemnly in our name, the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion. And...that all civil rights and the rights to hold office were to be extended to persons of any Christian denomination."''

In 1784 he was elected [[Mayor of New Haven]], which office he held until his death.

In 1790 both Sherman and [[Richard Law (judge)|Richard Law]] were appointed to revise the confused and archaic Connecticut statutes, which they accomplished.

Throughout his life, Sherman was a major benefactor of [[Yale|Yale College]], acting as the university's treasurer for many years and promoting construction of a college chapel. Roger Sherman died in 1793.

==Constitutional Convention==
Roger Sherman was one of the most influential members of the Constitutional Convention. He is not well known for his actions at the Convention because he was a "terse, ineloquent speaker" who never kept a personal record of his experience, unlike other prominent figures at the convention such as [[James Madison]], and at 66 years of age, Sherman was the second eldest member at the convention following [[Benjamin Franklin]] (who was 81 years old at the time).  Yet as one of the most active members of the Convention, Sherman made motions or seconds in reference to the Virginia Plan 160 times.&lt;ref name="Robertson, David B 2005"&gt;Robertson, David B. "Madison's Opponents and Constitutional Design." The American Political Science Review 99.22 (2005): 225–243. JSTOR. Web. February 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent Madison made motions or seconds 177 times.&lt;ref name="Robertson, David B 2005"/&gt;

Roger Sherman came into the Convention without the intention of creating a new constitution. Sherman, an original signer of the Articles of Confederation, saw the convention as a means to modify the already existing government. Part of his stance was concerned with the public appeal. He defended amending the articles declaring that it was in the best interest of the people and the most probable way the people would accept changes to a constitution.&lt;ref name="Boyd, Julian P 1932"/&gt; Sherman saw no reason for a bicameral legislature, as proposed by the Virginia Plan. "The problem with the old government was not that it had acted foolishly or threatened anybody's liberties, but that it had simply been unable to enforce its decrees".&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787"&gt;Collier, Christopher, and James Lincoln Collier. Decision in Philadelphia: The Constitutional Convention of 1787. New York: Random House, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman further advanced the idea that the national government simply needed a way to raise revenue and regulate commerce.&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787"/&gt; Sherman was a big defender of a unicameral legislature. He defended the unicameral legislature of the Articles of Confederation by stating that the large states had not "suffered at the hands of small states on account of the rule of equal voting".&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787"/&gt; Ultimately, when Sherman saw his initial goals of the convention as unattainable he organized compromises and deals in order to enact some of his desirable legislation.

Sherman was from a particularly isolationist state – Connecticut operated almost without much need from other states, using its own ports&lt;ref&gt;https://mchsct.org/exhibits-displays/a-vanished-port-middletown-the-caribbean-1750-1824/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ctexplored.org/connecticut-in-the-golden-age-of-smuggling/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://magazine.wesleyan.edu/2011/01/15/vanished-port-middletown-and-the-great-era-of-west-indies-trade/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/09/arts/discovering-connecticut-s-old-port-cities.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; to trade with the West Indies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courant.com/community/middletown/hc-ugc-article-vanished-port-exhibit-introduces-speakers-2016-09-25-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=E07pCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=Indies&lt;/ref&gt; instead of utilizing ports in Boston –&lt;ref name="Boyd, Julian P 1932"&gt;Boyd, Julian P. "Roger Sherman: Portrait of a Cordwainer Statesman." The New England Quarterly 5.2 (1932): 221–236. JSTOR. Web. February 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and feared that "...the mass of people lacked sufficient wisdom to govern themselves and thus wished no branch of the federal government to be elected directly by the people".&lt;ref&gt;Outline of American History – Chapter 4: The Formation of a National Government http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/history/ch4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://teachersinstitute.yale.edu/curriculum/units/1979/3/79.03.02.x.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Sherman, [[Elbridge Gerry]] (himself later recognized as the namesake of American political [[gerrymandering]]) and others were of the shared opinion that the elected composition of the national government should be reserved for the vote of state officials and not for election by the will of the people. Sherman was wary of allowing ordinary citizen participation in national government and stated that the people "should have as little to do as may be about the Government. They want information and are constantly liable to be misled".&lt;ref name="Rakove, Jack N 1996"&gt;Rakove, Jack N. Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution. New York: A.A. Knopf, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two proposed options for the formation of the legislative branch emerged in the deliberations. One was to form a bicameral legislature in which both chambers had representation proportional to the population of the states, which was supported by the Virginia plan. The second was to modify the unicameral legislature that had equal representation from all of the states, which was supported by the New Jersey plan. Roger Sherman was a devout supporter of a unicameral legislature, but when he saw that goal as unattainable he motioned to compromise. In terms of modes of election "Sherman moved to allow each state legislature to elect its own senators".&lt;ref name="Rakove, Jack N 1996"/&gt;  Additionally, in the house Sherman originally proposed that the suffrage of the House of Representatives should be figured according to the "numbers of free inhabitants" in each state.&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787"/&gt;

During the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention of 1787]], summoned into existence to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]], Sherman and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] offered what came to be called the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] or Connecticut Compromise.

In this plan, designed to be acceptable to both large and small states, the people would be represented [[proportional representation|proportionally]] in one branch of the legislature, called the House of Representatives (the [[lower house|lower legislative house]]). The states would be represented in another house called the Senate (the [[upper house]]). In the lower house, each state had a representative for every one delegate. In the upper house each state was guaranteed two senators, regardless of its size.

Sherman is also memorable for his stance against [[Banknote|paper money]] with his authoring of [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution]] and his later opposition to [[James Madison]] over the "[[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" amendments to the U.S. Constitution in his belief that these amendments would diminish the role and power of the states over the people.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman. http://fas-history.rutgers.edu/clemens/constitutional1/sherman.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Wilson &amp; Mr. Sherman moved to insert after the words "coin money" the words "nor emit bills of credit, nor make any thing but gold &amp; silver coin a tender in payment of debts" making these prohibitions absolute, instead of making the measures allowable (as in the XIII art) with the consent of the Legislature of the U.S. ... Mr. Sherman thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money. If the consent of the Legislature could authorize emissions of it, the friends of paper money would make every exertion to get into the Legislature in order to license it."&lt;ref&gt;Farrand, Max, ed. The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In terms of the executive Sherman had very little interest in giving the executive much authority. Sherman suggested that no constitutional provision needed be made for the executive because it was "nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect".&lt;ref name="Rakove, Jack N 1996"/&gt;

Originally opposed to slavery due to his personal beliefs and puritan views, Sherman used the issue of slavery as a tool for negotiation and alliance. Sherman was of the opinion that slavery was already gradually being abolished and the trend was moving southward.&lt;ref name="Rakove, Jack N 1996"/&gt; Sherman saw that the issue of slavery could be one that threatened the success of the constitutional convention. Therefore, Sherman decided to help pass legislation to benefit slave states in order to obtain unlikely allies from South Carolina. The two forces joined together because they both, due to the economies of their home states, benefitted from there being no export tax.&lt;ref name="Collier, Christopher 1787"/&gt;

Sherman opposed appointment of fellow signer [[Gouverneur Morris]] as minister to France because he considered that high-living Patriot to be of an "irreligious nature".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Connecticut. http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/sherman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Sherman was instrumental in securing the addition of ''"or to the people"'' in the wording of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and caused the cent to be used in the financial system. In a letter to [[Oliver Wolcott]] (May 21, 1777) he wrote, ''"I think it dangerous to admit citizens not connected to the army to be tried by a Court Martial"''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherman genealogy, including families of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, England'', p. 187; published 1920, author Sherman, Thomas Townsend (born 1853).

== Death and burial site ==
Sherman died in his sleep on July 23, 1793, after a two-month illness diagnosed as [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-918676-20-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rommel, John G. |title=Connecticut's Yankee patriot, Roger Sherman |publisher=American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut |location=Hartford |year=1979 |pages=53 |isbn=0-918676-20-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Gazette of the United States]]'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), August 17, 1793, p.&amp;nbsp;508, reported an alternate diagnosis, "He was taken ill about the middle of May last, and from that time declined till his death. His physician supposed his disorder to be seated in his liver."

He was buried in [[New Haven Green]]. In 1821, when that cemetery was relocated, his remains were moved to the [[Grove Street Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boardman|first= |title= : Signer and Statesman|year=1938|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=336|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an2yAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of the Sashi Kanta Acharya Chaudhuri, a former [[Maharaja]] of [[Mymensingh]], a premier [[zamindar]] in Bengal. The Maharajas of Mymensingh were the wealthiest and senior most zamindars of the district of Mymensingh and ranked high in the order of precedence in the Government House in Calcutta. Mymensingh was the predecessor estate of most other ''zamindaris'' of the district. He studied at [[Scottish Church College]],&lt;ref&gt;''Some Alumni of Scottish Church College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 593&lt;/ref&gt; and later at the [[University of Calcutta]]. He was called to the Bar by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in London.

'''Tom Stevenson''' (born 1951) is a [[British people|British]] author who has been writing about [[wine]] for more than 30 years. Described by his [[List of wine personalities|colleagues]] as one of today's most prolific wine authors,&lt;ref name=jr2&gt;{{Cite web|last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com | url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr7103 |title= Vintage 2003 wine books | date= 22 November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jr1/&gt; Stevenson is regarded as the world's leading authority on [[Champagne]].&lt;ref name=chrsmast&gt;christies.com [http://www.christies.com/services/education/london.aspx?s=6 Christie’s Champagne Masterclass]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swig.co.uk [http://www.swig.co.uk/product.asp?prev=producer%2Easp%3Fid%3D120%261%3D1&amp;id=181 Wine review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scots/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;frenchwinesociety.org [http://www.frenchwinesociety.org/site.php?page=page&amp;id=29 French Wine Society: Book review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wpt/&gt; He has written 23 books, the most important of which have been published internationally by more than 50 publishers and translated into over 25 languages.  In 1986, his book ''Champagne'' became the first wine book to win four literary awards, establishing Stevenson's reputation as a serious author, a fastidious researcher with a talent for divining future issues, and a critic bold enough to take on the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;wine-pages.com [http://www.wine-pages.com/guests/tom/champagne-expansion.htm Champagne’s €6 billion expansion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427074152/http://www.wine-pages.com/guests/tom/champagne-expansion.htm |date=27 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;champagne-lenoble.com [http://www.champagne-lenoble.com/uk/presse/LENOBLEUKPRESSEWINEREPORT.htm Wine Report, Tom Stevenson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Although Stevenson's first writings on wine were published in ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]'' in the late 1970s, a magazine for which he still writes, he was a more prolific contributor to ''[[WINE Magazine]]'' for consumers and ''[[Wine &amp; Spirit International]]'' for the trade (both since merged into ''[[Wine &amp; Spirit]]'') during the 1980s and 1990s.  At the time he was well known for his monthly ''"Fizz File"'' column in ''WINE Magazine'', and for being the sole author of the award winning annual Champagne supplements for both of these magazines.

In 1998, his ''[[Christie's World Encyclopedia of Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine]]'' became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper (''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 October 1998), when he published for the first time ever a 17th-century document proving that the English used a second fermentation to convert still wines into sparkling at least six years before [[Dom Pérignon]] arrived at the Abbey of [[Hautvillers]], and almost 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented.&lt;ref name=decajudg&gt;{{cite web| last = ''Decanter.com''| title = ''Decanter'' World Wine Awards: Judges | url = http://www.decanter.com/worldwineawards/judges1.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson is also regarded as one of the world’s leading experts on [[Alsace wine]].&lt;ref name=scots&gt;{{cite news| last= Hall| first= Allan, ''The Scotsman'' |title=

Stevenson is also the author of several more wide-ranging publications, including ''[[The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia]]'', which is required reading for both Master of Wine and Master Sommelier examinations, and has been published and revised continuously since 1988. In this book, Stevenson has shown that he has the gift of taking vast quantities of knowledge and experience and translating them into lucid, sparkling prose, easily graspable by the novice, yet still interesting and instructive to the connoisseur.&lt;ref name=wd-stev/&gt;&lt;ref name=wak&gt;{{Cite web|last= Goode |first= Jamie, wineanorak.com|title= My top 10 wine books |url= http://www.wineanorak.com/bookshop/top10.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; With ''[[The Oxford Companion to Wine]]'', ''The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia'' is regarded as one of the essential wine reference books in English.&lt;ref name=gua&gt;{{Cite news|last= Atkin|first= Tim, ''The Observer'' |title= The word on the vine |url= http://books.guardian.co.uk/booksoftheyear2005/story/0,,1664354,00.html |date= 11 December 2005 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the books authored by Stevenson, he conceived and edited the annual ''Wine Report'', described by [[Jancis Robinson]], MW as "the most significant entirely new wine book to emerge in 2003".&lt;ref name=jr2/&gt; In August 2009 it was announced by publisher [[Dorling Kindersley]] that the 2009 edition of ''Wine Report'' was to be the last, citing that the sales figures were insufficient to justify the fees of the guide's 45 writers, among them [[Clive Coates]], MW and [[Anthony Rose (wine)|Anthony Rose]].&lt;ref name=deca082009&gt;{{cite web|last= Peskett |first= Stuart, ''Decanter.com'' |title= Bleak future for Wine Report as publisher pulls plug |date= 25 August 2009 |url= http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/bleak-future-for-wine-report-as-publisher-pulls-plug-65926/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wine Report'' was the recipient of "Best in World" prizes three times at the Gourmand International Awards, and in 2006 it became the only wine book to be inducted into Gourmand's Hall of Fame (a feat unmatched by other wine books until 2007 when joined by ''[[The World Atlas of Wine]]'' and ''[[Bordeaux et ses Vins]]'').

Over and above these awards, Stevenson has personally won 31 literary prizes, including "Wine writer of the year" three times&lt;ref&gt;amazon.com [https://www.amazon.com/Wine-Report-2008/dp/0756631653 Back page text of Tom Stevenson's Wine Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and the coveted Wine Literary Award, America's only lifetime achievement award for wine writing.&lt;ref&gt;DK: Wine [http://us.dk.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780756631659,00.html Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson has been chairman of Champagne and Alsace panels at the "''Decanter'' World Wine Awards" since its inception, and has judged at other major competitions in France, Germany, Greece, Australia and the USA. He presents the [[Christie's]] Champagne Masterclass&lt;ref name=chrsmast/&gt; in London ever year (taking it to [[Singapore]] one year). He sporadically writes at wine-pages.com,  and once  away an entire edition of his ''Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine Guide'' simply because it was late coming out.&lt;ref name=jr1&gt;{{Cite web|last= Robinson |first= Jancis, jancisrobinson.com | url= http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr7075 |title= Free fizz guide | date= 21 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Aromas and Flavors resource lists the active chemical compounds responsible for common aromas in wine and has been described as the most helpful tool for delineating wine's attributes since Dr. Anne Noble's Aroma Wheel was devised at [[UC Davis]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;avenuevine.com [http://www.avenuevine.com/archives/cat_editorials.html Swirl, sniff, sip, search and blog]]  [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Harrison Hays Sr.''' ({{IPAc-en|h|eɪ|z}}; November 5, 1879 – March 7, 1954) was a United States politician, chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] (1918–21), [[U.S. Postmaster General]] (1921–22), and, from 1922–1945, the first chairman of the [[Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA). He became the namesake of the 1930 [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|Motion Picture Production Code]], informally (and inaccurately) referred to as the Hays Code, which spelled out a set of moral guidelines for the self-censorship of content in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood cinema]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Hays was born in [[Sullivan, Indiana]], on November 5, 1879, and attended [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]].  He was the [[campaign manager|manager]] of [[Warren G. Harding]]'s successful campaign for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1920|1920 election]] and was subsequently appointed Postmaster General. While serving in the Harding Administration, he became peripherally involved in the [[Teapot Dome scandal]].

==Teapot Dome scandal==

Oilman [[Harry Ford Sinclair]] devised a scheme in which twenty-five cents was diverted from the sale of every barrel of oil sold from the oil field leases that were the focus of the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. Sinclair testified that he "loaned" Will H. Hays, then-chairman of the Republican National Committee, $185,000 worth of [[Liberty Bonds]], later getting back $100,000. Sinclair also gave Hays $75,000 as an outright gift to the Committee. At the time, Hays was attempting to pay off the 1920 Republican campaign debt. Hays later approached a number of wealthy men and told them that if they would contribute to pay down the Committee's debt, he would reimburse them for their contributions with Liberty Bonds.

In 1924, after his resignation from the Harding administration, and while he was serving as President of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Hays was called to testify before the Senate Committee on Public Lands. When asked how much money Sinclair had contributed to the Republican Party, Hays testified that his contribution was $75,000. In 1928, after more details of Sinclair's scheme had emerged, Hays was called to testify again. Hays then told the full story of Sinclair's contribution, including the donation of $185,000 in Liberty Bonds and the $75,000 cash contribution. He stated that he had not mentioned the bonds in his earlier testimony because the Committee "had not asked about any bonds." While there was some public perception that Hays was attempting to conceal Sinclair's large contribution to the Republican National Committee, he testified that he was  "using the bonds to raise money for the deficit." &lt;ref&gt;Frederick Lewis Allen (1959). ''Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920's,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MPPDA Chairman==
Hays resigned his cabinet position on January 14, 1922, to become Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) shortly after the organization's founding.&lt;ref&gt;"Hays to Be Mogul in Silver Screen Realm", ''San Antonio Express'', January 15, 1922, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; He began his new job, at a $35,360 &lt;!--$35,360 is $17 per hour NOT $100,000--&gt; annual salary ({{Inflation|US|35360|1922|r=-4|fmt=eq}}), on March 6 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Will Hays, Who Is to Get $17 Hourly, to Make the Movies Behave Hereafter", ''Syracuse Herald'', March 5, 1922, p33&lt;/ref&gt; There was speculation that he would be paid between $100,000 and $150,000 a year.&lt;ref name=landis&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |quote=Postmaster General Will H. Hays yesterday signed a contract to become the "Landis of the movies" for three years, beginning next March 4 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E6DD1130EE3ABC4152DFB7668389639EDE |title=Will H. Hays Signs To Direct Movies. Will Formally Resign From the Cabinet Today, to Take Effect on March 4. To Form New Association. His Signature Is Placed on Contract After Telephone Talk With the President |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 19, 1922 |accessdate=January 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the organization was to renovate the image of the movie industry in the wake of the scandal surrounding the alleged rape and murder of model and actress [[Virginia Rappe]], of which film star [[Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] was accused, and amid growing calls by religious groups for federal censorship of the movies. Hiring Hays to "clean up the pictures" was, at least in part, a public relations ploy and much was made of his conservative credentials, including his roles as a Presbyterian deacon and past chairman of the Republican Party.

In his new position in Hollywood, Hays' main roles were to persuade individual state censor boards not to ban specific films outright and to reduce the financial impact of the boards' cuts and edits. At that time, the studios were required by state laws to pay the censor boards for each foot of film excised and for each title card edited; in addition, studios also had the expense of duplicating and distributing separate versions of each censored film for the state or states that adhered to a particular board's decisions.
[[Image:HungerfordCartoon.jpg|thumb|300px|1922 [[editorial cartoon]] by [[Cyrus Cotton "Cy" Hungerford|Cy Hungerford]] illustrating the perception that Hays was coming to rescue the movie industry.]]

Hays attempted to reduce studio costs (and improve the industry's image in general) by advising individual studios on how to produce movies to reduce the likelihood that the film would be cut. Each board kept its "standards" secret (if, indeed, they had any standardization at all), so Hays was forced to intuit what would or would not be permitted by each board. At first he applied what he called "The Formula" but it was not particularly successful; from that he developed a set of guidelines he called "The Don'ts and Be Carefuls". In general his efforts at pre-release self-censorship were unsuccessful in quieting calls for federal censorship.

Catholic bishops and lay people tended to be leery of federal censorship and favored the Hays approach of self-censorship; these included the outspoken Catholic layman [[Martin J. Quigley]], publisher of ''Exhibitors Herald-World'' (a trade magazine for independent exhibitors). For several months in 1929, Martin Quigley, [[Joseph Breen]], Father [[Daniel A. Lord]] S.J., Father FitzGeorge Dinneen S.J., and Father Wilfred Parsons (editor of Catholic publication ''America'') discussed the desirability of a new and more stringent code of behavior for the movies. With the blessing of [[George Mundelein|Cardinal George W. Mundelein]] of Chicago, Father Lord authored the code, which later became known as "The [[Production Code]]", "The Code", and "The Hays Code". It was presented to Will Hays in 1930 who said, "My eyes nearly popped out when I read it. This was the very thing I had been looking for".

The studio heads were less enthusiastic but they agreed to make The Code the rule of the industry, albeit with many loopholes that allowed studio producers to override the Hays Office's application of it. From 1930 to 1934, the Production Code was only slightly effective in fighting back calls for federal censorship. However, things came to a head in 1934 with widespread threats of Catholic boycotts of "immoral" movies, as well as reduced funding from Catholic financiers such as [[A. P. Giannini]] of the [[Bank of America]]. As a result, the studios granted MPPDA full authority to enforce the Production Code on all studios, creating a relatively strict regime of self-censorship which endured for decades. (The Code was set aside in the 1960s when the MPAA adopted the age-based rating system in force today.) Also in 1934, to deal with "inappropriate" industry personnel, alongside the Code's concern with the industry's output, Hays created a list of 117 names of performers whose personal lives he thought made them unfit to appear in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russo|first1=Vito|title=The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies |date=1987|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|page=45|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hays' philosophy might best be summed up by a statement he reportedly made to a movie director: "When you make a woman cross her legs in the films, maybe you don't need to see how she can cross them and stay within the law; but how low she can cross them and still be interesting".&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1943,'' p277&lt;/ref&gt;

Hays faced much international pressure to block film scripts and scenes offensive to foreign nations. Many European nations imposed quotas designed to boost domestic productions over Hollywood imports. A key accomplishment of Hays was his work with the U.S. government, particularly the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], in maintaining Hollywood's domination of overseas movie markets.&lt;ref&gt;John Trumpbour (2002). ''Selling Hollywood to the World: U.S. and European Struggles for Mastery of the Global Film Industry, 1920-1950,'' New York: Cambridge University Press, p4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Casting==
When the entertainment industry started to take off in the early 1920s, thousands of people flocked to Hollywood with hopes of becoming the next big star. These hopefuls were called "[[Extra_(acting)|extras]]" because they were the extra people who filled out scenes. The main way to find work at this time was to wait outside the gates of studios, hoping production would hire you on the spot. With little regulation on hiring film extras, many people were exploited while looking for work. In an effort to fix the employment issues and exploitation that plagued the industry, Hays commissioned several studies of the employment conditions in Hollywood. After reviewing the results of the studies, Hays created the [[Central_Casting|Central Casting Corporation]] in 1925 as a way to regulate the hiring of extras in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.centralcasting.com/from-film-extras-to-background-actors/ |title=From Film Extras to Background Actors |publisher=Central Casting |access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After his retirement, Will H. Hays returned to Sullivan, Indiana, where he died on March 7, 1954.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Will Hays, First Film Czar, Dies.

==Production Code==
{{main|United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930}}
The Production Code enumerated three "General Principles":

#No picture shall be produced that will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin.
#Correct standards of life, subject only to the requirements of drama and entertainment, shall be presented.
#Law, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation.

Specific restrictions were spelled out as "Particular Applications" of these principles:

:*[[Depictions of nudity|Nudity]] and suggestive dances were prohibited.
:*The ridicule of religion was forbidden, and ministers of religion were not to be represented as comic characters or villains.
:*The depiction of [[illegal drug use]] was forbidden, as well as the use of liquor, "when not required by the plot or for proper characterization."
:*Methods of crime (e.g. safe-cracking, arson, smuggling) were not to be explicitly presented.
:*References to sex perversions such as homosexuality and venereal disease were forbidden, as were depictions of childbirth.
:*The language section banned various words and phrases that were considered to be offensive.
:*Murder scenes had to be filmed in a way that would discourage imitations in real life, and brutal killings could not be shown in detail.
:*"Revenge in modern times" was not to be justified.
:*The sanctity of marriage and the home had to be upheld.
:*"Pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex relationship are the accepted or common thing."
:*Adultery and illicit sex, although recognized as sometimes necessary to the plot, could not be explicit or justified and were not supposed to be presented as an attractive option.
:*Portrayals of [[miscegenation]] were forbidden.
:*"Scenes of Passion" were not to be introduced when not essential to the plot.
:*"Excessive and lustful kissing" was to be avoided, along with any other treatment that might "stimulate the lower and baser element."
:*The [[flag of the United States]] was to be treated respectfully, and the people and history of other nations were to be presented "fairly."
:*"[[Vulgarity]]", defined as "low, disgusting, unpleasant, though not necessarily evil, subjects" must be "subject to the dictates of good taste."
:*Capital punishment, "[[third-degree methods]]", cruelty to children and animals, prostitution and surgical operations were to be handled with similar sensitivity.

'''William Samuel Johnson''' (October 7, 1727 – November 14, 1819) was an early American statesman who was notable for signing the [[United States Constitution]], for representing [[Connecticut]] in the [[United States Senate]], and for serving as the third president of [[Columbia University|King's College]] now known as Columbia University.

==Early life==
[[File:Coat of Arms of William Samuel Johnson.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of William Samuel Johnson]]
William Samuel Johnson was born in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], on October 7, 1727 to [[Samuel_Johnson_(American_educator)|Samuel Johnson]], a well-known Anglican clergyman and later president of King's ([[Columbia University|Columbia]]) College, and Johnson's first wife, Charity Floyd Nicoll.  Johnson received his primary education at home. He then graduated from [[Yale College]] in 1744, going on to receive a master's degree from his alma mater in 1747 (as well as an honorary degree from Harvard the same year). Although Johnson's father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided to pursue a legal career.Self educated in law he quickly established various business connections.

==Career==
Although his father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided instead to pursue a legal career. Self-educated in the law, he quickly developed an important clientele and established business connections extending beyond the boundaries of his native colony. He also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, rising to the rank of colonel, and he served in the lower house of the [[Connecticut General Assembly|Connecticut Legislature]] (1761 and 1765) and in the upper house (1766 and 1771–75). Additionally, he was a member of the colony's [[Connecticut Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (1772–74).

He was first attracted to the Patriot cause by what he and his associates considered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s unwarranted interference in the government of the colonies. He attended the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in 1765, and served on the committee that drafted an address to the King arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves.  He opposed the [[Townshend Acts]] passed by Parliament in 1767 to pay for the [[French and Indian War]] and supported the non-importation agreements devised by the colonies to protest taxation without representation.

===American Revolution===
Johnson lived in London from 1767 to 1771, serving as Connecticut's agent in its attempt to settle the colony's title to Indian lands.  He sharply criticized British policy toward the colonies.  His experience in Britain convinced him that Britain's policy was shaped more by ignorance of American conditions and not through the sinister designs of a wicked government, as many Patriots alleged.  As the Patriots became more radical in their demands, Johnson found it difficult to commit himself wholeheartedly to the cause.  Although he believed British policy unwise, he found it difficult to break his own connections with the mother country. A scholar of international renown, he had many friends in Britain and among the American Loyalists.  As the famous English author, [[Samuel Johnson]], said of him, "Of all those whom the various accidents of life have brought within my notice, there is scarce anyone whose acquaintance I have more desired to cultivate than yours."  He was also bound to Britain by religious and professional ties.  He enjoyed close associations with the Anglican Church in England and with the scholarly community at Oxford, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1766.

Fearing the consequences of independence for both the colonies and the mother country, Johnson sought to avoid extremism and to reach a compromise on the outstanding political differences between the protagonists. He rejected his election to the [[First Continental Congress]], a move strongly criticized by the Patriots, who removed him from his militia command. He was also strongly criticized when, seeking an end to the fighting after Lexington and Concord, he personally visited the British commander, General [[Thomas Gage]]. The incident led to his arrest for communicating with the enemy, but the charges were eventually dropped.  He felt that the American Revolution was not necessary and that independence would be bad for everyone concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth P. McCaughey, "William Samuel Johnson, The Loyal Whig" in William M. Fowler Jr. and Wallace Coyle, eds. ''American Revolution: Changing Perspectives'' (1979), pp. 69–102&lt;/ref&gt;

===New nation===
Once independence was achieved, Johnson felt free to participate in the government of the new nation, serving in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (1785–1787). His influence as a delegate was recognized by his contemporaries. [[Jeremiah Wadsworth]] wrote of him to a friend, "Dr. Johnson has, I believe, much more influence than either you or myself. The Southern Delegates are vastly fond of him." In 1785, the [[Vermont Republic]] granted Johnson a town in the former [[King's College Tract]] in thanks for representing the interests of Vermont before the Continental Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Swift, Esther M. |title=''Vermont Place-Names, Footprints in History'' |year=1977 |publisher=The Stephen Greene Press |pages=282–283 |isbn=0828902917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Johnson, Vermont]], the small university [[Johnson State College]], and Johnson Street [http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] bear his name.

===Constitutional Convention===
In 1787, Johnson played a major role as one of the [[Philadelphia Convention]]'s delegates. His eloquent speeches on the subject of representation carried great weight during the debate. He looked to a strong federal government to protect the rights of Connecticut and the other small states from encroachment by their more powerful neighbors. He supported the [[New Jersey Plan]], which called for equal representation of the states in the national legislature.

In general, he favored extension of federal authority. He argued that the judicial power "ought to extend to equity as well as law" (the words "in law and equity" were adopted at his motion). The inflexibility of the law had to be tempered by fairness. He denied that there could be treason against a separate state since sovereignty was "in the Union." He opposed prohibition of any [[ex post facto]] law, one which made an act a criminal offense retroactively, because such prohibition implied "an improper suspicion of the National Legislature."

Johnson was influential even in the final stages of framing the Constitution. He gave his fullest support to the [[Connecticut Compromise]], which foreshadowed the final Great Compromise, with a national legislature with a Senate that provided equal representation for all states and a House of Representatives based on population. He also served on and chaired the five-member Committee of Style, which framed the final form of the document.

In ''[[Miracle at Philadelphia]]'', [[Catherine Drinker Bowen]] called Johnson "the perfect man to preside over these four masters of argument and political strategy [i.e. fellow committee members [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Gouverneur Morris]], [[James Madison]], and [[Rufus King]]].... His presence on the committee must have been reassuring; the doctor's quiet manner disarmed."&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.235 of the 1986 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Avram "Yoni" Wolf''' (born April 30, 1979) is an [[United States|American]] [[alternative hip hop]] and [[indie rock]] musician and co-founder of the record label [[Anticon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alarm-magazine.com/2010/why-introspective-vagabond-rap/|title=Why?: Hip Hop’s Lyrical Transient|publisher=''ALARM Magazine''|first=Drew|last=Fortune|date=December 15, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019165507/http://alarm-magazine.com/2010/why-introspective-vagabond-rap/ |archivedate=October 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1997 until 2004, Wolf released music under the stage name '''Why?'''. In 2004 he transferred that name onto his [[Why? (American band)|newly founded band]]. Thereafter he has been credited for his solo work as Yoni Wolf.

Prior to the founding of the band Why? in 2004, Wolf had also been a member of numerous other groups, including [[Greenthink]], [[Clouddead]], [[Reaching Quiet]] and [[Hymie's Basement]].

==History==
Wolf was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] to [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jewish]] parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ben Ari |first=Gon |title=Why Not |publication-date=July 3, 2009 |newspaper=7 Nights, [[Yedioth Ahronoth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his first year in high school, he discovered an old 4-track in his father's synagogue and began to experiment musically. His forays into rapping, drumming, and poetry followed.

In 1997, while attending art school at the [[University of Cincinnati]], Wolf met fellow student Adam Drucker, aka [[Doseone]], at the semifinals of [[Scribble Jam]]. Along with Doseone, [[Mr. Dibbs]] and his brother [[Josiah Wolf]], he formed the live improvisational group Apogee. The partnership of Wolf and Doseone continued for many years under many guises.

[[File:Why2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Yoni Wolf performing with Why? in [[Brussels]] in 2010]]
In 1998 the duo released the album ''[[It's Not Easy Being...]]'' under the name [[Greenthink]]. In 1999, with an expansive roster of featured guests, they released the second Greenthink record ''[[Blindfold (album)|Blindfold]]'', after which they expanded to a trio with the addition of producer [[Odd Nosdam]] and adopted the name [[Clouddead]]. In the same year Wolf released his first solo album under the name Why?, entitled ''Part Time People Cage... or Part Time Key?''.

Beginning in 2000, Clouddead released a series of six 10" vinyl singles on [[Mush Records]]. In 2001 these singles were compiled on CD and released as the group's [[Clouddead (album)|self-titled debut album]].

Following the release of his album ''[[Oaklandazulasylum]]'' in 2003, Wolf enlisted Josiah Wolf on drums, Matt Meldon on guitar, and Doug McDiarmid as a multi-instrumentalist. Wolf decided to transfer his alias onto the new band, and [[Why? (American band)|Why?]] was officially formed.

In 2005, Why? released their debut album ''[[Elephant Eyelash]]''. The album deviated considerably from the sound of Wolf's prior solo work. The group toured much of 2005 in support of the album as a four-piece. However, by the time of their May 2006 tour with [[Islands (band)|Islands]], the group had become a three-piece, as Meldon moved to an island off the coast of [[Seattle]] to live with his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern.net/southern/news/?id%3D90 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706103524/http://www.southern.net/southern/news/?id=90 |archivedate=July 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their second album ''[[Alopecia (album)|Alopecia]]'', Why? asked their fans to contribute photographs of their palms for the album's artwork. They released "The Hollows" as the first single, with two different European and US versions, featuring remixes and covers by [[Boards of Canada]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Dntel]], [[Half-handed Cloud]], [[Dump (band)|Dump]] and [[Islands (band)|Islands]]. ''Alopecia'' was released in 2008 to very positive reviews.

In 2009, Why? released their third album ''[[Eskimo Snow]]''. The ten songs on the album were recorded during the ''Alopecia'' sessions and are described by Wolf as "the least hip-hop out of anything I've ever been involved with."&lt;ref name=PitchforkEskimo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35416-whys-yoni-wolf-reveals-new-album-ieskimo-snowi/ |title=WHY?'s Yoni Wolf Reveals New Album: ''Eskimo Snow'' |author=Tom Breihan |date=May 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=May 30, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530212242/http://pitchfork.com/news/35416-whys-yoni-wolf-reveals-new-album-ieskimo-snowi/ |archivedate=May 30, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2012, the band announced via [[Stereogum]] that they would be releasing their new EP ''[[Sod in the Seed]]'' on August 13 on [[City Slang]]. In the same article they premiered the title track. The song is more upbeat than any of the tracks on ''Eskimo Snow'' and contains rapping, which had been absent on the previous album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/1077502/why-sod-in-the-seed/mp3s/|title=WHY? - "Sod in the Seed"|publisher=''Stereogum''|first=Corbin|last=Goble|date=June 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830075427/http://stereogum.com/1077502/why-sod-in-the-seed/mp3s/|archivedate=August 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band released their fourth album, ''[[Mumps, Etc.]]'' on October 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/47309-why-announce-new-album-mumps-etc/|title=WHY? announce new album, Mumps, etc.|publisher=''Pitchfork''|first=Carrie|last=Battan|date=July 30, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912161844/http://pitchfork.com/news/47309-why-announce-new-album-mumps-etc/|archivedate=September 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf suffers from [[Crohn's disease]] and many of his lyrics describe his efforts to cope with the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plasternack|first=Alex|title=Just To Be Grounded: An Interview with Yoni Wolf|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezzzp7/just-to-be-grounded-an-interview-with-yoni-wolf-of-why|publisher=Vice|accessdate=31 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401213138/https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezzzp7/just-to-be-grounded-an-interview-with-yoni-wolf-of-why|archivedate=1 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Wolf has produced tracks for other MCs. He produced several tracks for fellow Anticon co-founder [[Pedestrian (rapper)|Pedestrian]]'s album ''[[Volume One: UnIndian Songs]]'' in 2005. He also produced several tracks for [[Serengeti (rapper)|Serengeti]]'s album ''Family and Friends'', as well as providing backup vocals, in 2011.&lt;ref name=PitchforkFamily&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/ |title=Serengeti – Family and Friends |author=Zach Kelly |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722141400/http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/ |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolf has released many albums as a member of groups including [[Reaching Quiet]], [[Hymie's Basement]], Miss Ohio's Nameless and Object Beings. He has collaborated with Doseone, [[Odd Nosdam]], [[Fog (band)|Fog]] among others. In 2017, he convinced his label to put out [[The Ophelias (band)|The Ophelias]]' debut LP, and he produced their sophomore LP, ''Almost'', the following year which was also released on [[Joyful Noise Recordings|Joyful Noise]].

The '''Young People's Christian Union''' (Y.P.C.U.), organized in 1889, was a Universalist youth group created to develop the spiritual life of young people and advance the work of the Universalist church.  Soon after it was founded the Y.P.C.U. focused its attention on missionary work.  It was instrumental in the founding of new southern churches and the creation of a Post Office Mission for the distribution of religious literature.

Initially organized as an auxiliary to the Universalist General Convention, the Y.P.C.U. developed an independent identity.  It held its own yearly conventions, published a magazine (''Onward''), implemented funding mechanisms and elected officers.

In 1941, the Young People's Christian Union was re-organized as the Universalist Youth Fellowship.  In 1953, the Universalists and Unitarian youth organizations merged to form the Liberal Religious Youth (LRY).  After the merger in 1961 of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America, LRY was re-organized as the Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU).

== History ==
=== Early Young People Societies ===

The inspiration for the Young People's Christian Union can be traced to the founding of the [[YMCA|Young Men's Christian Association]] (Y.M.C.A.) in England.

George Williams after entering the drapery business in 1841 formed a mutual improvement society with fellow workers.  The aim of the society was Bible study and support of missionary efforts.  Three year later, Williams and twelve other young men formalized the mission of their support group as the  “improvement of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery and other trades.”  Membership was later extended to anyone who was “a member of a Christian church” or gave “sufficient evidence of his being a converted character.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erb |first=Frank Otis |date=1917 |title= The Development of the Young People’s Movement
 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lNJMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=%22The+development+of+the+young+people%27s+movement%22+%22by+frank+otis+erb%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhwq_RyoLaAhUk0oMKHS1HBHgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20development%20of%20the%20young%20people's%20movement%22%20%22by%20frank%20otis%20erb%22&amp;f=false |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |pages= 28–29|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called their new society the Young Men's Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.).

By 1855 there were 8,500 Y.M.C.A members in Great Britain.  The American version of the Y.M.C.A. soon spread during a period of heightened religious activity called the [[Third Great Awakening]]  (1850s – 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erb |first=Frank Otis |date=1917 |title= The Development of the Young People’s Movement
 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lNJMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=%22The+development+of+the+young+people%27s+movement%22+%22by+frank+otis+erb%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhwq_RyoLaAhUk0oMKHS1HBHgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20development%20of%20the%20young%20people's%20movement%22%20%22by%20frank%20otis%20erb%22&amp;f=false |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page= 24|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860, Rev. Dr. Theodore L. Cuyler, minister of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, New York, became aware of the success of the Y.M.C.A. to gather young men for prayer meetings, but that the Y.M.C.A. had not succeeded in organizing them for more sustained Christian work in the church.  To address this situation, on November 6, 1867, Rev. Cuyler organized the Young People's Association (YPA).  Cuyler's YPA was designed to focus the energy of young men on long term church work such as “the conversion of souls, the development of Christian character and the training of converts in religious work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erb |first=Frank Otis |date=1917 |title= The Development of the Young People’s Movement

Some years later, Rev. Dr. Francis E. Clark, pastor of the Williston Congregational Church in Portland, Maine, visited the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church.  In 1892 he reflected back on his impression of the Young People's Association stating it “was certainly an inspiration to the first Christian Endeavor Society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erb |first=Frank Otis |date=1917 |title= The Development of the Young People’s Movement

=== Christian Endeavor Society ===

During a monthly Week of Prayer, Rev. Clark observed that similar to the Y.M.C.A. model, the Week of Prayer gathered young people for Christian devotion but afterwards they soon departed.  Clark had relied for years upon prevailing wisdom that entertainment, mutual improvement and literary societies would sustain young people's interest in Christian church work.  After five year of such efforts, Rev. Clark had little to show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Francis Edward |date=1912 |title= The Christian Endeavor Manual
 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PIQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christian+Endeavor+Society+Manual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIz576vNXZAhVMw4MKHZAvDaUQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Endeavor%20Society%20Manual&amp;f=false|location=Boston and Chicago |publisher=Plimpton Press |pages= 11–12|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark abandoned the “low expectations” model and opted instead to raise the expectations of the religious obligations of young people.  His youth organization would be first and foremost a Christian society.  Musical soirees and literary readings may follow, but they would be subordinate to the larger mission of seeking the kingdom of God.  On February 2, 1881 Rev. Clark proposed his new society and secured the signature of forty to fifty young people to the constitution of an organization called the [[Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour|Christian Endeavor]] Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Francis Edward |date=1912 |title= The Christian Endeavor Manual
 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PIQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Christian+Endeavor+Society+Manual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIz576vNXZAhVMw4MKHZAvDaUQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Endeavor%20Society%20Manual&amp;f=false|location=Boston and Chicago |publisher=Plimpton Press |pages= 13–14|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional societies soon followed in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts.  The absence of a denomination designation enabled a Christian Endeavor Society to be organized within any church denomination. Five years after the organization of the first Christian Endeavor Society, there were 850 societies representing eight denominations from 33 states and seven countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erb |first=Frank Otis |date=1917 |title= The Development of the Young People’s Movement
 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lNJMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=%22The+development+of+the+young+people%27s+movement%22+%22by+frank+otis+erb%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhwq_RyoLaAhUk0oMKHS1HBHgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20development%20of%20the%20young%20people's%20movement%22%20%22by%20frank%20otis%20erb%22&amp;f=false|location=Chicago, IL |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |page= 55|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others followed Rev. Clark's model, but created youth groups that were specifically denominationally branded: the Baptist Young's People's Union (1891), the Luther League (1896), the Universalist Young People's Christian Union (1889), the Unitarian Young People's Religious Union (1896) and the Methodist Epworth League (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Clinton Lee |date=1957 |title=The Universalist Church of American: A Shorty History|url= |location= |publisher=Universalist Historical Society |page=67 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universalist Young People’s Christian Union ==

The Universalists, not having made any earlier effort to create a unifying national youth organization, discovered that within the denomination there were more than 120 young people's societies including 38 Christian Endeavor Societies and others with names such as “Christian Union,” “Christian Culture,” and “Christian Work.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=175 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation was addressed at the 1886 Chicago General Convention with a proposal to create a national youth society called the Young People's Missionary Association (Y.P M.A.).  The proposal called for the formation of parish level associations designed as auxiliaries to state conventions.   After the convention, the Y.P.M.A. saw some initial success.  More than 20 such organizations were formed, but the Y.P.M.A. did not have wide appeal.  Existing youth groups resisted joining the Y.P.M.A. preferring to retain their individual social or literary charters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970

Two years later, in 1888, Rev. Stephen H. Roblin revived the idea of a distinctively Universalist nationwide youth group.

=== Bay City, Michigan  ===
Shortly after his ordination in 1882, Rev. Roblin assumed the pastorate at the Universalist church in Victor, New York.  His experience with his church's Christian Endeavor Society as well as his personal connection with Rev. L.B. Fisher and James D. Tillinghast, publishers of a New York State monthly journal called the ''Universalist Union'', would contribute to the reboot of a Universalist youth organization.

Six years later, in 1888, Rev. Roblin had relocated to Michigan to assume the pastorate of the Universalist church in Bay City.  Since his new church did not have a youth group, Rev. Roblin appointed Alfred J. Cardall to form a Christian Endeavor Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tillingshat |first=James D.  |date=1894 |title= Young People’s Christian Union.

|location=Boston|publisher=Universalist Publishing House |page= 288|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also closely associated with the formation of this Christian Endeavor Society was Albert G. Grier, a principal in the local school system.

As he organized his local youth group Roblin became curious about denominational support for a revised national youth society.  Roblin recruited Cardall and Grier, who has just formed the local Bay City Christian Endeavor Society, and Fisher and Tillinghast, publishers of the ''Universalist Union'', to conduct a correspondence campaign.  They contacted Universalist youth groups to ascertain their interest in a Universalist national youth organization.  If interested, youth groups were encouraged to send delegates to an organizing meeting to take place a day before the General Convention in Lynn, Massachusetts.

=== Lynn Convention  ===
On October 22, 1889, 131 delegates representing 56 societies from 13 states attended the First National Convention of Universalist Young People. By-laws and a constitution for the Young People's Christian Union (Y.P.C.U.) were drafted. The mission of the Y.P.C.U. was  “to promote an earnest Christian life among young people of the Universalist Church, and the sympathetic union of all young people’s societies in their efforts to make themselves more useful in the service of God.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bisbee |first=Frederick A. |date=1914 |title= Young People’s Christian Union of the Universalist Church Sourenir Program and Miniature History 1889 Lynn-Boston 1914

|location=Boston|publisher=Universalist Historical Society |page=11|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Universalist Union'' was adopted as the official press organ of the Y.P.C.U.

The Lynn General Convention approved the youth group's by-laws and constitution.  There was, however, those who opposed the formation of the youth group arguing that no intermediate organization should stand between the church and its people.  The opposition insisted that youth groups must be designated as auxiliaries or subordinates to the General Convention and adult supervision must be exercised over the Y.P.C.U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970
|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=177 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, over time, the new youth group acquired the profile of an independent organization. In 1893, The Y.P.C.U. assumed responsibility for the publication of the ''Universalist Union,'' changing the name to ''Onward,'' and modified the format from a monthly to weekly magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=188 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1894 the Y.P.C.U. began holding their conventions independently from those of the General Convention. The Y.P.C.U. also acquired other independent trappings such Y.P.C.U. branded colors (blue for truth, white for purity), motto (For Christ and His Church), hymn (''Follow the Gleam'') and watchword (Onward!).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970
|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=178 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having a national profile, the Y.P.C.U. was at its core a local institution.  Churches sponsored a local Y.P.C.U. group that, in turn, was affiliated with a state Y.P.C.U. organization.  The local groups could then voluntarily affiliate with the national organization.  Also loosely defined was the term "young."  It was not uncommon in the early days of the Y.P.C.U. for individuals in their thirties or older to be a member of the local Y.P.C.U.  For the truly young, a Junior Y.P.C.U. concept was introduced in 1894 with Mary Grace Canfield being appointed as its first national superintendent.  Finally, to provide an organizational structure for young Universalists who did not have a local church community, the Union at Large concept was introduced in 1892 with Sarah B. Hammond being appointed its first national superintendent.

== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Focus ==
At its first convention in Rochester, New York in 1890, the Y.P.C.U. turned its focus to missionary work.   This focus on missionary work  shaped the actions taken by the Y.P.C.U. in the following years by the appointment of its first missionary, Rev. William H. McGlauflin; granting its secretary a salary; adopting a temperance position; organizing a Post Office Mission for the distribution of religious literature; establishing a funding mechanism called the Two Cent a Week for Missions; explicitly denominationally rebranding the group by appending "of the Universalist Church" to the group's name; and the appointment of Rev. Quillen H. Shinn as their National Organizer.

The first missionary action taken by the Y.P.C.U. was accepting the responsibility to build of a new Universalist church in Harriman, Tennessee.

=== Harriman, Tennessee ===
==== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Work 1890 - 1895 ====
Despite being operational for only one year, building a new church, given the economic situation in Harriman, was a plausible objective for the Y.P.C.U.  Harriman was barely a town in early 1890, but growth was almost assured. Northern businessmen through the Tennessee Land Company were making substantial investments in Harriman to exploit abundant coal, iron, timber and limestone resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970

|location=Boston|publisher=Universalist Publishing House |page= 291|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged the Harriman missionary project.  They argued that in Harriman the Universalists would be the religious vanguard in a burgeoning new city instead of trailing along as late-comers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970
|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=185 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Rev. Nash had visited Harriman prior to the Rochester convention.  Nash was aware that there were a number of Universalists already in the area and that other conditions in Harriman were favorable to Y.P.C.U.   The East Tennessee Land Company, for example, provided Nash two land lots for a Universalist church.  The town's charter with its explicit prohibition on liquor closely aligned with Y.P.C.U. temperance sensibilities.  This commitment to temperance was further fortified by the East Tennessee Land Company's plan to construct an institute of higher learning in the city called The American Temperance University.

Adding to these social and economic incentives was financial support offered by [[Ferdinand Schumacher]].  A rich German immigrant known as the “oatmeal king,” Schumacher, from Ohio,  was a Universalist and temperance advocate. Schumacker pledged $1,000 to the church building fund if the Universalists raised $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=194 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cornerstone to the Grace Universalist Church in Harriman was laid on December 2, 1891.  The church was formally dedicated on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1892 with a sermon preached by Rev. Henry L. Canfield.  By 1895, the debt free church had 140 members.  The Y.P.C.U. would soon deliver the deed of the church to the General Convention and turn its attention to its next missionary effort in Atlanta.

==== Denouement ====
As the Y.P.C.U. turned its attention to Atlanta in 1895, the fortunes of the Grace Universalist Church reflected the economic downward trajectory of Harriman.  Church membership decreased after its first pastor, Rev. W.H. McGlauflin, departed.  More misfortune befell the church when McGlauflin's replacement, Rev. Harry Lawrence Veazey and his wife tragically died in New York State.  Rev. Charles R. East, the next pastor, became disheartened and departed.  Eleven years after its dedication, even the ever-optimistic Rev. Shinn declared the church dead.  An ex-Baptist who joined the Universalist church, Rev. John M. Rasanke, attempted to revive the church, but he too departed in 1904.  Several years of dormancy followed.

After World War I, the Universalist Women's National Missionary Association (WNMA) took over responsibility for Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=196 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WNMA reported in the October issue of the ''Universalist Leader'' that the Harriman church, once on the dormant list, was now active with Rev. William E. Manning serving as pastor. However, it would have been more accurate to report that Rev. Manning had only included Harriman on his 1920 – 1921 missionary circuit. The WNMA abandoned the church property in 1923 and the General Convention trustees sold the property in 1927 for $2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=196 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The old church building was torn down in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=John Norris |date=2014 |title= Images of America Harriman|url= |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=100 |isbn=978-1-4671-1187-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlanta, Georgia  ===
=== Missionary Work 1879 - 1882 ===
In the summer f 1879, Rev. W.C. Bowman attempted to establish a Universalist church in Atlanta.  The Universalists had a presence in the Georgia countryside, but had not established a presence in any urban city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1879 |title=Georgia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trf4cCtHDAAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:EP9S8WECe6EC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyiY2R1snZAhWQ8oMKHZm4BuYQ6AEIKTAA#v=thumbnail&amp;q&amp;f=false |magazine=Universalist Register with the Usual Astronomical Tables and a Counting House Almanac for 1879 |location=Boston, MA |publisher= Universalist Publishing House|access-date=May 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bowman's missionary work continued until 1881 when he severed his connection with the Universalists and joined the city's spiritualism movement.  Rev. D.B. Clayton, who had moved to Atlanta from his South Carolina home to assist Bowman, continued services until the summer of 1882.  Afterwards there was no active Universalist presence in the city.  Also in 1882, the Unitarians began active missionary work in Atlanta that provided Universalists a temporary religious home.

==== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Work 1895 - 1918 ====
In 1895, emboldened by their apparent success in Harriman, the Y.P.C.U. turned its attention to Atlanta, Georgia.  Three ministers were recruited to raise a Universalist church in Atlanta: Rev. Shinn, then the new Y.P.C.U. National Organizer, Rev. D.B. Clayton, who had been involved in the city's initial missionary work and Rev. McGlauflin, the Y.P.C.U. Southern Missionary and former Harriman pastor. They succeeded and established [[First Universalist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|First Universalist Church of Atlanta]] in 1895 with  Rev. McGlauflin becoming the first pastor of the new church.

In 1897, to encourage fund raising for a new church building, the Y.P.C.U. pledged to raise $4.00 for each dollar raised by Atlanta's Universalists.  The Y.P.C.U. was also instrumental in retiring the $2,500 mortgage on the building lot. On July 15, 1900, the Universalists dedicated a new church building at 16 East Harris Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Universalist Church is To Be Dedicated Today |work=The Atlanta Constitution |location=Atlanta, Georgia |date=Jul 15, 1900 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Y.P.C.U. invested over $16,000 in the Atlanta effort and subsequently transferred the property deed to the Georgia Universalist convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=197 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. W.H. McGlauflin remained pastor of the Atlanta church for nine years. He resigned in 1904 to become the superintendent the Universalist churches in Minnesota.  After Rev. McGlauflin most pastorates lasted between one and two years. The only exception was the pastorate of Rev. E. Dean Ellenwood who served the church from 1905 to 1913.

Despite the growth of Atlanta's population, the Atlanta Universalist congregation remained small.

==== Denouement ====
Driven by the general weakness of Atlanta's two liberal churches, the Unitarians and Universalists merged in 1918. The combined congregation, named the Liberal Christian Church, chose the Unitarian church building on West Peachtree Street as their common home.  The Universalist church on East Harris Street was sold in April 1920.  The Unitarian-Universalist congregation continued until 1951 when the congregation collapsed.

In 1952, the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America renewed efforts in Atlanta.  A new church called the United Liberal Church was established in 1954 and witnessed rapid growth.  The church was later renamed the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta.

=== St. Paul, Minnesota ===
Shortly after the dedication of the Atlanta church, at its 1901 Rochester Convention  the Y.P.C.U. selected St. Paul, Minnesota and Little Rock, Arkansas as their next missionary projects. Like Atlanta, St. Paul had seen earlier Universalist missionary activity that was unable to sustain a permanent presence.

==== Missionary Work 1865 - 1879 ====
The First Universalist Society of St. Paul was incorporated in 1865. Rev. Herman A. Bisbee briefly served as the society's first minister before he accepted a call in November 1866 to the Universalist church in nearby St. Anthony, Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uudb.org/articles/hermanbisbee.html |title=Herman Bisbee|author=Charles A. Howe |date=Nov 25, 2007 |website=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography| publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the First Universalist Society of St. Paul continued to operate.

In June 1866 the society purchased land on Wabasha Street.  In October 1867 ground for a new church was broken and by January 1869 the basement of the building was sufficiently completed to allow services to be held.  The building was completed and formally dedicated October 1, 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Castle |first=Henry A. |date=1912 |title=History of St. Paul and Vicinity A Chronicle of Progress and a Narrative Account of the Industries, Institutions and People of the City and its Tributary Territory  |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofstpaulv02cast/historyofstpaulv02cast_djvu.txt |dead-url= |location=Chicago and New York |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company|pages=519 |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society, however, was unable to sustain operations. In 1879 The ''Universalist Register'' began listing the St. Paul society as dormant.

The Universalist church property was sold in 1881 to the French Catholics also known as the St. Louis Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Castle |first=Henry A. |date=1912 |title=History of St. Paul and Vicinity A Chronicle of Progress and a Narrative Account of the Industries, Institutions and People of the City and its Tributary Territory  |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofstpaulv02cast/historyofstpaulv02cast_djvu.txt |dead-url= |location=Chicago and New York |publisher=The Lewis Publishing Company|pages=519 |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the St. Paul Universalist society virtually disappeared.

==== Missionary Work 1886 - 1893 ====
In early 1886, the society was revived when Rev. L.D. Boynton from Minneapolis conducted Sunday services in an old Baptist Church on Wacouta Street two to three times a month.  In December in that same year, Rev. W.S. Vail assumed the pastorate of the small St. Paul society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=To-Day In The Churches |work=The Saint Paul Globe |location=Saint Paul, Minnesota |date=Dec 5, 1886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rev. Vail's seven-year ministry significantly raised the fortunes of the Universalists.  Upon Rev. Vail's resignation in November 1893, ''The Universalist Register'' yearbook showed that the once moribund society now counted 125 families among its flock.

With Rev. Vail's departure, the society once again experienced a period of near dormancy.  From 1895 to 1900, ''The Universalist Register'' showed either no minister or simply dropped the society from its inventory of churches.  However, based on a review of newspaper announcements in the ''St. Paul Globe'' during this period, the Ladies Aid Society of the First Universalist Church continued to hold the small liberal community together.

==== Missionary Work 1898 ====
A prelude to another revival of the St. Paul society occurred in the summer of 1898.  While on his summer break from his pastorate of the Atlanta Unitarian church, Rev.

A hopeful sign was that even without a permanent minister, local Universalists had raised a “goodly sum” of money to establish a permanent Universalist presence in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Church My Reorganize |work=The Saint Paul Globe |location=Saint Paul, Minnesota |date=Aug 14, 1898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Work 1901 - 1916 ====
Following the selection of St. Paul as a missionary project, the Y.P.C.U. organ ''Onward'' announced on August 6, 1901 that Rev. Henry B. Taylor had accepted the pastorate to the fledgling St. Paul society.  Unioners were implored to support this new missionary project.  “Unless every member of our Union consecrates himself as a helper by a Two-Cents-a-Week pledge….the good work will not hasten forward as we desire.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Staff Writer |first= |date=Aug 6, 1901 |title=And They Helped, Every One His Neighbor |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6apw;view=1up;seq=257 |magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |pages=1 (249)|publisher= |access-date=Mar 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Rev. Taylor's pastorate (1901 – 1908) the Y.P.C.U. provided funds for the minister's salary, helped reduce the churches indebtedness and raised additional funds for the purchase of church property at the corner of Ashland and Mackubin.  In 1909 the Y.P.C.U. held their convention at the larger the Church of the Redeemer in Minneapolis.  The Unioners traveled to St. Paul for the dedication of the new church now under the pastorate of Rev. Thomas S. Robjent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bisbee |first=Frederick A. |date=1914 |title= Young People’s Christian Union of the Universalist Church Sourenir Program and Miniature History 1889 Lynn-Boston 1914|url= https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044016958241;view=1up;seq=7

Over the course of their missionary effort in St.Paul, the Y.P.C.U. contributed more than $16,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970

==== Denouement ====
In 1916, the Y.P.C.U. executive board voted to transfer the oversight of the St. Paul church to the trustees of the Universalist General Convention.  The General Convention, in turn, requested that the Y.P.C.U. assume missionary responsibilities for the Los Angeles, California church.  This exchange ended the Y.P.C.U involvement with St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970

=== Little Rock, Arkansas ===
As noted earlier, the Unioners at their 1901 Rochester Convention had selected St. Paul and Little Rock as their missionary projects.

==== Missionary Work 1895 - 1901 ====
Five years prior to the Y.P.C.U. intervention in 1896, Rev. Shinn had conducted missionary work in Little Rock. Shinn's missionary work typically focused on establishing Universalist structures such as a Sunday school and Ladies Universalist Society as a prelude to placing a permanent minister.  Notices posted in the ''Daily Arkansas Gazette'' showed that Universalist Sunday school was regularly held in 1899 in rented space at the Congregational Church at the corner of Eleventh and Main Streets.

==== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Work 1901 - 1915 ====
In 1902, Rev. F.L. Carrier was recruited by the Y.P.C.U. to serve as minister to the Little Rock church&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Staff Writer |first= |date=Jan 18, 1902 |title=Editorial |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6app;view=1up;seq=26 |magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |pages=20|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the church had 29 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Universalist Pastor |work=Arkansas Democrat |location=Little Rock, Arkansas |date=Mar 8, 1902| page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Y.P.C.U. also committed to contributing $500 a year to the pastor's salary.

Rev. Carrier held regular Sunday services in the rented space in the Congregational Church on Eleventh and Main until December 1903 when the Congregational Church sold the building to the Universalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Universalist Church Property Sold |work=Arkansas Democrat |location=Little Rock, Arkansas |date=Dec 3, 1903| page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, newspaper articles referred to this building as the Universalist Church on Eleventh and Main.

In 1904, Rev. Carrier resigned and was succeeded by Rev. Athalia Lizzie Johnson Irwin an Arkansas native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970|url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=198 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rev. Athalia L.J. Irwin was born in 1862 to the Baptist faith, but left that denomination by July 1898.  Befriending Rev. Q.H. Shinn she was encouraged to became a Universalist minister. Her first church in Pensacola, Florida ordained her in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uuhhs.org/womens-history/notable-women-biographies/notable-women-i-k/ |title=Athalia Lizzie Johnson Irwin (1862-1915) Universalist |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society| publisher=Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1904, she left her Pensacola church to assume the pastorate in Little Rock.

The Y.P.C.U. continued its financial support by providing money for the minister's salary and $6,000 toward a building fund. In 1905 a small chapel was constructed at the corner of Thirteenth and Center Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=199 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chapel became known as the Cottage Chapel.

Rev. Athalia L.J. Irwin was a gifted writer and orator.  The local newspaper  frequently printed summaries of her sermons with titles such as ''The God We Believe In'' and ''The Bible We Accept''. However, she garnered the most press coverage when she challenged her brother, Rev. M. Gray Johnson, a Baptist minister from Ohio to a debate in the Cottage Chapel.  When debating the topic “The Christ We Would Follow,” Rev. Irwin energetically rejected the doctrine of the Trinity “as unreasonable and as something which Christ never meant to imply.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Interest in Debate|work=Arkansas Democrat |location=Little Rock, Arkansas |date=Jun 30, 1906| page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to emphasis God's love and that God “wills that not any should perish, but that all should come to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.”

In spite of her many talents, the Little Rock church remained small. When Rev. Irwin departed in September 1908, there were fewer than 40 members.   The Universalist State Superintendent Rev. G.E. Cunningham filled the empty pulpit, vowing to remain until a successor was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Former Pastor in the City |work=Arkansas Democrat |location=Little Rock, Arkansas |date=Oct 18, 1908| page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rev. Cunningham continued to provide pastoral services to the small society until he moved to Illinois in late 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Universalist Leader to Speak Here Today|work=Arkansas Democrat |location=Little Rock, Arkansas |date=Dec 15, 1912| page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. H.C. Ledyard succeeded Cunningham and remained as the pastor for three years, departing in December 1915.  Lay members and guest speakers conducted Sunday services for several years, .  By mid 1919, Sunday services  ceased. The Cottage Chapel, now referred to as the First Universalist Church, was only being used as rental space for third party events.

==== Denouement ====
By 1922, there was no mention of the First Universalist church in local newspapers. The church property was sold in 1930.  In 1950, a new Universalist society was established and became known as the Unitarian Universalist Church of Little Rock.

=== Chattanooga, Tennessee ===
In 1909 the Y.P.C.U. turned its missionary zeal toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was the last major church building effort by the youth group.

==== Missionary Work 1895 - 1908 ====
As early as 1895 Rev. McGlauflin, the Southern Missionary in Harriman, Tennessee had visited Chattanooga, but no permanent church was founded. Rev. Q.H. Shinn, who visited Chattanooga just a few months prior to his death in September 1907, launched a new church in that city chartered with 32 members.  For 17 months the new church was without a permanent minister.  Atlanta's Rev. E. Dean Ellenwood, the Universalist General Superintendent, Rev. H.W. McGlauflin and other ministers offered temporary preaching services.

In late November 1908 under the direction of McGlauflin, Rev. L.R. Robinson was installed as the joint pastor for the Harriman and Chattanooga churches. Since there was a parsonage in Harriman, that city was selected as the pastor's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Evans |first=Dr. A.L. |date=Mar 29, 1910 |title=Historical Sketch of the Universalist Church in Chattanooga, Tenn|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6arx;view=1up;seq=106 |magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |pages=100–101|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was born into a Methodist Episcopal family but came to Universalism through his reading of the Bible. “I found so many Scriptural passages that seemed to clearly teach the final harmony of all souls with God.” Robinson requested Universalist literature from the Post Office Mission and later met Rev. H.W. McGlauflin. Encouraged by McGlauflin, Robinson, in the fall of 1908, accepted a position to serve the Universalist churches in Harriman and Chattanooga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Robinson |first=Rev. L.R. |date=Mar 29, 1910 |title=How I Came Into the Universalist Church and Ministry |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6arx;view=1up;seq=105 |magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |pages=99–101|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Y.P.C.U. Missionary Work 1909 - 1917 ====
Robinson provided Sunday service two times a month in Chattanooga. Under his ministry membership grew and financial obligations were addressed. In February 1910, the Y.P.C.U. selected Rev. L. R. Robinson as their “consecrated missionary” in Chattanooga and Robinson moved to that city accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Staff Writer |first= |date=Feb 8, 1910|title=Minssionary Work of the National Y.P.C.U.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6arx;view=1up;seq=49 |magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=43|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the time that Robinson was exploring fellowship with the Universalists, Chattanooga became the focal point of a multi-year search for a site to build a church to honor Rev. Q.H. Shinn who had died in late 1907.  Southern Universalists quickly established the Shinn Memorial Association to raise funds for the construction of a church in a southern state to commemorate Shinn's southern missionary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.hds.harvard.edu/exhibits/featured-images/first-universalist-shinn-memorial-church-chattanooga-tennessee |title=First Universalist (Shinn Memorial) Church (Chattanooga, Tennessee) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Andover-Harvard Theological Library| publisher=Harvard Divinity School |access-date=Feb 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection process continued for several years with the Y.P.C.U. supporting Chattanooga.

In 1911, four possible locations for the construction of a Shinn Memorial church were discussed at the General Convention: Houston, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Chattanooga, Tennessee and Rocky Mount, North Carolina.  At the convention the Y.P.C.U. continued its support for Chattanooga arguing that it was in this city  “where the Union is supporting a promising mission.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Board of Trustees|first= |date=1911 |title=The Dr. Shinn Memorial |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb4qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA109&amp;dq=%22shinn+memorial%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoKGUooDaAhXr4IMKHWrWD2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shinn%20memorial%22&amp;f=false |magazine=Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Universalist General Convention |location=Boston |pages=109–110|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 1914 it was announced that Chattanooga had been selected at the site for the Shinn Memorial Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Board of Trustees|first= |date=1915 |title=The Doctor Shinn Memorial |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb4qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA109&amp;dq=%22shinn+memorial%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoKGUooDaAhXr4IMKHWrWD2EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20doctor%20shinn%20memorial%22&amp;f=false |magazine=Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Universalist General Convention |location=Boston |pages=27–28|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, a front-page article in the August 1, 1914 edition of ''Onward'', Unioners were implored “Let the slogan ‘Chattanooga and Work’ be ours for the coming year.  This Y.P.C.U. ‘Chattanooga and Work’ campaign was designed to raise the thousands of dollars still needed for the Shinn Memorial Church building fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=199 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Services were first held in the new Shinn Memorial Church in the summer 1916. The church was dedicated during the 1917 Y.P.C.U. convention held in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=348 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the construction of the new church, one of Shinn's lifetime ambitions was finally realized.  In 1917, a School of Evangelism was opened.  The goal of the school was to provide ministerial training to those who were unable to attend regular Universalist theological schools.  The school continued to operate until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=348 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also became the headquarters in 1919 for the Southern Universalist Young People's Institute. The institute's summer programs were designed to train workers for service in Sunday schools, young people's societies and missionary work.  A year later the Y.P.C.U. turned over its roll in the institute to the Universalist's Women's National Missionary Association (WNMA).  In 1925 when the pastor of the Chattanooga church, Rev. George A. Gay, moved to Camp Hill, Alabama, he took the institute with him.  The institute, however, returned to Chattanooga in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|page=348 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denouement====
In spite of starting with a surplus of funds after the church was built, the congregation frequently had financial trouble and had to depend on denominational aid. It had trouble finding and keeping good ministers, and its lay leadership was frequently divided. In its final years, it ignored the interest in establishing a Unitarian fellowship in Chattanooga. By 1951, there were only four active members, and services were suspended. The congregation is last listed in the Universalist Directory for 1956 - 1957.

== Post Office Mission ==
Within three years of its formation in 1892 at  their Reading, Pennsylvania convention, Rev. Shinn urged the Y.P.C.U. to organize a Post Office Mission.  The Post Office Mission was designed to supplement the influence of Universalist ministers and the denomination's  periodicals.  In a front-page article in the February 1895 edition of ''Onward'' it was argued that, “The voice of the minister is heard but a few feet from the pulpit, and the message of the denomination through our papers reaches almost exclusively those who are already acquainted with the message, and is even reaching too few of them. To extend the light into the dark places and to proclaim the gospel of our church where hitherto no voice has been raised in its behalf is the sphere of this mission.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Harry L. |date=Feb 1, 1895 |title=The Post Office Mission|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah67sr;view=1up;seq=7|magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=1|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Post Office Mission was primarily organized at a local level.  Local societies were tasked with identifying names for mailings with the national organization providing oversight coordination.

Understanding the opportunities inherent in the 1895 Atlanta Cotton Exposition and 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition, booths were secured by the Post Office Mission at both events to distribute literature and collect names for the mailing list.

The Atlanta Cotton Exposition coincided with the resumption of missionary work in Atlanta and the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission embarked on a “Shall We Bombard Atlanta?” campaign. “From all over the South people are gathering, and in the month of December the exposition grounds will be thronged.  How can we reach this multitude and plant in their minds some seed of Universalist philosophy?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Staff Writer |first= |date=Nov 15, 1895 |title=Shall We Bombard Atlanta? |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah67sr;view=1up;seq=172|magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=166|publisher= |access-date=Jan 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was literature distributed at the Exposition booth, but 187 names were also added to the Post Office Mission mailing list. 
 
The Post Office Mission relied on local Y.P.C.U. societies not only to maintain mailing lists but to cover the cost of postage and other distribution expenses. To defray their overall cost, the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission relied on the Universalist Publishing House to provide the literature at little or no cost.  The cost for the production of the literature having been covered by a bequest from the late entertainer and showman, P.T. Barnum, and other donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Harry L. |date=Feb 1, 1895 |title=The Post Office Mission|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah67sr;view=1up;seq=7|magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=1|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national level Post Office Mission leadership encouraged local Unions to maintain literature tables or racks in the vestibule of their churches.  Local societies were additionally encouraged to find public places such as railway stations where literature could be made available to the public.  Unioners were implored that “Through the Post Office Mission everyone who takes up the work becomes a heralder of the truth.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Harry L. |date=Feb 1, 1895 |title=The Post Office Mission|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah67sr;view=1up;seq=7|magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=1|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest and support for the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission declined by the earlier 1920s,.   Contributing to the decline was the continued need for local funds and the inability to concretely measure the Post Office Mission's success. The national level Post Office Mission Superintendent Clifford R. Stetson noted in October 1920 that “the Post Office Mission could not be measured in definite terms.” He went on to recommend that the function of the Post Office Mission “to sow the seed, trusting that the fruit would follow” be transferred to another department called the Union-at-Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Stetson |first=Clifford R. |date=Oct 1, 1920 |title=Report on The Post Office Mission|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah6as3;view=1up;seq=252
|magazine=Onward The Official Organ of the Young People's Christian Union |location=Boston and Chicago |page=246|publisher= |access-date=Mar 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Union at Large had been formed in 1892 to support Universalist youth in areas where no local Y.P.C.U. chapter had been formed.  Following the transfer, the Y.P.C.U. Post Office Mission ceased to exist.

== Decline and Merger ==
The 41st annual Y.P.C.U. convention held in the United Liberal Church of Atlanta, a joint Unitarian-Universalist congregation, was “one of tension and crisis from beginning to end.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association | page=203 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The youth group faced shrinking membership, increasing deficits, an uncertain future for ''Onward'' and needed to answer the question of merger with the Unitarian Young People's Religious Union (Y.P.R.U.).

The problem with ''Onward'' was addressed by changing its format back to a monthly magazine with a four-page limit focused on news bulletins and less on “abstract articles…little read and little needed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association | page=204 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action was taken with considerable opposition to change the convention from an annual to a biennial format. In 1933 the Y.P.C.U. had its lowest individual membership of less than 2,000 with less than 100 local unions and only 10 junior unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association | page=203 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the early 1930s Max A. Kapp president of the Universalist's Y.P.C.U. and Dana Greeley president of the Unitarian Y.P.R.U. discussed a merger or federation of the two groups. However, no action was taken until the Unitarians made an overt offer to merge in 1935. Opposition was  strong within the Y.P.C.U. It was argued that the Unitarian Y.P.R.U was no better equipped to address youth needs.  The Universalists voted to defer action for another year. The deferral period actually continued for many years with no definitive merger action being taken during World War II (1941-1945.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association | page=211 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universalist Youth Fellowship (UYF) ===
The Y.P.C.U. continued an internal examination. In 1941 at the poorly attended Y.P.C.U. convention in Oak Park, Illinois, the youth group reorganized as the Universalist Youth Fellowship (UYF).  The re-organized youth group introduced several changes.  Its membership focus was narrowed to youth between 13 and 25.  The new organization would no longer appeal to state unions for funding. Rather, funding would be based on investment income and other funds raised by the Universalist Church of America Unified Appeal.

Manpower demands from World War II significantly diminished the UYF leadership ranks that came primarily from those preparing for the ministry at Tufts College. Work with youth and students understandably came to a virtual standstill.  The UYF budget for 1943-1944 was just $3,300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Arnason |first1= Wayne E | last2= Scott |first2= Rebecca |date=1985 |title= We Would Be One |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqSKTwsSk6AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22universalist+youth+fellowship%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAwv2Zk4vaAhWh2YMKHWRdBEIQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22universalist%20youth%20fellowship%22&amp;f=false |location=Boston, MA |publisher= Skinner House Books | pages=52–53|isbn=1-55896-488-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite demurring on the 1935 proposal to merge, the Universalist and Unitarian youth did act jointly.  In late 1945 they cooperated on the publication on two small magazine-size digests called ''Youth for Action'' that focused on social service. In the fall of 1945, as the bi-monthly publication of ''Onward'' came to an end, they also conducted a two-year experiment with a joint publication called ''The Young Liberal''.  This post war Universalist – Unitarian publication became a platform supporting relief efforts in devastated European countries. The publication regularly contained appeals to feed starving Czech and Dutch people and photographs of students rebuilding Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Arnason |first1= Wayne E | last2= Scott |first2= Rebecca |date=1985 |title= We Would Be One |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqSKTwsSk6AC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22universalist+youth+fellowship%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAwv2Zk4vaAhWh2YMKHWRdBEIQ6AEINzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22universalist%20youth%20fellowship%22&amp;f=false |location=Boston, MA |publisher= Skinner House Books | page=61|isbn=1-55896-488-6|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947 the Universalists withdrew their support from the magazine that then had only 200 subscribers.

The Universalists in that same year turned their attention to the publication of ''The Youth Leader''.  The publication changed formats several times but lasted three years beyond the formal merger of the Universalists and Unitarians in 1961.

=== Liberal Religious Youth (LRY) ===
Ten years prior to the merger of the Universalists and Unitarians, the two denominational youth groups took final steps toward merger at a convention held in 1951 at Lake Winnepesaukee, New Hampshire.  Three years later, in 1953, the two youth groups completed the merger discussions started in 1935 and formed the Liberal Religious Youth (LRY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Russell E |date=1985 |title= The Larger Hope, The Second Century of the Universalist Church in America, 1870-1970 |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association | page=211 |isbn=0-933840-00-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU) ===
After the merger in 1961 of the American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church of America, LRY was re-organized as the Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU).

Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the [[China Central Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1991. His work deals with subjects of [[contemporary art]].

==Background==
Zhu Yu is often termed the most controversial and criticized artist in China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His contemporary performance art raises questions about moral agendas, and draws an audience through its shock value. His artwork often encompasses the human body.  He is categorized by some critics as an artist of the “cadaver school,” which consists of artists who tend to use human body parts in their work.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4488657|title=Violent Capital: Zhu Yu on File|first=Meiling|last=Cheng|date=2 October 2018|journal=TDR (1988-)|volume=49|issue=3|pages=58–77|accessdate=2 October 2018|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu's most famous piece of [[conceptual art]], titled "Eating People," was performed at a [[Shanghai]] [[arts festival]] in 2000. It consisted of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a [[human]] [[fetus]].&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara. (June 19, 2001).

Images from the piece have also been used in anti-Chinese propaganda, disseminated by e-mail with a short text attached explaining the images show China's "hottest food" and that dead fetuses can be bought for 10-12,000 Yen (approximately US$100 - US$120). Recipients are encouraged to forward the mail, and the explanatory text is written in both English and Korean script.

==Exhibitions==
Zhu Yu has been involved in many group exhibitions including Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion in Beijing (January 1999), and The Third Guangzhou Triennial in Guangzhou (September 2008), which involved 181 artists from 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29575/third-guangzhou-triennial/|title=Third Guangzhou Triennial|author=Charles LaBelle|work=[[Artinfo]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Most notable is his work at the [[Fuck Off (art exhibition)|Fuck Off]] Exhibit curated by [[Ai Weiwei]] and [[Feng Boyi]] in Shanghai, 2000. This controversial exhibit hosted 48 contemporary avant-garde artists. This is where his most controversial piece of performance art “Eating People” appeared. Among his other solo exhibitions are Plaything (Long March Space, Beijing 2010) and Leftover (Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing, 2007).

==Significant Works==
'''The Foundation of All Epistemology''': This work appeared in the 1998 group exhibition ''It’s All Right'' in Shanghai. For this piece, Zhu Yu cut and boiled five human brains which were purchased from a local hospital. He placed them in neatly labeled jars that he then signed with his own name. Zhu put these jars of brains up for sale in a market that sponsored the exhibit. He ended up selling 15 bottles each for the price of 98 yuans.

'''Eating People''': In his performance art piece Eating People, Zhu photographs himself cooking and eating a human fetus that he divided into five parts. Zhu says that “I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” &lt;ref&gt;Fuck Off! Please, 2000; Ai Weiwei, Feng Boyi&lt;/ref&gt; In further response to Zhu’s bold performance, The Ministry of Culture cited a menace to social order and the spiritual health of the Chinese people, and banned exhibitions involving culture, animal abuse, corpses, and overt violence and sexuality.&lt;ref name="录像作品《朱昱侮辱尸体案》文字记录"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New China, new art; Munich ; New York : Prestel, c2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this piece did not even appear at the exhibit; The night before the exhibition, Ai Weiwei collaborated with Zhu and the photographs were removed from the gallery. This piece was thought particularly controversial, and organizers did not want to risk government censorship for the rest of the exhibit. The response to this work stemmed from its appearance on the internet shortly after. ''Eating People'' appeared in Malaysia's ''Perdan Weekly'' without caption and generated the question of whether eating babies was accepted in Asia on various myth-debunking websites.

'''Pocket Theology''': Appearing in the 1999 group exhibition ''Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion'' in Beijing, curated by Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling rope was gripped by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook.  This display was held in a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organize the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.

'''Skin Graft''':&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Chinese Art: Primary Documents, New York : Museum of Modern Art ; Durham, N.C. : Distributed by Duke University Press, c2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This performance art installation appeared in the 2000 exhibition ''Infatuation with Injury'' organized by Li Xianting. In the exhibit, Zhu uses his own flesh as a canvas. Photos were shown of trunk of a quartered pig lying on a hospital bed. Zhu grafted a piece of his own skin onto a section of damaged skin from the pig. Two photos of this process appeared in the exhibit; one that showed the surgical process, and another which featured the artist sewing his own skin onto the pig carcass. Zhu stood by the exhibit and lifted his shirt to show the scar which stood as evidence of the procedure.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

'''Leftover''': This series was exhibited by the Xin Beijing Art Gallery at the China International Gallery Exposition.  Zhu photographed plates that held bits of leftover food, and then painted those images on canvas with oil. Eight paintings appeared at the Xin Beijing Art Gallery.

==Recent Works==

Zhu Yu’s most recent works follow his ideas with the Leftover exhibit, in which he paints highly detailed portraits of mundane objects. His series “Stain,” features a bird’s-eye view of teacups that contain the dregs of tea leaves. The next series, “Pebble,” appeared at Zhu’s solo exhibition ''Play Thing'', at the [http://www.longmarchspace.com/index.html Long March Space] in Beijing, 2010. This is another series of highly detailed, realistic paintings that show individual pebbles, each featuring a slightly different hue or shape. This work implies that all life can be reduced to a pebble, a simple object from which much meaning can be derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longmarchspace.com/artist/list_8_brief.html?locale=en_US|title=LONG MARCH SPACE|work=longmarchspace.com|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
