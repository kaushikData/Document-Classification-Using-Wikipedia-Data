The '''1997 Central European flood''' or the '''1997 Oder Flood''' of the [[Oder River|Oder]] and [[Morava (river)|Morava river]] basins in July 1997 affected [[Poland]], [[Germany]], and the [[Czech Republic]], taking the lives of about 114 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9707/27/germany.floods/|title=Third dike bursts in flood-hit Germany|publisher=CNN|date=25 July 1997|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the Czech Republic and Poland) and causing material damages estimated at $4.5 billion (3.8 billion euros in the Czech Republic and Poland and 330 million euros in Germany). The flooding began in the Czech Republic, then spread to Poland and Germany.

==Causes==
Southwestern Poland and the northern Czech Republic experienced two periods of extensive rainfall, the first occurring 3–10 July and the second 17–22 July.&lt;ref name="VasilʹevOrganization2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Studien und Tagungsberichte, Schriftenreihe des Landesumweltamtes Brandenburg. Band 16 - Das Sommerhochwasser an der Oder 1997 - Fachbeiträge anläßlich der Brandenburger Ökologietage II. Potsdam. Marz 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The precipitation was caused by a [[Genoa low]] pressure system, which moved from northern Italy to [[Moravia]] and Poland. The unusual development occurred when the field of higher air pressure between the Azores Islands and Scandinavia was blocked. The center of the low pressure remained over southern Poland for a long period.&lt;ref name="VasilʹevOrganization2007"&gt;Zbigniew W. Kundzewicz. Summer 1997 Flood in Poland in Perspective. In {{cite book|author1=Oleg Fedorovich Vasilʹev|author2=North Atlantic Treaty Organization|author3=E. J. Plate|author4=M. V. Bolgov|title=Extreme Hydrological Events: New Concepts for Security|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntbLv5KAYH8C&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=5 March 2011|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5740-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precipitation was very high, measuring {{Convert|300|-|600|mm|in}}, and corresponded to several months' average rainfall over a few days.&lt;ref name="GruntfestHandmer2001"/&gt; The waters rose 2–3&amp;nbsp;m above the previously recorded averages&lt;ref name="GruntfestHandmer2001"/&gt; and were so high that they flooded over standing measurement poles. It was one of the heaviest rainfalls in the recorded world's history.&lt;ref name="PettsAmoros1996"/&gt; It was dubbed the Millennium Flood because the likelihood of such a flood in a particular year was estimated at 0.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} Przemysław Berg, [http://www.polityka.pl/kraj/analizy/1503594,2,czy-grozi-nam-powodz.read Czy grozi nam powódź: Widmo Wielkiej Wody], ''Polityka'', 21 lutego 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floods==
[[File:Stary Dwor (pow. Wolowski)-powodz 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Exit sign from village of [[Stary Dwór, Wołów County]], Poland]]
Flooding began on July 5 in the Czech Republic and spread to Poland on July 6. Those early floods were very rapid [[flash floods]] (water levels rose by up to four meters in half a day).&lt;ref name="VasilʹevOrganization2007"/&gt; In Poland, the first towns flooded were located around [[Głuchołazy]], and were visited by Polish Prime Minister [[Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz]] on July 7.&lt;ref name="PettsAmoros1996"/&gt; Flooding spread rapidly from [[Chałupki, Racibórz County|Chałupki]] to [[Racibórz]]. In [[Kłodzko]] several buildings dating back a few hundred years ([[kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]]) collapsed; on 8 July the flood reached [[Krapkowice]]. In the second stage of the flood, the flood wave flowed down through the Oder river, submerging successive towns in the area.&lt;ref name="VasilʹevOrganization2007"/&gt; Left-bank [[Opole]] was flooded on July 10, [[Wrocław]] and [[Rybnik]] on July 12, and [[Głogów]] soon after. The rising waters slowed by the time they reached the Polish-German border (the [[Oder-Neisse line]]), allowing more time for preparations; the damages were thus much lower.&lt;ref name="VasilʹevOrganization2007"/&gt;

On 18 July, Polish president [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] declared a day of national mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP19970420423 Zarządzenie Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 15 lipca 1997 r. w sprawie opuszczenia flagi państwowej Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej].

==Career==
Ben Pollner held various positions in industrial companies until joining the Steuber Corporation in 1970 when he commenced his international marketing, transport and trading activities in the bulk petrochemical industry. In the 1990s, he worked for [[David B.

'''Bentwood''' objects are those made by wetting wood (either by soaking or by steaming), then bending it and letting it harden into curved shapes and patterns.

In furniture making this method is often used in the production of [[rocking chair]]s, cafe chairs, and other light furniture. The iconic [[No. 14 chair]] by [[Gebrüder Thonet|Thonet]] is a well-known design based on the technique. The process is in widespread use for making casual and informal furniture of all types, particularly seating and table forms. It is also a popular technique in the worldwide production of furniture with frames made of heavy cane, which is commonly imported into European and Western shops.

'''Bentwood boxes''' are a traditional item made by the [[First Nations]] people of the North American west coast including the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Gitxsan people|Gitxsan]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Tsimshian people|Tsimshian]], [[Alutiiq people|Sugpiaq]], [[Aleut people|Unangax]], [[Yupik peoples|Yup'ik]], [[Inupiat people|Inupiaq]] and [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]. These boxes are generally made out of one piece of wood that is steamed and bent to form a box. Traditional uses of the boxes was varied and included storage of food goods, clothing and for burial. They were often without decoration while others were decorated elaborately. Today many are made for collectors and can be purchased from museums, gift shops and online sites as well as directly commissioned from the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasures Gallery - Bentwood storage boxes|publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]|url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/treasure/237eng.shtml|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haida Gwaii … "Islands of the People"|publisher= [[Haida Heritage Centre]]|url=http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014557/1100100014563 |date=2010-09-15|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Online: Bentwood|publisher=[[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]]|url=http://collection-online.moa.ubc.ca/collection-online/search?keywords=bentwood|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Haida Art|author=George MacDonald|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aleut people|Aleut or Unangan People]] of Alaska made [[Unangan hunting headgear|hunting visors]], called ''chagudax'', out of driftwood using the bentwood method. The visors were used by hunters who were in kayaks. They are said to help keep the sea spray off the face as well as improve hearing. They were often decorated with paints, beads, sea lion whiskers and ivory figurines. [[Andrew Gronholdt]] is credited with reviving the art of chagudax carving in the 1980s. Present day Unangan artists create chagudax for ceremonial purposes and offer them for sale to the public as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska Native Collections Smithsonian Institution|url=http://alaska.si.edu/record.asp?id=18|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Aleut Art of Making Bentwood Visors Showcased at Anchorage Museum |url=http://articles.ktuu.com/2012-03-09/hat_31141973 |accessdate=14 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721033108/http://articles.ktuu.com/2012-03-09/hat_31141973 |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">'''Bursa Merinos Energy Museum''' ({{lang-tr|Bursa Merinos Enerji Müzesi}}) is a [[technology museum]] dedicated to electricity, which was  established in 2012 in the defunct power plant of an abandoned textile factory in [[Bursa]], northwestern  Turkey.

The museum is situated at {{coord|40|12|03|N|29|03|03|E}} on Dr. Sadık Ahmet Boulevard in [[Osmangazi]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-sehir.com/turkiye-haritasi/merinos-enerji-muzesi-nerede-nasil-gidilir.html Map page ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Merinos factory was one of the state-owned factories established in 1938. It was a textile factory using the wool of [[merino]]. With additions in 1944 and 1946 it became the biggest factory of its kind in Balkan and Mideastern countries. However, in 2004 the factory was closed within the scope of privatization program. Its {{convert|314369|m2}} land lot together  with the infrastructure was handed over to the Bursa Metropolitan Municipality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcivelekoglu.blogspot.com.tr/2013/11/83-yil-once-bugun-bursa-merinos.html 83 years  bursa page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;	

The factory had its own energy plant with a ground area of {{convert|3200|m2}}. On 7 September 2012, the municipality established an energy museum. In the museum, the role of electricity in the civilization is emphasized. The history of electricity in the World, in Turkey and in Bursa, the illumination gadgets and the production of electricity are shown by the photographs and animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bursamerinosenerjimuzesi.com/?page_id=5 Merinos pge {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cheapium''' is a term used for several theoretically stable binary [[platinum-group]] combinations sifted from thousands of potential platinum-group compounds using [[supercomputers]], databases, and algorithms. By using theories on how atoms interact with model chemical structures to automate new compounds testing, years of laboratory research and money can be potentially saved to discover cheaper (thus the name Cheapium) alternatives to expensive currently known platinum based compounds. The term was coined by [[materials scientist]] [[Stefano Curtarolo]] as a mixture of inexpensive elements (cheap) having chemical, physical or structural property equivalent to an expensive and rare element (Expensium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/platinum_aint_cheap_cheapium_could_be-127164|title=Platinum Ain't Cheap But 'Cheapium' Could Be|date=January 3, 2014|work=[[Science 2.0]]|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratt.duke.edu/news/supercomputers-join-search-cheapium|title=Supercomputers Join Search for 'Cheapium'|last=Kingery|first=ken|date=January 3, 2014|work=[[Duke University]]|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/using-supercomputers-in-the-hunt-for-cheapium|title=Using supercomputers in the hunt for ‘cheapium’|date=January 6, 2014|work=[[KurzweilAI]]|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Locomotive ChS4-109 2012 G1.jpg|thumb|Electric locomotive '''Škoda ChS4-109.''' The [[Moscow]] — [[Odesa|Odessa]] train in [[Vinnytsia]] railway station.]]
[[File:ÖBB 1216.233.JPG|thumb|The [[Eurosprinter|Siemens ES64U4]], is the current confirmed holder as the fastest electric locomotive at {{convert|357|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 2006.]]

An '''electric locomotive''' is a [[locomotive]] powered by [[electricity]] from [[overhead line]]s, a [[third rail]] or on-board energy storage such as a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or a [[supercapacitor]].

Electric locomotives with on-board fueled [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]s, such as [[diesel engine]]s or [[gas turbine]]s, are classed as [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] or [[Turbine-electric transmission|gas turbine-electric]] and not as electric locomotives, because the electric generator/motor combination serves only as a [[Transmission (mechanics)|power transmission system]].

Electric locomotives benefit from the high efficiency of electric motors, often above 90% (not including the inefficiency of generating the electricity). Additional efficiency can be gained from [[regenerative braking]], which allows [[kinetic energy]] to be recovered during braking to put power back on the line. Newer electric locomotives use AC motor-inverter drive systems that provide for regenerative braking. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and exhaust noise and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance. Power plant capacity is far greater than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives are ideal for [[commuter rail]] service with frequent stops. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can also come from clean or [[Renewable energy|renewable sources]], including [[geothermal power]], [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]], [[nuclear power]], [[solar power]] and [[wind turbine]]s.&lt;ref name="Hay1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hay|first=William W|title=Railroad engineering|volume=1|year=1982|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-36400-9|page=137|chapter=The economics of electrification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief disadvantage of electrification is the high cost for infrastructure: overhead lines or third rail, substations, and control systems. Public policy in the U.S. interferes with electrification: higher property taxes are imposed on privately owned rail facilities if they are electrified.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The EPA regulates exhaust emissions on locomotive and marine engines, similar to regulations on car &amp; freight truck emissions, in order to limit the amount of carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, nitric oxides, and soot output from these mobile power sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA, Transportation and Air Quality  |url=https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/locomotives.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling to make the necessary investments for electrification. In Europe and elsewhere, railway networks are considered part of the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock pay fees according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification.

[[File:MILW ES-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Milwaukee Road class ES-2]], an example of a larger [[steeplecab]] [[switcher]] for an electrified heavy-duty railroad]]

The first known electric locomotive was built in 1837 by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]], and it was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Davidson later built a larger locomotive named ''Galvani'', exhibited at the [[Royal Scottish Society of Arts]] Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two [[direct-drive]] [[reluctance motor]]s, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple [[commutator (electric)|commutators]]. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off|spell=in}}. It was tested on the [[Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway]] in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Lance|last2=McNeil|first2=Ian|title=Biographical dictionary of the history of technology|year=1966|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-06042-4|chapter=Davidson, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=William|title=Our Home Railways|publisher=Frederick Warne and Co|location=London|year=1910|volume=2|page=156|chapter=The Underground Electric}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Renzo Pocaterra, ''Treni'', De Agostini, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The first electric passenger train was presented by [[Werner von Siemens]] at [[Berlin]] in 1879. The locomotive was driven by a 2.2&amp;nbsp;kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13&amp;nbsp;km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-metre-long (984 feet) circular track. The electricity (150 V DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks. A contact roller was used to collect the electricity.
The world's first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin, Germany, in 1881. It was built by Werner von Siemens (see [[Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway]] and [[Berlin Straßenbahn]]). [[Volk's Electric Railway]] opened in 1883 in Brighton. Also in 1883, [[Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram]] opened near Vienna in Austria. It was the first in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line. Five years later, in the U.S. electric [[Tram|trolleys]] were pioneered in 1888 on the [[Richmond Union Passenger Railway]], using equipment designed by [[Frank Julian Sprague|Frank J. Sprague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Much of the early development of electric locomotion was driven by the increasing use of tunnels, particularly in urban areas. Smoke from steam locomotives was noxious and municipalities were increasingly inclined to prohibit their use within their limits. The first electrically-worked [[rapid transit|underground]] line was the [[City and South London Railway]], prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting use of steam power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in 1890, using electric locomotives built by [[Mather and Platt]]. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of [[multiple-unit train control]] in 1897. Surface and elevated [[rapid transit]] systems generally used steam until forced to convert by ordinance.

The first use of electrification on a main line was on a four-mile stretch of the [[Baltimore Belt Line]] of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B&amp;O to the new line to New York through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore's downtown. Parallel tracks on the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had shown that coal smoke from [[steam locomotive]]s would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three [[UIC classification#Bo+Bo|Bo+Bo]] units were initially used, at the south end of the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;''B&amp;O Power'', Sagle, Lawrence, Alvin Stauffer&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad entrances to [[New York City]] required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the [[Harlem River]] after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the [[New York Central Railroad]]. In the 1930s, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].

The [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (the Milwaukee Road), the last transcontinental line to be built, electrified its lines across the [[Rocky Mountains]] and to the Pacific Ocean starting in 1915. A few East Coast lines, notably the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]], electrified short sections of their mountain crossings. However, by this point electrification in the United States was more associated with dense urban traffic and the use of electric locomotives declined in the face of dieselization.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=241}} Diesels shared some of the electric locomotive's advantages over steam and the cost of building and maintaining the power supply infrastructure, which discouraged new installations, brought on the elimination of most main-line electrification outside the Northeast. Except for a few captive systems (e.g. the [[Black Mesa and Lake Powell]]), by 2000 electrification was confined to the [[Northeast Corridor]] and some commuter service; even there, freight service was handled by diesels. Development continued in Europe, where electrification was widespread. 1,500 V DC is still used on some lines near France and 25 kV 50&amp;nbsp;Hz is used by high-speed trains.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Alternating current===

The first practical [[Alternating current|AC]] electric locomotive was designed by [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown|Charles Brown]], then working for [[Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon|Oerlikon]], Zürich. In 1891, Brown had demonstrated long-distance power transmission, using [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase AC]], between a [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric plant]] at [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] West, a distance of 280&amp;nbsp;km. Using experience he had gained while working for [[Heilmann locomotive|Jean Heilmann]] on steam-electric locomotive designs, Brown observed that [[AC motor#Three-phase AC synchronous motors|three-phase motors]] had a higher power-to-weight ratio than [[Direct current|DC]] motors and, because of the absence of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]], were simpler to manufacture and maintain.{{efn-lr|Heilmann evaluated both AC and DC electric transmission for his locomotives, but eventually settled on a design based on [[Thomas Edison]]'s DC system.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=39–41}}}}  However, they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor [[bogie]]s: they could only be carried within locomotive bodies.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=129}}

In 1894, Hungarian engineer [[Kálmán Kandó]] developed a new type 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives. 
Kandó's early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1896, Oerlikon installed the first commercial example of the system on the [[Trams in Lugano|Lugano Tramway]]. Each 30-tonne locomotive had two {{convert|110|kW|hp|-1|abbr=on}} motors run by three-phase 750&amp;nbsp;V 40&amp;nbsp;Hz fed from double overhead lines. Three-phase motors run at constant speed and provide [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], and are well suited to steeply graded routes, and the first main-line three-phase locomotives were supplied by Brown (by then in partnership with [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie|Walter Boveri]]) in 1899 on the 40&amp;nbsp;km [[List of railway electrification systems#Burgdorf-Thun Bahn|Burgdorf—Thun line]], Switzerland. The first implementation of industrial frequency single-phase AC supply for locomotives came from Oerlikon in 1901, using the designs of [[Hans Behn-Eschenburg]] and [[Emil Huber-Stockar]]; installation on the Seebach-Wettingen line of the Swiss Federal Railways was completed in 1904. The 15&amp;nbsp;kV, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz {{convert|345|kW|hp|-1|abbr=on}}, 48&amp;nbsp;tonne locomotives used transformers and rotary converters to power DC traction motors.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=124}}

[[File:Ganz engine Valtellina.jpg|thumb|A prototype of a Ganz AC electric locomotive in Valtellina, Italy, 1901]]
Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch. The 106&amp;nbsp;km Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=120–121}}&lt;ref name="Patent Office" /&gt; The electrical system was three-phase at 3&amp;nbsp;kV 15&amp;nbsp;Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices.&lt;ref name="Kalman Kando2" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-phase two-wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as "the Italian system". Kandó was invited in 1905 to undertake the management of Società Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives.&lt;ref name="Kalman Kando2" /&gt; During the period of electrification of the Italian railways, tests were made as to which type of power to use: in some sections there was a 3,600&amp;nbsp;V {{frac|16|2|3}}&amp;nbsp;Hz three-phase power supply, in others there was 1,500&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC, 3&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;DC and 10&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;AC&amp;nbsp;45&amp;nbsp;Hz supply. After WW2, 3 kV&amp;nbsp;DC power was chosen for the entire Italian railway system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later development of Kandó, working with both the [[Ganz]] works and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Societa Italiana Westinghouse]], was an [[Rotary phase converter|electro-mechanical converter]], allowing the use of three-phase motors from single-phase AC, eliminating the need for two overhead wires.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=117}} In 1923, the first phase-converter locomotive in Hungary was constructed on the basis of Kandó's designs and serial production began soon after. The first installation, at 16&amp;nbsp;kV 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, was in 1932 on the 56&amp;nbsp;km section of the Hungarian State Railways between Budapest and [[Komárom]]. This proved successful and the electrification was extended to [[Hegyeshalom]] in 1934.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273–274}}

[[File:Biaschina Intermodal.jpg|thumb|A Swiss [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 420|Re 420]] leads a freight train down the South side of the [[Gotthard railway|Gotthard line]], which was electrified in 1922. The masts and lines of the catenary can be seen.]]
In Europe, electrification projects initially focused on mountainous regions for several reasons: coal supplies were difficult, [[hydroelectric power]] was readily available, and electric locomotives gave more traction on steeper lines. This was particularly applicable in Switzerland, where almost all lines are electrified. An important contribution to the wider adoption of AC traction came from [[SNCF]] of France after [[World War II]]. The company had assessed the industrial-frequency AC line routed through the steep [[Höllentalbahn (Black Forest)|Höllental Valley]], Germany, which was under French administration following the war. After trials, the company decided that the performance of AC locomotives was sufficiently developed to allow all its future installations, regardless of terrain, to be of this standard, with its associated cheaper and more efficient infrastructure.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}} The SNCF decision, ignoring as it did the {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} of high-voltage DC already installed on French routes, was influential in the standard selected for other countries in Europe.{{sfnp|Duffy|2003|p=273}}

The 1960s saw the electrification of many European main lines. European electric locomotive technology had improved steadily from the 1920s onwards. By comparison, the [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2]] (1918) weighed 240&amp;nbsp;t, with a power of 3,330&amp;nbsp;kW and a maximum speed of 112&amp;nbsp;km/h; in 1935, German [[DRG Class E 18|E 18]] had a power of 2,800&amp;nbsp;kW, but weighed only 108 tons and had a maximum speed of 150&amp;nbsp;km/h. On 29 March 1955, French locomotive [[SNCF Class CC 7100|CC 7107]] reached 331&amp;nbsp;km/h. In 1960 the [[SJ Dm3|SJ Class Dm 3]] locomotives on Swedish Railways produced a record 7,200&amp;nbsp;kW. Locomotives capable of commercial passenger service at 200&amp;nbsp;km/h appeared in Germany and France in the same period. Further improvements resulted from the introduction of electronic control systems, which permitted the use of increasingly lighter and more powerful motors that could be fitted inside the bogies (standardising from the 1990s onwards on asynchronous three-phase motors, fed through GTO-inverters).

In the 1980s, development of very high-speed service brought further electrification. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] and the French [[TGV]] were the first systems for which devoted high-speed lines were built from scratch. Similar programs were undertaken in [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Spain]]; in the United States the only new main-line service was an extension of electrification over the Northeast Corridor from [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], though new electric [[light rail]] systems continued to be built.

On 2 September 2006, a standard production Siemens electric locomotive of the [[EuroSprinter|Eurosprinter type ES64-U4]] ([[ÖBB]] Class 1216) achieved {{convert|357|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, the record for a locomotive-hauled train, on the new line between Ingolstadt and Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Types==
[[File:Vivan755.jpg|thumb|The operating controls of VL80R freight locomotive from [[Russian Railways]]. The wheel controls motor power.]]
[[File:DC Electric Locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Electric locomotive used in mining operations in [[Flin Flon, Manitoba]]. This locomotive is on display and not currently in service.]]

An electric locomotive can be supplied with power from
*[[Rechargeable energy storage system]]s, such as battery or [[ultracapacitor]]-powered [[mining]] locomotives.
* A stationary source, such as a [[third rail]] or [[overhead line|overhead wire]].

The distinguishing design features of electric locomotives are:
*The type of electrical power used, [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]].
*The method of storing (batteries, ultracapacitors) or collecting (transmission) electrical power.
*The means used to couple the [[traction motors]] to the driving wheels (drivers).

===Direct and alternating current===
The most fundamental difference lies in the choice of AC or DC. The earliest systems used DC, as AC was not well understood and insulation material for high voltage lines was not available. DC locomotives typically run at relatively low voltage (600 to 3,000 volts); the equipment is therefore relatively massive because the currents involved are large in order to transmit sufficient power. Power must be supplied at frequent intervals as the high currents result in large transmission system losses.

As AC motors were developed, they became the predominant type, particularly on longer routes. High voltages (tens of thousands of volts) are used because this allows the use of low currents; [[copper loss|transmission losses]] are proportional to the square of the current (e.g. twice the current means four times the loss). Thus, high power can be conducted over long distances on lighter and cheaper wires. Transformers in the locomotives transform this power to a low voltage and high current for the motors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alternating current#Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply]]&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar high voltage, low current system could not be employed with direct current locomotives because there is no easy way to do the voltage/current transformation for DC so efficiently as achieved by AC transformers.

AC traction still occasionally uses dual overhead wires instead of single phase lines. The resulting [[three-phase]] current drives [[induction motor]]s, which do not have sensitive [[commutator (electric)|commutators]] and permit easy realisation of a [[regenerative brake]]. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss [[rack railway]]s. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.
[[File:SJ night train in the Björnfjell.jpg|thumb|The Swedish [[SJ Rc|Rc locomotive]] was the first series locomotive that used [[thyristor]]s with DC motors.]]
[[Rectifier]] locomotives, which used AC power transmission and DC motors, were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities.{{explain|date=October 2015}} Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless [[Electric motor#Three-phase AC induction motors|three-phase AC induction motors]]. These polyphase machines are powered from [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO]]-, [[IGCT]]- or [[IGBT]]-based inverters. The cost of electronic devices in a modern locomotive can be up to 50% of the cost of the vehicle.

Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of the train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines. This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending locomotives can produce a large portion of the power required for ascending trains.
Most systems have a characteristic voltage and, in the case of AC power, a system frequency. Many locomotives have been equipped to handle multiple voltages and frequencies as systems came to overlap or were upgraded. American [[FL9]] locomotives were equipped to handle power from two different electrical systems and could also operate as diesel-electrics.

While today's systems predominantly operate on AC, many DC systems are still in use &amp;ndash; e.g. in [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (750 V and 1,500 V); [[Netherlands]], [[Japan]], [[Ireland]] (1,500 V); [[Slovenia]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]] (3,000 V) and [[Washington DC]] (750 V).

{{See also|Railway electrification system}}

Electrical circuits require two connections (or for [[Three-phase|three phase AC]], three connections). From the beginning, the track was used for one side of the circuit. Unlike [[model railroad]]s the track normally supplies only one side, the other side(s) of the circuit being provided separately.

====Overhead lines====
Railways generally tend to prefer [[overhead lines]], often called "[[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|catenaries]]" after the support system used to hold the wire parallel to the ground. Three collection methods are possible:

*[[Trolley pole]]: a long flexible pole, which engages the line with a wheel or shoe.
*[[Bow collector]]: a frame that holds a long collecting rod against the wire.
*[[Pantograph (rail)|Pantograph]]: a hinged frame that holds the collecting shoes against the wire in a fixed geometry.

Of the three, the pantograph method is best suited for high-speed operation. Some locomotives use both overhead and third rail collection (e.g. [[British Rail Class 92]]).
In Europe the recommended geometry and shape of pantographs are defined by standard EN 50367/IEC 60486&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=EN 50367/IEC 60486 |title=Railway applications - Current collection systems - Technical criteria for the interaction between pantograph and overhead line (to achieve free access)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third rail====
The original [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] electrification used a sliding shoe in an overhead channel, a system quickly found to be unsatisfactory. It was replaced by a [[third rail]], in which a pickup (the "shoe") rode underneath or on top of a smaller rail parallel to the main track, above ground level. There were multiple pickups on both sides of the locomotive in order to accommodate the breaks in the third rail required by trackwork. This system is preferred in [[Subway (rail)|subway]]s because of the close clearances it affords.

===Driving the wheels===
[[File:MILW Bi-Polar.jpg|thumb|right|One of the [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] "Bi-polar" electrics]]
During the initial development of railroad electrical propulsion, a number of drive systems were devised to couple the output of the [[traction motor]]s to the wheels. Early locomotives often used [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] drives. In this arrangement, the traction motor is mounted within the body of the locomotive and drives the jackshaft through a set of gears. This system was employed because the first traction motors were too large and heavy to mount directly on the axles. Due to the number of mechanical parts involved, frequent maintenance was necessary. The jackshaft drive was abandoned for all but the smallest units when smaller and lighter motors were developed,

Several other systems were devised as the electric locomotive matured. The [[Buchli drive]] was a fully spring-loaded system, in which the weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French [[SNCF]] and [[Swiss Federal Railways]]. The [[quill drive]] was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or to the side of the axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The [[PRR GG1|Pennsylvania Railroad GG1]] locomotive used a quill drive. Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.

Another drive was the "[[bipolar electric motor|bi-polar]]" system, in which the motor armature was the axle itself, the frame and field assembly of the motor being attached to the truck (bogie) in a fixed position. The motor had two field poles, which allowed a limited amount of vertical movement of the armature. This system was of limited value since the power output of each motor was limited. The [[Milwaukee Road class EP-2|EP-2]] bi-polar electrics used by the [[Milwaukee Road]] compensated for this problem by using a large number of powered axles.

Modern electric locomotives, like their [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]] counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, one side of the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by [[Gear#Spur|spur gearing]], in which a [[pinion]] on the motor shaft engages a [[bull gear]] on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.

===Wheel arrangements===
[[File:PRR GG1 4890 at NRM, Green Bay, 20040426.jpg|thumb|A [[GG1]] electric locomotive]]
The [[Whyte notation]] system for classifying [[steam locomotive]]s is not adequate for describing the variety of electric locomotive arrangements, though the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] applied [[class (locomotive)|classes]] to its electric locomotives as if they were steam. For example, the [[PRR GG1]] class indicates that it is arranged like two [[4-6-0]] class G locomotives coupled back-to-back.

[[UIC classification]] system was typically used for electric locomotives, as it could handle the complex arrangements of powered and unpowered axles and could distinguish between coupled and uncoupled drive systems.

===Battery locomotive{{anchor|Battery locomotive|Battery-electric locomotive|Storage battery locomotive|Battery electric locomotive}}===
[[File:Battery loco 16 at West Ham.JPG|thumb|right|A [[London Underground]] battery-electric locomotive at [[West Ham station]] used for hauling engineers' trains]]
A battery-electric locomotive (or battery locomotive) is powered by on-board batteries; a kind of [[battery electric vehicle]].

Such locomotives are used where a conventional diesel or electric locomotive would be unsuitable. Another use for battery locomotives is in industrial facilities where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., [[steam locomotive|steam-]] or [[diesel locomotive|diesel-]]powered) could cause a safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by [[Trolley pole|trolley-powered]] units [[Electric arc|arcing]] at the collection shoes, or where [[electrical resistance]] could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strakoš|first=Vladimír|title=Mine Planning and Equipment Selection |year=1997|publisher=Balkema|location=Rotterdam, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-5410-915-0|page=435|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mine railway#Battery|Mine railways]] often use battery locomotives.

The first electric locomotive built in 1837 was a battery locomotive It was built by chemist [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]] of [[Aberdeen]], and it was powered by [[galvanic cell]]s (batteries). Another early example was at the [[Kennecott, Alaska|Kennecott Copper Mine]], [[Latouche, Alaska]], where in 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of {{convert|4+1/2|ST|LT t}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=George Curtis|title=Mineral resources of Alaska|year=1919|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, DC|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series electric locomotives with on-board batteries. These locomotives weighed {{convert|85|ST|LT t}} and operated on 750 volt [[Overhead line|overhead trolley wire]] with considerable further range whilst running on batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://utahrails.net/bingham/kcc-diesel-elec-loco.php#700-elec List of Kennecott Copper locomotives]&lt;/ref&gt;  The locomotives provided several decades of service using [[Nickel-iron battery]] (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]], and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The others can be seen at the [[Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad]], Iowa, and at the [[Western Railway Museum]] in Rio Vista, California.

The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] previously operated a battery electric locomotive built by [[Nippon-Sharyo]] in 1968 and retired in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5510.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

London Underground regularly operates [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery-electric locomotives]] for general maintenance work.

==Electric traction around the world==

===Europe===
[[File:NorthEasternRailwayNo1-Locomotion-Shildon-April2008.JPG|thumb|NER No.1, Locomotion museum, Shildon]]
[[Image:Locomotiva E656-569.jpg|thumb|right| [[FS Class E656]], an articulated Bo'-Bo'-Bo' locomotive, manages more easily the tight curves often found on the Italian railways]]

Electrification is widespread in Europe. Due to higher density schedules, operating costs are more dominant with respect to the infrastructure costs than in the U.S. and electric locomotives have much lower operating costs than diesels. In addition, governments were motivated to electrify their railway networks due to coal shortages experienced during the First and Second World Wars.

Diesel locomotives have less power compared to electric locomotives for the same weight and dimensions. For instance, the 2,200&amp;nbsp;kW of a modern [[British Rail Class 66]] was matched in 1927 by the electric [[SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/7]] (2,300&amp;nbsp;kW), which is lighter. However, for low speeds, tractive effort is more important than power. This is why diesel engines are competitive for slow freight traffic (as it is common in the U.S.) but not for passenger or mixed passenger/freight traffic like on many European railway lines, especially where heavy freight trains must be run at comparatively high speeds (80&amp;nbsp;km/h or more).

These factors led to high degrees of electrification in most European countries. In some countries like Switzerland, even electric shunters are common and many private sidings can be served by electric locomotives. During [[World War II]], when materials to build new electric locomotives were not available, [[Swiss Federal Railways]] installed electric heating elements, fed from the overhead supply, in the boilers of [[Electric-steam locomotive|some steam shunters]] to deal with the shortage of imported coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Arthur Morton|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Co|location=London|year=1950|edition=7|volume=2|page=389|oclc=39200150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/swisselec/swisselc.htm|title=The Swiss Electric-Steam Locomotives|last=Self|first=Douglas|date=December 2003|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent political developments in many European countries to enhance public transit have led to another boost for electric traction. High-speed trains like the [[TGV]], [[InterCityExpress|ICE]], [[AVE]] and [[Pendolino]] can only be run economically using electric traction and the operation of branch lines is usually less in deficit when using electric traction, due to cheaper and faster rolling stock and more passengers due to more frequent service and more comfort. In addition, gaps of un-electrified track are closed to avoid replacing electric locomotives by diesels for these sections. The necessary modernisation and electrification of these lines is possible due to financing of the railway infrastructure by the state.

=== Russia and former USSR ===
{{see also|Railway electrification in the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Электровоз ВЛ60к-1196.jpg|thumb|Soviet electric locomotive VL60&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; (ВЛ60&lt;sup&gt;п&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;к&lt;/sub&gt;), c. 1960]]
[[File:Electric locomotive.jpg|thumb|Soviet electric locomotive VL-23 (ВЛ-23)]]
[[Russia]] and other countries of the former [[USSR]] have a mix of 3,300 V DC and 25 kV AC for historical reasons.

The special "junction stations" (around 15 over the former USSR - [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk etc.) have wiring switchable from DC to AC. Locomotive replacement is essential at these stations and is performed together with the contact wiring switching.

Most Soviet, Czech (the USSR ordered passenger electric locomotives from Skoda), Russian and Ukrainian locomotives can operate on AC or DC only. For instance, [[VL80]] is an AC machine, with VL10 a DC version. There were some half-experimental small series like VL82, which could switch from AC to DC and were used in small amounts around the city of [[Kharkov]] in [[Ukraine]]. Also, the latest Russian passenger locomotive EP10 is dual-system.

Historically, 3,300 V DC was used for simplicity. The first experimental track was in Georgian mountains, then the suburban zones of the largest cities were electrified for EMUs - very advantageous due to much better dynamic of such a train compared to the steam one, which is important for suburban service with frequent stops. Then the large mountain line between [[Ufa]] and [[Chelyabinsk]] was electrified.

For some time, electric railways were only considered to be suitable for suburban or mountain lines. In around 1950, a decision was made (according to legend, by [[Joseph Stalin]]) to electrify the highly loaded plain prairie line of [[Omsk]]-[[Novosibirsk]]. After this, electrifying the major railroads at 3,000 V DC became mainstream.

25 kV AC started in the USSR in around 1960, when the industry managed to build the rectifier-based AC-wire DC-motor locomotive (all Soviet and Czech AC locomotives were such; only the post-Soviet ones switched to electronically controlled induction motors). The first major line with AC power was Mariinsk-Krasnoyarsk-Tayshet-Zima; the lines in European Russia like Moscow-Rostov-on-Don followed.

In 1990s, some DC lines were rebuilt as AC to allow the usage of the huge 10 MWt AC locomotive of VL85. The line around [[Irkutsk]] is one of them. The DC locomotives freed by this rebuild were transferred to the St Petersburg region.

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] has been partly electrified since 1929, entirely since 2002. The system is 25 kV AC 50&amp;nbsp;Hz after the junction station of Mariinsk near Krasnoyarsk, 3,000 V DC before it, and train weights are up to 6,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF|title=Comments on the Regional Railroad Network and Power Grid Interconnection|author= Boris DYNKIN, Far Eastern State Transport University, Khabarovsk| accessdate=2009-05-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125020500/http://www.nautilus.org/archives/energy/grid/2002Workshop/materials/DYNKIN.PDF |archivedate = November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Railroad electrification in the United States}}
[[File:Main Lines—Freight and Passenger by Grif Teller, 1949.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of a [[PRR GG1]] in 1949.]]
Electric locomotives are used for passenger trains on [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] between [[Washington, DC]], and [[Boston]], with a branch to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], and on some [[commuter rail]] lines. Mass transit systems and other electrified commuter lines use [[electric multiple unit]]s, where each car is powered. All other long-distance passenger service and, with [[Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad|rare exceptions]], all freight is hauled by diesel-electric locomotives.

In North America, the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relative low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or operational constraints dictate the use of electricity. An example of the latter is the use of electric locomotives by Amtrak and [[commuter railroad]]s in the Northeast. [[New Jersey Transit]] New York corridor uses [[ALP-46]] electric locomotives, due to the prohibition on diesel operation in [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and the [[North River Tunnels|Hudson]] and [[East River Tunnels]] leading to it. Some other trains to Penn Station use [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|dual-mode]] locomotives that can also operate off third-rail power in the tunnels and the station. Electric locomotives are planned for the [[California High Speed Rail]] system.

During the steam era, some mountainous areas were electrified but these have been discontinued. The junction between electrified and non-electrified territory is the locale of engine changes; for example, [[Amtrak]] trains had extended stops in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], as locomotives were swapped, a delay which contributed to the decision to electrify the New Haven to Boston segment of the [[Northeast Corridor]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"New York to Boston, under wire - Amtrak begins all-electric Northeast Corridor service between Boston and Washington, D.C", ''Railway Age'', March 2000, accessed from [https://web.archive.org/web/20060504010847/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1215/is_3_201/ai_61640435 FindArticles.com] on 28 Sep. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

No main-line railways in Canada use electric locomotives as of January 2011.

[[Agence métropolitaine de transport]] (AMT) operates the [[ALP-45DP]] dual-mode [[electro-diesel locomotive]]s for the [[Repentigny-Mascouche Line (AMT)]]. They run as electric while in the poorly ventilated [[Mount Royal Tunnel]], otherwise they run as diesel locomotives.

[[Toronto subway]] operates two [[Arva Industries]] electric locomotives in their [[Toronto subway rolling stock|work car fleet]]. It previous had [[Nippon Sharyo]] electric locomotives since 1968.

====Japan====
{{see also|List of railway electrification systems in Japan}}
[[File:EF65_1001_Omiya_20030822.jpg|thumb|Japan electric locomotive [[JNR Class EF65|EF65]]]]

The rail system consists of the following ({{as of|2005}}):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html CIA &amp;ndash; The World Factbook &amp;ndash; Japan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{convert|20264|km|mi|abbr=on}} of {{RailGauge|1067 mm|lk=on}}, of which {{convert|13280|km|mi}} is electrified;
* {{convert|3204|km|mi|abbr=on}} of {{RailGauge|1435 mm|allk=on}}, all electrified;
* {{convert|117|km|mi|abbr=on}} of {{RailGauge|1372 mm|lk=on}} [[Scotch gauge]], all electrified;
* {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of {{RailGauge|762 mm|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge]], all electrified.

Electrification systems used by the JR group, Japan's formerly state-owned operators, are 1,500 V DC and 20 kV AC for conventional lines and 25 kV AC for Shinkansen. Electrification at 600 V DC and 750 V DC are also seen in private lines. The frequency of the AC power supply is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in Eastern Japan and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz in Western Japan.

Japan has come close to complete electrification largely due to the relatively short distances and mountainous terrain, which make electric service a particularly economical investment. Additionally, the mix of freight to passenger service is weighted much more toward passenger service (even in rural areas) than in many other countries, and this has helped drive government investment into electrification of many remote lines.

Electrification began in earnest for local railways in the 1920s and main lines electrification began following World War II using a universal 1,500 V DC standard and eventually, a 20 kV standard for rapid intercity main lines (often overlaying 1,500 V DC lines) and 25 kV AC for high-speed [[Shinkansen]] lines. Because most of the electrification infrastructure was destroyed in the war, the only variances to this standard with significant traffic are a few of the older subway lines in Tokyo and Osaka. The [[Tōkaidō Main Line]], Japan's busiest line, completed electrification in 1956 and [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen]] was complete in 1964. By the mid 1970s, most main lines had been converted. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, when a fast-growing Japanese economy encouraged massive infrastructure spending, almost every line with any significant traffic was electrified. Though the massive debts incurred for these upgrades (along with the more publicised expense of Shinkansen expansions) led to the privatization and break-up of the [[Japan Railways Group|national rail company]]. By the time of the breakup in 1987, electric service had penetrated to every line with significant traffic. In the 1990s, and 2000s, rural infrastructure was the focus of a lot of government stimulus funding and this included some rail electrification on infrequently used lines, and funding for expanding the Shinkansen network (which, as with all high speed trains, is electric). The latter was mostly in the form of loans rather than direct investment as in the former.

===Australia===
Both [[Victorian Railways]] and [[New South Wales Government Railways]], which pioneered electric traction in Australia in the early 20th century and continue to operate 1,500 V DC [[Electric Multiple Unit]]s, have withdrawn their electric locomotives.

In both states, the use of electric locomotives on principal interurban routes proved to be a qualified success. In Victoria, because only one major line (the [[Orbost railway line|Gippsland line]]) had been electrified, the economic advantages of electric traction were not fully realised due to the need to change locomotives for trains that ran beyond the electrified network. VR's [[Victorian Railways L class electric|electric locomotive fleet]] was withdrawn from service by 1987&lt;ref name=vrlclass&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.victorianrailways.net/motive%20power/lelec.html| title= L class electric locomotives |publisher=victorianrailways.net |accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gippsland line electrification was dismantled by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianrailways.net/vr%20history/history.html |title=VR History |publisher=victorianrailways.net |accessdate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530050949/http://www.victorianrailways.net/vr%20history/history.html |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 86 class locomotives introduced to NSW in 1983 had a relatively short life as the costs of changing locomotives at the extremities of the electrified network, together with the higher charges levied for electricity use, saw diesel-electric locomotives make inroads into the electrified network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sets.org.au/fleet/index.php?id=8606 |title=SETS Fleet - Electric Locomotive 8606| publisher=Sydney Electric Train Society| accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric [[power car]] trains are still used for urban passenger services.

[[Queensland Rail]] implemented electrification relatively recently and utilises the more recent [[25 kV AC]] technology with around 1,000&amp;nbsp;km of the [[narrow gauge]] network now electrified. It operates a fleet of electric locomotives to transport [[coal]] for export, the most recent of which the 3,000&amp;nbsp;kW (4,020 HP) 3300/3400 Class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://locopage.railpage.org.au/qr/33003400.html |title=QR: 3300/3400 class |publisher=railpage.com.au |accessdate=2007-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507120820/http://locopage.railpage.org.au/qr/33003400.html |archivedate=2007-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland Rail is currently rebuilding its 3100 and 3200 class locos into the 3700 class, which use AC traction and need only three locomotives on a coal train rather than five. Queensland Rail is getting 30 3800 class locomotives from Siemens in Munich, Germany, which will arrive during late 2008 to 2009. QRNational (Queensland Rail's coal and freight after separation) has increased the order of 3800 class locomotives. They continue to arrive late into 2010.

In [[South Australia]], the [[Seaford railway line]] was electrified in 2013; electric services commenced in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infrastructure.sa.gov.au/seaford Rail revitalisation Seaford rail extension] Department of Planning, Transport &amp; Infrastructure&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">'''Energy elasticity''' is a term used with reference to the [[energy intensity]] of [[Gross Domestic Product]]. It is "''the percentage change in energy consumption to achieve one per cent change in national GDP''". 

This term has been used when describing sustainable growth in the developing world, while being aware of the need to maintain the security of energy supply and constrain the emission of additional [[greenhouse gas]]es. Energy elasticity is a top-line measure, as the commercial energy sources used by the country in question are normally further itemised as fossil, renewable, etc. 

For example, [[India]]'s national Integrated [[Energy policy|Energy Policy]] of 2005 noted current elasticity at 0.80, while planning for 7-8% GDP growth. It expected to be able to reduce this to 0.75 from 2011 and to 0.67 from 2021-22. &lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2006/05/09/stories/2006050900491000.htm  To power 7-8% GDP growth] N. R. Krishan, The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, India's Ambassador was able to inform the [[United Nations Security Council]] that its GDP was growing by 8%, with only 3.7% growth in its total primary energy consumption,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.int/india/2007/ind1328.htm Statement by Nirupam Sen to UN Security Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115103253/http://www.un.int/india/2007/ind1328.htm |date=2008-01-15 }} UN 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting it had effectively de-linked energy consumption from economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=85040 India’s energy consumption, growth de-linked] Express India, 18 April, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]] has shown the opposite relationship, as, after 2000, it has consumed proportionately more energy to achieve its high double-digit growth rate. Although there are problems with the quality of the estimates of both GDP and energy consumption, by 2003-4 observers placed Chinese energy elasticity at approximately 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.iea.org/textbase/speech/2005/jl_china.pdf Energy Outlook for China] EIA testimony U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 3 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; For every one percent increase in GDP, energy demand grew by 1.5 percent. Much of this extra demand has been sourced internationally from [[fossil fuel]]s, such as [[coal]] and [[petroleum]].

In [[particle physics]], a '''fermion''' is a particle that follows [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. These particles obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Fermions include all [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, as well as all [[composite particle]]s made of an [[even and odd|odd number]] of these, such as all [[baryon]]s and many [[atom]]s and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. Fermions differ from [[boson]]s, which obey [[Bose–Einstein statistics]].

A fermion can be an [[elementary particle]], such as the [[electron]], or it can be a [[composite particle]], such as the [[proton]]. According to the [[spin-statistics theorem]] in any reasonable [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[quantum field theory]], particles with [[integer]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] are [[boson]]s, while particles with [[half-integer]] spin are fermions.

In addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers. Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics-quantum number relation.&lt;ref&gt;Physical Review D volume 87, page 0550003, year 2013, author Weiner, Richard M., title "Spin-statistics-quantum number connection and supersymmetry"  arxiv:1302.0969&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, only one fermion can occupy a particular [[quantum state]] at any given time. If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with [[matter]], whereas bosons are generally [[force carrier]] particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear.  [[Weak interaction|Weakly interacting]] fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions.  At low temperature fermions show [[superfluidity]] for uncharged particles and [[superconductivity]] for charged particles.

Composite fermions, such as protons and [[neutron]]s, are the key building blocks of [[baryonic matter|everyday matter]].

The name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]] from the surname of Italian physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Dirac's lecture ''Developments in Atomic Theory'' at Le Palais de la Découverte, 6 December 1945, UKNATARCHI Dirac Papers BW83/2/257889. See note 64 on page 331 in "The Strangest Man: The Hidden Life of Paul Dirac, Mystic of the Atom" by Graham Farmelo&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elementary fermions==

The [[Standard Model]] recognizes two types of elementary fermions: [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s. In all, the model distinguishes 24 different fermions. There are six quarks ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]] and [[top quark|top]] quarks), and six leptons ([[electron]], [[electron neutrino]], [[muon]], [[muon neutrino]], [[Tau (particle)|tau particle]] and [[tau neutrino]]), along with the corresponding [[antiparticle]] of each of these.

Mathematically, fermions come in three types:
* [[Weyl fermion]]s (massless),
* [[Dirac fermion]]s (massive), and
* [[Majorana fermion]]s (each its own antiparticle).
Most Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the [[neutrino]]s are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both). Dirac fermions can be treated as a combination of two Weyl fermions.&lt;ref name="MoriiLim2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T. Morii|author2=C. S. Lim|author3=S. N. Mukherjee|title=The Physics of the Standard Model and Beyond|date=1 January 2004|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|isbn=978-981-279-560-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}}  In July 2015, Weyl fermions have been experimentally realized in [[Weyl semimetal]]s.

==Composite fermions==
{{see also|List of particles#Composite particles}}

Composite particles (such as [[hadron]]s, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion. It will have half-integer spin.

Examples include the following:
*A baryon, such as the proton or neutron, contains three fermionic quarks and thus it is a fermion.
*The nucleus of a [[carbon-13]] atom contains six protons and seven neutrons and is therefore a fermion.
*The atom [[helium-3]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He) is made of two protons, one neutron, and two electrons, and therefore it is a fermion.

The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.

Fermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup.

Fermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs. This is the origin of superconductivity and the [[superfluid]]ity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of [[phonon]]s, forming [[Cooper pair]]s, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.

The quasiparticles of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] are also known as [[composite fermions]], which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.

===Skyrmions===
{{Standard model of particle physics|cTopic=[[Elementary particle]]s}}
{{main|Skyrmion}}

In a quantum field theory, there can be field configurations of bosons which are topologically twisted. These are coherent states (or [[soliton]]s) which behave like a particle, and they can be fermionic even if all the constituent particles are bosons. This was discovered by [[Tony Skyrme]] in the early 1960s, so fermions made of bosons are named [[skyrmion]]s after him.

Skyrme's original example involved fields which take values on a three-dimensional sphere, the original [[nonlinear sigma model]] which describes the large distance behavior of [[pion]]s. In Skyrme's model, reproduced in the [[1/N expansion|large N]] or [[AdS/QCD|string]] approximation to [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD), the proton and neutron are fermionic [[topological soliton]]s of the pion field.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Whereas Skyrme's example involved pion physics, there is a much more familiar example in quantum electrodynamics with a [[magnetic monopole]]. A bosonic monopole with the [[Dirac quantization condition|smallest possible magnetic charge]] and a bosonic version of the electron will form a fermionic [[dyon]].

The analogy between the Skyrme field and the Higgs field of the electroweak sector has been used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author-link=Richard M. Weiner|first= Richard M.| last=Weiner|title= The Mysteries of Fermions|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|volume= 49 |date=2010|pages=1174–1180|doi=10.1007/s10773-010-0292-7|issue=5|bibcode = 2010IJTP...49.1174W |arxiv = 0901.3816 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to postulate that all fermions are skyrmions. This could explain why all known fermions have baryon or lepton quantum numbers and provide a physical mechanism for the Pauli exclusion principle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14370">'''Fluxional molecules''' are [[molecule]]s that undergo dynamics such that some or all of their [[atom]]s interchange between symmetry-equivalent positions.  Because virtually all molecules are fluxional in some respects, e.g. bond rotations in most [[organic compound]]s, the term fluxional depends on the context and the method used to assess the dynamics.  Often, a molecule is considered fluxional if its spectroscopic signature exhibits line-broadening (beyond that dictated by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]) due to chemical exchange.  In some cases, where the rates are slow, fluxionality is not detected spectroscopically, but by [[isotopic labeling]]. Where such movement do not occur, the molecule may be described as a '''semi-rigid molecule'''.&lt;ref&gt; H. W. Kroto, ''Molecular Rotation Spectra'', Wiley, New York, 1975 (Reprinted by Dover 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Bunker and P.

{{primary|date=November 2018}}
The prototypical fluxional molecule is [[phosphorus pentafluoride]].  Its [[Fluorine-19 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectrum]] consists of a &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-coupled doublet, indicating that the equatorial and axial fluorine centers interchange rapidly on the NMR timescale.  [[Fluorine-19 NMR]] spectroscopy, even at temperatures as low as −100&amp;nbsp;°C, fails to distinguish the axial from the equatorial fluorine environments.  The apparent equivalency arises from the low barrier for [[pseudorotation]] via the [[Berry mechanism]], by which the axial and equatorial fluorine atoms rapidly exchange positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gutowsky, H.

Thus, even at [[absolute zero]] there is no rigid molecular structure, the H atoms are always in motion.  More precisely, the spatial distribution of protons in CH&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is many times broader than its parent molecule CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal  = J.

==NMR spectroscopy==
Temperature dependent changes in the NMR spectra result from dynamics associated with the fluxional molecules when those dynamics proceed at rates comparable to the frequency differences observed by NMR.  The experiment is called '''DNMR''' and typically involves recording spectra at various temperatures.  In the ideal case, low temperature spectra can be assigned to the "slow exchange limit", whereas spectra recorded at higher temperatures correspond to molecules at "fast exchange limit".  Typically, high temperature spectra are simpler than those recorded at low temperatures, since at high temperatures, equivalent sites are averaged out.  Prior to the advent of DNMR, kinetics of reactions were measured on nonequilibrium mixtures, monitoring the approach to equilibrium.

Many molecular processes exhibit fluxionality that can be probed on the NMR time scale. Beyond the examples highlighted below, other classic examples include the [[Cope rearrangement]] in [[bullvalene]] and the  [[cyclohexane conformation|chair inversion]] in [[cyclohexane]].

For processes that are too slow for traditional DNMR analysis, the technique spin saturation transfer (SST) is applicable. This magnetization transfer technique provides rate information, provided that the rates exceed [[Relaxation (NMR)|1/''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarek, R. L., Flesher, R. J., Shin, S. K., "Kinetics of Internal Rotation of N,N-Dimethylacetamide: A Spin-Saturation Transfer Experiment", Journal of Chemical Education 1997, volume 74, page 978.  {{DOI|10.1021/ed074p978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimethylformamide===
A classic example of a fluxional molecule is [[dimethylformamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = H. S. Gutowsky | author2 = C. H. Holm | title = Rate Processes and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra. II. Hindered Internal Rotation of Amides | journal = J. Chem.

[[Image:DmfDNMR.png|center|300px]]
At temperatures near 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz NMR spectrum of this compound shows only one signal for the methyl groups.  Near room temperature however, separate signals are seen for the non-equivalent methyl groups.  The rate of exchange can be readily calculated at the temperature where the two signals are just merged.  This "coalescence temperature" depends on the measuring field.  The relevant equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{\pi \Delta \nu_\circ}{2^{1/2}} \sim 2 \Delta \nu_\circ&lt;/math&gt;
where Δν&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the difference in Hz between the frequencies of the exchanging sites.  These frequencies are obtained from the limiting low-temperature NMR spectrum.  At these lower temperatures, the dynamics continue, of course, but the contribution of the dynamics to line broadening is negligible.

For example, if Δν&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  =  1ppm @ 500&amp;nbsp;MHz
:&lt;math&gt;k \sim 2(500) = 1000 \mathrm{s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (ca. 0.5 millisecond [[half-life]])

===Ring whizzing in organometallic chemistry===
Many [[organometallic compound]]s exhibit fluxionality.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Faller "Stereochemical Nonrigidity of Organometallic Complexes" ''Encyclopedia of Inorganic and Bioinorganic Chemistry'' 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/9781119951438.eibc0211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compound Fe(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) (η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;- C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits the phenomenon of "ring whizzing".  
[[File:Fe Habcd.jpg|thumb|The structure of the ring whizzer Fe(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) (η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

At 30&amp;nbsp;°C, the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum shows only two peaks, one typical (δ5.6) of the η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and the other assigned η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. The singlet assigned to the η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand splits at low temperatures owing to the slow hopping of the Fe center from carbon to carbon in the  η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Jr. M.

Jordan, Reaction Mechanisms of Inorganic and Organometallic Systems (''Topics in Inorganic Chemistry''), 2007. {{ISBN|978-0195301007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berry pseudorotation===
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-Berry-mechanism.png|500px|center|Iron-pentacarbonyl-Berry-mechanism]]
Pentacoordinate molecules of trigonal pyramidal geometry typically exhibit a particular kind of low energy fluxional behavior called [[Berry pseudorotation]]. Famous examples of such molecules are [[iron pentacarbonyl]] (Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phosphorus pentafluoride]] (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).  At higher temperatures, only one signal is observed for the ligands (e.g., by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C or &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR) whereas at low temperatures, two signals in a 2:3 ratio can be resolved.  Molecules that are not strictly pentacoordinate are also subject to this process, such as SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==IR spectroscopy==
Although less common, some dynamics are also observable on the time-scale of [[IR spectroscopy]].  One example is [[electron transfer]] in a mixed valence dimer of metal clusters.  Application of above equation for coalescence of two signals separated by 10&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; gives the following result:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Casey H. Londergan |author2 = Clifford P. Kubiak | title = Electron Transfer and Dynamic Infrared-Band Coalescence: It Looks Like Dynamic NMR Spectroscopy, but a Billion Times Faster | journal =  Chemistry: A European Journal | year = 2003 | volume = 9 | pages = 5969ff | doi = 10.1002/chem.200305028 |issue = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k \sim \Delta \nu_\circ \sim 2(10 \mathrm{cm}^{-1}) (300 \cdot 10^8 \mathrm{cm/s}) \sim 6 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \cdot&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, processes that induce line-broadening on the IR time-scale must be extremely rapid.

==Identical nuclei==
When a molecule contains identical nuclei&amp;mdash;which is commonly the case&amp;mdash;there are a number of minima related by the ''permutations of the identical nuclei''. The  minima, distinguished by different numberings of identical nuclei, can be partitioned in equivalent  classes. Two minima are equivalent if they can be transformed into one other by rotating the molecule, that is, without surmounting any energy barrier (bond breaking or bond twisting). The molecules with minima in different equivalent classes are called '''versions'''. To transform one version into another version an energy barrier must be overcome.

===Example===
Take for instance the pyramidal ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule. There are 3!=6 permutations of the hydrogen atoms. If we count the hydrogens looking down from the nitrogen onto the plane of the hydrogens,  then we see that 
:{H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;} 
forms one equivalence class, (class '''I'''), because the members can be transformed into each other by simply rotating around the 3-fold axis without overcoming an energy barrier.
The other equivalence class (class '''II''') consists of 
:{H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}.
To transform a  member (''version'') of class '''I''' to class '''II''', an energy barrier has to be overcome. (The lowest path on the potential energy surface is actually via the flipping of the ammonia "umbrella". The umbrella up and the umbrella down are separated by an energy barrier of height of ca. 1000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

In a '''semi-rigid molecule''' all the barriers between different versions are so high that the tunneling though the barriers may be neglected.  Under these conditions identical nuclei may be seen as ''distinguishable'' particles to which the [[Pauli principle]] ''does not'' apply. This is a very common point of view in chemistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1185">'''Glow plates''' are sheets of glass or plastic that "glow" when light is supplied to one of their edges.
The light source for a glow plate can be artificial, such as [[fluorescent light]], or natural, with [[sunlight]] being directly exposed to the plate or fed through a [[fiber-optic]] system.

A joint effort between [[Florida State University]] and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is focused on the design of a "spiral bio-reactor light sheet", which consists of a [[plexiglas]] sheet that has been micro-etched on one side and rolled into a [[spiral]] shape.

Aside from aesthetic or utilitarian [[lighting]] purposes, much interest in using glow plates as a source of light comes from recent developments in [[algaculture|algal cultivation]].

'''Jamming''' is the physical process by which the viscosity of some [[Mesoscopic physics|mesoscopic]] materials, such as [[granular material]]s, [[glass]]es, [[foam]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[emulsion]]s, and other [[complex fluid]]s, increases with increasing particle density.  The jamming transition has been proposed as a new type of [[phase transition]], with similarities to a [[glass transition]] but very different from the formation of
[[crystalline solid]]s.&lt;ref name="nat_phys"&gt;{{cite journal

While a glass transition occurs when the liquid state is cooled, the jamming transition happens when density is increased.  This crowding of the constituent particles prevents them from exploring [[phase space]], making the aggregate material behave as a solid.  The system may be able to unjam if [[Packing density|volume fraction]] is decreased, or external stresses are applied such that they exceed the yield stress. This transition is interesting because it is highly [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] with respect to volume fraction.

The jamming [[phase diagram]]  relates the jamming transition to inverse density, stress
and temperature.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal

The density at which systems jam is determined by many factors, including the shape of their components, the deformability of the particles, frictional interparticle forces, and the degree of [[dispersity]] of the system. The overall shape of the jamming manifold may depend on the particular system. For example, a particularly interesting feature of the jamming transition is the difference between attractive and repulsive systems. Whether the jamming surface diverges for high enough densities or low temperatures is uncertain.

Simulations of jammed systems study particle configurations leading to jamming in both static systems and systems under shear. Under [[shear stress]], average cluster size may diverge after a finite amount of strain, leading to a jammed state. A particle configuration may exist in a jammed state with a stress required to “break” the force chains causing the jam.

A static sand pile is jammed under the force of gravity and no energy is being dissipated. Systems which are consuming energy are also sometimes described as being jammed. An example is [[traffic jam]]s, where due to jamming the average velocity of cars on a road may drop sharply. Here the cars on a road may be thought of like a [[granular material]] or a [[non-newtonian fluid]] that is being pumped through a tube. There under certain conditions the effective [[viscosity]] may rapidly increase, dramatically increasing the [[granular material]] or [[fluid]]s's resistance to flowing and so causing the velocity to drop or even come to a complete stop. In this analogy the cars are like the grains in a [[granular material]] and if they are dense enough (i.e., closely enough spaced along the road) then interactions between the cars (as they must avoid each other to avoid crashing) cause jamming. A simple model of this behavior is the [[Nagel-Schreckenberg model]].

The '''KN-3 reactor''' (VM-16) is the [[nuclear reactor]] used in pairs to power the [[Kirov class battlecruiser|''Kirov''-class battlecruisers]]. The reactor was also intended to be used on the [[Soviet aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk|''Ulyanovsk'' class]] of [[supercarrier]]s. It is a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR), using [[enriched uranium|enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel to produce [[megawatt|300 MW]] of power.

It was developed by [[OKBM Afrikantov]].

'''LOT Polish Airlines Flight LO 165''' crashed 2 April 1969 at 16:08 local time (UTC+1) while en route from [[Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport|Warsaw]] to [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice|Krakow Balice airport]] during a snowstorm. 
It crashed on the northern slope of [[Polica (mountain)|Polica]] near [[Zawoja]] in southern [[Poland]], hitting the mountain at an altitude of {{convert|1200|m}}.
The plane was an [[Antonov An-24]] aircraft, with registration SP-LTF. 
All 53 people (47 passengers and 6 crew) on board were killed. There were three Americans and one London resident among the passengers, all others being Polish citizens.

==Flight history==

===Introduction===
The official accident report, published in 1970, blamed the pilot for getting lost.
No reasons were given why the aircraft, just before the crash, was flying at such a low altitude some {{convert|50|km}} past its intended destination.

Information given below comes from two newspaper articles&lt;ref name=GK1&gt;
{{Citation | last = Pałosz | first = Jerzy | title = Tragedia pod Zawoją&amp;nbsp;(''Tragedy near Zawoja'')  | newspaper = [[Gazeta Krakowska]] | pages = 6–7 | date = 10 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =GK2&gt;
{{Citation | last = Pałosz | first = Jerzy | title = Tragedia pod Zawoją (2)&amp;nbsp;(''Tragedy near Zawoja (2)'')  | newspaper = Gazeta Krakowska | page = 3 | date = 11 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1994, with a summary written by a third party available on-line.&lt;ref name=Lachowice&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.zswsucha.iap.pl/STREFA_N/WiLeHi/zawoja/tragedia.html
|title=Aviation tragedy on Polica|accessdate=1 April 2008}}A summary of the ''Gazeta Krakowska'' articles, includes photographs from the crash site {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist wrote that even 25 years after the accident, most of the documentation remained classified, so his main sources were interviews with participants in the rescue action and some members of the accident investigation commission who asked for anonymity.

===Flight===

The aircraft took off at 15:20 local time for a 55-minute flight to Krakow's Balice airport. The [[Captain (civil aviation)|captain]] was Czesław Doliński (with 20 years of flying in PLL LOT and more than two million kilometres of experience). 

At 15.49, the [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] received a routine instruction: after passing [[Jędrzejów]], less than 80&amp;nbsp;km north of the destination, descend to 
{{convert|1500|m}} and get in touch with the Balice control tower (VOR in Jędrzejów is a border point of Warsaw/Kraków ATC centre). At that time, a military radar registered the aircraft at an altitude of {{convert|4000|m}}. The pilots informed Okęcie and Balice about time, when the plane passed Jędrzejów VOR, but given three circumscription: 15.52, 15.55 for Okęcie and 15.49 for Balice.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} The pilots informed Balice also about the time they passed the next VOR – 15.53.  Shortly before 16:00, the captain (who had taken over the controls in the meantime) called Balice, gave his altitude as {{convert|3700|m}}, got the local weather report and was instructed to descend to {{convert|1200|m}}. At 16:01, the aircraft was at {{convert|2400|m}} and descending. In the next eight minutes, a series of radio exchanges took place between the aircraft and the Balice radar operator, with the captain repeatedly asking for the [[fix (position)|fix]] and reporting problems with the beacon signal, and the operator asking for the aircraft's position and altitude to help him find the aircraft on the radar screen. At 16:05, the aircraft was near [[Maków Podhalański]], some 50&amp;nbsp;km past the destination, at {{convert|1200|m}}. The last message was, "Left turn to further..." – at 16:08.17. Seconds after that, radio contact was lost.

== Passenger manifest ==

For today, the official death toll of 53 killed is controversial.  LOT manifest included 53 passengers and 5 crew members, but two days after the crash Polish press agencies published (based on LOT's information) 46 surnames (part of them without an address or name).

In [[condensed matter physics]] and [[physical chemistry]], the '''Lifshitz theory of van der Waals forces''', sometimes called the '''macroscopic theory of van der Waals forces''', is a method proposed by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]] in 1954 for treating [[van der Waals forces]] between bodies which does not assume pairwise additivity of the individual intermolecular forces; that is to say, the theory takes into account the influence of neighboring molecules on the interaction between every pair of molecules located in the two bodies, rather than treating each pair independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Theory of Molecular Attractive Forces between Solids|last = Lifshitz|first = E.M.|date = 3 September 1954|journal = Journal of Experimental Theoretical Physics USSR|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 29|pages = 94–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The theory of molecular Attractive Forces between Solids|last = Lifshitz|first = E.M.|date = January 1956|journal = Soviet Physics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 2|number = 1|pages = 73–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Need for a Non-Pairwise Additive Theory ==
The van der Waals force between two molecules, in this context, is the sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between them; these forces are primarily [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] in nature, and in their simplest form might consist of a force between two charges, two [[Electric dipole moment|dipoles]], or between a charge and a dipole. Thus, the strength of the force may often depend on the net charge, electric dipole moment, or the electric [[polarizability]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;) (see for example [[London forces|London force]]) of the molecules, with highly polarizable molecules contributing to stronger forces, and so on.

The total force between two bodies, each consisting of many molecules in the van der Waals theory is simply the sum of the intermolecular van der Waals forces, where pairwise additivity is assumed. That is to say, the forces are summed as though each pair of molecules interacts completely independently of their surroundings (See [[Van der Waals force#Van der Waals forces between macroscopic objects|Van der Waals forces between Macroscopic Objects]] for an example of such a treatment). This assumption is usually correct for gasses, but presents a problem for many condensed materials, as it is known that the molecular interactions may depend strongly on their environment and neighbors. For example, in a conductor, a [[Point particle|point-like]] charge might be screened by the electrons in the [[Valence and conduction bands|conductance band]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of the Theory of Solids|last = Ziman|first = J.M.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1972|isbn = 978-0521297332|location = Cambridge|pages = |edition = 2|lccn = 72-80250|chapter = 5.2: Screened Impurities and Neutral Pseudo-Atoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the polarizability of a condensed material may be vastly different from that of an individual molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Solid State Physics|last = Ashcroft|first = N.W.|publisher = Sauders College Publishing|year = 1976|isbn = 978-0030839931|location = |pages = |last2 = Mermin|first2 = N.D.|chapter = 31: Diamagnetism and Paramagnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to correctly predict the van der Waals forces of condensed materials, a theory that takes into account their total electrostatic response is needed.

== General Principle ==
The problem of pairwise additivity is completely avoided in the Lifshitz theory, where the molecular structure is ignored and the bodies are treated as continuous media. The forces between the bodies are now derived in terms of their bulk properties, such as [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] and [[refractive index]], which already contain all the necessary information from the original molecular structure.

The original Lifshitz 1955 paper proposed this method relying on [[quantum field theory]] principles, and is, in essence, a generalization of the [[Casimir effect]], from two parallel, flat, ideally conducting surfaces, to two surfaces of any material.

== Hamaker Constant in the Lifshitz Theory ==
[[File:Lifshitz Van der Waals integration 02.png|thumb|An Ion of charge &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and a nonpolar molecule of polarizability &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The Lifshitz theory can be expressed as an effective [[Hamaker constant]] in the van der Waals theory.

Consider, for example, the interaction between an ion of charge &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and a [[Chemical polarity#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar molecule]] with polarizability &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; at distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. In a medium with [[dielectric constant]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3&lt;/math&gt;, the interaction energy between a charge and an electric dipole &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Electrodynamics|last = Griffith|first = D.J.|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 149|edition = 3|chapter = 3.4.2: The Monopole and Dipole Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U(r)=\frac{-Qp}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3 r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with the dipole moment of the polarizable molecule given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p=\alpha_2 E&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;  is the strength of the electric field at distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the ion. According to Coulomb's law:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3} \frac{1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

so we may write the interaction energy as

:&lt;math&gt;U(r)=\frac{-Q^2 \alpha_2}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3)^2 r^4}&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Lifshitz Van der Waals integration 03.png|thumb|The nonpolar molecule is now replaced with a dielectric medium (in grey); the force experienced by the molecule can be found using the method of image charges.]]
[[File:Lifshitz Van der Waals integration 01.png|thumb|Definition of integration variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Consider now, how the interaction energy will change if the right hand molecule is replaced with a medium of density &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt; of such molecules. According to the "classical" van der Waals theory, the total force will simply be the summation over individual molecules. Integrating over the volume of the medium (see the third figure), we might expect the total interaction energy with the charge to be

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U(D)&amp;= \frac{-2\pi Q^2 \alpha_2 \rho_2}{(4 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3)^2}  \int \limits_{z=D}^{\infin}dz\int\limits_{x=0}^{\infin}dx \frac{x}{(z^2+x^2)^2} \\
&amp; =  -\frac{\pi Q^2 \alpha_2 \rho_2}{(4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3)^2} \frac{1}{D}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

But this result cannot be correct, since It is well known that a charge &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; in a medium of dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; from the plane surface of a second medium of dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2&lt;/math&gt; experiences a force as if there were an 'image' charge of strength &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q'=-Q(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3)/(\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3)&lt;/math&gt; at distance D on the other side of the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electrodynamics of Continuous Media|last = Landau|first = |publisher = Pergamon Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Lifshitz|first2 = |edition = 2|volume = 2|page = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The force between the real and image charges must then be

:&lt;math&gt;F(D)= \frac{-Q^2}{(4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3) (2D)^2} \frac{\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3}{\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3}&lt;/math&gt;

and the energy, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;U(D) = \frac{-Q^2}{(4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3) 4D} \frac{\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3}{\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3}&lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two expressions for the energy, we define a new effective polarizability that must obey

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_2 \alpha_2 = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_3 \frac{\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3}{\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, replacing the real charge &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; with a medium of density &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; and polarizability &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; gives an expression for &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1 \rho_1&lt;/math&gt;. Using these two relations, we may restate our theory in terms of an effective Hamaker constant. Specifically, using McLachlan's generalized theory of VDW forces the Hamaker constant for an interaction potential of the form  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U(r)=-C/r^n&lt;/math&gt;  between two bodies at temperature &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLachlan|first1=A.

:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi^2 C \rho_1 \rho_2 = \frac{6\pi^2 k_B T \rho_1 \rho_2}{(4\pi \epsilon_0)^2} \sum_{n=0,1...}^\infty \frac{\alpha_1 (i\nu_n) \alpha_2 (i\nu_n)}{\epsilon_3^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nu_n = 2\pi n k_B T / h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are Boltzmann's and Planck's constants correspondingly. Inserting our relations for &lt;math&gt;\rho \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and approximating the sum as an integral &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_B T \sum_{n=0,1...}^\infty  \rightarrow \frac{h}{2\pi}\int\limits_{\nu_1}^{\infin}d\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the effective Hamaker constant in the Lifshitz theory may be approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;A \approx \frac{3}{4} k_B T \left( \frac{\epsilon_1-\epsilon_3}{\epsilon_1+\epsilon_3} \right) \left( \frac{\epsilon_2-\epsilon_3}{\epsilon_2+\epsilon_3} \right)
+
\frac{3h}{4\pi} \int\limits_{\nu_1}^{\infin} d\nu \left( \frac{\epsilon_1(i\nu)-\epsilon_3(i\nu)}{\epsilon_1(i\nu)+\epsilon_3(i\nu)} \right) \left( \frac{\epsilon_2(i\nu)-\epsilon_3(i\nu)}{\epsilon_2(i\nu)+\epsilon_3(i\nu)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

We note that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(i\nu)&lt;/math&gt; are real functions, and are related to measurable properties of the medium;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intermolecular and Surface Forces|last = Israelachvili|first = J.N.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = |edition = 2|chapter = Ch. 6.6: General Theory of Van der Waals forces Between Molecules}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, the Hamaker constant in the Lifshitz theory can be expressed in terms of observable properties of the physical system.

== Experimental Validation ==
The macroscopic theory of van der Waals theory has many experimental validations.

There are currently 27 '''National Parks of Costa Rica''', which are managed under the umbrella of [[SINAC]] (Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion), a department of [[Costa Rica]]'s Ministry of Environment and Energy ([[MINAE]]). All told, Costa Rica's protected areas encompass more than 25% of the country's total land area, more than any other country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Protected Areas of Costa Rica|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/attractions/national-park}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these protected areas are national parks. 

Costa Rica's progressive policies on environmental protection and sustainable [[ecotourism]] in the National Parks System have been lauded as a model for other countries. The [[rainforest]]s, tropical forests, marine areas and [[wetlands]] of Costa Rica are the subject of many university and scientific organization studies. The enrichment of the world's knowledge of these important [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] is an invaluable contribution from the National Parks System of Costa Rica. 

The [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] is home to an impressive collection of national parks and other preserved areas, including the [[La Amistad International Park]], which extends into [[Panamá]]. On the southern [[Osa Peninsula]] is the internationally renowned [[Corcovado National Park]], which preserves a remnant of sizeable lowland tropical rainforest that is unique in the world. [[Manuel Antonio National Park]] was listed by [[Forbes]] in 2011 among the world's 12 most beautiful national parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2011/08/29/the-worlds-most-beautiful-national-parks/ |title=The World's Most Beautiful National Parks |author=Jane Levere|work=[[Forbes]]|date=2011-08-29|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnesium fluoride''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound is a white crystalline [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and is transparent over a wide range of [[wavelength]]s, with commercial uses in [[optics]] that are also used in [[space telescope]]s. It occurs naturally as the rare mineral [[sellaite]].

==Production and structure==
[[Magnesium]] [[fluoride]] is prepared from [[magnesium oxide]] with sources of [[hydrogen fluoride]] such as [[ammonium bifluoride]]:
:MgO  +  (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)HF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Related [[metathesis reaction]]s are also feasible.

The compound crystallizes as [[tetragonal]] [[birefringent]] crystals.  The structure of the compound is similar to that in [[rutile]], featuring octahedral Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; centers and 3-coordinate [[fluoride]] centres.&lt;ref name="Aigueperse 2005"&gt;{{citation | first1 = Jean | last1 = Aigueperse | first2 = Paul | last2 = Mollard | first3 = Didier | last3 = Devilliers | first4= Marius | last4 = Chemla | first5 =  Robert | last5 = Faron | first6 = Renée | last6 = Romano | first7 = Jean Pierre | last7 = Cuer | contribution = Fluorine Compounds, Inorganic | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2005 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | place = Weinheim|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a11_307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
===Optics===
Magnesium fluoride is [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] over an extremely wide range of [[wavelength]]s. Windows, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], and [[prism (optics)|prism]]s made of this material can be used over the entire range of wavelengths from 0.120&amp;nbsp;μm (vacuum [[ultraviolet]]) to 8.0&amp;nbsp;μm ([[infrared]]). High quality synthetic VUV grade MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is quite expensive, in the region of $3/kg (2007) but the real cost of optics in this material is due to relatively low volume manufacture. However, with [[lithium fluoride]] it is one of the two materials that will transmit in the vacuum ultraviolet range at 121&amp;nbsp;nm (Lyman alpha) and this is where it finds its application. Lower grade MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is sometimes used in the [[infrared]] but here it is inferior to [[calcium fluoride]]. MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is tough and works and polishes well, but it is slightly [[Birefringence|birefringent]] and should be cut with the [[optic axis of a crystal|optic axis]] perpendicular to the plane of the window or lens.&lt;ref name="Aigueperse 2005"/&gt;

Due to its having a suitable [[refractive index]] of 1.37, thin layers of MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are very commonly used on the surfaces of optical elements as inexpensive [[anti-reflective coating]]s.

The [[Verdet constant]] of (MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm is 0.00810{{nbsp}}arcmin/G&amp;sdot;cm.&lt;ref&gt;J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans., 1996, 92, 2753 - 2757.  {{DOI|10.1039/FT9969202753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Chronic exposure to magnesium fluoride may affect the skeleton, kidneys, central nervous system, respiratory system, eyes and skin, and may cause or aggravate attacks of asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espimetal.com/index.php/msds/658-Magnesium%20Fluoride|title=Magnesium Fluoride Material Safety Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=August 2004|website=ESPI Metals|access-date=October 13, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the software sense|monolithic system}}
'''Monolithic architecture''' describes buildings which are carved, cast or excavated from a single piece of material, historically from rock. The most basic form of [[monolith]]ic architecture is a [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut building]], such as the [[monolithic church]]es of [[Ethiopia]] built by the [[Zagwe dynasty]], or the [[Pancha Rathas]] in [[India]].  These are cut out of solid rock, to which they remain attached at the base.  In most cases this is evident from the remaining surrounding rock, but sometimes a building is cut from an [[outcrop]], as in the [[Shore Temple]] in southern India, and only inspection at close quarters reveals that the building is monolithic.

The terms ''monolith'' and ''[[monolithic column]]'' are normally used for objects made from a single large piece of rock which is detached from the ground. They may have been moved a considerable distance, as with several ancient [[Egyptian obelisk]]s, which have been moved across the world. Buildings with a structural material that is poured into place, most commonly [[concrete]], can also be described as monolithic. Extreme examples are [[monolithic dome]]s, where the material is sprayed inside of a [[Formwork|form]] to produce the solid structure.

An ancient example of a monolithic dome is that of the [[Mausoleum of Theodoric]] in [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]], whose roof is made from a single stone.

'''Murray River National Park''' is a [[protected area]]  in [[South Australia]] located between {{convert|180|km}} and {{convert|240|km|abbr=on}} north east of the [[Adelaide city centre]].  The national park was proclaimed in 1972 "to conserve a significant proportion of South Australia’s floodplain environments which are not represented widely in other reserve systems."  The national park consists of three sections adjoining the [[Murray River]] and extending from near [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]] in the south west to near [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]] in the north-east.  The first which is known as the ‘Katarapko’ section is located on the north side of the river between Loxton in the south and [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]] in the north.  The second section which is known as the ‘Lyrup Flats’ section is located on the north side of the river midway between Berri and Loxton.  The third section is known as the ‘Bulyong’ section is located on the west side of the river upstream from Renmark.     The national park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category VI – Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources|Category VI protected area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Murray River National Park (Including Rilli Island, Media Island and Kapunda Island) Management Plan Amendment 2010|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/5248692b-f15c-4392-8bf7-9e4f00b1710c/murray-river-np-mp-amendment.pdf|publisher= Department for Environment and Natural Resources |accessdate=16 January 2015|date= 2010|pages =1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Murray River National Park Management Plan (including Rilli Island, Media Island and Kapunda Island Conservation Park)|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/7589f3c0-69c8-4dd5-a0ed-9e4f00b1cf45/PARKS_PDFS_MURRAY_RIVER_NP_MP.pdf|publisher= Department for Environment and Natural Resources |accessdate=16 January 2015|date= 1994|pages =vi-vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title= Terrestrial Protected Areas of South Australia (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nemateleotris helfrichi''', '''Helfrich's Dartfish''', is a [[species]] of [[dartfish]] native to the [[Pacific Ocean]].

==Description==
They are small fishes that grow to a maximum length of {{convert|6|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;	Lieske, E. and R. Myers, 1994. Collins Pocket Guide. Coral reef fishes. Indo-Pacific &amp; Caribbean including the Red Sea. Harper Collins Publishers, 400 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They have bright yellow head with purple forehead with purple and white shades on body.&lt;ref name=liveaq&gt;[http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=15+1636+171&amp;pcatid=171 Saltwater Aquarium Fish for Marine Aquariums: Firefish, Helfrichi]&lt;/ref&gt; They have 7 [[Fish fin|dorsal spines]] 28-31 [[Fish fin|dorsal soft rays]] and 1 [[Fish fin|anal spine]]   26-28 [[Fish fin|anal soft rays]].&lt;ref name=fbase&gt;[http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=12750 Nemateleotris helfrichi, Helfrichs' dartfish : aquarium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and Habitat==
They are present in the [[Pacific Ocean]] between latitudes 16°N and  28°S. Their range extends from [[Indonesia]] to [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]. They prefer deeper waters than other [[Nemateleotris]]. They are found swimming a few meters above the water bed. They are found at a depths between and are rarely found above {{convert|40|m}}.&lt;ref name=fbase/&gt;

==Diet==
They are [[carnivorous]]. ''N. helfrichi'' mainly feed on [[zooplankton]]s, [[amphipods]], [[copepods]], small [[crustaceans]] and [[shrimp]] larvae.&lt;ref name=aqdom&gt;[http://www.aquariumdomain.com/viewSpeciesMarine.php?id=111/ Helfrichi Firefish,  Species Profile, Hobbyist Guide, Care Instructions, Feeding and more.]&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to lose their bright colour if their dietary requirements are not met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bluezooaquatics.com/productdetail.asp?did=1&amp;cid=283&amp;pid=694 Helfrich's Firefish, Helfrich's Dartfish - Nemateleotris helfrichi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
The species is [[monogamous]] and are usually found in pairs.&lt;ref name=fbase/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whiteman, E.A. and I.M. Côté, 2004. Monogamy in marine fishes. Biol. Rev. 79:351-375.&lt;/ref&gt; They are territorial and will fight with [[conspecifics]] unless they are a pair.&lt;ref name=liveaq/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Tullock|first=John|title=Saltwater Aquarium Models|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken|isbn=9780470119471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fmar&gt;[http://www.freshmarine.com/helfrich-firefish-goby.html FreshMarine.com - Helfrich's Firefish Goby - Nemateleotris helfrichi]&lt;/ref&gt; The species is shy and hides in small caves when threatened.&lt;ref name=fmar/&gt;

==In the aquarium==
Due to their bright colour they are very popular as a marine aquarium fish. They are also more delicate and rare form than other more common firefish species (as evidenced by their price) and should be kept by marine-aquarists of intermediate expertise or higher.

==Name==
The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honours Philip Helfrich, an Emeritus Director and Researcher, [[Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology]] ([[University of Hawaii]]), and the director of the [[Mid-Pacific Research Laboratory|Eniwetok Marine Biological Laboratory]], who collected some of the first specimens of this species.&lt;ref name = ETYFish&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.etyfish.org/gobiiformes6/ | title = Order GOBIIFORMES: Family GOBIIDAE (i-p) | accessdate= 17 August 2018 | author1 = Christopher Scharpf | author2 = Kenneth J.

[[File:Apocalypse 38. A new heaven and new earth. Revelation cap 21. Mortier's Bible. Phillip Medhurst Collection.jpg|thumb|right|{{bibleref2|Rev.|21:1|NIV|''A new heaven and new earth''}}, Mortier's Bible, [[c:User:Phillip Medhurst|Phillip Medhurst]] Collection]]
The '''New Earth''' is an expression used in the [[Book of Isaiah]] (Is 65:17 &amp; 66:22), [[Second Epistle of Peter|2 Peter]] (2 Peter 3:13), and the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev 21:1) in the [[Bible]] to describe the final state of [[Redemption (theology)|redeemed humanity]]. It is one of the central doctrines of [[Christian eschatology]] and is referred to in the [[Nicene Creed]] as the [[world to come]].

==Biblical references==
The twenty-first chapter of the Book of Revelation introduces the final state of perfection where, according to one commentator, "cosmic time has been turned into eternity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon J. Kistemaker]], ''Exposition of the Book of Revelation'' (New Testament Commentary; Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 2001), 554.&lt;/ref&gt;  In symbolic and visual language, God allows John to see the glory and beauty of the inheritance of His people. The first thing the reader notices about this vision is that it includes a "new heavens and a new earth" (21:1). To understand what the Bible teaches about eternity, the reader of the Apocalypse must understand the New Testament doctrine of the "[[New Heaven and New Earth|New Heavens and the New Earth]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Cottrell]], ''The Faith Once for All: Bible Doctrine for Today'' (Joplin, Mo.: College Press Pub., 2002), 564–572; David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, The Church and the Last Things (Wheaton, Ill.: Crossway Books, 1998), 246–248; G. C. Berkouwer, The Return of Christ (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 210-234.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The basic difference with [[Mosaic covenant|the promises of the]] [[Old Testament]] is that in Revelation they also have an [[ontology|ontological]] value ({{bibleref2|Rev.|21:1;4|NIV}}: "Then I saw 'a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea...'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death' or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away") and no longer just [[gnosiology|gnosiological]] ({{bibleref2|Isaiah|65:17|NIV}}: "See, I will create/new heavens and a new earth./The former things will not be remembered,/nor will they come to mind").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=[[Joel B. Green]], Jacqueline Lapsley, Rebekah Miles, Allen Verhey |title=Dictionary of Scripture and Ethics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8fxBvvFu2l8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2011 |publisher=[[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Books]] |location=[[Ada Township, Michigan]] |isbn=1-44123998-7 |id={{ISBN|978-1-441-23998-3}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=8fxBvvFu2l8C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22promise+of+a+renewal+of+all+creation,+a+hope+present+in+OT+prophetic+literature+(Isa.+65:17%22%22but+portrayed+most+strikingly+through+Revelation's+vision%22%22divine+king+of+creation+promises+to+renew+all+of+reality%22 190] |quote=This goodness theme is advanced most definitively through the promise of a renewal of all creation, a hope present in OT prophetic literature (Isa. 65:17–25) but portrayed most strikingly through Revelation's vision of a “new heaven and a new earth” (Rev. 21:1). There the divine king of creation promises to renew all of reality: “See, I am making all things new” (Rev. 21:5).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=Steve Moyise, Maarten J.J.

In addition to the passing of the former heaven and earth, John also asserts that the sea was no more in 21:1c.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But, in accordance with [[New covenant|his promise]], we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home ({{bibleref2|2 Peter|3:13|NRSV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interpretation==
In [[Koine Greek]], there were two words that are translated as "new" in the English Bible; ''neos'' and ''kainos''. One Greek resource states:

{{quote|As distinct from néos, "new in time," kainós means "new in nature" (with an implication of "better"). Both words suggest "unfamiliar," "unexpected," "wonderful," and the distinction fades with time.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kittel, G. Friedrich, G. W. Bromiley (1995, c1985). Theological Dictionary of the New Testament. Translation of: Theologisches Wörterbuch zum Neuen Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: W. B. Eerdmans), 388.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  

That ''kainos'' should not be taken as something totally new can be seen in a passage like the following:
{{quote|If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! (2 Corinthians 5:17)}}

Here the [[Apostle Paul]] uses ''kainos'' in the expression "new creation." Paul did not intend to convey the idea that this is a completely different individual. There is continuity between the old person and the new person to such an extent that it remains the same person, but renovated. The person is the same, but the quality of that person has been transformed.

In the same way, the biblical concept of the New Earth is one of renovation and restoration. Either on this current earth or on rebuilt new planet. This conclusion is supported by Peter's words in his public speech in the temple at Jerusalem. 

{{quote|Repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord; and that he may send Jesus, the Christ appointed for you, whom heaven must receive until the period of the restoration of all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient time.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 3:19-21&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

This earth, however, will be either cleansed or destroyed by fire for the purpose of restoration as expressed in the following passage:
{{quote|But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed. Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved, and the elements will melt with fire? (2 Peter 3:10-12)}}

An '''optical rectenna''' is a [[rectenna]] ('''rect'''ifying an'''tenna''') that works with visible or infrared light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rectenna Solar Cells |year=2013 |editors=Garret Moddel and Sachit Grover |isbn=978-1-4614-3716-1 |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461437154}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rectenna is a circuit containing an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and a [[diode]], which turns electromagnetic waves into [[direct current]] [[electricity]]. While rectennas have long been used for [[radio wave]]s or [[microwave]]s, an optical rectenna would operate the same way but with infrared or visible light, turning it into electricity.

While traditional (radio- and microwave) rectennas are fundamentally similar to optical rectennas, it is vastly more challenging in practice to make an optical rectenna. One challenge is that light has such a high frequency—hundreds of [[Hertz|terahertz]] for visible light—that only a few types of specialized diodes can switch quickly enough to rectify it. Another challenge is that antennas tend to be a similar size to a wavelength, so a very tiny optical antenna requires a challenging [[nanotechnology]] fabrication process. A third challenge is that, being very small, an optical antenna typically absorbs very little power, and therefore tend to produce a tiny voltage in the diode, which leads to low diode nonlinearity and hence low efficiency. Due to these and other challenges, optical rectennas have so far been restricted to laboratory demonstrations, typically with intense focused laser light producing a tiny but measurable amount of power.

Nevertheless, it is hoped that arrays of optical rectennas could eventually be an efficient means of converting sunlight into electric power, producing [[solar power]] more efficiently than conventional [[solar cell]]s.  The idea was first proposed by Robert L. Bailey in 1972.&lt;ref name="Corkish"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Corkish | first = R | author2 = M.A Green | author3 = T Puzzer | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 395–401 | title = Solar energy collection by antennas | doi = 10.1016/S0038-092X(03)00033-1 | issn = 0038-092X | accessdate = 2012-05-28 | date = December 2002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X03000331 | bibcode=2002SoEn...73..395C}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, only a few optical rectenna devices have been built, demonstrating only that energy conversion is possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/13f254/lexicon.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown if they will ever be as cost-effective or efficient as conventional [[photovoltaic cells]].

The term '''nantenna''' (nano-antenna) is sometimes used to refer to either an optical rectenna, or an optical antenna by itself. Currently, Idaho National Laboratories has designed an optical antenna to absorb wavelengths in the range of 3–15 μm.&lt;ref name ="Novack"&gt;{{Cite conference

==History==
Robert Bailey, along with James C. Fletcher, received a patent ({{patent|US|3760257}}) in 1973 for an "electromagnetic wave energy converter". The patented device was similar to modern day optical rectennas. The patent discusses the use of a diode "type described by [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Ali Javan]]] in the IEEE Spectrum, October, 1971, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5217817 page 91]", to whit, a 100&amp;nbsp;nm-diameter metal [[cat's whisker]] to a metal surface covered with a thin oxide layer. Javan was reported as having rectified 58&amp;nbsp;THz infrared light. In 1974, T. Gustafson and coauthors demonstrated that these types of devices could rectify even visible light to DC current&lt;ref name = "Heiblum"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Heiblum | first = M. | author2 = Shihyuan Wang | author3 = Whinnery, John R. | author4 = Gustafson, T. | journal = IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–169 | title = Characteristics of integrated MOM junctions at DC and at optical frequencies |doi = 10.1109/JQE.1978.1069765 | issn = 0018-9197 | date = March 1978 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1069765| bibcode = 1978IJQE...14..159H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvin M. Marks received a patent in 1984 for a device explicitly stating the use of sub-micron antennas for the direct conversion of light power to electrical power.&lt;ref name="patent2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4445050.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4445050&amp;RS=PN/4445050|title=United States Patent: 4445050 - Device for conversion of light power to electric power|author=|date=|website=uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks’s device showed substantial improvements in efficiency over Bailey’s device.&lt;ref name = "Lin"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lin | first = Guang H. | author2 = Reyimjan Abdu | author3 = John O'M. Bockris | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 565–568 | title = Investigation of resonance light absorption and rectification by subnanostructures | doi = 10.1063/1.362762 | issn = 0021-8979 | date = 1996-07-01 | url = http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v80/i1/p565_s1| bibcode = 1996JAP....80..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, Guang H. Lin reported resonant light absorption by a fabricated nanostructure and rectification of light with frequencies in the visible range.&lt;ref name = "Lin"/&gt; In 2002, ITN Energy Systems, Inc. published a report on their work on optical antennas coupled with high frequency [[diode]]s. ITN set out to build an optical rectenna array with single digit efficiency. Although they were unsuccessful, the issues associated with building a high efficiency optical rectenna were better understood.&lt;ref name="Berland"/&gt;

In 2015, [[Baratunde A. Cola]]'s research team at the   [[Georgia Institute of Technology]],    developed   a solar energy collector that can convert optical light to DC current,  an optical rectenna using carbon nanotubes,.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A carbon nanotube optical rectenna|url = https://zenodo.org/record/851685|journal = Nature Nanotechnology|doi = 10.1038/nnano.2015.220|first = Asha|last = Sharma|first2 = Virendra|last2 = Singh|first3 = Thomas L.|last3 = Bougher|first4 = Baratunde A.|last4 = Cola|volume=10|pages=1027–1032|bibcode = 2015NatNa..10.1027S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical arrays of multiwall [[Carbon nanotube|carbon nanotubes]] (MWCNTs) grown on a metal-coated substrates were coated with insulating aluminum oxide and altogether capped with a metal electrode layer. The small dimensions of the nanotubes act as antennae, capable of capturing optical wavelengths. The MWCNT also doubles as one layer of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) [[Tunnel diode|tunneling diode]]. Due to the small diameter of MWCNT tips, this combination forms a diode that is capable of rectifying the high frequency optical radiation. The overall achieved conversion efficiency of this device is around 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; %.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nonetheless, optical rectenna research is ongoing.

The primary drawback of these carbon nanotube rectenna devices is a lack of air stability. The device structure originally reported by Cola used calcium as a semitransparent top electrode because the low work function of calcium (2.9 eV) relative to MWCNTs (~5 eV) creates the diode asymmetry needed for optical rectification. However, metallic calcium is highly unstable in air and oxidizes rapidly. Measurements had to be made within a glovebox under an inert environment to prevent device breakdown. This limited practical application of the devices. 

Cola and his team later solved the challenges with device instability by modifying the diode structure with multiple layers of oxide. In 2018 they reported the first air-stable optical rectenna along with efficiency improvements. 

The air-stability of this new generation of rectenna was achieved by tailoring the diode's quantum tunneling barrier. Instead of a single dielectric insulator, they showed that the use of multiple dissimilar oxide layers enhances diode performance by modifying diode tunneling barrier. By using oxides with different electron affinities, the electron tunneling can be engineered to produce an asymmetric diode response regardless of the work function of the two electrodes. By using layers of Al2O3 and HfO2, a double-insulator diode was constructed that improved the diode's asymmetric response more than 10-fold without the need for low work function calcium, and the top metal was subsequently replaced with air-stable silver.

Future efforts have been undertaken to improve the device efficiency by investigating alternative materials, manipulating the MWCNTs and the insulating layers to encourage conduction at the interface, and reduce resistances within the structure.

==Theory==

The theory behind optical rectennas is essentially the same as for traditional (radio or microwave) [[rectenna]]s. Incident light on the antenna causes electrons in the antenna to move back and forth at the same frequency as the incoming light. This is caused by the oscillating electric field of the incoming electromagnetic wave. The movement of electrons is an alternating current (AC) in the antenna circuit. To convert this into [[direct current]] (DC), the [[alternating current|AC]] must be rectified, which is typically done with a [[diode]]. The resulting DC current can then be used to power an external load.
The resonant frequency of antennas (frequency which results in lowest impedance and thus highest efficiency) scales linearly with the physical dimensions of the antenna according to simple microwave antenna theory.&lt;ref name="Berland"/&gt;  The wavelengths in the solar spectrum range from approximately 0.3-2.0 μm.&lt;ref name="Berland"/&gt; Thus, in order for a rectifying antenna to be an efficient electromagnetic collector in the solar spectrum, it needs to be on the order of hundreds of nm in size.

[[Image:Skin Effect.png|right|250px|thumb| Figure 3. Image showing the skin effect at high frequencies. The dark region, at the surface, indicates electron flow where the lighter region (interior) indicates little to no electron flow.]]

Because of simplifications used in typical rectifying antenna theory, there are several complications that arise when discussing optical rectennas. At frequencies above infrared, almost all of the current is carried near the surface of the wire which reduces the effective cross sectional area of the wire, leading to an increase in resistance. This effect is also known as the “[[skin effect]]”. From a purely device perspective, the I-V characteristics would appear to no longer be ohmic, even though Ohm’s law, in its generalized vector form, is still valid.

Another complication of scaling down is that [[diode]]s used in larger scale rectennas cannot operate at THz frequencies without large loss in power.&lt;ref name="Novack"/&gt; The large loss in power is a result of the junction capacitance (also known as parasitic capacitance) found in p-n junction diodes and Schottky diodes, which can only operate effectively at frequencies less than 5 THz.&lt;ref name="Berland"/&gt;  The ideal wavelengths of 0.4–1.6&amp;nbsp;μm correspond to frequencies of approximately 190–750&amp;nbsp;THz, which is much larger than the capabilities of typical diodes. Therefore, alternative diodes need to be used for efficient power conversion. In current optical rectenna devices, [[metal-insulator-metal]] (MIM) [[Tunnel diode|tunneling diodes]] are used. Unlike Schottky diodes, MIM diodes are not affected by [[parasitic capacitance]]s because they work on the basis of [[Quantum tunnelling|electron tunnel]]ing. Because of this, MIM diodes have been shown to operate effectively at frequencies around {{nowrap|150 THz}}.&lt;ref name="Berland"/&gt;

==Advantages==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2011}}
One of the biggest claimed advantages of optical rectennas is their high theoretical efficiency. When compared to the theoretical efficiency of single junction solar cells (30%), optical rectennas appear to have a significant advantage. However, the two efficiencies are calculated using different assumptions.
The assumptions involved in the rectenna calculation are based on the application of the Carnot efficiency of solar collectors. The [[Carnot efficiency]], η, is given by

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \eta = 1 - \frac{T_\text{cold}}{T_\text{Hot}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;cold&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the cooler body and T&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the warmer body. In order for there to be an efficient energy conversion, the temperature difference between the two bodies must be significant. {{nowrap|R. L. Bailey}} claims that rectennas are not limited by Carnot efficiency, whereas [[photovoltaics]] are. However, he does not provide any argument for this claim. Furthermore, when the same assumptions used to obtain the 85% theoretical efficiency for rectennas are applied to single junction solar cells, the theoretical efficiency of single junction solar cells is also greater than 85%.

The most apparent advantage optical rectennas have over semiconductor photovoltaics is that rectenna arrays can be designed to absorb any frequency of light. The resonant frequency of an optical antenna can be selected by varying its length. This is an advantage over semiconductor photovoltaics, because in order to absorb different wavelengths of light, different band gaps are needed. In order to vary the band gap, the semiconductor must be alloyed or a different semiconductor must be used altogether.&lt;ref name ="Novack"/&gt;

==Limitations and disadvantages==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2011}}
As previously stated, one of the major limitations of optical rectennas is the frequency at which they operate. The high frequency of light in the ideal range of wavelengths makes the use of typical Schottky diodes impractical. Although MIM diodes show promising features for use in optical rectennas, more advances are necessary to operate efficiently at higher frequencies.&lt;ref name="ids.nic.in"&gt;http://ids.nic.in/Tnl_Jces_May%202012/PDF1/pdf/6.Nanteena.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another disadvantage is that current optical rectennas are produced using electron beam ([[Electron beam processing|e-beam]]) lithography. This process is slow and relatively expensive because parallel processing is not possible with e-beam lithography. Typically, e-beam lithography is used only for research purposes when extremely fine resolutions are needed for minimum feature size (typically, on the order of nanometers). However, photolithographic techniques have advanced to where it is possible to have minimum feature sizes on the order of tens of nanometers, making it possible to produce rectennas by means of photolithography.&lt;ref name="ids.nic.in"/&gt;

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
After the proof of concept was completed, laboratory-scale silicon wafers were fabricated using standard semiconductor integrated circuit fabrication techniques. E-beam lithography was used to fabricate the arrays of loop antenna metallic structures. The optical antenna consists of three main parts: the ground plane, the optical resonance cavity, and the antenna. The antenna absorbs the electromagnetic wave, the ground plane acts to reflect the light back towards the antenna, and the optical resonance cavity bends and concentrates the light back towards the antenna via the ground plane.&lt;ref name ="Novack"/&gt; This work did not include production of the diode.

===Lithography method===
Idaho National Labs used the following steps to fabricate their optical antenna arrays. A metallic ground plane was deposited on a bare silicon wafer, followed by a sputter deposited amorphous silicon layer. The depth of the deposited layer was about a quarter of a wavelength. A thin manganese film along with a gold frequency selective surface (to filter wanted frequency) was deposited to act as the antenna.  Resist was applied and patterned via electron beam lithography. The gold film was selectively etched and the resist was removed.

===Roll-to-roll manufacturing===
In moving up to a greater production scale, laboratory processing steps such as the use of [[electron beam lithography]] are slow and expensive. Therefore, a [[roll-to-roll processing|roll-to-roll manufacturing]] method was devised using a new manufacturing technique based on a master pattern. This master pattern mechanically stamps the precision pattern onto an inexpensive flexible substrate and thereby creates the metallic loop elements seen in the laboratory processing steps. The master template fabricated by Idaho National Laboratories consists of approximately 10 billion antenna elements on an 8-inch round silicon wafer. Using this semi-automated process, Idaho National Labs has produced a number of 4-inch square [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]]. These coupons were combined to form a broad flexible sheet of antenna arrays. This work did not include production of the diode component.

===Atomic layer deposition===
Researchers at the University of Connecticut are using a technique called selective area atomic layer deposition that is capable of producing them reliably and at industrial scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UConn Professor’s Patented Technique Key to New Solar Power Technology|url=http://today.uconn.edu/blog/2013/02/uconn-professors-patented-technique-key-to-new-solar-power-technology/|publisher=University of Connecticut|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research is ongoing to tune them to the optimal frequencies for visible and infrared light.

==Proof of principle==
The proof of principle for optical antennas (but not optical-frequency diodes) started out with a 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; silicon substrate with the printed antenna array filling the area. The device was tested using infrared light with a range of 3 to 15&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]. The peak emissivity is found to be centered at 6.5&amp;nbsp;µm and reaches an emissivity of 1. An emissivity of 1 means the antenna absorbs all of the photons of a specific wavelength (in this case, 6.5&amp;nbsp;µm) that are incident upon the device.&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Robinson, Keith. Spectroscopy: The Key to the Stars. New York: Springer, 2007. Springer Link. University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 20 Apr. 2009 &lt;http://www.springerlink.com/content/p3878194r0p70370/?p=900b261891484572a965aca5acb7d079&amp;pi=0&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the experimental spectrum to the modeled spectrum, the experimental results are in agreement with theoretical expectations (Figure 5). In some areas, the antenna had a lower emissivity than the theoretical expectations, but in other areas, namely at around 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm, the device absorbed more light than expected.

[[File:Nantenna Results.png|right|400px|thumb| Figure 5. Experimental and theoretical emissivity as a function of wavelength. The experimental spectrum was determined by heating the optical antenna to {{nowrap|200 °C}} and comparing the spectral radiance to blackbody emission at {{nowrap|200 °C}}.]]

After a proof of concept on a stiff silicon substrate, the experiment was replicated on a flexible polymer-based substrate. The target wavelength for the flexible substrate was set to 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Initial tests show that the antenna design can be translated to a polymer substrate, but further experiments are needed to fully optimize the characteristics.

The proof of principle of optical antennas can be realized in [[radio frequency]] range. High permittivity dielectric particles can be used to simulate silicon behaviour at optical frequencies. This allows to perform experiment at microwave in order to predict antenna behavior at optics.

==Economics of optical antennas==
Optical antennas (by itself, omitting the crucial diode and other components) are cheaper than photovoltaics (if efficiency is ignored). While materials and processing of photovoltaics are expensive (currently the cost for complete photovoltaic modules is in the order of {{nowrap|430 [[United States dollar|USD]] / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in 2011 and declining.&lt;ref name="solarbuzz"&gt;Solarbuzz PV module pricing survey, May 2011 &lt;http://solarbuzz.com/facts-and-figures/retail-price-environment/module-prices&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), Steven Novack estimates the current cost of the antenna material itself as around {{nowrap|5 - 11 USD / m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in 2008.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;“[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93872974 Nanoheating]”, Talk of the Nation. National Public Radio. 22 Aug. 2008. Transcript. NPR. 15 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With proper processing techniques and different material selection, he estimates that the overall cost of processing, once properly scaled up, will not cost much more. His prototype was a {{nowrap|30 x 61 cm}} of plastic, which contained only {{nowrap|0.60 USD}} of [[gold]] in 2008, with the possibility of downgrading to a material such as [[aluminum]], [[copper]], or [[silver]].&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, Hank. “[http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1357/ Nano-Antennas for Solar, Lighting, and Climate Control]”, ''Ecogeek''. 7 Feb. 2008.  15 Feb. 2009. Interview with Dr. Novack.&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype used a silicon substrate due to familiar processing techniques, but any substrate could theoretically be used as long as the ground plane material adheres properly.

==Future research and goals==
In an interview on National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation, Dr. Novack claimed that optical rectennas could one day be used to power cars, charge cell phones, and even cool homes. Novack claimed the last of these will work by both absorbing the infrared heat available in the room and producing electricity which could be used to further cool the room. (Other scientists have disputed this, saying it would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Springer New York |isbn = 978-1-4614-3715-4 |pages = 3–24 |editor = Garret Moddel |editor2 = Sachit Grover  |last = Moddel |first = Garret |title = Rectenna Solar Cells |chapter = Will Rectenna Solar Cells Be Practical? |date = 2013 |chapterurl = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3716-1_1}} Quote: "There has been some discussion in the literature of using infrared rectennas to harvest heat radiated from the earth’s surface. This cannot be accomplished with ambient-temperature solar cells due to the second law of thermodynamics" (page 18)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.J. Byrnes |author2=R.

However, these analyses have neglected the thermal fluctuations of the diode, as discussed below and in ref. 12, which leads to the absurd conclusion that a room-temperature device can generate useful power from collecting the ambient radiation from room-temperature objects."&lt;/ref&gt;)

Improving the diode is an important challenge. There are two challenging requirements: Speed and nonlinearity. First, the diode must have sufficient speed to rectify visible light. Second, unless the incoming light is extremely intense, the diode needs to be extremely nonlinear (much higher forward current than reverse current), in order to avoid "reverse-bias leakage". An assessment for solar energy collection found that, to get high efficiency, the diode would need a (dark) current much lower than 1μA at 1V reverse bias.&lt;ref&gt;''Rectenna Solar Cells'', ed. Moddel and Grover, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment assumed (optimistically) that the antenna was a [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|directional antenna array]] pointing directly at the sun; a rectenna that collects light from the whole sky, like a typical silicon solar cell does, would need the reverse-bias current to be even lower still, by orders of magnitude. (The diode simultaneously needs a high forward-bias current, related to impedance-matching to the antenna.)

There are special diodes for high speed (e.g., the metal-insulator-metal tunnel diodes discussed above), and there are special diodes for high nonlinearity, but it is quite difficult to find a diode that is outstanding in both respects at once.

To improve the efficiency of carbon nanotube-based rectenna:
* Low [[work function]]: A large work function (WF) difference between the MWCNT is needed to maximize diode asymmetry, which lowers the turn-on voltage required to induce a photoresponse. The WF of carbon nanotubes is 5 eV and the WF of the calcium top layer is 2.9 eV, giving a total work function difference of 2.1 eV for the MIM diode.  
* High transparency: Ideally, the top electrode layers should be transparent to allow incoming light to reach the MWCNT antennae.  
* Low electrical resistance: Improving device conductivity increases the rectified power output. But there are other impacts of resistance on device performance. Ideal impedance matching between the antenna and diode enhances rectified power. Lowering structure resistances also increases the diode cutoff frequency, which in turn enhances the effective bandwidth of rectified frequencies of light. The current attempt to use calcium in the top layer results in high resistance due to the calcium oxidizing rapidly.

Researchers currently hope to create a rectifier which can convert around 50% of the antenna's absorption into energy.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;
Another focus of research will be how to properly upscale the process to mass-market production. New materials will need to be chosen and tested that will easily comply with a roll-to-roll manufacturing process. Future goals will be to attempt to manufacture devices on pliable substrates to create flexible solar cells.

'''Power Augmented Ram thrust''' (or '''PAR thrust''' for short) is the use of displaced [[air]] in enhancing the air cushion under the wings or body of what is normally a [[Ground effect vehicle|Wing In Ground-effect or WIG craft]]. The system can also be used in surface effect ships to increase their top speed.

The configuration can use either the exhaust gases from [[jet engine]]s or [[propeller]]s slipstream from either the main engines or special assist engines.  This [[acceleration|accelerated]] air is then either [[ducted fan|ducted]], deflected or directed in such a manner that it will pass underneath the [[wing]] or [[fuselage|body]] and assist in the creation of an air cushion.  The purpose of using PAR thrust is to allow the craft to take off at lower speeds than those required if the system was not used.

Some craft only use PAR thrust during takeoff; notable examples of this are the KM and [[Lun-class ekranoplan|Lun Ekranoplanes]] that situated their jet engines forward of the wing and deflected the thrust downwards under the wing. Once airborne and at a speed where sufficient lift was generated by the wing alone, the deflection could be removed. The KM required 10 [[turbojet]]s to have enough power to take off, 8 of them operating in PAR mode; once in level flight, the engines could be throttled back extensively or some of them even shut off.

A notable spin-off of this technique was the [[A-90 Orlyonok]] [[ekranoplan]]e, which was powered in flight by a massive [[Kuznetsov (aircraft engines)|Kuznetsov]] [[Kuznetsov NK-12|NK-12]] [[turboprop]] (by far the most powerful ever built), and required two large [[turbofan]]s embedded in the nose for take-off, whose ducts pointed permanently downwards under the wings to provide PAR thrust. These engines were shut down during flight to reduce [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|fuel consumption]].

Some other craft such as [[Burt Rutan]]'s PARLC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stargazer2006.online.fr/others/parlc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606034735/http://stargazer2006.online.fr/others/parlc.htm |archivedate=2013-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Strizh PE-201, Volga 2, Ivolga and other [[ground effect vehicle|WIG craft]] use this system.  Boats that use this system ([[surface effect ship]]s) require permanent use of PAR thrust in order to achieve enough [[Lift (force)|lift]] for normal operation.

'''Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading''' was a Task Group set up on 10 December 2006 by Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] to develop an [[Australian Carbon Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2F68QL6%22|archivedate=15 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215194133/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2F68QL6%22|title=Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading|first=John|last=Howard|author-link=John Howard|date=10 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of reference of the task group was:
:Australia enjoys major competitive advantages through the possession of large reserves of fossil fuels and uranium. In assessing Australia’s further contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, these advantages must be preserved. 

:Against this background the Task Group will be asked to advise on the nature and design of a workable global emissions trading system in which Australia would be able to participate. The Task Group will advise and report on additional steps that might be taken, in Australia, consistent with the goal of establishing such a system.

The Prime Ministerial Task Group submitted its final report on 31 May 2007. The scheme proposed by the Task Group had some similarities to the "hybrid scheme" developed by [[Warwick McKibbin]]. 

Prime Minister [[John Howard]] announced on 4 June 2007 the government's plan for a carbon trading scheme to be launched in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Taipei Times |date=4 June 2007 |accessdate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard took the draft carbon trading scheme to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]].

==Background==
Australian state and territory governments, through the [[Council for the Australian Federation]] (CAF) in January 2004 set up a working group to investigate the design of a national emissions trading scheme (NETS). This working group became the [[National Emissions Trading Taskforce]] (NETT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/source/national-emissions-trading-taskforce National Emissions Trading Taskforce]&lt;/ref&gt; NETT reported  progress to CAF in December 2004, including the  development of 10 key design propositions as a basis for further investigation and analysis of a NETS. After extensive consultations, on 28 August 2006 NETT published its final report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caf.gov.au/Documents/nett-discussion-paper.pdf Possible Design for a National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2007 CAF declared:  

:Premiers and Chief Ministers expressed their expectation that the Prime Minister would make a commitment to the introduction of a national emissions trading scheme following receipt of the Task Group report in May 2007. If the Commonwealth refuses to commit at this time, the States and Territories will introduce an emissions trading scheme by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gov.au/research/supporting/emissions-trading/emissionstrading.pdf Productivity Commission Submission to the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2007, the federal Labor Opposition and the Labor-controlled state and territory governments commissioned the separate [[Garnaut Climate Change Review]]. 

==Membership==
The Task Group members included:
* [[Peter Shergold]], (Chair) Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet 
* [[David Borthwick (public servant)|David Borthwick]], Secretary, Department of the Environment and Heritage
* Peter Coates, Executive Committee Member, Xstrata

'''Reedy Creek Energy Services''' (RCES) is a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It operates the  [[electricity|electric]] and other utility transmission and distribution systems of the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (RCID) on behalf of the district which specifically covers [[Walt Disney World]] outside [[Orlando, Florida]]. Some power is produced by the district-owned power plant north of [[The Magic Kingdom]] with the remainder purchased from the public [[power grid]]. Officially the utility systems are owned by the district entity itself and the district "contracts" with RCES to operate the systems. 

In addition to electric power, RCES handles all public services and public works for the RCID:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myflorida.com/rcid/deptlist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Electric]]
* Hot water
* Chilled water
* Natural gas
* Fuel oil distribution
* [[Potable water]] (drinking)
* [[Sewage]] and [[wastewater]] treatment
* [[Solid waste]]
* Reclaimed water
* [[Recycling]] and drainage control
* Roadway maintenance

RCES is currently Disney's only non-entertainment-related subsidiary. Until 2001, Disney and [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] owned [[Vista-United Telecommunications]], a telephone company that served the RCID. That company has since been sold to [http://www.smartcitytelecom.com/ Smart City Telecom].

[[File:Kalanchoe veg.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Production of new individuals along a leaf margin of the  miracle leaf plant (''[[Kalanchoe pinnata]]''). The small plant in front is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;in) tall. The concept of "individual" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]
'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s – "offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].

In asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.

==Asexual==
{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}
Asexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of "splitting" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.

Some species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]—reproduction without seeds or spores—but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].

Other ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some
[[reptile]]s,&lt;ref name="reptiles"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles &amp; Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986

It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.

==Sexual==
{{Main article|Sexual reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}} 
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating in midair flight]]
Sexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called "plus" and "minus" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 79, No. 3 (Sep. 30, 1938), pp. 411-434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858}}&lt;/ref&gt; have more than two  "sexes", called [[syngen]]s.
Most [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that "the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases" where recombination occurs freely.&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Otto and D. B. Goldstein. "Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy". [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]. Vol 131 (1992): 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE. (1987) The molecular basis of the evolution of sex. ''Adv Genet.'' '''24''':323-370. Review. {{PMID|3324702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.

===Allogamy===
{{Main article|Allogamy}}
Allogamy is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)

===Autogamy===
{{main article|Autogamy}}
Self-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term "autogamy" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532–542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.

===Mitosis and meiosis===
[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].

'''Mitosis'''
The resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.
{{Clear}}&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] --&gt;
'''Meiosis'''
The resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell. A [[diploid]] cell duplicates itself, then undergoes two divisions ([[tetraploid]] to diploid to haploid), in the process forming four [[haploid]] cells. This process occurs in two phases, meiosis I and meiosis II.

==Same-sex==
In recent decades, developmental biologists have been researching and developing techniques to facilitate same-sex reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samesexprocreation.com/timeline.htm |title=Timeline of same-sex procreation scientific developments |publisher=samesexprocreation.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The obvious approaches, subject to a growing amount of activity, are [[female sperm]] and [[male egg]]s, with female sperm closer to being a reality for humans, given that Japanese scientists have already created female sperm for chickens. "However, the ratio of produced W chromosome-bearing (W-bearing) spermatozoa fell substantially below expectations. It is therefore concluded that most of the W-bearing PGC could not differentiate into spermatozoa because of restricted spermatogenesis."&lt;ref name="chicken sperm"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=9227893|title=Differentiation of female chicken primordial germ cells into spermatozoa in male gonads|publisher= | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169X.1997.t01-2-00002.x|volume=39|issue=3|date=June 1997|pages=267–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, by altering the function of a few genes involved with imprinting, other Japanese scientists combined two mouse eggs to produce daughter mice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Washington Post |date=April 22, 2004 |title=Japanese scientists produce mice without using sperm |publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUIgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wYQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6950,1352704&amp;dq=japanese+scientists+combine+two+mouse+eggs+to+produce+daughter+mice&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018 Chinese scientists created 29 female mice from two female mice mothers but were unable to produce viable offspring from two father mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-father-necessary-as-mice-are-created-with-two-mothers-2vskf8w58|title=No father necessary as mice are created with two mothers|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|date=2018-10-12|work=The Times|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en|issn=0140-0460|subscription=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhi-Kun|last2=Wang|first2=Le-Yun|last3=Wang|first3=Li-Bin|last4=Feng|first4=Gui-Hai|last5=Yuan|first5=Xue-Wei|last6=Liu|first6=Chao|last7=Xu|first7=Kai|last8=Li|first8=Yu-Huan|last9=Wan|first9=Hai-Feng|date=2018-10-01|title=Generation of Bimaternal and Bipaternal Mice from Hypomethylated Haploid ESCs with Imprinting Region Deletions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934590918304417|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2018.09.004|issn=1934-5909|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==
&lt;!--[[Reproductive strategy]], [[Reproduction strategy]] and [[Reproduction strategies]] redirect here--&gt;
{{further information|Modes of reproduction|Life history theory}}

There are a wide range of reproductive strategies employed by different species. Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after birth and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10–30 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10–14 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.

===Other types===
{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}
* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.
* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].
* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].

==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

Organisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.

Many organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.

When food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]] and Bernstein et al.).&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H., Bernstein C. and Michod R.E. (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19: 357-382 in ''DNA Repair'', Inna Kruman (Ed.), InTech (publisher) {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}}. Available online from [http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair intechopen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other "over-wintering" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can "wait out" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.

==Life without==
The existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].

Scientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12114528&amp;dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]&lt;br/&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]&lt;/ref&gt; However, viruses are often regarded as not alive. Being nothing more than a bit of RNA or DNA in a protein capsule, they have no [[metabolism]] and can only [[self-replication|replicate]] with the assistance of a hijacked [[cell (biology)|cell]]'s metabolic machinery.

The production of a truly living organism (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would be a much more complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A [[Synthetic Genomics|synthetic genome]] has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial production of a new ''[[M. mycoides]]'' organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1190719| pmid = 20488990| year = 2010| last1 = Gibson | first1 = D.| last2 = Glass | first2 = J.| last3 = Lartigue | first3 = C.| last4 = Noskov | first4 = V.| last5 = Chuang | first5 = R.| last6 = Algire | first6 = M.| last7 = Benders | first7 = G.| last8 = Montague | first8 = M.| last9 = Ma | first9 = L.| last10 = Moodie | first10 = M.

There is some debate within the scientific community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic&lt;ref name="venter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703559004575256470152341984|title=Scientists Create First Synthetic Cell|author=Robert Lee Hotz|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term "synthetic bacterial cell" but they also clarify "...we do not consider this to be "creating life from scratch" but rather we are creating new life out of already existing life using synthetic DNA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/first-self-replicating-synthetic-bacterial-cell/faq |title=FAQ |author=Craig Venter Institute |accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that "they are pretty clearly human inventions".&lt;ref name="venter"/&gt; Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield "truly programmable organisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = W. Wayte Gibbs | title = Synthetic Life | journal = Scientific American | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=synthetic-life| date = May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers involved stated that the creation of "true synthetic biochemical life" is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3214/01.html |title= NOVA: Artificial life |accessdate=2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lottery principle==
Sexual reproduction has many drawbacks, since it requires far more energy than asexual reproduction and diverts the organisms from other pursuits, and there is some argument about why so many species use it. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of "winning" - that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

A '''ship graveyard''' or '''ship cemetery''' is a location where the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s of [[ship breaking|scrapped]] [[ship]]s are left to decay and disintegrate, or left in [[reserve fleet|reserve]]. Such a practice is now less common due to waste regulations and so some dry docks where ships are [[Shipbreaking|broken]] (to recycle their metal and remove dangerous materials like [[asbestos]]) are also known as ship graveyards.

By analogy, the phrase can also refer to a large number of [[shipwreck]]s which have accumulated in a single area but not been removed by human agency, instead being left to disintegrate naturally. These can form in places where navigation is difficult or dangerous (such as [[List of shipwrecks of the Seven Stones Reef|the Seven Stones]], off Cornwall, or [[Blackpool shipwrecks|Blackpool]], on the Irish Sea); or where a large number of ships have been deliberately [[scuttling|scuttled]] together ([[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|as with the]] German [[High Seas Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]]); or where a large number of ships have been sunk in battle (such as [[Ironbottom Sound]], in the pacific).

'''Silk''' is a natural [[protein]] [[fiber]], some forms of which can be [[weaving|woven]] into [[textile]]s. The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of [[fibroin]] and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/silk|title=Silk|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known silk is obtained from the [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s of the [[larva]]e of the [[mulberry]] [[silkworm]] ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' reared in captivity ([[sericulture]]). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular [[prism (optics)|prism]]-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different [[angle]]s, thus producing different colors.

Silk is produced by several insects, like silk worms but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing. There has been some research into other types of silk, which differ at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Sutherland TD, Young JH, Weisman S, Hayashi CY, Merritt DJ 2010 171–88"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sutherland TD, Young JH, Weisman S, Hayashi CY, Merritt DJ |title=Insect silk: one name, many materials|journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]]|volume=55|issue=|pages=171–88|year=2010|pmid=19728833|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-112408-085401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk is mainly produced by the [[larva]]e of insects undergoing [[Holometabolism|complete metamorphosis]], but some insects such as [[webspinner]]s and [[Gryllacrididae|raspy crickets]] produce silk throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Walker AA, Weisman S, Church JS, Merritt DJ, Mudie ST, Sutherland TD |year=2012|title=Silk from Crickets: A New Twist on Spinning|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=e30408|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030408|pmid=22355311|pmc=3280245|bibcode=2012PLoSO...730408W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk production also occurs in [[Hymenoptera]] ([[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s, and [[ant]]s), [[silverfish]], [[mayfly|mayflies]], [[thrips]], [[leafhopper]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[lacewing]]s, [[flea]]s, [[fly|flies]], and [[midge]]s.&lt;ref name="Sutherland TD, Young JH, Weisman S, Hayashi CY, Merritt DJ 2010 171–88"/&gt; Other types of [[arthropod]] produce silk, most notably various [[arachnid]]s such as [[spider]]s.

==Etymology==
The word silk comes from {{lang-ang|sioloc}}, from {{lang-grc|σηρικός|translit=sērikós}}, "silken", ultimately from an Asian source — compare [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] {{lang|zh-Latn|sī}} "silk", [[Manchu language|Manchurian]] {{lang|mnc-Latn|sirghe}}, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] {{lang|mn-Latn|sirkek}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=silk&amp;searchmode=none |title=Silk |work=Etymonline |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214224755/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=silk&amp;searchmode=none |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of silk}}

===Wild silk===
{{Main|Wild silk}}[[File:Silk from Mawangdui 2.jpg|thumb|right|Woven silk textile from tomb no 1. at [[Mawangdui]] in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province, [[China]], from the [[Western Han Dynasty]], 2nd century BC]]Several kinds of [[wild silk]], which are produced by [[caterpillar]]s other than the [[mulberry]] silkworm, have been known and used in [[China]], [[South Asia]], and [[Europe]] since ancient times. However, the scale of production was always far smaller than for cultivated silks. There are several reasons for this: first, they differ from the domesticated varieties in colour and [[wikt:texture|texture]] and are therefore less uniform; second, cocoons gathered in the wild have usually had the pupa emerge from them before being discovered so the silk thread that makes up the cocoon has been torn into shorter lengths; and third, many wild cocoons are covered in a mineral layer that prevents attempts to reel from them long strands of silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silk Production Takes a Walk on the Wild Side|author=Sindya N. Bhanoo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/science/24obsilk.html?_r=3&amp;emc=eta1|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=26 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109043733/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/science/24obsilk.html?_r=3&amp;emc=eta1|archivedate=9 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the only way to obtain silk suitable for spinning into textiles in areas where commercial silks are not cultivated was by tedious and labor-intensive [[carding]].

Commercial silks originate from reared silkworm pupae, which are bred to produce a white-colored silk thread with no mineral on the surface. The pupae are killed by either dipping them in boiling water before the adult moths emerge or by piercing them with a needle.

Legend gives credit for developing silk to a Chinese empress, [[Leizu]] (Hsi-Ling-Shih, Lei-Tzu). Silks were originally reserved for the Emperors of China for their own use and gifts to others, but spread gradually through [[Chinese culture]] and trade both geographically and socially, and then to many regions of [[Asia]]. Because of its texture and lustre, silk rapidly became a popular luxury fabric in the many areas accessible to Chinese merchants. Silk was in great demand, and became a staple of pre-[[industrial revolution|industrial]] international [[trade]]. In July 2007, archaeologists discovered intricately woven and dyed silk [[textile]]s in a tomb in [[Jiangxi]] province, dated to the Eastern [[Zhou Dynasty]] roughly 2,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="people's daily"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/6228297.html|title = Chinese archaeologists make ground-breaking textile discovery in 2,500-year-old tomb|accessdate = 26 August 2007|work = |publisher = People's Daily Online.|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013190840/http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/6228297.html|archivedate = 13 October 2007|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although historians have suspected a long history of a formative textile industry in ancient China, this find of silk textiles employing "complicated techniques" of weaving and dyeing provides direct evidence for silks dating before the [[Mawangdui]]-discovery and other silks dating to the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC-220 AD).&lt;ref name="people's daily"/&gt;

Silk is described in a chapter on mulberry planting by Si Shengzhi of the Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD). There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han (25–220 AD) document.

Silk has a long history in India. It is known as ''Resham'' in eastern and north India, and ''Pattu'' in southern parts of [[India]]. Recent archaeological discoveries in [[Harappa]] and [[Chanhu-daro]] suggest that [[sericulture]], employing [[wild silk]] threads from native [[silkworm]] species, existed in [[South Asia]] during the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) dating between 2450 BC and 2000 BC, while "hard and fast evidence" for silk production in China dates back to around 2570 BC.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott |first=Phill |doi=10.1038/457945a|date=17 February 2009 |title=Rethinking silk's origins : Nature News |publisher=Nature.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Good |first1=I.L. |last2=Kenoyer |first2=J.M.| last3=Meadow |first3=R.H. |title=New evidence for early silk in the Indus civilization |journal=Archaeometry |volume=50 |page=457 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00454.x |issue=3 |url=http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1900/version/1/files/npre20081900-1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelagh Vainker, a silk expert at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, who sees evidence for silk production in China "significantly earlier" than 2500–2000 BC, suggests, "people of the Indus civilization either harvested silkworm cocoons or traded with people who did, and that they knew a considerable amount about silk."&lt;ref name=nat/&gt;

India is the second largest producer of silk in the world after China. About 97% of the raw mulberry silk comes from six Indian states, namely, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Bihar]] and [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnsericulture.gov.in/sericultureNov12/BriefNoteOnSericulture.htm Tn Sericulture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819023205/http://tnsericulture.gov.in/SericultureNov12/BriefNoteOnSericulture.htm |date=19 August 2014 }}.

India is also the largest consumer of silk in the world. The tradition of wearing silk sarees for marriages and other auspicious ceremonies is a custom in Assam and southern parts of India. Silk is considered to be a symbol of royalty, and, historically, silk was used primarily by the upper classes. Silk garments and [[saree]]s produced in [[Kanchipuram]], [[Bhoodhan Pochampally|Pochampally]], [[Dharmavaram, Anantapur|Dharmavaram]], [[Mysore]], [[Arni, Tiruvannamalai|Arani]] in the south, [[Banaras]] in the north, [[Bhagalpur]] and [[Murshidabad]] in the east are well recognized. In the northeastern state of [[Assam]], three different types of silk are produced, collectively called [[Assam silk]]: Muga, Eri and Pat silk. Muga, the golden silk, and Eri are produced by silkworms that are native only to Assam.

===Thailand===
{{Main|Thai silk}}
Silk is produced year-round in Thailand by two types of silkworms, the cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving is considered to be a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have their own typical silks. A single thread [[fiber|filament]] is too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a reeling machine for this task, but some silk threads are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.

The silk fabric is soaked in extremely cold water and bleached before dyeing to remove the natural yellow coloring of Thai silk yarn. To do this, skeins of silk thread are immersed in large tubs of [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Once washed and dried, the silk is woven on a traditional hand-operated loom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkok-thailand.com/about-thai-silk.htm About Thai silk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509190809/http://www.bangkok-thailand.com/about-thai-silk.htm |date=9 May 2007 }} from World of Thai Silk (commercial)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rajshahi Division]] of northern Bangladesh is the hub of the country's silk industry. There are three types of silk produced in the region: mulberry, endi and tassar. [[Bengal]]i silk was a major item of international trade for centuries. It was known as Ganges silk in medieval Europe. Bengal was the leading exporter of silk between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Silk Silk – Banglapedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195226/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Silk |date=4 March 2016 }}.

In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', 19.233, when Odysseus, while pretending to be someone else, is questioned by Penelope about her husband's clothing, he says that he wore a shirt "gleaming like the skin of a dried onion" (varies with translations, literal translation here)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' '''19''' 233–234:

[[Aristotle]] wrote of ''[[Coa vestis]]'', a wild silk textile from [[Kos]].
[[Sea silk]] from certain large sea shells was also valued.
The [[Roman Empire]] knew of and traded in silk, and Chinese silk was the most highly priced luxury good imported by them.&lt;ref name=gart/&gt; During the reign of emperor [[Tiberius]], [[sumptuary laws]] were passed that forbade men from wearing silk garments, but these proved ineffectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Legend has it that monks working for the emperor [[Justinian I]] [[Smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire|smuggled silkworm eggs]] to [[Constantinople]] in hollow canes from China. All top-quality looms and weavers were located inside the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace complex]] in Constantinople, and the cloth produced was used in imperial robes or in diplomacy, as gifts to foreign dignitaries. The remainder was sold at very high prices.

===Middle East===
In the [[Torah]], a scarlet cloth item called in Hebrew "sheni tola'at" שני תולעת – literally "crimson of the worm" – is described as being used in purification ceremonies, such as those following a leprosy outbreak (Leviticus 14), alongside [[Cedar wood|cedar]] wood and [[hyssop]] ([[za'atar]]). Eminent scholar and leading medieval translator of [[Jewish]] sources and books of the [[Bible]] into [[Arabic]], Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], translates this phrase explicitly as "crimson silk" – חריר קרמז حرير قرمز.

In [[Islamic]] teachings, Muslim men are forbidden to wear silk. Many religious jurists believe the reasoning behind the prohibition lies in avoiding clothing for men that can be considered feminine or extravagant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Modern attire has raised a number of issues, including, for instance, the permissibility of wearing silk [[necktie]]s, which are masculine articles of clothing.

Despite injunctions against silk for men, silk has retained its popularity in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] because of its permissibility for women, and due to the presence of non-Muslim communities. The Muslim [[Moors]] brought silk with them to Spain during their conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Italy was the most important producer of silk during the Medieval age. The first center to introduce silk production to Italy was the city of [[Catanzaro]] during the 11th century in the region of [[Calabria]]. The silk of Catanzaro supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair in the port of [[Reggio Calabria]], to Spanish, Venetian, Genovese and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became the lace capital of the world with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was world-famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officeoftourism.org/europe/italy/Calabria/catanzaro.asp|title=Office of Tourism – Italy – Calabria, Catanzaro|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821045739/http://www.officeoftourism.org/europe/italy/Calabria/catanzaro.asp|archivedate=21 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable center was the Italian [[city-state]] of [[Republic of Lucca|Lucca]] which largely financed itself through silk-production and silk-trading, beginning in the 12th century. Other Italian cities involved in silk production were [[Genoa]], [[Venice]] and [[Florence]].

The [[Llotja de la Seda|Silk Exchange in Valencia]] from the 15th century—where previously in 1348 also ''perxal'' ([[percale]]) was traded as some kind of silk—illustrates the power and wealth of one of the great Mediterranean mercantile cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/782|title=La Lonja de la Seda de Valencia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=2011-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514032507/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/782|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diccionari Aguiló: materials lexicogràfics / aplegats per Marià Aguiló i Fuster; revisats i publicats sota la cura de Pompeu Fabra i Manuel de Montoliu, page 134, [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]], Barcelona 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 15th century, silk production in France has been centered around the city of [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] where many mechanic tools for mass production were first introduced in the 17th century.
[[File:Anoniem - La charmante rencontre.JPG|thumb|"La charmante rencontre", rare 18th century embroidery in silk of Lyon (private collection)]]
[[James I of England|James I]] attempted to establish silk production in England, purchasing and planting 100,000 mulberry trees, some on land adjacent to [[Hampton Court Palace]], but they were of a species unsuited to the silk worms, and the attempt failed. In 1732 John Guardivaglio set up a silk throwing enterprise at [[List of mills in Stockport|Logwood mill in Stockport]]; in 1744, Burton Mill was erected in [[Macclesfield]]; and in 1753 Old Mill was built in [[Congleton]].&lt;ref name=Callender&gt;{{Harvnb|Callandine|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three towns remained the centre of the English silk throwing industry until silk throwing was replaced by [[silk waste|silk waste spinning]]. British enterprise also established silk filature in [[Cyprus]] in 1928. In England in the mid-20th century, raw silk was produced at [[Lullingstone Castle]] in Kent. Silkworms were raised and reeled under the direction of Zoe Lady Hart Dyke, later moving to [[Ayot St Lawrence]] in Hertfordshire in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lullingstone Silk Farm|url=http://www.lullingstonecastle.co.uk/component/content/article/223|website=www.lullingstonecastle.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110040554/http://www.lullingstonecastle.co.uk/component/content/article/223|archivedate=10 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
Wild silk taken from the nests of native caterpillars was used by the [[Aztecs]] to make containers and as paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.G.|first=Kevan,|last2=R.A.|first2=Bye,|date=1991|title=natural history, sociobiology, and ethnobiology of Eucheira socialis Westwood (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), a unique and little-known butterfly from Mexico|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301742531|journal=Entomologist|language=English|issn=0013-8878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/latin-american-insects-and-entomology/oclc/25164105|title=Latin American insects and entomology|last=Hogue|first=Charles Leonard|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520078497|location=Berkeley|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silkworms were introduced to [[Oaxaca Valley|Oaxaca]] from Spain in the 1530s and the region profited from silk production until the early 17th century, when the king of Spain banned export to protect Spain's silk industry.

King [[James VI and I|James I]] introduced silk-growing to the British colonies in America around 1619, ostensibly to discourage [[tobacco]] planting. The [[Shakers]] in Kentucky adopted the practice.  [[File:Yếm lụa đào.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yếm]] – the traditional silken bra in Vietnam]]

In the 19th century a new attempt at a silk industry began with European-born workers in [[Paterson, New Jersey]], and the city became a silk center in the United States. [[Manchester, Connecticut]] emerged as center of the silk industry in America from the late 19th through the mid-20th century. The Cheney Brothers Historic District showcases mills refurbished as apartments and includes nearby museums.

[[World War II]] interrupted the silk trade from Asia, and silk prices increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weatherford | first=D | title=American Women During World War II: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Routledge | year=2009 | page=97 | isbn=0415994756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. industry began to look for substitutes, which led to the use of [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic]]s such as [[nylon]]. Synthetic silks have also been made from [[lyocell]], a type of [[cellulose]] fiber, and are often difficult to distinguish from real silk (see [[spider silk]] for more on synthetic silks).

===Malaysia===
In [[Terengganu]], which is now part of [[Malaysia]], a second generation of silkworm was being imported as early as 1764 for the country's silk textile industry, especially [[songket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5Te9LWyzQvYC|page=899}} |title=The Malayhandloom weavers:a study of the rise and decline of traditional |accessdate=2013-11-09|isbn=9789813016996 |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1980s, Malaysia is no longer engaged in sericulture but does plant mulberry trees.

===Vietnam===

In Vietnamese legend, silk appeared in the sixth dynasty of [[Hùng Vương]].

The environmental impact of silk production is potentially large when compared with other natural fibers. A life cycle assessment of Indian silk production shows that the production process has a large carbon and water footprint, mainly due to the fact that it is an animal-derived fiber and more inputs such as fertilizer and water are needed per unit of fiber produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Astudillo|first1=Miguel F.|last2=Thalwitz|first2=Gunnar|last3=Vollrath|first3=Fritz|title=Life cycle assessment of Indian silk|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=October 2014|volume=81|pages=158–167|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

[[File:Models by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Models in silk dresses at the MoMo Falana fashion show]]

===Physical properties===
Silk fibers from the ''Bombyx mori'' silkworm have a [[triangle|triangular]] [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] with rounded corners, 5–10 [[μm]] wide. The fibroin-heavy chain is composed mostly of [[beta-sheet]]s, due to a 59-mer amino acid repeat sequence with some variations.&lt;ref&gt;"Handbook of Fiber Chemistry", Menachem Lewin, Editor, 3rd ed., 2006, CRC press, {{ISBN|0-8247-2565-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flat surfaces of the fibrils reflect [[light]] at many angles, giving silk a natural sheen. The cross-section from other silkworms can vary in shape and diameter: crescent-like for ''Anaphe'' and elongated wedge for ''tussah''. Silkworm fibers are naturally extruded from two silkworm glands as a pair of primary filaments (brin), which are stuck together, with sericin proteins that act like [[glue]], to form a [[bave]]. Bave diameters for tussah silk can reach 65 μm. See cited reference for cross-sectional SEM photographs.&lt;ref&gt;"Handbook of Fiber Chemistry", Menachem Lewin, Editor, 2nd ed.,1998, Marcel Dekker, pp. 438–441, {{ISBN|0-8247-9471-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Silk raw 01a.jpg|thumb|left|Raw silk of domesticated silk worms, showing its natural shine.]]
Silk has a smooth, soft texture that is not slippery, unlike many [[synthetic fiber]]s.

Silk is one of the strongest natural fibers, but it loses up to 20% of its strength when wet. It has a good [[moisture regain]] of 11%. Its [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] is moderate to poor: if elongated even a small amount, it remains stretched. It can be weakened if exposed to too much sunlight. It may also be attacked by insects, especially if left dirty.

One example of the durable nature of silk over other fabrics is demonstrated by the recovery in 1840 of silk garments from a [[HMS Royal George (1756)|wreck of 1782]]: 'The most durable article found has been silk; for besides pieces of cloaks and lace, a pair of black satin breeches, and a large satin waistcoat with flaps, were got up, of which the silk was perfect, but the lining entirely gone ... from the thread giving way ... No articles of dress of woollen cloth have yet been found.'&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', London, article CS117993292, 12 October 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silk is a poor conductor of [[electricity]] and thus susceptible to [[static cling]].  Silk has a high emissivity for infrared light, making it feel cool to the touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Venere|first1=Emil|title=Silk fibers could be high-tech 'natural metamaterials'|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-01-silk-fibers-high-tech-natural-metamaterials.html|accessdate=2 February 2018|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unwashed silk chiffon may [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrink]] up to 8% due to a relaxation of the fiber macrostructure, so silk should either be washed prior to garment construction, or [[Dry cleaning|dry cleaned]]. Dry cleaning may still shrink the chiffon up to 4%. Occasionally, this shrinkage can be reversed by a gentle steaming with a press cloth. There is almost no gradual shrinkage nor shrinkage due to molecular-level deformation.

Natural and synthetic silk is known to manifest [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties in proteins, probably due to its molecular structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.tx.ncsu.edu/Past_Meetings/Spring_2003_Loughborough/papers/081-Ellison.pdf|title=Piezoelectricity in Natural and Synthetic Silks|accessdate=28 April 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011853/http://fs.tx.ncsu.edu/Past_Meetings/Spring_2003_Loughborough/papers/081-Ellison.pdf|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silkworm silk was used as the standard for the [[Denier (measure)|denier]], a measurement of [[linear density]] in fibers. Silkworm silk therefore has a linear density of approximately 1 den, or 1.1 [[dtex]].

===Chemical properties===
Silk emitted by the silkworm consists of two main proteins, [[sericin]] and [[fibroin]], fibroin being the structural center of the silk, and serecin being the sticky material surrounding it. Fibroin is made up of the [[amino acid]]s [[Glycine|Gly]]-[[Serine|Ser]]-Gly-[[Alanine|Ala]]-Gly-Ala and forms [[beta sheet|beta pleated sheet]]s. [[Hydrogen bond]]s form between chains, and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network.

The high proportion (50%) of glycine allows tight packing. This is because glycine's R group is only a hydrogen and so is not as sterically constrained. The addition of alanine and serine makes the fibres strong and resistant to breaking. This tensile strength is due to the many interceded hydrogen bonds, and when stretched the force is applied to these numerous bonds and they do not break.

Silk is resistant to most [[mineral acid]]s, except for [[sulfuric acid]], which dissolves it. It is yellowed by perspiration. Chlorine bleach will also destroy silk fabrics.

==Variants==

=== Regenerated silk fiber ===
RSF is produced by chemically dissolving silkworm cocoons, leaving their molecular structure intact. The silk fibers dissolve into tiny thread-like structures known as [[microfibril]]s. The resulting solution is extruded through a small opening, causing the microfibrils to reassemble into a single fiber. The resulting material is reportedly twice as stiff as silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/regenerated-silk-fiber/52128|title=To almost match spider silk, scientists regenerate silkworm silk|last=|first=|date=|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Turkeye.Urgüp02.jpg|thumb|Silk filaments being unravelled from silk cocoons, [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]], 2007.]]

=== Clothing ===
Silk's [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbency]] makes it comfortable to wear in warm weather and while active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is often used for clothing such as [[shirt]]s, [[necktie|ties]], [[blouse]]s, formal [[dress]]es, high fashion clothes, [[lining (sewing)|lining]], [[lingerie]], [[pajama]]s, [[robe]]s, dress [[Formal wear|suits]], sun dresses and Eastern [[folk costume]]s. For practical use, silk is excellent as clothing that protects from many biting [[insects]] that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as [[mosquitoes]] and [[Horse-fly|horseflies]].

Fabrics that are often made from silk include [[charmeuse]], [[habutai]], [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]], [[crape|crepe de chine]], [[dupioni]], [[noil]], [[tussah]], and [[shantung (fabric)|shantung]], among others.

=== Furniture ===
Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many [[furnishing]] applications. It is used for [[upholstery]], wall coverings, window treatments (if blended with another fiber), [[Carpet|rug]]s, [[bedding]] and wall hangings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Industry ===
Silk had many industrial and commercial uses, such as in [[parachute]]s, bicycle [[tire]]s, [[silk comforter|comforter filling]] and [[artillery]] [[gunpowder]] bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_646357|title=Silk Powder or Cartridge Bag Cloth|publisher=americanhistory.si.edu|accessdate=2017-05-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109202452/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_646357|archivedate=9 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
A special manufacturing process removes the outer [[sericin]] coating of the silk, which makes it suitable as non-absorbable [[surgical suture]]s. This process has also recently led to the introduction of specialist silk underclothing, which has been used for skin conditions including [[eczema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14746626|year=2004|author1=Ricci|first1=G|title=Clinical effectiveness of a silk fabric in the treatment of atopic dermatitis|journal=The British Journal of Dermatology|volume=150|issue=1|pages=127–31|last2=Patrizi|first2=A|last3=Bendandi|first3=B|last4=Menna|first4=G|last5=Varotti|first5=E|last6=Masi|first6=M|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05705.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17033173|year=2006|author1=Senti|first1=G|title=Antimicrobial silk clothing in the treatment of atopic dermatitis proves comparable to topical corticosteroid treatment|journal=Dermatology|volume=213|issue=3|pages=228–33|last2=Steinmann|first2=L.

===Biomaterial===
Silk has been considered as a luxurious textile since 3630 BC. However, it started to serve also as a biomedical material for suture in surgeries decades ago. In the past 30 years, it has been widely studied and used as a biomaterial, which refers to materials used for medical applications in organisms, due to its excellent properties, including remarkable mechanical properties, comparative biocompatibility, tunable degradation rates ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'', the ease to load cellular growth factors (for example, BMP-2), and the ability to be processed into several other formats such as films, gels, particles, and scaffolds.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rockwood|first=Danielle N|last2=Preda|first2=Rucsanda C|last3=Yücel|first3=Tuna|last4=Wang|first4=Xiaoqin|last5=Lovett|first5=Michael L|last6=Kaplan|first6=David L|title=Materials fabrication from ''Bombyx mori'' silk fibroin|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=6|issue=10|pages=1612–1631|doi=10.1038/nprot.2011.379|pmc=3808976|pmid=21959241|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silks from ''Bombyx mori'', a kind of cultivated silkworm, are the most widely investigated silks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altman|first=Gregory H|last2=Diaz|first2=Frank|last3=Jakuba|first3=Caroline|last4=Calabro|first4=Tara|last5=Horan|first5=Rebecca L|last6=Chen|first6=Jingsong|last7=Lu|first7=Helen|last8=Richmond|first8=John|last9=Kaplan|first9=David L|date=2003-02-01|title=Silk-based biomaterials|journal=Biomaterials|volume=24|issue=3|pages=401–416|doi=10.1016/S0142-9612(02)00353-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silks derived from ''Bombyx mori'' are generally made of two parts: the [[silk fibroin]] fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa and a heavy chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vepari|first=Charu|last2=Kaplan|first2=David L.|date=2007-08-01|title=Silk as a biomaterial|journal=Progress in Polymer Science|series=Polymers in Biomedical Applications|volume=32|issue=8–9|pages=991–1007|doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2007.05.013|pmc=2699289|pmid=19543442}}&lt;/ref&gt;) linked by a single disulfide bond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Cong-Zhao|last2=Confalonieri|first2=Fabrice|last3=Medina|first3=Nadine|last4=Zivanovic|first4=Yvan|last5=Esnault|first5=Catherine|last6=Yang|first6=Tie|last7=Jacquet|first7=Michel|last8=Janin|first8=Joel|last9=Duguet|first9=Michel|date=2000-06-15|title=Fine organization of ''Bombyx mori'' fibroin heavy chain gene|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=28|issue=12|pages=2413–2419|pmc=102737|pmid=10871375|doi=10.1093/nar/28.12.2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a glue-like protein, [[sericin]], comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic [[beta sheet]] blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens of times that of [[Polylactic acid|poly(lactic acid)]] and hundreds of times that of [[collagen]]. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have found their way into tendon tissue engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kardestuncer|first=T|last2=McCarthy|first2=M B|last3=Karageorgiou|first3=V|last4=Kaplan|first4=D|last5=Gronowicz|first5=G|title=RGD-tethered Silk Substrate Stimulates the Differentiation of Human Tendon Cells|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00003086-200607000-00034|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=448|pages=234–239|doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000205879.50834.fe|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.

Most products fabricated from regenerated silk are weak and brittle, with only ≈1–2% of the mechanical strength of native silk fibers due to the absence of appropriate secondary and hierarchical structure,

====Biocompatibility====
Biocompatibility, i.e., to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is a critical issue for biomaterials. The issue arose during its increasing clinical use. Wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as the extent of the removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yaopeng|last2=Yang|first2=Hongxia|last3=Shao|first3=Huili|last4=Hu|first4=Xuechao|date=2010-05-05|title=Antheraea pernyiSilk Fiber: A Potential Resource for Artificially Biospinning Spider Dragline Silk|journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=2010|pages=1–8|doi=10.1155/2010/683962|pmc=2864894|pmid=20454537}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wray|first=Lindsay S.|last2=Hu|first2=Xiao|last3=Gallego|first3=Jabier|last4=Georgakoudi|first4=Irene|last5=Omenetto|first5=Fiorenzo G.|last6=Schmidt|first6=Daniel|last7=Kaplan|first7=David L.|date=2011-10-01|title=Effect of processing on silk-based biomaterials: Reproducibility and biocompatibility|journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials|language=en|volume=99B|issue=1|pages=89–101|doi=10.1002/jbm.b.31875|pmc=3418605|pmid=21695778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meinel|first=Lorenz|last2=Hofmann|first2=Sandra|last3=Karageorgiou|first3=Vassilis|last4=Kirker-Head|first4=Carl|last5=McCool|first5=John|last6=Gronowicz|first6=Gloria|last7=Zichner|first7=Ludwig|last8=Langer|first8=Robert|last9=Vunjak-Novakovic|first9=Gordana|date=2005-01-01|title=The inflammatory responses to silk films in vitro and in vivo|journal=Biomaterials|volume=26|issue=2|pages=147–155|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2004.02.047}}&lt;/ref&gt; when assessed with human mesenchymal [[stem cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Thus, appropriate degumming and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Hongbin|last2=Liu|first2=Haifeng|last3=Toh|first3=Siew L.|last4=Goh|first4=James C.H.|title=Anterior cruciate ligament regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells and silk scaffold in large animal model|journal=Biomaterials|volume=30|issue=28|pages=4967–4977|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.05.048|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minoura|first=N.|last2=Aiba|first2=S.|last3=Higuchi|first3=M.|last4=Gotoh|first4=Y.|last5=Tsukada|first5=M.|last6=Imai|first6=Y.|date=1995-03-17|title=Attachment and growth of fibroblast cells on silk fibroin|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|volume=208|issue=2|pages=511–516|pmid=7695601|doi=10.1006/bbrc.1995.1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gellynck|first=Kris|last2=Verdonk|first2=Peter C.

====Biodegradability====
Biodegradability (also known as [[biodegradation]])--the ability to be disintegrated by biological approaches, including bacteria, fungi, and cells—is another significant property of biomaterials today. Biodegradable materials can minimize the pain of patients from surgeries, especially in tissue engineering, there is no need of surgery in order to remove the scaffold implanted. Wang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yongzhong|last2=Rudym|first2=Darya D.|last3=Walsh|first3=Ashley|last4=Abrahamsen|first4=Lauren|last5=Kim|first5=Hyeon-Joo|last6=Kim|first6=Hyun S.|last7=Kirker-Head|first7=Carl|last8=Kaplan|first8=David L.|title=In vivo degradation of three-dimensional silk fibroin scaffolds|journal=Biomaterials|volume=29|issue=24–25|pages=3415–3428|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.05.002|pmc=3206261|pmid=18502501|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed the in vivo degradation of silk via aqueous 3-D scaffolds implanted into Lewis rats. [[Enzyme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the means used to achieve degradation of silk in vitro. Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus and α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreases are the two popular enzymes for silk degradation. In addition, [[Gamma Radiation|gamma-radiation]], as well as [[cell metabolism]], can also regulate the degradation of silk.

Compared with synthetic biomaterials such as [[polyglycolide]]s and [[polylactide]]s, silk is obviously advantageous in some aspects in biodegradation. The acidic degraded products of polyglycolides and polylactides will decrease the pH of the ambient environment and thus adversely influence the metabolism of cells, which is not an issue for silk. In addition, silk materials can retain strength over a desired period from weeks to months as needed by mediating the content of beta sheets.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Thai man spools silk at Jim Thompson House photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Thai man spools silk]]
[[File:Bombyx mori Cocon 02.jpg|thumb|[[Pupa#Cocoon|Cocoon]]]]
Silk [[moth]]s lay eggs on specially prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh [[mulberry]] leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and are ready to begin spinning a cocoon. A straw frame is placed over the tray of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins spinning a cocoon by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin, a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into moths to breed the next generation of caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of silk.&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Carrie (2006) ''The Biography of Silk''. Crabtree Publishing Company. p. 12. {{ISBN|0778724875}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights==
As the process of harvesting the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae by boiling them, sericulture has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists.&lt;ref name=Stancati2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stancati|first1=Margherita|title=Taking the Violence Out of Silk|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/01/04/taking-the-violence-out-of-silk/|accessdate=22 January 2015|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=4 Jan 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122231507/http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/01/04/taking-the-violence-out-of-silk/|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] was critical of silk production based on the [[Ahimsa]] philosophy which led to promotion of cotton and [[Ahimsa silk]], a type of [[wild silk]] made from the cocoons of wild and semi-wild silk moths.&lt;ref name="AlexanderCentenary1968"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Horace Gundry|last2=Centenary|first2=National Committee for the Gandhi|title=Mahatma Gandhi: 100 years|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LGVuAAAAMAAJ|page=349}}|year=1968|publisher=[[Gandhi Peace Foundation]]; &amp;#91;sole distributors: Orient Longmans&amp;#93;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
[[File:2008Computex Taiwan Design Innovation Pavilion DuckImage Vogue Solar Backpack.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Solar backpack]]
* A solar backpack system known as ''Rucksack Enhanced Portable Power System (REPPS)'', developed by the [[United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center]], features a 62-watt solar panel ''blanket'' in a backpack for use by the [[US army]] based in [[Afghanistan]]. The [[US Air Force]] had previously employed solar panels on shipping containers, developed by [[Lockheed Martin]], while the [[Marines]] developed suitcase units of foldable solar panels which can also be carried as a backpack. As military equipment like radios and GPS units require lots of energy, these portable solar power systems were designed to minimize dependence of troops on [[fossil fuel]]s in [[combat|combat zones]]. The ''REPPS'' is currently utilized by the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team in [[Logar, Afghanistan]]. It is used to power electronic devices with a charging time of just 6 hours. As it weighs at around 10 pounds, it can be carried as a backpack easily. In addition to solar power, it can also convert ac power from wall outlets and utilize power from disposable batteries and vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/u-s-army-to-use-solar-backpacks-in-afghanistan/|title=U.S. Army to Use Solar Backpacks In Afghanistan|publisher=inhabitat.com|accessdate=2011-07-25|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[physics]], the '''solidus''' is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of temperatures (a curve on a [[phase diagram]]) below which a given substance is completely [[solid]] (crystallized). The solidus is applied, among other materials, to [[metal]] [[alloy]]s, [[ceramic]]s, and natural rocks and [[mineral]]s.

The solidus quantifies the temperature at which [[melting]] of a substance ''begins'', but the substance is not necessarily melted ''completely'', i.e., the solidus is not necessarily a [[melting point]]. For this distinction, the solidus may be contrasted to the [[liquidus]]. The solidus is always less than or equal to the liquidus, but they need not coincide. If a gap exists between the solidus and liquidus it is called the freezing range, and within that gap, the substance consists of a mixture of solid and liquid phases (like a [[slurry]]). Such is the case, for example, with the [[olivine]] ([[forsterite]]-[[fayalite]]) system.

In [[eutectic]] mixtures the solidus and liquidus temperatures coincide at a point known as the eutectic point. At the eutectic point, the solid congruently melts (i.e., melts completely).

[[Persepolis]]]]
A '''waterskin''' is a receptacle used to hold water. Normally made of a sheep or cow bladder, it retains water naturally and therefore was very useful in [[desert]] crossings until the invention of the [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]]. It is still used in some developing nations. Though it may have been used over 5000 years ago by tribal peoples, the first pictures of it are from ancient [[Assyria]]ns, who used the bladders as floats in 3000&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt; B.C. It also was used by large [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[empire]]s such as [[Roman Empire|Rome]] before the advent of the [[Canteen (bottle)|canteen]].

Modern waterskins are often made of various plastic or rubber impregnated canvases, or sometimes simply thicker transparent plastics, and are often called water-pouches, water bags, or water bladders. Such modern waterskins offer many features, such as detachable straw-hoses, valves, refill openings of various widths, various closures and handles, styles of covering or cases, and removable cases or carry pouches.

[[File:wind.turbine.components.and.coordinates.svg|thumb|right|200opx|Schematic representation of the main [[wind turbine]] components. The [[yaw system]] is located between the wind turbine [[nacelle]] and tower.]]

The '''yaw bearing''' is the most crucial and cost intensive component of a [[yaw system]] found on modern horizontal axis [[wind turbine]]s. The yaw bearing must cope with enormous static and dynamic [[Structural load|loads]] and [[torque|moments]] during the wind turbine operation, and provide smooth rotation characteristics for the orientation of the [[nacelle]] under all weather conditions. It has also to be [[corrosion]] and [[wear]] resistant and extremely long lasting. It should last for the [[service life]] of the wind turbine) while being cost effective.

== History ==

[[Windmills]] of the 18th century began implementing rotatable [[nacelles]] to capture wind coming from different directions. The [[yaw system]]s of these "primitive" windmills were surprisingly similar to the ones on modern wind turbines. The nacelles rotated by means of wind driven [[yaw drive]]s known as fantails, or by animal power, and were mounted on the windmill towers by means of an axial gliding bearing.

These gliding bearings consisted of multiple gliding blocks fixed on the windmill tower structure. These blocks maintained sliding contact with a gliding ring on the nacelle. The gliding blocks were wooden cube-like pieces with [[wikt:convex|convex]] gliding surface covered with [[animal fat]], or even lined with copper (or brass) sheet as a [[friction]] reduction means. These wooden blocks were fixed in wooden slots, carved in the wooden bearing substructure, by means of [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] or [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]] and were carefully leveled to create a flat surface where the nacelle gliding ring could glide. The gliding blocks, despite the [[lubrication]] would wear quite often and would have to be exchanged. This operation was relatively simple due to the wedge-based connection between substructure and gliding blocks. The gliding blocks were further locked via movable locking devices&lt;ref name=molen/&gt; which, in a different form, remain as a technical solution in modern gliding yaw bearings.  
 
The gliding ring of the windmill nacelle was made from multiple wooden parts and, despite the old construction techniques, was usually quite level, allowing the nacelle to rotate smoothly around the tower axis.&lt;ref name=molen&gt;Molenbouw, A. Sipman, Zutphen, 2002,  {{ISBN|90-5730-119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''hybrid yaw bearing system'' combines the solutions old windmills used. This system comprises multiple removable radial gliding pads in combination with an axial roller bearing.&lt;ref name=molen/&gt;

[[File:Historical.hybrid.bearing.png|thumb|center|400px|Schematic representation of a historical hybrid yaw bearing with axial rollers and radial gliding pads.&lt;ref name=molen/&gt;]]

== Types ==
The main categories of yaw bearings are: 
* Roller Yaw Bearing: Large [[diameter]] bearing (usually four-point bearing)
* Gliding Yaw Bearing: Dry or lubricated gliding bearing with plurality of axial and radial gliding pads being in friction contact with a large diameter steel disk, usually combined with the gear-rim as a single element

== Roller yaw bearing  ==
[[File:Roller.yaw.bearing.svg|thumb|right|200px|Schematic representation of a typical roller yaw bearing configuration of a modern wind turbine.]]

The roller yaw bearing is a common technical yaw bearing solution followed by many [[List of wind turbine manufacturers|wind turbine manufacturers]] as it offers low turning friction and smooth rotation of the nacelle. The low turning friction permits the implementation of slightly smaller yaw drives (compared to the gliding bearing solution), but on the other hand requires a yaw braking system. 

Some manufacturers use a plurality of smaller yaw drives (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of yaw drives often offers the possibility of active yaw braking using differential torque from the yaw drives. In this case half of the yaw drives apply a small mount of torque for clockwise rotation and the other half apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the internal magnetic brakes of the electric motor. In this way the pinion-gear rim backlash is eliminated and the nacelle is fixed in place.

== Gliding yaw bearing ==
[[File:Gliding.yaw.bearing.components.svg|thumb|right|400px|Schematic representation of the components of a modern gliding yaw bearing.]]
[[File:Gliding.yaw.bearing.svg|thumb|left|200px|Schematic representation of a typical gliding yaw bearing configuration of a modern wind turbine.]]

The gliding yaw bearing is a combined [[wikt:axial|axial]] and [[wikt:radial|radial]] bearing, which serves as a rotatable connection of the wind turbine nacelle and the tower. Contrary to the old windmill concept, the modern yaw bearings support the nacelle also from the to{{clarify|date=May 2017|reason=support how?}} thus restraining the nacelle from being rotated by the Y-axis due to the [[torque|moments]] induced by the upper half of the rotor sweep disk and the X-axis due to the torque of the drive train (i.e. rotor, shaft, generator, etc. ). 

Principally, the simplest way to accomplish the yaw bearing tasks with gliding elements is with two gliding planes for the axial loads (top and bottom) and a radial gliding surface for the radial loads. Consequently, the gliding yaw bearing comprises three general surfaces covered with multiple gliding pads. These gliding pads come in sliding contact with a [[steel]] disk, which is usually equipped with [[gear]] teeth to form a gliding-disk/gear-rim. The teeth may be located at the inner or the outer [[cylindrical]] face of the disk, while the arrangement of the gliding pads and their exact number and location vary strongly among the existing designs. To assemble the gliding yaw bearings, their cages split in several segments that are assembled together during wind turbine installation or [[manufacturing]]. 

In its simplest form, the gliding yaw bearing uses pads (usually made out of [[polymers]]) distributed around the three contact surfaces to provide a proper guiding system for the radial and axial movement with relatively low friction coefficient. Such systems are economical and very [[:wikt:robust|robust]] but do not allow individual adjustment of the axial and radial gliding elements. This function importantly minimizes the axial and radial "play" of the gliding bearing due to manufacturing tolerances as well as due to wear of the gliding pads during operation. 

To solve this problem, yaw systems incorporate pre-tensioned gliding bearings. These bearings have gliding pads that are pressed via pressure elements against the gliding disk to stabilize the nacelle against undesirable movement. The pressure elements can be simple steel [[Spring (device)|springs]], pneumatic, or [[hydraulic cylinders|hydraulic pre-tension elements]], etc. The use of pneumatic or hydraulic pre-tension elements allows active control of the yaw bearing pre-tension, which provides yaw brake function.

== Wear and lubrication ==

In all gliding bearings wear is an issue of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as [[Polyoxymethylene plastic|POM]] or [[Polyamide|PA]]. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip effects]] (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central lubrication system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or [[Composite material|composites]] (e.t.g [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]]) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.

== Maintenance and repair ==

Despite the fact that the gliding yaw bearings and their components are designed and constructed to last the [[service life]] of the wind turbine, it should be possible to replace worn out yaw bearing gliding elements or other components of the yaw system. To allow for replace-ability of worn out components, the yaw systems are designed in segments. Usually one or more gliding planes comprise several sub-elements that contain a number of gliding elements (radial or axial or a combination). These sub-elements can be individually removed and repaired, re-fit or replaced. In this way the yaw bearing can be serviced without the need of dis-assembly of the whole gliding yaw bearing (e.g., in case of a roller yaw bearing, dis-assembly of the whole wind turbine). This rep-arability offered by the segmented design of the gliding yaw bearing is one of the most important advantages of this system against the roller yaw bearing solution. 

The only remaining issue is the replacement of the gliding elements of the gliding yaw bearing surface, which is not segmented. This is usually the top axial surface of the gliding bearing, which constantly supports the weight of the whole nacelle-rotor assembly. For the gliding elements of this gliding surface to be replaced, the nacelle-rotor assembly must be lifted by an external [[Crane (machine)|crane]]. An alternative solution to this problem is the use of mechanical or hydraulic [[Jack (device)|jacks]] able to partially or fully lift the nacelle-rotor assembly while the gliding yaw bearing is still in place. In this way and by providing a small clearance between the gliding elements and the gliding disk, it is possible to exchange the sliding elements without dismantling the gliding yaw bearing.

== Bearing Adjustment ==
[[File:Yaw.bearing.details.svg|thumb|right|250px|Detailed view of a typical pre-tension system for an azimuth (yaw) gliding bearing of a modern wind turbine.]]

When the wind turbine nacelle is positioned on the tower and the yaw bearing assembly is completed it is necessary to adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre-tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2185">'''Zero emission''' refers to an [[engine]], [[electric motor|motor]], process, or other energy source, that emits no waste products that pollute the environment or disrupt the climate.

==Zero emission engines==
Vehicles and other mobile machinery used for transport (over land, sea, air, rail) and for other uses (agricultural, mobile power generation, etc.) contribute heavily to climate change and pollution, so zero emission engines are an area of active research. These technologies almost in all cases include an [[electric motor]] powered by an energy source compact enough to be installed in the vehicle. These sources include [[hydrogen fuel cell]]s, [[Traction battery|batteries]], [[supercapacitors]], and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices.

In some cases, such as [[Air engine|compressed air engines]], the engine may be mechanical rather than electrical. This mechanical engine is then powered by a passive energy source like [[compressed air]], or a combustible non-polluting gas like [[hydrogen]].

The above engines can be used in all vehicles, from cars to boats to propeller airplanes. For boats, energy sources such as [[nuclear power]] and [[Photovoltaics|solar panels]] can also be a viable option, in addition to traditional [[sail]]s and [[turbosail]]s.

A concept like [[vegetable oil economy]] produces emissions.
