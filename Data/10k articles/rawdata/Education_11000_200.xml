'''European Theological Libraries''', or, in French, '''Bibliothèques Européennes de Théologie''', hence the name '''BETH''', is an ecumenical association established in 1961, with legal registration in [[Nijmegen]], [[Netherlands]]. Its purpose is to contribute to the development of theological libraries in Europe and to encourage cooperation among its members.

== History ==

To mark the tenth anniversary of the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft katholisch-Theologischer Bibliotheken'' (AKThB) several librarians met in [[Frankfurt]] in 1957 and founded an association that would become BETH. Father Luchesius Smits of VKSB (Vereniging voor Seminarie en Kloosterbibliothecarissen, The Netherlands), Father Francis Courtney of ABTAPL (Association of British Theological and Philosophical Libraries, United Kingdom), and Father Paul Mech (Association des bibliothèques de sciences religieuses, France), in the spirit of reconstruction and reconciliation that characterized the post-war period,&lt;ref&gt;André J. Geuns and Barbara Wolf-Dahm, "[http://forge.fh-potsdam.de/~IFLA/INSPEL/98-3geunsdahm.pdf Theological Libraries : an overview on history and present activities of the international council of associations of theological libraries]" [archive], in INSPEL, International Journal of Special Libraries, 32 (1998) 3, pp 139-158.&lt;/ref&gt; were concerned about making a contribution to the development of the [[Christian]] faith by promoting exchanges between the theological libraries. It seemed essential to them to improve the professional qualifications, to work on some international bibliographies and to promote mutual assistance in order to fully accomplish their mission. Revisiting the words of Johan van Wyngaerden on the founders of the Netherlands VSKB "they considered an apostolic mission not only to support the conservation of valuable collections of books in seminaries and convents , but also to make these available to a wider public. "&lt;ref&gt;J. van Wyngaerden, "Vereniging voor het Theologisch Bibliothecariaat (VTB)", in ''Conseil International des Associations de Bibliothèques de Théologie, 1961-1996, Leuven: Bibliothek van de Faculteit Godgeleerdheid van de K.U. Leuven, 1996.''&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in Frankfurt, however, on 18 October 1961 that the ''International Committee for the Coordination of Catholic Theological Library Associations (le Comité international de coordination des associations de bibliothèques de théologie catholique)'' was established when librarians from Germany, France and the Netherlands met at a meeting of German librarians. In 1970, the ‘Committee’ became the ''International Council of Theological Library Associations (le Conseil international des associations de bibliothèques de théologie)'' when it had grown to include a number of national associations and the ''Council'' became a member of IFLA (1971-1986). From 1961 to 1999 several collaborative publications testify to the enterprising activities of the Council: ''Scripta recenter edita,'' an updated bibliographies of philosophical and theological works, were published between 1950 and 1973, and ''Bibliographia ad usum seminariorum'', a selection of the necessary tools for theological studies (liturgical, missiological, ecumenical) from 1959 to 1965.

In 1999, in recognition of the distinct European composition of the association and its activities, the Council became ''BETH: Bibliothèques Européennes de Théologie / European Theological Libraries / Europäische Bibliotheken für Theologie,'' which has a website (www.beth.be) hosted by The Catholic University of Leuven (KULeuven).

By 2010, BETH had a membership of 12 national associations and 16 extraordinary members, among which are found, for example, the [[National Library of France]] (the department of Philosophy/Religion), the [[National and University Library of Strasbourg]] and the Library of the [[World Council of Churches]] in [[Geneva]].

BETH, supported by the national organisation and the exceptionally rich heritage of the libraries involved, organises a conference each year. The official languages of the association are English, French and German, but libraries from all areas of Europe (and their native languages) are welcome in the association, although communications among the membership are principally conducted in English. BETH assists its members in forming consortia for obtaining access to databases and distributes throughout the year any information concerning exhibitions, symposia &lt;ref&gt;O. Dupont "[http://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-2010-01-0054-011 Les réseaux français et européens de Bibliothèques religieuses]" [archive], in BBF, Bulletin des Bibliothèques de France, 2010, t.55, n°&lt;/ref&gt; other current digitalisation projects.

== Symbolism ==

[[File:Logo BETH.jpg|thumb|150px|Association logo]]

In [[Hebrew]], [[Beth (letter)|Beth ב]] is the second letter of the alphabet and the first letter found when opening the Biblical text, the word Bereschit (in the beginning). The word BETH conveys the idea of a house, dwelling, building.

In 2008, an Hungarian artist designed the logo of the association, which expresses the tradition of study and of the lectio divina set on a [[lectern]], as well as the contemporary librarian’s job with the keys of a keyboard on which we see the letters of the acronym of the association.

'''Robert Earl Filner''' (born September 4, 1942) is a former American politician who was the 35th [[Mayor of San Diego]] from December 2012 through August 2013, when he resigned amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Condon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57599950/bob-filner-agrees-to-resign/|title=Bob Filner agrees to resign|last=Condon|first=Stephanie|date=August 23, 2013|work=CBS News|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later pleaded guilty to state charges of [[false imprisonment]] and battery. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Filner was previously the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|51}}, and the [[California's 50th congressional district|50th]], serving from 1993 to 2012. He was chair of the [[U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs|House Committee on Veterans' Affairs]] from 2007 to 2011.

==Early life, education, and academic career==
Filner was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], in the [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]] neighborhood. He is Jewish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/01/13/democratic-congressman-gabrielle-giffords-shooting-the-start-of-the-revolution/|title=Giffords shooting ‘the start of the revolution’|last=Poor|first=Jeff|date=January 13, 2011|work=[[The Daily Caller]]|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Sarah F. and Joseph H. Filner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Politicians in California|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/CA/jewish.html|website=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a labor union organizer, U.S. Army veteran and later international metal trader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Obituaries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/07/12/obituaries/ec078538-7de7-4b8b-a090-8468933f9137/|date=July 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Cornell University]], where he worked on the ''[[Cornell Daily Sun]]'', a student newspaper, and took part in civil rights demonstrations. In June 1961, after pulling into the bus station in [[Jackson, Mississippi]] as a [[Freedom Rider]], Filner was arrested for "disturbing the peace and inciting a riot." He refused to post bond for his release and remained incarcerated for two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Paul|title=Congressmember Bob Filner: Confronting racist Tea Party violence on election night|url=http://www.openleft.com/diary/20977/congressmember-bob-filner-confronting-racist-tea-party-violence-on-election-night|website=[[OpenLeft]]|accessdate=January 7, 2013|date=November 30, 2010|archive-date=July 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715072252/http://www.openleft.com/diary/20977/congressmember-bob-filner-confronting-racist-tea-party-violence-on-election-night}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from Cornell in 1963 with a degree in chemistry, and earned his doctorate in history of science from Cornell six years later. While completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], he moved to San Diego, becoming a history professor at [[San Diego State University]] for more than 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/voiceofsandiego.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/70/b70e88d0-448b-11e2-b316-001a4bcf887a/50c8d098d6f97.pdf.pdf|type=PhD|first=Bob|last=Filner|title=Science and Politics in England, 1930-1945: The Social Relations of Science Movement|publisher=Cornell University|year=1973}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Filner was long interested in politics. He worked for [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] in 1975 and for Minnesota Congressman [[Donald M. Fraser|Don Fraser]] in 1976. He also worked for Congressman [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]] from the San Diego area in 1984.&lt;ref name=Vote_DB&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob Filner|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/F000116|work=U.S. Congress Votes Database|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His elective career began in 1979, when his opposition to the closing of a neighborhood school led him to run for the [[San Diego Unified School District]] Board of Education, defeating a longtime incumbent. His "back to basics" approach to education won him wide praise, and his colleagues elected him president of the board in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/apr/14/treatment-by-school-board-launched-filner-into/#|title=School board snub fired Filner up for politics|last=Gustafson|first=Craig|date=April 14, 2012|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced on the board by [[Susan Davis (politician)|Susan Davis]], who now represents most of the rest of San Diego in the House of Representatives. He was elected to the [[San Diego City Council]] in 1987 and was reelected in 1991; his colleagues elected him Deputy Mayor of San Diego.&lt;ref name=Vote_DB /&gt;

===Elections===
California gained seven seats after the 1990 census, and one of them was the 50th District in south San Diego (renumbered the 51st District after the 2000 census). The district is one of the most ethnically diverse in the nation, including much of [[San Diego]]'s southern section, the cities of [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] and [[National City, California|National City]] and all of [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]]. It includes most of California's border with [[Mexico]], except for the city of [[Imperial Beach]]. In 1992, Filner ran in a five-way Democratic [[Primary election|primary]] for the seat and won a narrow victory. One of his primary opponents was his former boss, [[Jim Bates (politician)|Jim Bates]], who had lost his seat in a [[sexual harassment]] scandal in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-28/local/me-2663_1_charges-of-sexual-harassment|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Apologetic Bates Plans Comeback|first=Barry M.|last=Horstman|date=September 28, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose home had been drawn into the district.

Another opponent was veteran state Senator Wadie Deddeh, who was term-limited. Filner defeated Deddeh by a narrow margin, with Bates finishing third place in the primary. The district was almost 40% Hispanic (redistricting in 2000 made it 53% [[Hispanic]]) and heavily Democratic, and his victory in November (with 57 percent of the vote) was a foregone conclusion.&lt;ref name=NJ_Filner_bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Rep. Bob Filner (D)|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/bob-filner-ca|work=National Journal Almanac|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reelected nine times with no substantive [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opposition. He ran unopposed in 1998. He chose not to run for re-election to Congress in 2012, opting instead to run for Mayor of San Diego. He resigned from the House of Representatives on December 3, 2012, in order to take office as Mayor of San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph|first=Cameron|title=Rep.

===Tenure===
Filner was a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bob Filner on the Issues|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/CA/Bob_Filner.htm|publisher=On the Issues|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of the [[Congressional Motorcycle Safety Caucus]] and [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus|International Conservation Caucus]].

;Veterans issues
Filner served on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and ascended to the chairmanship when the Democrats took over the House of representatives after the [[United States House elections, 2006|2006 election]]. As chairman, Filner advocated for funding for veterans benefits, increased spending on veterans healthcare, and a new [[Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008|GI bill]] for veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Filner stayed on as ranking Democrat on the committee after the Republicans retook the House in the [[United States House elections, 2010|2010 election]].&lt;ref name=vosdcongress/&gt;

;Filipino issues
Filner's district in south San Diego had one of the largest populations of [[Filipino American]]s in the country, leading Filner to focus on issues relevant to the [[Philippines]] while in congress, especially Filipino veterans. Filner's accomplishments included legislation allowing Filipino veterans to maintain a small stipend from the government if they moved back to the Philippines, burial benefits, and access to [[Veterans Health Administration|VA clinics]]. In 2009 Filner brokered a deal securing $198 million in [[Filipino American#World War II veteran benefits|pension benefits for Filipino veterans]] who had served for the United States in World War II in the form of a $15,000 lump sum payment as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus bill]].&lt;ref name=vosdcongress&gt;{{cite news|last=Dillon|first=Liam|title=What Bob Filner Did In Washington D.C.|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/government/article_f8dacfb4-f3da-11e1-8418-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=December 24, 2012|newspaper=Voice of San Diego|date=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, Rep.

;Airline worker controversy
On August 20, 2007, Filner was involved in an altercation with a [[United Airlines]] employee at [[Dulles International Airport]] after he became upset that his baggage had not yet arrived on a [[baggage carousel]]. Filner entered the baggage claim office and became irritated when the employee was busy helping another customer and asked the congressman to wait his turn. It was at this point that it is alleged that Filner attempted to enter the employee-only area of the office. He was asked to leave the area several times by airline employees but refused to do so until airport police were called in.&lt;ref name="FN2007"/&gt;

Filner was on his way to visit troops in Iraq at the time of the incident. He released a statement saying "suffice it to say now, that the story that has appeared in the press is factually incorrect and the charges are ridiculous".&lt;ref name="FN2007"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep.

;People's Mujahedin of Iran
Filner, along with several senior United States officials, argued that the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran#Designation as a terrorist organization|People's Mujahedin of Iran]], also known as the MEK, should have its designation as a terrorist group removed. Filner considered the MEK, a major member of the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]], an ally against the current Iranian regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=MEK supporters push for recognition by US as official Iranian opposition|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/mek-supporters-us-iranian-opposition|accessdate=December 9, 2012|newspaper=UK Guardian|date=September 28, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filner accepted free trips, most recently in June 2013 to Paris, and paid engagements to speak in favor of delisting them as a terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Filner's Road to Paris |author=Matt Potter|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/jul/27/radar-filners-road-paris/ |newspaper=San Diego Reader |date=July 27, 2011 |accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of State lifted the MEK's designation as a terrorist organization as of September 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register |77 |60741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
In his first speech as mayor, Filner promised to focus on rebuilding the neighborhoods of San Diego, improving city services, increasing staffing for public safety, bringing jobs to the city, and developing stronger regional ties with [[Tijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halverstadt|first=Lisa|title=Where Candidate Filner Wavered, Mayor Filner Delivers|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/government/article_ba8d495c-3daf-11e2-84e7-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=January 7, 2013|newspaper=Voice of San Diego|date=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, following a meeting between Filner and the San Diego chapter of [[Americans for Safe Access]], Filner instructed the [[San Diego Police Department]] and city code compliance officers to stop enforcing [[Local ordinance|codes]] against [[Cannabis in California#Medical marijuana|marijuana dispensaries]] and stop forwarding cases to the San Diego City Attorney's Office.&lt;ref name="SDUT10JAN13CG"&gt;{{cite news|title=Filner halts medpot crackdown: Federal crackdown not affected by mayor's action|author=Craig Gustafson|url=http://m.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jan/10/filner-stops-prosecution-medical-marijuana|newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=San Diego halts all actions against marijuana dispensaries|author=Tony Perry|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-74010723|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Filner  proposed a new ordinance to restore permanent legal status to dispensaries, but the City Council rejected it and suggested that the City Attorney draft a new ordinance in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riffel|first=James R.|title=Filner ‘Disappointed’ With City Council's Medical Marijuana Decision|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/23/filner-disappointed-city-councils-medical-marijuan/|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=KPBS - City News Service|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, federal agencies continued to raid and prosecute dispensaries within city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Scott|title=San Diego's Marijuana Confusion Hits a New High|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/04/23/san-diegos-marijuana-confusion-hits-a-new-high|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=Voice of San Diego|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Filner raised controversy by not authorizing funding of the Tourism Marketing District, a hotelier-run organization charged with promoting San Diego as a tourist destination that is funded by a 2 percent surcharge on hotel rooms. In 2012, the San Diego City Council agreed to renew the District for 39 1/2 years, but outgoing mayor Jerry Sanders did not sign the agreement before leaving office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisberg|first=Lori|title=Tourism marketing funds still in limbo|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jan/31/tourism-revenues-|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=U-T San Diego|date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filner publicly withheld his signature on the agreement, wanting a series of concessions that would raise hotel worker salaries, protect the City from liability, and direct more of the funds collected to be used by the City of San Diego. The District subsequently filed suit against the Mayor to enforce the agreement, but Judge Timothy Taylor ruled that Filner had the discretion not to sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gustafson|first=Craig|title=Mayor vs. city attorney, Round 2|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/feb/20/filner-goldsmith-feud-tourist-tax|accessdate=June 2, 2013|newspaper=U-T San Diego|date=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/Mayor-Bob-Filner-Wins-Court-Battle-Over-Tourism-Marketing-199627391.html|title=Mayor Bob Filner Wins Court Battle Over Tourism Marketing|publisher=[[XETV-TV|San Diego 6]]|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this ruling, Filner and the hoteliers agreed to a compromise and Filner signed the contract.

==2013 allegations and resignation==
===Allegations of sexual harassment===
On July 11, 2013, three of Filner's long-time supporters held a press conference to call for Filner's resignation as mayor, based on numerous unspecified but "credible" allegations that he had sexually harassed women. [[KPBS-FM]] said that it had been investigating reports of sexual harassment of female staff members for several months, and that the complaints included "inappropriate comments, kissing and groping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/jul/12/mayors-mea-culpa-wont-satisfy-former-supporters/|title=Filner: ‘A Fair, Independent Investigation Will Support My Innocence’|date=July 12, 2013|work=KPBS News|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day Filner issued a video statement apologizing and saying that he was seeking professional help to change his behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/Jul/11/filner-backers-news-conference-resign/?#article-copy Filner apologizes, gets professional help], ''San Diego Union Tribune,'' July 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Filner told reporters that he had treated women poorly and sometimes intimidated them, but insisted that a "fair and independent investigation" would clear him of sexual harassment charges.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-filner-20130713,0,3378904.story|title=San Diego politicians, journalists abuzz over Mayor Filner's troubles|last=Perry|first=Tony|date=July 12, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12 Filner's chief of staff, Vince Hall, announced his resignation, effective immediately.&lt;ref name = "Perry" /&gt; On July 24 Filner's new chief of staff Tony Buckles, his former congressional chief of staff, resigned after only 10 days on the job and was replaced by Lee Burdick, a woman who had been serving as deputy chief of staff.&lt;ref name="third"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jul/24/3rd-woman-says-san-diego-mayor-made-sexual-advance/|title=3rd woman says San Diego mayor made sexual advance|last=Spagat|first=Elliott|date=July 24, 2013|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15 the same three former supporters held another press conference, describing in more detail charges by women who said they had been forcibly kissed, groped, and subjected to sexually suggestive comments by Filner; the alleged but unidentified victims include a mayoral staffer, a campaign volunteer and a constituent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/jul/16/filner-defiant-details-alleged-sexual-harassment-e/|title=Filner Defiant as Details of Alleged Sexual Harassment Emerge|last=Dirks|first=Sandhya|date=July 16, 2013|work=KPBS-FM|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filner repeated that he had done nothing wrong and would not resign.

On July 29, 2013, Filner asked the city of San Diego to pay his legal fees for a sexual harassment lawsuit regarding his former communications director.

===Other issues===
Federal, state and local investigators looked into several other issues involving Filner.&lt;ref name="bodyguards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/aug/10/san-diego-bob-filner-investigation-fbi-sheriff/|title=Bodyguards: Filner took women to hotel|last=Seibert|first=Trent|date=August 10, 2013|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One matter involved a trip he took to Paris with his then-fiancée in June 2013; questions had been raised about the nonprofit group that paid his expenses and the use of city credit cards to pay for his accompanying security detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-filner-paris-20130726,0,3950601.story|title=San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's June trip to Paris questioned|last=Perry|first=Tony|date=July 26, 2013|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.10news.com/news/investigations/bob-filners-paris-finances-show-last-minute-airfare-unattended-conferences-cost-thousands|title=Bob Filner's Paris finances show last-minute airfare, unattended conferences cost thousands|last=Blacher|first=Mitch|date=August 17, 2013|work=ABC 10 News|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another issue, FBI agents looked into a pair of proposed housing developments which Filner blocked with an "administrative hold" until the developers contributed money to certain city projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/jul/30/tp-fbi-expands-probe-of-developer-deals/|title=FBI expands probe of developer deals|last=McDonald|first=Jeff|date=July 30, 2013|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall effort===
In August 2013 two different groups started the process to mount a recall drive against Filner; the two groups later combined their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.10news.com/news/announcement-on-filner-recall-efforts-expected-080213|title=Filner recall effort organizers join forces|last=Chen|first=Michael|work=ABC 10 News|publisher=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to force a recall election, they would have had to gather more than 100,000 signatures of city voters (15% of the votes cast in the most recent election) within a 39-day window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2013/08/08/critics-recall-is-virtually-impossible/#axzz2bowXJcwv|title=Critics: Filner recall is virtually impossible|last=De La Rosa|first=Christian|date=August 8, 2013|work=Fox 5 San Diego|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 1,200 volunteers began collecting signatures. Less than a week after the signature drive began, Filner agreed to resign. The recall organizers wound down the effort, called for all petitions to be turned in so they could be counted and destroyed, and worked on preparing a final financial accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/politics/Recall-Bob-Filner-Campaign-Ends-After-Mayors-Resignation-220950801.html|title=Recall Effort Winds Down in Wake of Filner’s Resignation|last=Garske|first=Monica|date=August 24, 2013|work=NBC San Diego|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
On August 21, 2013, city attorney [[Jan Goldsmith]] said that Filner had reached an agreement with the city after three days of mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/21/us/san-diego-mayor-bob-filner-deal/index.html|title=San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, city reach mediation deal, city attorney says|last=Wian|first=Casey|date=August 21, 2013|work=CNN|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Council considered the agreement in a closed session on August 23 and voted 7-0 to accept Filner's resignation.&lt;ref name="Condon" /&gt; The resignation deal with the City Council limits Filner's "legal and financial exposure"&lt;ref name="limit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/us/san-diego-mayor-resigns-in-sexual-harassment-scandal.html|title=San Diego Mayor Resigns in Sexual Harassment Scandal|date=August 23, 2013|work=NY Times|accessdate=August 23, 2013|first=Jennifer|last=Medina}}&lt;/ref&gt; by providing a joint legal defense for him and the city for claims filed against him by current or former city employees, as well as paying up to $98,000 of his outside legal fees.&lt;ref name="parks" /&gt; Filner signed a letter of resignation that became effective at 5 p.m PDT August 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Mayor Bob Filner Resigns From Office|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/san-diego-mayor-bob-filner-resigns-from-office/|publisher=Mediaite|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Council president [[Todd Gloria]] served as interim mayor, with limited powers, pending election of a new mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/08/22/the-differences-between-an-interim-mayor-and-a-strong-mayor/|title=The Differences Between an Interim Mayor and a Strong Mayor|last=Dotinga|first=Randy|date=August 22, 2013|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[San Diego mayoral special election, 2013–2014|special election]] was held on November 19, 2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/23278149/developing-city-council-to-decide-on-special-election-date|title=Special election to replace Filner set for November 19|date=August 28, 2013|work=KFMB-TV|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election was held on February 11, 2014, wherein [[Kevin Faulconer]] was elected to be the next mayor.

===Conviction===
On October 15, 2013, Filner pleaded guilty in San Diego Superior Court to three criminal counts filed against him by the [[California Attorney General|California state attorney general]], who took over the case after [[Bonnie Dumanis|the San Diego County district attorney]] recused herself.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The charges were one felony count of [[false imprisonment]] and two misdemeanor [[Battery (crime)|battery]] charges. The victims were identified as three [[John Doe|Jane Does]].

In a 2016 interview, Filner denied all allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Halverstadt|first1=Lisa|title=The Return of Bob Filner|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/politics/the-return-of-bob-filner/|accessdate=March 27, 2016|work=Voice of San Diego|date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Filner is divorced from his first wife, Barbara (Christy) Filner, a retired mediation specialist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/jan/31/for-nice-san-diegan-mediation-is-the-key/|title=For ‘nice’ San Diegan, mediation is the key|last=Rowe|first=Peter|date=January 31, 2011|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have two adult children, a son and a daughter.

The '''British Academy of Management''' ('''BAM'''), founded in 1986, is a [[learned society]] dedicated  to advancing the academic discipline of [[management]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]. The academy runs two [[academic journal]]s: the ''[[British Journal of Management]]'' and the ''[[International Journal of Management Reviews]]''. Once a year, it publishes an article which is presented at the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = British Academy Of Management,London,UK|url = http://10times.com/organizers/british-academy-management|website = 10times.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquartered of the British Academy of Management is in London, United Kingdom.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The British Academy of Management was founded in 1986, exactly 50 years after the [[Academy of Management|AoM]] was formed in [[Chicago]]. [[Cary Cooper]] was its first President and [[Andrew Pettigrew]] was its first Chairman. During the AoM conference in [[San Diego]] in 1985 they realize the lack of a multidisciplinary association in the UK and decided to establish BAM.

The biggest challenges for this new organisation were to set up a [[constitution]] and to exercise good governance through a strong executive committee. The inaugural conference of BAM was at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1987. This was organised by [[Andrew Pettigrew]]. With over 200 delegates, the conference had an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = 1 November 2015|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early days ===
From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, the management of the Academy was still based on an amateur approach, because of the moving from one place to another. The nomadic life of the BAM office and the lack of a centralized system meant that outgoing chairpersons packaged the documents and sent them on to the institution of the new chair. Sometimes, this delivery arrived without all the key papers. BAM headquarters had to be moved from one city to another for a bit more than a decade, until they found a stable home in 2002 in [[London]]. Thus, the records eventually delivered to HQ were not very comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
In the 1990s, BAM struggled to find conference venues, and to attract persons due to the fact that the attendance was low. As the time passed there was a growth in both domestic and international attendance, especially from Europe. At this time, it was observed that the conferences were more about social interaction than about the discussion of serious research. Combining both consistently high academic quality and the fun factor became a priority by the late 1990s.

The first BAM Workshop took place on 5 January 1989 entitled ''‘Organisation and Strategic Decision Making’'' at [[Bradford Management Centre]], [[University of Bradford]]. It had 69 participants who came from [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Brazil]], [[United States|US]], [[China]] and [[France]]. It was organised by Richard Butler, Richard Pike and John Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First BAM Journal ===
BAM’s founders wanted to start publishing a journal. Cary Cooper managed one of the AoM divisions that had its own journal and he suggested that BAM should do the same.  Cooper coordinated a small group from Council who interviewed a number of  publishing companies for a five-year contract, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]] won the first contract. The [[British Journal of Management]] (BJM) was launched in early 1990 and had 4 issues a year running into 64 pages. The General Editor was [[David Otley]] and the Associate Editors were John Burgoyne, [[John McGee (editor)|John McGee]], Roy Payne, [[Nigel Piercy]] and [[Roy Rothwell]]. BJM purpose was to receive articles from a full range of business and management disciplines and to have a multi and inter disciplinary orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ===
One of the significant changes to BAM’s structure happened in 1999 with the formation of [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs). The aim of the SIGs was to encourage greater member participation and to provide a more diverse range of activities for members. The first SIGs were ''Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Management Consultancy but Learning and Knowledge, Interorganisational Relations, Performance Management, Philosophy of Management, Research Methodology, Creativity and Creative Industries'' and ''E-Business'' soon joined them. The SIG structure proved a thriving way to organise BAM’s  conferences,offering richer benefits for the membership. SIGs also provided new opportunities for less experienced academics to play active roles in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = The History of British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Journal of Management Reviews (IJMR) ===
The success of the British Journal of Management (BJM) was joined by BAM’s acquisition of the [[International Journal of Management Reviews]] (IJMR). Cary Cooper and Alan Pearson had been the first editors.

== Governance ==
British Academy of Management has an Executive Committee and a Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Governance Structure {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/governance-structure|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BAM Executive ===

== Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ==
Special Interest Groups are networks of researchers that are focused in a specific area of management research. They organize events throughout the year and provide the members with an academic forum for the discussion on relevant topics.

SIGs are run by BAM members, with support from the BAM office. They organise workshop and events on topics relevant to their research area, and take the lead in managing the academic programme at the annual BAM Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Special Interest Groups {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/special-interest-groups|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some SIGs networks:

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015).

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''. Center for Effective Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Willingness to take risks
# Eager listeners
# Passion for the cause
# Optimistic about the future
# Able to share knowledge, power and credit

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017). Collaborative leadership and the implementation of community-based fall prevention initiatives: a multiple case study of public health practice within community groups. ''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''educational film''' is a [[film]] or movie whose primary purpose is to [[educate]]. Educational films have been used in classrooms as an alternative to other [[teaching methods]].

==Cultural significance==
Many educational films shown in schools are part of long series - for example, films demonstrating scientific principles and experiments tend to be episodic, with each episode devoted to a specific experiment or principle.

Many [[schoolchildren]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s watched hundreds of episodes of British-made educational films (all very similar in style and production) over the course of their [[primary school]] careers. As a result, the delivery-style and distinctive colour-palette ("scientific" looking neutral-blue backgrounds etc.) of these films is instantly recognisable to any child of the appropriate generation. This was used to great effect by the British television series ''[[Look Around You]]'' which parodies these films.

==Research into educational benefits==
Many early psychological studies of learning from film and particularly TV found this medium to be inferior to text. Studies included comparisons between reading newspaper reports and watching TV news. In these early studies the memory retention was always stronger in those who read the reports. This was shown to be linked mainly to the ability of the individual to control the speed of the delivery of information. When you read you can pause at any time, which was not possible with classroom-based TV and film. This has changed with the advent of online video, which can be paused and rewound easily. More recent studies now see no difference in memory retention between the two media, video and text.&lt;ref&gt;TIBUS, M., HEIER, A. &amp; SCHWAN, S. 2012. Do Films Make You Learn? Inference Processes in Expository Film Comprehension. Journal of Educational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MERKT, M., WEIGAND, S., HEIER, A. &amp; SCHWAN, S. 2011. Learning with videos vs. learning with print: The role of interactive features. Learning and Instruction, 21, 687-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also examines the idea that cognitive overload may occur because the viewer has to process audio and visuals at the same time. Careful design of the film can alleviate this. For instance, signaling clearly where the focus of the audio is in terms of the video image will help the viewer merge the two. However, too much information, or information that is superfluous, can reduce learning.&lt;ref&gt;IBRAHIM, M., ANTONENKO, P. D., GREENWOOD, C. M. &amp; WHEELER, D. 2012. Effects of segmenting, signalling, and weeding on learning from educational video. Learning, Media &amp; Technology, 37, 220-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">The '''Faulkes Telescope Project''' (FTP) is supported by the  [[Dill Faulkes]] Educational Trust. It provides access to 1,500 hours of observing time on two 2-metre class telescopes located in Hawaii ([[Faulkes Telescope North]] in [[Hawaii]]) and Australia ([[Faulkes Telescope South]] in [[Australia]]). This time is dedicated to education and public outreach, mainly in the UK, but also for smaller, selected projects in [[Europe]] and the [[US]].  

FTP has operated a UK-wide educational programme since 2004, and currently works with science education projects across Europe and further afield (e.g. USA, Russia, Israel), including many EU-based science, maths and ICT programmes. FTP specialises in providing physics and maths education and outreach via astronomy and space science, utilising the unique access it can provide to research-grade facilities. The basic philosophy is to engage learners in “real science”, making them active participants in a range of astronomical research projects, ranging from observations of the solar system to distant galaxies. Teacher training (both face-to-face and online) is a core component of the FTP educational philosophy, and project staff have been involved in professional development work both in the UK and overseas, with teacher training days being held in Moscow, Santa Barbara, Munich, Lisbon, Paris and several other venues in Portugal and Spain.

FTP operates a broad range of educational programmes, with a strong emphasis on teacher training and engaging students with “real science”. A variety of research projects are currently being run on the FTs, with schools often participating in the role of data gatherers, particularly in long-term monitoring or short-term intensive studies or Target of Opportunity requests for transient objects (e.g. GRBs, supernovae, NEOs or X-ray systems in outburst).  

The project also provides extensive educational materials which can be accessed and downloaded free of charge from their educational resources website. These resources include astronomy video tutorials, online astronomy training, paper-based documents for use in the classroom, and pre-packaged data from the telescopes to use with the exercises detailed online.

==Robotic Telescopes==
The robotic telescopes used by the Faulkes Telescope Project are owned and operated by Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGTN). Users must register for an account via FTP and, providing they meet the criteria for an account (as explained on the FTP website), the account details will be emailed out to the registered user. Students and teachers can then go online and book time on the telescope and run their own 29-minute-long real-time observational session on one of the telescopes,  remotely controlling it over the internet.  These telescopes are the largest robotic telescopes in the world available for UK schools to control in real time.

The project was the winner of the 2008 [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]] in the category of Achievement in Education.

The Faulkes Telescope  Projects in cooperation with [[Hands-On Universe]] runs many student observing projects such as supernovae observations, asteroid observations, the Lifecycle of Stars project and Hickson Compact Group of Galaxies project. Details of these, and many more projects can be found on the Faulkes educational website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">A '''First Prize''' diploma in music (French: '''Premier Prix''') is a high honor Diploma of Musical Studies, typically in performance or composition.  It is awarded by European [[Music school|music conservatories]] and European-styled conservatories elsewhere.  A First Prize diploma does not denote first in class, but rather, a very high level of artist proficiency.&lt;ref name="Conrey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook 1991" /&gt;  The typical period of study to earn a First Prize is one to two years.  A First Prize diploma is sometimes wrongly described as being similar to a master's degree in music performance or composition.  As of the mid-1990s, the degree in many European countries has been discontinued.

== France ==
At the [[Paris Conservatory]], and at all government sanctioned institutions of higher learning in France, a Diploma of Musical Studies — the degree that offers the First Prize — was accredited by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]], but not as a higher education academic degree.  A First Prize from any European government accredited or sanctioned conservatory is a major distinction.

=== First prize broadly discontinued; new diploma is instituted ===
Beginning around the late 1960s, First Prize degrees in all music disciplines, in a sense, became a victim of their own success.  Holders of First Prizes, more and more, were gaining positions in comprehensive institutions of higher learning.  In the mid-1990s, the [[Paris Conservatory]], and all French government accredited conservatories, discontinued offering First Prizes with Diplomas of Musical Studies and replaced them with D.F.S. degrees — Diplomas of Superior Performance.  The D.F.S. degree was instituted across Europe in part to incorporate comprehensive higher education in the fine arts with comprehensive universities and in part to unify standards in higher education of the [[Bologna declaration|Bologna Declaration]] that was adopted by 29 European countries&lt;ref name="Bologna Declaration countries" group=lower-alpha /&gt; in 1999.&lt;ref name="Bologna Declaration doc 1999" /&gt;

== Quebec ==
First Prize degrees in [[Quebec]] are awarded upon attained a high level of proficiency before a jury at the end of the fourth cycle of study at a conservatory — or two years.  While two years of schooling equals the time required to earn a master's degree in Quebec, the scope of education does not offer the equivalence of a master's degree.  Thus, a student who wishes to pursue doctoral studies might need compensatory education.

Music conservatories in [[Quebec]] fall under the purview of Quebec's [[Ministry of Culture and Communications (Quebec)|Ministry of Culture and Communications]]. The [[Conservatory of Music and Drama in Quebec]] [[:fr:Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec|(fr)]] was founded in 1942 by [[Wilfrid Pelletier]].  Since then, Quebec has added a network of conservatories [[Gatineau]], [[Rimouski]], [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[Trois-Rivières]], and [[Val-d'Or]].

In 2018, His Excellency Nana Akuffo Addo and his team of governance introduced another initiative as part of the Free SHS Education Policy which is the Double Track System. 

The Double Track System was introduced by the government in other to enable various Senior High Schools in Ghana to take in more students and ensure that all Ghanaian students have access to a senior high school education. The Double Track System is in two sessions, thus The Green Track and The Gold Track. The Green Track represents the first batch of students who would go to school for a term and are later followed by the Gold Track students who would continue after students of the green track session have vacated on the academic calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Double Track System |url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Double-Track-System-First-batch-to-attend-classes-for-41-days-682546 |website=Ghana Web |publisher=Ghana Web |accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
Gamification techniques are intended to leverage people's natural desires for socializing, learning, mastery, competition, achievement, status, self-expression, [[altruism]], or closure, or simply their response to the [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] of a situation as game or play.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberoth, A. (2015) Shallow Gamification, Testing Psychological Effects of Framing an Activity as a Game, Games and Culture  Vol 10, Issue 3, pp. 229 - 248  {{doi|10.1177/1555412014559978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early gamification strategies use [[reward system|rewards]] for players who accomplish desired tasks or [[competition]] to engage players. Types of rewards include points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Browse the Web, earn points and prizes|last=Sutter|first=John D.|date=September 30, 2010|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/09/30/web.checkin.onetruefan/?hpt=Sbin }}&lt;/ref&gt; achievement badges or levels,&lt;ref name="ffdega"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamari|first=Juho|author2=Eranti, Veikko|title=Framework for Designing and Evaluating Game Achievements|journal=Proceedings of Digra 2011 Conference: Think Design Play, Hilversum, Netherlands, September|year=2011|pages=14–17|url=http://www.digra.org/dl/db/11307.59151.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the filling of a progress bar,&lt;ref name="sjmn" /&gt; or providing the user with virtual currency.&lt;ref name="ffdega" /&gt; Making the rewards for accomplishing tasks visible to other players or providing leader boards are ways of encouraging players to compete.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book|author1=Byron Reeves |author2=J. Leighton Read |publisher=Harvard Business Press|title=Total Engagement: Using Games and Virtual Worlds to Change the Way People Work and Businesses Compete|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4221-4657-6|page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to gamification is to make existing tasks feel more like games.&lt;ref name="Just Add Points"&gt;{{cite web

== Applications ==
Gamification has been applied to almost every aspect of life. Examples of gamification in business context include the U.S. Army, which uses "America's Army" as a recruitment tool, and [[M&amp;M's]] "Eye Spy" [[pretzel]] game, launched in 2013 to amplify the company's pretzel marketing campaign by creating a fun way to "boost user engagement." Another example can be seen in the American education system. Students are ranked in their class based on their earned [[Grading in education|grade-point average]] (GPA), which is comparable to earning a high score in video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899000643|title=Gamification in education and business|others=Reiners, Torsten,, Wood, Lincoln C.,|isbn=9783319102085|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=899000643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also receive incentives, such as an honorable mention on the dean's list, the honor roll, and scholarships, which are equivalent to leveling-up a video game character or earning virtual currency or tools that augment game success. 
Job application processes sometimes use gamification as a way to hire employees by assessing their suitability through questionnaires and mini games that simulate the actual work environment of that company. 
=== Marketing ===
Gamification has been widely applied in marketing. Over 70% of [[Forbes Global 2000]] companies surveyed in 2013 said they planned to use gamification for the purposes of marketing and customer retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Van Grove|first = Jennifer|title = Gamification: How Competition Is Reinventing Business, Marketing &amp; Everyday Life|publisher = [[Mashable]]|date = 28 July 2011|url = http://mashable.com/2011/07/28/gamification/|accessdate = 12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in November, 2011, Australian broadcast and online media partnership [[Yahoo!7]] launched its [[Yahoo!7#Fango mobile app|Fango mobile app]]/SAP, which TV viewers use to interact with shows via techniques like check-ins and badges. As of February, 2012, the app had been downloaded more than 200,000 times.&lt;ref name="impulsegamer"&gt;{{cite web |title=FANGO delivers on Social TV |date=11 February 2012 |url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/wordpress/?p=18861 |publisher=Impulse Gamer |accessdate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamification has also been used in customer loyalty programs. In 2010, [[Starbucks]] gave custom [[Foursquare]] badges to people who checked in at multiple locations, and offered discounts to people who checked in most frequently at an individual store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/07/18/gamification-marketing/|title=HOW TO: Gamify Your Marketing|last=Kleinberg|first=Adam|date=18 July 2011|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule Gamification Marketing or Game Marketing usually falls under four primary categories;

'''1. In-Game Advertising;''' Messages, images or videos promoting company or products in the game play itself. According to NBCNews game creators [[Electronic Arts]] used "Madden 09" and "Burnout Paradise" to promote 'in-Game' billboards encouraging players to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27184857/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/ads-obama-campaign-its-game/#.W6HQHpMzafQ|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''2. Video-Game coLabs:''' [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Nintendo's "007: Golden Eye"]] is a classic example. A Video game created to advertise the movie Golden Eye. The Game itself actually ended up making more money than the movie. 

'''3. Through-the-line (TTL) &amp; Below-the-line (BTL)''' marketing strategies. Text above, side or below main game screen (also known as an iFrame) advertising images or text. Example of this would be [[I Love Bees|"I love Bee".]] 

4. '''Advergames'''. Usually games based off popular mobile games like '[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]' or '[[Temple Run|Temple Run']]. These games are re-created via Platforms like [[Wix.com|WIX]] or [[Gamify (company)|Gamify]] to promote Brands and Products. Usually to encourage engagement, loyalty and product education. These usually involve social leader points and rewards that are advertised via social media platforms like Facebook's Top 10 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2009/10/16/top-facebook-games/#dN8t18tfbiqW|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Gamification also has been used as a tool for [[customer engagement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/disciplines/market-research/opinion/businesses-need-to-get-in-the-game/3018554.article|publisher=Marketing Week|title=Businesses need to get in the game|first=Matt|last=Daniels|date=September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for encouraging desirable website usage behavior.&lt;ref name="sjmn"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_16401223|title=Get ready for the decade of gamification|first=Chris|last=O'Brien|date=October 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, gamification is applicable to increasing engagement on sites built on [[social network service]]s. For example, in August, 2010, the website builder DevHub announced an increase in the number of users who completed their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamification elements. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|title=Website builder DevHub gets users hooked by "gamifying" its service|date=August 25, 2010|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/08/25/devhub-scores-engagement-increase-by-gamifying-its-web-site-creation-tools/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the programming [[question-and-answer site]] [[Stack Overflow]] users receive points and/or badges for performing a variety of actions, including spreading links to questions and answers via [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. A large number of different badges are available, and when a user's [[reputation points]] exceed various thresholds, the user gains additional privileges, eventually including moderator privileges.

=== Inspiration ===
Gamification can be used for ideation (structured [[brainstorming]] to produce new ideas). A study at [[MIT Sloan]] found that ideation games helped participants generate more and better ideas, and compared it to gauging the influence of academic papers by the numbers of citations received in subsequent research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|publisher=Marketing Science|title=Idea Generation, Creativity, and Incentives|first=Olivier|last=Toubia|date=October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520204612/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/vc/Ideationpaper022805.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===
{{See also|Exergaming}}
Applications like [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] (Dacadoo) use gamification to encourage their users to exercise more effectively and improve their overall health. Users are awarded varying numbers of points for activities they perform in their workouts, and gain levels based on points collected. Users can also complete quests (sets of related activities) and gain achievement badges for fitness milestones.&lt;ref name="BetaBeat"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffries|first=Adrianne|title=The Fitocrats: How Two Nerds Turned an Addiction to Videogames Into an Addiction to Fitness|url=http://www.betabeat.com/2011/09/16/the-body-hackers-behind-the-scenes-at-fitocracy-the-addictive-fitness-game-that-will-make-you-want-to-work-out/|accessdate=23 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Observer|date=16 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Month adds aspects of [[social network game|social gaming]] by allowing successful users to restore points to users who have failed to meet certain goals.

In a review of health apps in the 2014 Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], more than 100 apps showed a positive correlation between gamification elements used and high user ratings. [[MyFitnessPal]] was named as the app that used the most gamification elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reviewers of the popular [[location-based game]] ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' praised the game for promoting physical exercise.

=== Crowdsourcing ===

[[Crowdsourcing]] has been gamified in games like [[Foldit]], a game designed by the [[University of Washington]], in which players compete to manipulate proteins into more efficient structures. A 2010 paper in science journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing useful results that matched or outperformed algorithmically computed solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In a Video Game, Tackling the Complexities of Protein Folding |author=John Markoff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/science/05protein.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 August 2010 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ESP Game]] is a game that is used to generate image metadata.

Gamification is used in corporate training to motivate employees to apply what they learned in the training to their job, theoretically this should improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kornferry.com/institute/the-gamification-of-corporate-training|title=The Gamification of Corporate Training|work=Korn Ferry|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study conducted by [[Badgeville]], 78% of workers are utilizing games-based motivation at work and nearly 91% say these systems improve their work experience by increasing engagement, awareness and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Gamification Improves Work Experience for 91% of Employees, Increases Productivity Across U.S. Companies|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gamification-improves-work-experience-for-91-of-employees-increases-productivity-across-us-companies-300124915.html|date=August 6, 2015|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and terrorist groups ===
Alix Levine, an American [[national security|security]] consultant, reports that some techniques that a number of extremist websites such as [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and various terrorism-related sites used to build loyalty and participation can be described as gamification. As an example, Levine mentioned reputation scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Foreign Policy|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/04/13/the_world_of_holy_warcraft?page=0,1|title=The World of Holy Warcraft:How al Qaeda is using online game theory to recruit the masses.|author1=Jarret Brachman |author2=Alix Levine |date=April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1749266/gamification-jihadist-websites-game-theory-islamist|title=Welcome To JihadVille|first=Neal|last=Ungerleider|date=April 22, 2011|publisher=Fast Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government has announced that it will begin using gamification to rate its citizens in 2020, implementing a [[Social Credit System]] in which citizens will earn points representing trustworthiness. Details of this project are still vague, but it has been reported that citizens will receive points for good behavior, such as making payments on time and educational attainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-34592186|title=China 'social credit': Beijing sets up huge system|first=Celia|last=Hatton|date=26 October 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology design ===
Traditionally, researchers thought of motivations to use computer systems to be primarily driven by extrinsic purposes; however, many modern systems have their use driven primarily by intrinsic motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin Lowry | first1 = Paul | last2 = Gaskin | first2 = James | last3 = Twyman | first3 = Nathan W. | last4 = Hammer | first4 = Bryan | last5 = Roberts | first5 = Tom L. | year = 2013 | title = Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) | ssrn = 2177442 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 11| pages = 617–671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, include online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, and so on. Such systems are excellent candidates for further 'gamification' in their design. Moreover, even traditional management information systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) are being 'gamified' such that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations must increasingly be considered.

As illustration, Microsoft has announced plans to use gamification techniques for its [[Windows Phone 7]] operating system design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/will-the-gamification-of-windows-phone-7-set-it-apart/39857?tag=content;search-results-rivers|publisher=ZDnet|title=Will the gamification of Windows Phone 7 set it apart?|first=Larry|last=Dignan|date=September 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While businesses face the challenges of creating motivating gameplay strategies, what makes for effective gamification&lt;ref name="Effective Gamification"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Dennis L. Kappen |author2=Lennart E. Nacke | title = The Kaleidoscope of Effective Gamification: Deconstructing Gamification in Business Applications| conference = Proceedings of Gamification '13 | year = 2013 |  pages = 119–122 | doi=10.1145/2583008.2583029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a key question.

One important type of technological design in gamification is the player centered design. Based on the design methodology [[user-centered design]], its main goal is to promote greater connectivity and positive behavior change between technological consumers. It has five steps that help computer users connect with other people online to help them accomplish goals and other tasks they need to complete. The 5 steps are: an individual or company has to know their player (their target audience),  identify their mission (their goal), understand human motivation (the personality, desires, and triggers of the target audience), apply mechanics (points, badges, leaderboards, etc.),  and to manage, monitor, and measure the way they are using their mechanics to ensure it is helping them achieve the desired outcome of their goal and that their goal is specific and realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uxmag.com/articles/five-steps-to-enterprise-gamification|title=Five Steps to Enterprise Gamification {{!}} UX Magazine|website=uxmag.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authentication ===

Gamification has also been applied to [[authentication]]. For example, the possibilities of using a game like [[Guitar Hero]] can help someone learn a password implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528743.900-the-password-you-can-use-without-knowing-it.html?full=true&amp;print=true | title = The password you can use without knowing it?| author = Jim Giles | date = 19 July 2012 | publisher = New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, games have been explored as a way to learn new and complicated passwords. It is suggested that these games could be used to "[[Experience level|level up]]" a password, thereby improving its strength over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6320439&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6320439 | title = Gamifying authentication | author = Christien Kroeze | date = 16 August 2012 | publisher = IEEE Conference Proceedings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamification has also been proposed as a way to select and manage archives.&lt;ref name="Gamifying Archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grace|first=Lindsay|title=Gamifying Archives, A Study of Docugames as a Preservation Medium|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6000335|work=Computer Games (CGAMES), 2011 16th International Conference on|publisher=IEEE Press|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, an Australian technology company called Wynbox has recorded success in the application of its gamification engine to the hotel booking process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/everyone_loves_winning_how_rydges_ky3lAs92n4NvdxAZqNLGuI | title=Everyone loves winning: how Rydges used gamification to double sales | work=afr.com | date=May 16, 2013 | accessdate=September 13, 2016 | author=Hurley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "gamification" first gained widespread usage in 2010, in a more specific sense referring to incorporation of social/reward aspects of games into software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/03/the-game-based-economy/ |title=Play to win: The game-based economy |author=JP Mangalindan |date=2010-09-03 |publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112074424/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/03/the-game-based-economy/ |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique captured the attention of venture capitalists, one of whom said he considered gamification the most promising area in gaming.&lt;ref name="fun"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/04/12/healthcare-reform-social-games-gamification/|publisher=Venture Beat|title=The ultimate healthcare reform could be fun and games|date=April 12, 2010 | first=Michael|last=Sinanian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another observed that half of all companies seeking funding for consumer software applications mentioned game design in their presentations.&lt;ref name="sjmn" /&gt;

Several researchers consider gamification closely related to earlier work on adapting game-design elements and techniques to non-game contexts. Deterding ''et al.''&lt;ref name=deterdingdefinition /&gt; survey research in [[human–computer interaction]] that uses game-derived elements for motivation and interface design, and Nelson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Mark J. Nelson | title = Soviet and American precursors to the gamification of work | conference = Proceedings of the 16th International Academic MindTrek Conference | year = 2012 | pages = 23–26 | url = http://www.kmjn.org/papers/Nelson_soviet_american_gamification_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues for a connection to both the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] concept of [[socialist competition]], and the American management trend of "fun at work". Fuchs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fuchs, Mathias | chapter = Ludic interfaces.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out that gamification might be driven by new forms of [[Ludic Interfaces|ludic interfaces]]. Gamification conferences have also retroactively incorporated simulation; e.g. [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], designer of the 1989 [[video game]] [[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]], was the keynote speaker at the gamification conference Gsummit 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsummit.com/sf13/why-attend/ |title=gsummit 2013 Why Atten |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to companies that use the technique, a number of businesses created gamification platforms.

Gamification 2013, an event exploring the future of gamification, was held at the [[University of Waterloo Stratford Campus]] in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='UW Stratford campus to host international gamification conference', by Mike Betz|first=Mike|last=Beitz|date= July 12, 2013|publisher=thebeaconherald.com|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2013/07/12/uw-stratford-campus-to-host-international-gamification-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal restrictions ==

Through gamification's growing adoption and its nature as a data aggregator, multiple legal restrictions may apply to gamification. Some refer to the use of virtual currencies and virtual assets, data privacy laws and data protection, or labour laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamification and Law or How to stay out of Prison despite Gamification|first=Mario|last=Herger|date=Jan 4, 2012|publisher=Enterprise-Gamification.com|url=http://enterprise-gamification.com/index.php/en/blog/4-blog/65-gamification-and-law-or-how-to-stay-out-of-prison-despite-gamification }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of virtual currencies, in contrast to traditional payment systems, is not regulated. The legal uncertainty surrounding the virtual currency schemes might constitute a challenge for public authorities, as these schemes can be used by criminals, fraudsters and money launderers to perform their illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Currency Schemes|date=Oct 2012|publisher=European Central Bank|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
University of Hamburg researcher [[Sebastian Deterding]] has characterized the initial popular strategies for gamification as not being fun and creating an artificial sense of achievement. He also says that gamification can encourage unintended behaviours.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign.com"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fast Company|title=Reasons Why "Gamification" is Played Out|author=John Pavlus|date=November 4, 2010|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662656/sixty-two-reasons-why-gamification-is-played-out }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of 132 of the top health and fitness apps in the Apple app store, in 2014, using gamification as a method to modify behavior, the authors concluded that "Despite the inclusion of at least some components of gamification, the mean scores of integration of gamification components were still below 50 percent. This was also true for the inclusion of game elements and the use of [[Transtheoretical model|health behavior theory constructs]], thus showing a lack of following any clear industry standard of effective gaming, gamification, or behavioral theory in health and fitness apps."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Concern was also expressed in a 2016 study analyzing outcome data from 1298 users who competed in gamified and incentivized exercise challenges while wearing wearable devices. In that study the authors conjectured that data may be highly skewed by cohorts of already healthy users, rather than the intended audiences of participants requiring behavioral intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2196/games.5358 | volume=4 | title=Behavioral Economics, Wearable Devices, and Cooperative Games: Results From a Population-Based Intervention to Increase Physical Activity | journal=JMIR Serious Games | pages=e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game designers like [[Jon Radoff]] and Margaret Robertson have also criticized gamification as excluding elements like storytelling and experiences and using simple reward systems in place of true game mechanics.&lt;ref name="radoff.com"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Radoff.com|title=Gamification|author=Jon Radoff|date=February 16, 2011|url=http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/16/gamification/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219171239/http://radoff.com/blog/2011/02/16/gamification/|archivedate=February 19, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hideandseek.net"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Hideandseek.net|title=Can't Play Won't Play|author=Margaret Robertson|url=http://www.hideandseek.net/2010/10/06/cant-play-wont-play// }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic tea-party-blog of gamification|first=Mario|last=Herger|publisher=Enterprise-Gamification.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out that while the initial popular designs were in fact mostly relying on simplistic reward approach, even those led to significant improvements in short-term engagement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprise-gamification.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Facts_%26_Figures|title=Gamification facts &amp; Figures|first=Mario|last=Herger|publisher=Enterprise-Gamification.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the first comprehensive study in 2014, which concluded that an increase in gamification elements correlated with an increase in motivation score, but not with capacity or opportunity/trigger scores.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Just a Fad?

The same study called for standardization across the app industry on gamification principles to improve the effectiveness of health apps on the health outcomes of users.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

MIT Professor [[Kevin Slavin]] has described business research into gamification as flawed and misleading for those unfamiliar with gaming.&lt;ref name="Slavin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/6353625142/in-a-world-filled-with-sloppy-thinking-this|date=June 9, 2011|title=In a World Filled With Sloppy Thinking|first=Kevin|last=Slavin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Chaplin, writing in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', describes gamification as "an allegedly populist idea that actually benefits corporate interests over those of ordinary people".&lt;ref name="Chaplin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/gaming/2011/03/i_dont_want_to_be_a_superhero.single.html|date=March 29, 2011|title=I Don't Want To Be a Superhero|first=Heather|last=Chaplin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane McGonigal]] has distanced her work from the label "gamification", listing rewards outside of gameplay as the central idea of gamification and distinguishing game applications where the gameplay itself is the reward under the term "gameful design".&lt;ref name="McGonigal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014576/We-Don-t-Need-No|title=How To Reinvent Reality Without Gamification|first=Jane|last=McGonigal|publisher=GDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gamification" as a term has also been criticized. [[Ian Bogost]] has referred to the term as a marketing fad and suggested "exploitation-ware" as a more suitable name for the games used in marketing.&lt;ref name="Bogost 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134735/persuasive_games_exploitationware.php?page=2|title=Persuasive Games: Exploitationware|first=Ian|last=Bogost|publisher=Gamasutra }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinions on the terminology criticism have made the case why the term gamification makes sense.&lt;ref name="enterprise-gamification.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enterprise-gamification.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143:the-term-gamification-why-i-hate-it-and-why-i-love-it&amp;catid=4:blog&amp;Itemid=251&amp;lang=en|title=About the Term Gamification: Why I Hate It AND Why I Love It|first=Mario|last=Herger|publisher=Enterprise-Gamification.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Mitchell Muschamp''' (November 28, 1947 &amp;ndash; October 2, 2007) was an American architecture critic.

== Early years ==
Born in [[Philadelphia]], Muschamp described his childhood home life as follows: "The living room was a secret. A forbidden zone. The new slipcovers were not, in fact, the reason why sitting down there was taboo. That was just the cover story. It was used to conceal the inability of family members to hold a conversation. Who knew what other secrets might come tumbling out if they actually sat down and talked? The cause of Mother's headaches might come up."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Muschamp. ''Hearts of the City: The Selected Writings of Herbert Muschamp.'' Introduction by [[Nicolai Ouroussoff]]. New York: [[Alfred A. Knopf]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This motivated Muschamp to engage in boisterous conversations outside the home in later years, particularly in the company of such up-and-coming architects as [[Elizabeth Diller]] and [[Ricardo Scofidio]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Bernard Tschumi]] and [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects|Tod Williams]], which formed the basis for his perceptive and often vehement architectural commentary and criticism.&lt;ref name="archpaper1"&gt;Jonathan Glancey. [http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4231 Review: Muschamp, The Works.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209120214/http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4231 |date=2010-02-09 }} The Architect's Newspaper. Published: February 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Muschamp attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] but dropped out after two years to move to [[New York City]], where he was a regular at [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[The Factory|Factory]]. He later attended [[Parsons School of Design]], where he studied architecture, and returned to teach after spending some time studying at the [[Architectural Association]] in [[London]].

== Career ==
During this period, he began writing architectural criticism for various magazines, including ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House &amp; Garden]]'', and ''[[Art Forum]]''. He was appointed the architecture critic for ''[[The New Republic]]'' in 1987.

Muschamp became the architecture critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1992, succeeding [[Paul Goldberger]]. During his controversial tenure at the ''Times'', Muschamp rose, according to [[Nicolai Ouroussoff]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai Ouroussoff. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/arts/design/04muschamp.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;oref=slogin ''Herbert Muschamp, 59, Architecture Critic, Dies'']. The New York Times. Published: October 3, 2007. Retrieved on October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to preeminence as the nation's foremost [[judge]] of the architecture world. His writing championed now-famous architects such as [[Frank Gehry]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Jean Nouvel]], as well as architects that he regarded as rising talents, including [[Greg Lynn]], Lindy Roy, Jesse Reiser, Nanako Umemoto and [[Casagrande &amp; Rintala]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Muschamp. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E3DF113BF930A15754C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 ''Architecture's Claim on the Future: The Blob '']. The New York Times. Published: July 23, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

His detractors, noted the ''[[New York Observer]]'', argued that his conflicts of interest, from socializing with his subjects frequently, and his "iconoclasm and obscurantism, his unapologetic dilettantism" were along with his "very public break downs" a source of a "fall from grace."&lt;ref&gt;Clay Risen. [http://www.observer.com/node/49446 ''As Muschamp Goes, Angry Adversaries Ready for Revenge'']. New York Observer. Published: June 27, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muschamp was a lover of cities. One of his most often quoted lines came from a 2004 review: "A city is never more fully human than when expertise – our own or someone else's – allows us access to ebullience, lightness and delight."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Muschamp. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/03/nyregion/an-appraisal-for-lower-manhattan-tower-offers-a-residential-stairway-to-the-sky.html ''An Appraisal - For Lower Manhattan, Tower Offers a Residential Stairway to the Sky'']. The New York Times. Published: March 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a number of columns criticizing the new master plan for the [[World Trade Center site]], calling the plan produced by [[Daniel Libeskind]] an embodiment of the "[[Orwellian]] condition America's detractors accuse us of embracing: perpetual war for perpetual peace." &lt;ref&gt;Herbert Muschamp. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E5DD163BF935A35751C0A9659C8B63 ''Balancing Reason and Emotion in Twin Towers Void'']. The New York Times. Published: February 6, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He stepped down as the architecture critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2004 to write the "Icons" column for the ''Times''' ''T Style Magazine'', among other features. He was replaced by his protégé, [[Nicolai Ouroussoff]]. Muschamp was [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]], and the centrality of gay men in the cultural life of New York City was central to his writing. He continued to write until his death from [[lung cancer]] in [[Manhattan]] in 2007.

A book collection of Muschamp's writings, ''Hearts of the City: The Selected Writings of Herbert Muschamp,'' was published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="archpaper1"/&gt;

'''Hot Soup Processor''' is a [[programming language]] from [[Japan]] that was originally developed in 1994. It was originally based on [[BASIC]], but has diverged significantly from those roots over the years. It is [[freeware]] as of 1996, and now is [[Open-source software|open source]] (OpenHSP) under the [[BSD licenses]]. HSP is used to teach programming in Japanese schools, and because it is freeware, it was a popular programming language for [[doujin soft]] in the late 1990s.

==Features==
Hot Soup Processor is a [[procedural language]], and includes the following features:
*Very brief and simple syntax, ideal for beginning programmers
*no [[line numbering]]
*non-[[case-sensitive]]
*all variables are [[global variable|global]]

'''''Humanitas''''' is a [[Latin]] noun meaning human nature, civilization, and kindness.

==Classical origins of term==
The Latin word ''humanitas'' corresponded to the Greek concepts of ''[[Philanthropy#Classical Philanthropy|philanthrôpía]]'' (loving what makes us human) and ''[[paideia]]'' (education) which were amalgamated with a [[Virtue#Roman virtues|series of qualities]] that made up the traditional unwritten Roman code of conduct (''[[mos maiorum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;The opening chapter of Cicero's [[Tusculan Disputations]] enumerates some of them: ''Quae enim tanta gravitas, quae tanta constantia, magnitudo animi, probitas, fides, quae tam excellens in omni genere virtus in ullis fuit, ut sit cum maioribus nostris comparanda?'' "For what weight of character, what firmness, magnanimity, probity, good faith, what surpassing virtue of any type, has been found in any people to such a degree as to make them the equals of our ancestors?" (''Tusculanae Disputationes'' 1.2.). Of the Roman political virtues, Richard Bauman judges clemency as the most important. See Richard A. Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC) used ''humanitas'' in describing the formation of an ideal speaker ([[orator]]) who he believed should be [[Education|educated]] to possess a collection of virtues of character suitable both for an active life of public service and a decent and fulfilling private life; these would include a fund of learning acquired from the study of ''bonae litterae'' ("good letters", i.e., classical literature, especially poetry), which would also be a source of continuing cultivation and pleasure in leisure and retirement, youth and old age, and good and bad fortune.&lt;ref&gt;The word occurs also in other Latin writers of the Classical period. For example, ''cultus atque humanitas'' ("culture and humanity"), meaning "civilization", appears in the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=CaeComm.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=1&amp;division=div2  opening sentences] of [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars]] (1. 1. 3), where Caesar calls the tribe of the Belgae the bravest, because farthest away from Romanized Southern France ([[Provence]]). It also occurs five times in the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', for centuries erroneously attributed to Cicero but which in fact predates him. However, the concept was most fully elaborated by Cicero, who uses the word 299 times, accounting for about half of the 463 occurrences in all the other Classical Latin writers together. See [http://www.tulliana.eu/documenti/Oniga_Humanitas.pdf Renato Oniga, "Humanitas"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in ''Tulliana'' (2009) II. On the distinctly Roman cast of Cicero's adaptation of the concept of ''humanitas'' from the Greek ''[[paidea]]'', Oniga cites a 1973 study by the German scholar Wolfgang Schadewaldt:&lt;blockquote&gt;...''l’essenza della'' humanitas ''romana sta propriamente nell’essere l’altra faccia di un insieme ordinato di valori molto precisi e severi, che facevano parte del codice di comportamento del cittadino romano fin dalle origini, e sono pressoché intraducibili in greco: la ''pietas ''(che è qualcosa di diverso dalla'' eusébeia''), ''mores'' (che non coincidono esattamente con l''’ethos), ''e poi la'' dignitas'', la ''gravitas'', l’''integritas, ''e così via. L’idea di humanitas riassumeva in sé tuttiquesti valori . . . ma nello stesso tempo li sfumava, li rendeva meno rigidi e più universali.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; ...the essence of Roman ''humanitas'' is that it constitutes one of the aspects of an orderly complex of very distinct and severe values that had been part of the code of conduct of a Roman citizen from the outset and are virtually untranslatable in Greek: ''pietas'' (which is different from ''[[Eusebeia#Classical Greek usage|eusébeia]]''), ''mores'' (which do not coincide exactly with ''[[ethos]]''), and ''dignitas'', ''gravitas'', ''integritas'', and so on. The idea of ''humanitas'' subsumed all these values ... simultaneously blurring their outlines, rendering them less rigid and more universal.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See Wolfgang Schadewaldt, “Humanitas Romana" (in Hildegard Temporini and Wolfgang Haase, editors, ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' I.4, 1973, p. 47). For further discussion of Schadewaldt's essay, see also Bauman's ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as ''humanitas'' corresponded to ''philanthrôpía'' and ''paideia'', it was particularly applicable to guiding the proper exercise of power over others. Hence Cicero's advice to his brother that "if fate had given you authority over Africans or Spaniards or Gauls, wild and barbarous nations, you would still owe it to your ''humanitas'' to be concerned about their comforts, their needs, and their safety."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Greg Woolf]], ''Becoming Roman: The Origins of Provincial Civilization in Gaul'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing Cicero over a century later, [[Pliny the Younger]] (61-112 A.D.) defined ''humanitas'' as the capacity to win the affections of lesser folk without impinging on greater (Ep. IX, 5).&lt;ref&gt;See Zvi Yavetz, ''Plebs and Princeps'' (Transaction Publishers, 1988),  p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival in Early Italian Renaissance==
The concept was of great importance during the re-discovery of [[Classical Antiquity]] during the age of the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian ''[[Renaissance Humanism|umanisti]]'', beginning with the illustrious Italian poet [[Petrarch]], who revived Cicero's injunction to cultivate the [[humanities]], understood during the Renaissance as grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium (education)|Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. —[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion 17'' (1944–45), pp. 346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1333, in [[Liège]], [[Belgium]], Petrarch had found and copied out in his own hand a manuscript of Cicero's speech, ''[[Pro Archia Poeta|Pro Archia]]'', which contained a famous passage in defense of poetry and ''litterae'' (letters): &lt;blockquote&gt;''Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solacium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur.'' (Translation: "These studies sustain youth and entertain old age, they enhance prosperity, and offer a refuge and solace in adversity; they delight us when we are at home without hindering us in the wider world, and are with us at night, when we travel and when we visit the countryside").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1695391 ''Pro Archia'' paragraph 16.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Petrarch liked this quotation and referred to it often, and where Cicero used the phrase "''litterarum lumen''", "the light of literature", Petrarch in the margin wrote ''lumen litterarum'' alongside and drew a sketch of a lamp or candle. The Liège manuscript is lost and so is Petrarch's copy, but Petrarch's copy "can be shown to be behind all but one of the later manuscripts" and preserve Petrarch's marginal annotations.&lt;ref&gt;MIchael D. Reeve writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is true that Italian humanists had no expression closer to ‘classical scholarship’ than ''studia humanitatis'', the ''Pro Archia'' provided classical scholarship in the Renaissance with its charter of foundation. In Petrarch’s attention to ''Pro Archia'' eight elements can be distinguished:
#	He discovered the speech.
#	He liked it because it extolled poetry
#	He used it in works of his own
#	He marked details in it, sometimes because related things had struck him elsewhere in his reading of ancient literature
#	He adjusted its text
#	He spoke of his discovery in correspondence that he put in wider circulation
#	He put the speech itself into wide circulation
#	Such was his prestige both as a writer and as a collector that after his death ''Pro Archia'' became one of many texts in his library sought out for copying.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
See Michael D. Reeve, "Classical Scholarship" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor (Cambridge, 1996), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrarch, in many respects a Medieval man, regretted that Cicero had not been a Christian and believed that he certainly would have been one had he not died before the birth of Jesus. To Petrarch and the Renaissance ''umanisti'' who immediately followed him, Cicero's ''humanitas'' was not seen as in conflict with Christianity or a Christian education. In this they followed the fifth century Church fathers such as  Jerome and Augustine, who taught that Greek and Roman learning and literature were gifts of God and models of excellence, provided, of course, they were filtered and purified in order to serve Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Ernst Robert Curtius recounts that "St. Jerome furnished the Middle Ages with an oft repeated argument for utilizing antique learning in the service of Christianity: In Deuteronomy 21 :12: If a Hebrew desires to marry  a heathen slave, he shall cut her hair and her nails. In like manner the Chritian who loves secular learning shall purify it from all errors. Then it is worthy to serve God." St. Augustine "in his allegorical exposition of Exodus 3 : 22  and 12 : 35: When they went out of Egypt the Israelites took gold and silver vessels with them, thus the Christian must rid pagan learning of what is superfluous and pernicious, that he may place it in the service of truth." See [[Ernst Robert Curtius]], ''European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages'' (Princeton, N.J.: Bollingen Series / Princeton University Press, 1973 [1953]), p. 40 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitas during the French Enlightenment==
According to historian [[Peter Gay]], the eighteenth-century French [[philosophes]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found Cicero's eclectic, [[Stoicism|Stoic]]-tinged paganism congenial:&lt;blockquote&gt;The ideal of ''humanitas'' was first brought to Rome by the philosophic circle around Scipio and further developed by Cicero. For Cicero, ''humanitas'' was a style of thought, not a formal doctrine. It asserted man’s importance as a cultivated being, in control of his moral universe. The man who practiced ''humanitas'' was confident of his worth, courteous to others, decent in his social conduct, and active in his political role. He was a man, moreover, who faced life with courageous skepticism: he knows that the consolations of popular religion are for more credulous beings than himself, that life is uncertain, and that sturdy pessimism is superior to self-deceptive optimism. Man becomes man as he refines himself; he even becomes godlike: “''Deus est mortali iuvare mortalem'',” wrote Pliny, translating a Greek Stoic, “To help man is man’s true God.” Finally, the man who practiced ''humanitas'' cultivated his aesthetic sensibilities as he listened to his reason: "''Cum musis,''” wrote Cicero, “''id est, cum humanitate et doctrina habere commercium''".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay's citation of the phrase, ''Cum musis'', etc., refers to an anecdote in the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', in which Cicero recounts how during a visit to Syracuse, in Sicily, he had chanced to discover the tomb of [[Archimedes]], at that time unknown to the inhabitants of the city, but which he, Cicero, recognized from its description in a line of poetry he had memorized; and he contrasted the enduring fame of Archimedes, the mathematician, to the obloquy of the notorious Sicilian tyrant  [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius the Elder]], buried nearby: “Who is there who has had anything at all to do with the Muses, that is, with humanity and learning, who would not prefer to be this mathematician rather than that tyrant? If we look into their manner of life and employment, the mind of the one was nourished by seeking out and pondering theories, accompanied by the delight in his cleverness, which is the sweetest sustenance of souls, that of the other in murder and wrongdoing, accompanied by fear both day and night” (TD 5.64–5). This anecdote is one of the sources for the humanist commonplace that poetry is a more lasting monument than stone. See Mary Jaeger, ”Cicero and Archimedes Tomb", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 92, (2002), pp. 51–52. The incident is recalled by [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;''Call Archimedes from his buried tomb
''Upon the plain of vanished Syracuse,
''And feelingly the Sage shall make report
''How insecure, how baseless in itself,
''Is the Philosophy, whose sway depends
''On mere material instruments;—how weak
''Those arts, and high inventions, if unpropped
''By virtue.—He, sighing with pensive grief,
''Amid his calm abstractions, would admit
''That not the slender privilege is theirs
''To save themselves from blank forgetfulness!'' —[http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html William Wordsworth (1770-1850), ''The Excursion'' (Book Eighth: "The Parsonage", lines 220-230)]&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue, Cicero insisted, is nothing but nature perfected and developed to its highest point, and there is therefore a resemblance between man and God: "''Est autem virtus nihil aliud quam in se perfecta et ad summum perducta natura; est igitur homini cum deo similitudio''".&lt;ref&gt;See Cicero, ''[[De Legibus]]'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/leg1.shtml Book 1: 25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cicero’s ''humanitas'' . . . reappeared in the first century in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s claim – made in the midst of a lament over Roman bestiality – that man is a sacred thing to man: “''homo res sacra homini''”; and reappeared once more in the eighteenth century in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s call for human autonomy and in [[Voltaire]]’s stern injunction: “Remember your dignity as a man.” In the beginning of his ''[[Meditations]]'', the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] elaborated a veritable catalog of qualities which, all together, made up the virtues which Cicero had called ''humanitas'' and which the ''philosophes'' hoped they possessed in good measure: modesty, self-control, manliness, beneficence, practicality, generosity, rationality, tolerance, and obedience to the dictates of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''The Enlightenment: The Rise of Modern Paganism'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, [1966] 1995), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Revival in 18th- and 19th-century Germany==
During the [[Aufklärung]] (or German version of the eighteenth-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the term "''Humanität''" was used to designate the intellectual, physical, and moral formation of "a better [[human being]]" (or [[Humanism]]). It was used, for example, by theologian [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in his ''Briefe zur Beförderung der Humanität'' (''Letters for the Advancement of Humanity''), 1792, and by [[Friedrich Schiller]], among others.&lt;blockquote&gt;Herder's ''Humanität'' is a broad concept he defines variously as the gradual fulfillment of best human potential, the achievement of reason and fairness in all classes and in all affairs of men, and the joint product of the creative actions of legislators, poets, artists, philosophers, inventors, and educators through the ages.&lt;ref&gt;T. J. Reed, ''Light in Germany: Scenes from an Unknown Enlightenment'' (University of Chicago, 2015), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Herder is considered the originator of ethnic nationalism, he was no chauvinist. He maintained that each person loves his own nation, family, language, and customs not because they are better than other peoples' but because they were his. Love for one's own individuality ought to lead to respect for that of others. For Herder, the image of God was imprinted in each human being, along with an internal impulse for self-improvement and growth. Historian William McNeil writes that Herder boldly proclaimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;each age and every people embody ideals and capacities peculiar to themselves, thus allowing a fuller and more complete expression of the multiform potentialities of humankind than could otherwise occur. Herder expressly denied that one people or civilization was better than another. They were just different, in the same way that the German language was different from the French.&lt;ref&gt;William Hardy McNiell, "Discrepancies among the social sciences", ''Conspectus of History'' 1: 7 (1981): 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Humanitas as benevolence==
In Roman humanism, benevolence (''benevolentia'') was considered a feature of ''Humanitas''. This notion is particularly underscored in the works of Cicero and Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cadenzas: Philosophical Notes for Postmodernism|last=Poma|first=Andrea|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319528113|location=Berlin|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, benevolence drives the idea of humaneness and is understood as a feeling either of love or tenderness so that it makes "someone willing to participate, at the level of feeling, in whatever is human."&lt;ref&gt;Poma, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Such participation entails a willingness to engage both in human suffering and joy. This was echoed in the Kantian position on love, where the thinker cited the so-called rational benevolence driven by natural sympathetic joy and pity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kant on Love|last=Rinne|first=Pärttyli|publisher=Walter de Gryuter|year=2018|isbn=9783110543858|location=Berlin|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other thinkers have also discussed benevolence in modern humanism. Max Scheler, for example, used it as an important element in his discourse of sympathy. In one of his works, he linked benevolence and the concept of "fellow-feeling," which allows self-love, self-centred choice, solipsism and egoism" to finally be wholly overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Sympathy|last=Scheler|first=Max|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9781412806879|location=New Brunswick|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler specifically equated benevolence with humanitarianism, explaining that these concepts - along with fellow-feeling - embrace all men, "simply because they are men."&lt;ref&gt;Scheler, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Humanitas'' as [[Altruism|benevolence]], is also a cornerstone of the credo of [[Freemasonry]] and constituted one of the bases for its position that nationality and religion do not matter, only universal humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Outsiders: Imperial Inclusion, National Exclusion, and the Pan-European Idea, 1900-1930|last=Sorrels|first=Katherine|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9781349720620|location=Berlin|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some orders of Freemasonry are called "Humanitas".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6009">An '''Ikastola''' ({{IPA-eu|ikas̺tola}}, plural ''ikastolak'') is a type of primary and secondary school in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]], [[Navarre]] and (to a much lesser extent) the [[French Basque Country]] (see [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]]) in which pupils are taught either entirely or predominantly in the [[Basque language]]. Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public, divided into different networks.

The Basque language public network relies on state funding and management, allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories, while in France the association Ikas-Bi in the public network advocates for bilingual education. Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country, closely linked to the similar network in the [[Southern Basque Country]]. The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents, popular subscription (either directly or by means of annual massive festivals, e.g. ''[[Herri Urrats]], [[Nafarroa Oinez]], [[Araba Euskaraz]]'', etc.) and the allowance provided by public educational institutions.

== History ==
[[File:Sanpelaio4.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Salbatore Mitxelena ikastola of [[Zarautz]]]]
Although spoken more widely than in later times, there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in [[Basque nationalism]]. Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border. The first official ikastola was opened in 1914, and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the [[Southern Basque Country]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century. 

During the early 1930s, the seeds of the "Basque Schools" (''Escuelas Vascas'') were sown  in [[Navarre]] by the Basque Nationalist Party, featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central. They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus ("the neutrality") on Basque matters in regular religious schooling. The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona, followed by another one in [[Estella-Lizarra]] (1933) and Elizondo (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo: Religión y movilización antirrepublicana en Navarra (1931-1936)|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |page=300 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Following the Republican defeat in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the public use of [[Basque language|Basque]] was [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|made illegal]], and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of [[Spanish language|Castilian]], to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque. There are, however, isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque. 

Since thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education, in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas, later becoming a secular federation. With the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, large degrees of self-government were given to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]], and ikastolak sprang up all over the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque region]] in northern [[Spain]].

For a time, the ikastolak operated along the public school system, the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools. During his term as Basque minister for education, the [[Partido Socialista de Euskadi|Socialist]] [[Fernando Buesa]] proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School, prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools.

At the present time, tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] attend ikastolak, but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location. They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basque-speaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), but less so in non-Basque speaking areas (i.e. the southern fringes). Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC, but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support (traditionally Basque speaking), unlike central and southern areas of Navarre, where they lack public recognition and funding, remaining in a legal limbo until 2007.

In the French Basque Country, the ikastolak developed later, but grew steadily, so much so that a network, [[Seaska]], is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels.

An '''institute of technology''' (also: '''university of technology''', '''polytechnic university''', '''technikon''' and '''technical university''') is a type of [[university]] which specializes in [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[applied science]] and sometimes [[natural science]]s.  

The English term '''polytechnic''' appeared in the early 19th century, from the French ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', an engineering school founded in 1794 in [[Paris]]. The [[French language|French]] term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''πολύ'' (''polú'' or ''polý'') meaning "many" and ''τεχνικός'' (''tekhnikós'') meaning "arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polytechnic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutes of technology versus polytechnics==
The institutes of technology and polytechnics have been in existence since at least the 18th century, but became popular after [[World War II]] with the expansion of engineering and applied science education, associated with the new needs created by [[industrialization]]. The world's first institution of technology, the Berg-Schola (today its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/uni/univ/booklet/MandU.html | title = Misckolc and the University | date = | publisher = Miskolci Egyetem (University of Miskolci) | access-date = 29 October 2017}}{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was founded by the Court Chamber of Vienna in [[Selmecbánya]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Slovakia]]), in 1735 in order to train specialists of precious metal and copper mining according to the requirements of the industrial revolution in Hungary. The oldest German Institute of Technology is the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], founded in 1745 as "Collegium Carolinum". Another exception is the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', which has educated [[France|French]] ''élites'' since its foundation in 1794. In some cases, polytechnics or institutes of technology are engineering schools or technical colleges.

In several countries, like Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey, institutes of technology and polytechnics are institutions of [[higher education]] and have been accredited to award academic degrees and doctorates. Famous examples are the [[Istanbul Technical University]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[İYTE]], [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[RWTH Aachen]], all considered universities.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In countries like Iran, Finland, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore or the United Kingdom, there is often a significant and confused distinction between polytechnics and universities. In the UK a binary system of higher education emerged consisting of universities (research orientation) and polytechnics (engineering and applied science and professional practice orientation).  Polytechnics offered university equivalent degrees mainly in [[Science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's]] and [[PhD]] that were validated and governed at the national level by the independent UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. In 1992 UK polytechnics were designated as universities which meant they could award their own degrees. The CNAA was disbanded. The UK's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the [[University of Westminster]]), was founded in 1838 in Regent Street, London. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term "institute of technology" is the more favored synonym of a "[[regional technical college]]" though the latter is the legally correct term; however, [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] is a university in all but name as it can confer degrees in accordance with law, [[Cork Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | title = Report of the Delegated Authority Evaluation Group on the Cork Institute of Technology | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912200434/http://www.hetac.ie/docs/Cork%20IT-DA%20Evaluation%20Group%20Report.pdf | archive-date=September 12, 2008 | format = PDF | date = June 2005 | author = Evaluation Group for the Delegation of Authority to Make Awards | publisher = Higher Education and Training Awards Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Institutes of Technology have delegated authority from HETAC to make awards to and including master's degree level — Level 9 of the Republic of Ireland's National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) — for all areas of study and Doctorate level in a number of others.

In a number of countries, although being today generally considered similar institutions of higher learning across many countries, polytechnics and institutes of technology used to have a quite different statute among each other, its teaching competences and organizational history.  In many cases "polytechnic" were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an "institute of technology". A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like "institute of technology", "polytechnic university", "[[university of applied sciences]]", or "university of technology" for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Argentina===
{{See also|Education in Argentina|List of universities in Argentina}}

In the so-called ''[[Latin American docta]]'' the main higher institution advocates to the study of technology is the [[National Technological University]] which has brand ramifications through all the country geographic space in the way of ''Regional Faculties''. The [[Buenos Aires Institute of Technology]] (ITBA) is other important recognized institute of technology with renowned and prestige in the country.

===Australia===
{{See also|Education in Australia|Technical and Further Education|College of Advanced Education|Category:Australian tertiary institutions}}

;1970s–1990s
During the 1970s to early 1990s, the term was used to describe state owned and funded technical schools that offered both [[vocational education|vocational]] and higher education. They were part of the [[College of advanced education|College of Advanced Education]] system. In the 1990s most of these merged with existing universities, or formed new ones of their own. These new universities often took the title University of Technology, for marketing rather than legal purposes. AVCC report The most prominent such university in each state founded the [[Australian Technology Network]] a few years later.

;1990s–today
Since the mid-1990s, the term has been applied to some technically minded [[technical and further education]] (TAFE) institutes. A recent example is the [[Melbourne Polytechnic]]  rebranding and repositioning in 2014 from Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE.&lt;ref&gt;Kylie Adoranti, Herald Sun, 3 October 2014 ''[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/northern-melbourne-institute-of-tafe-to-be-rebranded-as-melbourne-polytechnic/story-fnglekhp-1227078125350 Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to be rebranded as Melbourne Polytechnic]'', Retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These primarily offer [[vocational education]], although some like Melbourne Polytechnic are expanding into higher education offering vocationally oriented applied bachelor degrees. This usage of the term is most prevalent historically in NSW and the ACT. The new terminology is apt given that this category of institution are becoming very much like the institutes of the 1970s–1990s period.

In Tasmania in 2009 the old college system and TAFE Tasmania have started a 3-year restructure to become the Tasmanian Polytechnic www.polytechnic.tas.edu.au, Tasmanian Skills Institute www.skillsinstitute.tas.edu.au and Tasmanian Academy www.academy.tas.edu.au

In the higher education sector, there are seven designated Universities of Technology in Australia (though, note, not all use the phrase "university of technology", such as the Universities of Canberra and South Australia, which used to be Colleges of Advanced Education before transitioning into fully-fledged universities with the ability - most important of all - to confer doctorates):
* [[Curtin University]], [[Western Australia]]
* [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[Queensland]]
* [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[Swinburne University of Technology]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]
* [[University of Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]]
* [[University of South Australia]], [[South Australia]]
* [[University of Technology, Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]

* [[Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt]] (Faculty of Technical Sciences founded 2007)


;Fachhochschulen
'''[[Fachhochschule]]''' is a German type of tertiary education institution and adopted later in Austria and Switzerland. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2010, there were 20 Fachhochschulen in Austria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mokka Medienagentur GmbH |url=http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |title=Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung: Fachhochschulen |publisher=Bmwf.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119223842/http://www.bmwf.gv.at/startseite/hochschulen/fachhochschulen/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
''Hogeschool'' is used in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. The hogeschool has many similarities to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas and to the ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' in Finland.

''Hogeschool'' institutions in the [[Flemish Community]] of Belgium (such as the [[Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel]]) are currently undergoing a process of academization. They form associations with a university and integrate research into the curriculum, which will allow them to deliver academic master's degrees. &lt;!-- Don't the Walloon universities do the same?--&gt;

In the Netherlands, four former institutes of technology have become universities over the past decades. These are the current three Technical Universities (at [[Delft University of Technology|Delft]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology|Eindhoven]] and [[Universiteit Twente|Enschede]]), plus the former agricultural institute in [[Wageningen University|Wageningen]]. A list of all ''hogescholen'' in the Netherlands, including some which might be called polytechnics, can be found [[List of universities in the Netherlands#Vocational universities|here]].

;Universities
*[[Royal Université de Phnom Penh|RUPP]] or [[Royal Université de Phnom Penh]] (polytechnic university in [[Phnom Penh, Cambodia]])

===Canada===
In Canada, there are affiliate schools, colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities that offer instruction in a variety of programs that can lead to engineering and applied science degrees, apprenticeship and trade programs, certificates and diplomas. Affiliate schools are polytechnic divisions belonging to a national university and offer select technical and engineering programs. Colleges, institutes of technology/polytechnic institutes and universities tend to be independent institutions.

Credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level; however, university-affiliated schools like the École de technologie supérieure and the École Polytechnique de Montréal (both of which are located in Quebec), also offer graduate and postgraduate programs, in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines. Canadian higher education institutions, at all levels, undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding, private equity, or industry sources.

Some of Canada's most esteemed colleges and polytechnic institutions also partake in collaborative institute-industry projects, leading to technology commercialization, made possible through the scope of [[Polytechnics Canada]], a national alliance of eleven leading research-intensive colleges and institutes of technology.

;Universities of technology
Universities of technology are categorised as universities, are allowed to grant B.Sc. (Tech.), [[Diplomi-insinööri|M.Sc. (Tech.)]], Lic.Sc. (Tech.), Ph.D. and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees and roughly correspond to Instituts de technologie of French-speaking areas and Technische Universität of Germany in prestige. In addition to universities of technology, some universities, e.g. University of Oulu and Åbo Akademi University, are allowed to grant the B.Sc. (tech.), M.Sc. (tech.) and D.Sc. (Tech.) degrees.

Universities of technology are academically similar to other (non-polytechnic) universities. Prior to Bologna process, M.Sc. (Tech.) required 180 credits, whereas M.Sc. from a normal university required 160 credits. The credits between universities of technology and normal universities are comparable.

Some Finnish universities of technology are:
*[[Aalto University]], formed from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] and other universities
*[[Lappeenranta University of Technology]]
*[[Tampere University of Technology]]

;Polytechnics
Polytechnic schools are distinct from academic universities in Finland. ''[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]]'' is the common term in [[Finland]], as is the Swedish alternative "''yrkeshögskola''" – their focus is on studies leading to a degree (for instance ''insinööri'', engineer; in international use, Bachelor of Engineering) in kind different from but in level comparable to an academic bachelor's degree awarded by a university. Since 2006 the polytechnics have offered studies leading to master's degrees (Master of Engineering).  After January 1, 2006, some Finnish ammattikorkeakoulus switched the English term "polytechnic" to the term "university of applied sciences" in the English translations of their legal names. The ammattikorkeakoulu has many similarities to the ''hogeschool'' in Belgium and in the Netherlands and to the ''Fachhochschule'' in the German language areas.

Some recognized Finnish polytechnics are:
*[[Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Tampere University of Applied Sciences]]
*[[Turku University of Applied Sciences]]

A complete list may be found in [[List of polytechnics in Finland]].

===France and Francophone regions===

;Instituts de technologie (grandes écoles)
[[Collegiate university|Collegiate universities]] grouping several engineering schools or multi-site clusters of French [[grandes écoles]] provide sciences and technology curricula as autonomous higher education engineering institutes. They include:
* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]]
* [[Centrale Graduate School]]
* [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]]
* [[Institut national des sciences appliquées]]
* [[Institut Supérieur de l'Aéronautique et de l'Espace]]
* [[Paris Institute of Technology]]
* [[ESTIA Institute of Technology]]
They provide science and technology master's degrees and doctoral degrees.

;'Universités technologiques / instituts universitaires de technologie'' / polytechs
French education system also includes three universities of technology:
*''[[Université de technologie de Belfort-Montbéliard]]''
*[[University of Technology of Compiègne]]
*[[University of Technology of Troyes]]

In addition, France's education system includes many institutes of technology, embedded within most French universities. They are referred-to as ''institut universitaire de technologie'' (IUT). Instituts universitaires de technologie provide undergraduate technology curricula. 'Polytech institutes', embedded as a part of eleven French universities provide both undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula.

In the French-speaking part of Switzerland exists also the term ''haute école specialisée'' for a type of institution called ''Fachhochschule'' in the German-speaking part of the country. (see below).

;Écoles polytechniques
Higher education systems, that are influenced by the French education system set at the end of the 18th century, use a terminology derived by reference to the French ''[[École polytechnique]]''. Such terms include ''Écoles Polytechniques'' (Algeria, Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland, Tunisia), Escola Politécnica (Brasil, Spain), Polytechnicum (Eastern Europe).

In [[French language]], higher education refers to ''écoles polytechniques'', providing science and engineering curricula:
* [[École polytechnique]] or '''X''' (near [[Paris]])
* École polytechnique de Bruxelles
* [[École polytechnique de Montréal]]
* [[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine]]
*[[National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse]]

===Germany===
;Fachhochschule{{Main|Fachhochschule}}

''Fachhochschulen'' were first founded in the early 1970s. They do not focus exclusively on technology, but may also offer courses in social science, medicine, business and design. They grant bachelor's degrees and master's degrees and focus more on teaching than research and more on specific professions than on science.

In 2009/10, there existed about 200 ''Fachhochschulen'' in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/AktuellZusatz,templateId=renderPrint.psml#Fussnote1|title=Startseite&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[:de:Liste der Fachhochschulen in Deutschland|German Wikipedia]] for a list.

;Technische Universität
''[[Technische Universität]]'' (abbreviation: ''TU'') is the common term for universities of technology or technical university. These institutions can grant habilitation and doctoral degrees and focus on research.

The nine largest and most renowned ''Technische Universitäten'' in Germany have formed [[TU9|TU9 German Institutes of Technology]] as community of interests. Technische Universitäten normally have faculties or departements of natural sciences and often of economics but can also have units of cultural and social sciences and arts. RWTH Aachen, TU Dresden and TU München also have a faculty of medicine associated with [[Teaching hospital|university hospitals]] ([[Klinikum Aachen]], [[University Hospital Dresden]], [[Rechts der Isar Hospital]]).

There are 17 universities of technology in Germany with about 290,000 students enrolled. The four states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] are not operating a ''Technische Universität''. [[Saxony]] and [[Lower Saxony]] have the highest counts of ''TUs'', while in Saxony three out of four universities are universities of technology.

===Ireland===
{{see |Institutes of technology in Ireland}}
An "Institute of Technology" was formerly referred to as Regional Technical College (RTCs) system. The abbreviation '''IT''' is now widely used to refer to an Institute of Technology. These institutions offer sub-degree, degree and post-graduate level studies. Unlike the Irish university system an Institute of Technology also offers sub-degree programmes such as 2-year [[Higher Certificate]] programme in various academic fields of study. Some institutions have "delegated authority" that allows them to make awards in their own name, after authorisation by the [[Higher Education &amp; Training Awards Council]].

[[Dublin Institute of Technology]] developed separately from the Regional Technical College system and after several decades of association with the [[University of Dublin, Trinity College]] it acquired the authority to confer its own degrees before becoming a member of the T.U. Dublin.

The IOTI, is the representative body for the various Institutes of Technology in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioti.ie/ Institutes of Technology Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[higher education in Italy|higher education]], ''Politecnico'' refers to a technical university awarding degrees in engineering. Historically there were two ''Politecnici'', one in each of the two largest industrial cities of the [[norther Italy|north]]:
* [[Politecnico di Torino]], established 1859;
* [[Politecnico di Milano]], established 1863.
A third ''Politecnico'' was added in the south in 1990:
* [[Politecnico di Bari]], established 1990.
However, many other universities have a faculty of engineering.

In 2003, the [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of Education, Universities and Research]] and the [[Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy)|Ministry of Economy and Finance]] jointly established the [[Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia]] (Italian Institute of Technology), headquartered in [[Genoa]] with 10 laboratories around Italy, which however focuses on research, not entirely in the fields of engineering and does not offer undergraduate degrees.

;Polytechnics
Polytechnics in [[Malaysia]] has been operated for almost 44 years. The institutions provide courses for bachelor's degree &amp; Bachelor of Science (BSc) (offer at '''Premier Polytechnics''' for '''September 2013 intake''' &amp; '''2014 intake'''), Advanced Diploma, Diploma and Special Skills Certificate.  It was established by the Ministry of Education with the help of UNESCO in 1969. The amount of RM24.5 million is used to fund the pioneer of Politeknik Ungku Omar located in Ipoh, Perak from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

At present, Malaysia have developed 32 polytechnic at all over states in engineering, agriculture, commerce, hospitality and design courses with 60,840 students in 2009 to 87,440 students in 2012.

The following is a list of the polytechnics in Malaysia in order of establishment:-

;Technical University
There are 4 technical universities in Malaysia and all are belongs to [[Malaysian Technical University Network]]: 
*[[Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Perlis]]
*[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]]
*[[Universiti Malaysia Pahang]]

===Mauritius===
The only technical university in [[Mauritius]] is the [[University of Technology, Mauritius]] with its main campus situated in La Tour Koenig, Pointe aux Sables. It has a specialized mission with a technology focus. It applies traditional and beyond traditional approaches to teaching, training, research and consultancy. The university has been founded with the aim to play a key role in the economic and social development of Mauritius through the development of programmes of direct relevance to the country’s needs, for example in areas like technology, sustainable development science and public sector policy and management.

===Moldova===
{{See also|Education in Moldova}}

* [[Technical University of Moldova]], 1964

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Public sector organisations in New Zealand#Polytechnics and institutes of technology|Education in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] polytechnics are established under the Education Act 1989 as amended and are typically considered state-owned tertiary institutions along with [[university|universities]], colleges of education and [[wananga|wānanga]]; there is today often much crossover in courses and qualifications offered between all these types of [[Tertiary Education Institution]]s. Some have officially taken the title 'institute of technology' which is a term recognized in government strategies equal to that of the term 'polytechnic'.  One has opted for the name '[[Universal College of Learning]]' (UCOL) and another '[[Unitec New Zealand]]'. These are legal names but not recognized terms like 'polytechnic' or 'institute of technology'.  Many if not all now grant at least bachelor-level degrees. Some colleges of education or institutes of technology are privately owned, however, the qualification levels vary widely.

Since the 1990s, there has been consolidation in New Zealand's state-owned tertiary education system. In the polytechnic sector: Wellington Polytechnic amalgamated with [[Massey University]]. The Central Institute of Technology explored a merger with the [[Waikato Institute of Technology]], which was abandoned, but later, after financial concerns, controversially amalgamated with Hutt Valley Polytechnic, which in turn became [[Wellington Institute of Technology]]. Some smaller polytechnics in the [[North Island]], such as Waiarapa Polytechnic, amalgamated with [[Universal College of Learning|UCOL]]. (The only other amalgamations have been in the colleges of education.)

The [[Auckland University of Technology]] is the only polytechnic to have been elevated to [[university]] status; while [[Unitec New Zealand|Unitec]] has had repeated attempts blocked by government policy and consequent decisions; Unitec has not been able to convince the courts to overturn these decisions.

===Nigeria===
{{See also|List of polytechnics in Nigeria}}
Virtually every state in [[Nigeria]] has a polytechnic university operated by either the federal or state government. In [[Rivers State]] for example, there are two state-owned polytechnic universities; [[Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic]], [[Bori City]] and the [[Rivers State College of Arts and Science]], [[Port Harcourt]]. The former was established on 13 May 1988 while the latter–though founded in 1984–was approved by the [[National Board for Technical Education|NBTE]] in 2006. The first private polytechnic university in the state is the [[Eastern Polytechnic, Port Harcourt|Eastern Polytechnic]], established in 2008.

===Pakistan===

The polytechnic institutes in [[Pakistan]] offer [[diploma]] spanning three years in different engineering branches. This diploma is known as [[Diploma of Associate Engineering]] (DAE). Students are admitted to the diploma program based on their results in the 10th grade standardized exams. The main purpose of the diploma offered in polytechnic institutes is to train people in various trades.

These institutes are located throughout Pakistan and have been in service since early 1950s.

After successfully completion of diploma at a polytechnic, students can get employment or enroll either in [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech) or [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BE) degree programs.

===Portugal===
{{Main|Polytechnic (Portugal)}}
The designation "Institute of Technology" is not applied at all, being meaningless in [[Portugal]]. However, there are a number of non-university [[list of higher education institutions in Portugal|higher educational institutions]] which are called [[Polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic institutes]] since the 1970s. Some of these institutions existed since the 19th century with different designations (industrial and commercial institutes, agricultural managers, elementary teachers and nurses schools, etc.). In theory, the polytechnics higher education system is aimed to provide a more practical training and be profession-oriented, while the university higher education system is aimed to have a stronger theoretical basis and be highly research-oriented. The polytechnics are also oriented to provide shorter length studies aimed to respond to local needs. The Portuguese polytechnics can then be compared to the US [[community colleges]].

Since the implementation of [[Bologna Process]] in Portugal in 2007, the polytechnics offer the 1st cycle (licentiate degree) and 2nd cycle (master's degree) of higher studies. Until 1998, the polytechnics only awarded bachelor ({{lang-pt|bacharelato}}) degrees (three-year short-cycle degrees) and were not authorized to award higher degrees. They however granted post-bachelor diplomas in specialized higher studies (DESE, ''diploma de estudos superiores especializados''), that could be obtained after the conclusion of a two-year second cycle of studies and were academical equivalent to the university's [[licentiate degree]]s (''licenciatura''). After 1998, they started to be allowed to confer their own licentiate degrees, which replaced the DESE diplomas.

The Polytechnics in Singapore do not offer bachelors, masters or PhD degrees. However, the Polytechnics in Singapore offers three-year diploma courses in fields such as information technology, engineering subjects and other vocational fields, like psychology and nursing. The Polytechnic diploma certification in Singapore is equivalent to a [[junior college]] in the UK or a [[community college]] in the United States. There are 5 polytechnics in Singapore. They are namely: [[Singapore Polytechnic]], [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], [[Temasek Polytechnic]], [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] and [[Republic Polytechnic]].

A Polytechnic diploma in Singapore is known to be parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution, thus, Polytechnic graduates in Singapore have the privilege of being granted transfer credits or module exemptions when they apply to local and overseas universities, depending on the university's policies on transfer credits.

The only university in Singapore with the term "institute of technology", most notably the [[Singapore Institute of Technology]] were developed in 2009 as an option for Polytechnic Diploma graduates who desire to pursue a bachelor's degree. Other technological university in Singapore includes the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (1981) and the [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] (2009).

===Slovakia===
*[[Slovak University of Technology]] in Bratislava
The world's first institution of technology or technical university with tertiary technical education is the '''Banská Akadémia''' in [[Banská Štiavnica]], Slovakia,&lt;ref name="unesco1"/&gt; founded in 1735, Academy since December 13, 1762 established by queen [[Maria Theresa]] in order to train specialists of silver and gold mining and metallurgy in neighbourhood. Teaching started in 1764. Later the department of Mathematics, Mechanics and Hydraulics and department of Forestry were settled. University buildings are still at their place today and are used for teaching. University has launched the first book of [[electrotechnics]] in the world.

[[South Africa]]
has completed a process of transforming its "higher education landscape". Historically a division has existed in South Africa between Universities and Technikons (polytechnics) as well between institutions servicing particular racial and language groupings. In 1993 Technikons were afforded the power to award [[Bachelor of Technology#South Africa|certain technology degrees]].
Beginning in 2004 former Technikons have either been merged with traditional Universities to form Comprehensive Universities or have become Universities of Technology, however the Universities of Technology have not to date acquired all of the traditional rights and privileges of a University (such as the ability to confer a wide range of degrees).&lt;ref&gt;Mentz, J., Kotzé, P., Van der Merwe, A. (2008). [http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/comp/comp_v42_a10.html Searching for the Technology in University of Technology.] ''South African Computer Journal'', Vol 42, December 2008, pp. 29–37, looks at the role of Universities of Technologies after these mergers.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Education in Thailand}}

Most of Thailand's institutes of technology were developed from [[technical college]]s, in the past could not grant bachelor's degrees; today, however, they are [[university]] level institutions, some of which can grant degrees to the [[doctorate|doctoral]] level. Examples are [[Pathumwan Institute of Technology]] (developed from Pathumwan Technical School), [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] (Nondhaburi Telecommunications Training Centre) and [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok]] (Thai-German Technical School).

There are two former institutes of technology, which already changed their name to "University of Technology": [[Rajamangala University of Technology]] (formerly Institute of Technology and Vocational Education) and [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]] (Thonburi Technology Institute).

Institutes of technology with different origins are [[Asian Institute of Technology]], which developed from [[SEATO]] Graduate School of Engineering and [[Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology]], an engineering school of [[Thammasat University]]. [[Suranaree University of Technology]] is the only government-owned technological university in Thailand that was established (1989) as such; while [[Mahanakorn University of Technology]] is the most well known private technological institute.  Technology/Technical colleges in Thailand is associated with bitter rivalries which erupts into frequent off-campus brawls and assassinations of students in public locations that has been going on for nearly a decade, with innocent bystanders also commonly among the injured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Schools-will-face-action-over-student-brawls-30163128.html|title=Schools will face action over student brawls|date=19 August 2011|work=The Nation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217104025/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Schools-will-face-action-over-student-brawls-30163128.html|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the military under [[martial law]] still unable to stop them from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/449944/tech-students-brawl-shuts-concert|title=Tech students' brawl shuts concert|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polytechnics'''{{Main|Polytechnic (United Kingdom)}}

Polytechnics were [[tertiary education]] teaching institutions in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s.

From 1965 to 1992, UK polytechnics operated under the [[Binary Divide|binary system]] of education along with universities.  Polytechnics offered diplomas and degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD) validated at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA). They particularly excelled in engineering and applied science degree courses and other [[science, technology, engineering and mathematics|STEM]] subjects similar to technological universities in the USA and continental Europe.  Polytechnics were associated with innovations including [[women’s studies]], the academic study of [[communication studies|communications]] and [[media studies|media]], [[sandwich degree]]s and the rise of management and [[business studies]]. 

Britain's first polytechnic, the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]] later known as the [[Polytechnic of Central London]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain "at little expense."  The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century.  Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.

The designation "institute of technology" was occasionally used by polytechnics (Bolton), [[Central Institution]]s (Dundee, Robert Gordon's) and postgraduate universities, (Cranfield and Wessex), most of which later adopted the designation university and there were two "institutes of science and technology": [[UMIST]] and UWIST, part of the [[University of Wales]]. [[Loughborough University]] was called Loughborough University of Technology from 1966 to 1996, the only institution in the UK to have had such a designation.

Polytechnics were granted university status under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]].  This meant that polytechnics could confer degrees without the oversight of the national CNAA organization.  These institutions are sometimes referred to as [[New universities (United Kingdom)#Post-1992 universities that trace their roots to former polytechnics|post-1992 universities]].

'''Technical colleges'''

In 1956, some colleges of technology received the designation [[college of advanced technology (United Kingdom)|college of advanced technology]]. They became universities in 1966 meaning they could award their own degrees. 

Institutions called "technical institutes" or "technical schools" that were formed in the early 20th century provided further education between high school and university or polytechnic.  Most technical institutes have been merged into regional colleges and some have been designated university colleges if they are associated with a local university.

In 2016 the UK government announced plans to establish new "institutes of technology" in England as part of its reforms to post-16 skills provision "to provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels 3, 4 and 5. Each IoT is likely to build on infrastructure that already exists but will have its own independent identity, governance arrangements which directly involve employers and national branding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/536068/56259_Cm_9280_print.pdf |title=Data |website=www.gov.uk |format=PDF}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Institute of Technology (United States)}}
[[Image:Teamsolvingpuzzle.jpg|thumb|Students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]]]
Polytechnic institutes in the USA are technological universities, many dating back to the mid-19th century.  A handful of American universities include the phrases "Institute of Technology", "Polytechnic Institute", "Polytechnic University", or similar phrasing in their names; these are generally [[research]]-intensive universities with a focus on engineering, science and technology. The earliest of these institutions include: [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI, 1824), [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT, 1829), [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering|Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute]] (1854), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]  (MIT, 1861), [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] (1865), [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] (1870), [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (VPI or VT, 1872), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (1881), [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (1885), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech, 1891), [[Drexel University|Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry]] (1891) and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (1900). Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields, focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level, parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a bachelor's degree-granting institution.

===Venezuela===
Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s as an option for post-secondary education in technical and scientific courses, after the ''polytechnic'' French concepts.  At that time, technical education was considered essential for the development of a sound [[middle class]] economy.

Nowadays, most of the ''Institutos de Tecnología'' are privately run businesses, with varying degrees of quality.

Most of these institutes award diplomas after three or three and a half years of education. The institute of technology implementation (IUT, from ''Instituto universitario de tecnologia'' in Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French "Institut Universitaire de Technologie"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUTs were created in 
Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France. Later, some private institutions sprang up using IUT in their names, but they are not regulated by the original French system and award lower quality degrees.

Its members are philosophers of science or leading experts in sciences interested in philosophical questions.

==History==
The AIPS was created in 1947 by Stanislas Dockx. Among its first members were Bernays, Beth, Bochenski, Bohr, Borel, Brouwer, de Broglie, Destouches, Einstein, [[Ferdinand Gonseth|Gonseth]], Milne, Paulus and Weyl. Since 1949, a long series of colloquia have been organized in [[Europe]] but even in [[Americas|North- and South America]].

==Organization==
* An Academic Council whose president is elected for three years (current president: {{ill|Gerhard Heinzmann|fr}}, [[Nancy, France]]; former president [[Evandro Agazzi]], [[Genoa, Italy]]).
* A General Assembly of full members held normally every year.

==Aims and objects==
The AIPS promotes collaboration between philosophers of science and scientists by the means of annual sessions held in major scientific centers. The proceedings are published in French and/or English. The subjects of the meetings are decided by the General Assembly.

==Members==
Members are co-opted on the basis of proposals by full members. The currently over one hundred members come from nearly 25 countries.

==History==
KU was founded in 1999. The founding [[vice chancellor]], Badru Kateregga, together with other academics and entrepreneurs pooled resources to establish the university. It received its license from the Uganda National Council for Higher Education in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unche.or.ug/institutions/private-universities/page/2 |
title=Private Universities: Kampala University | last=UNCHE | accessdate=16 July 2014 | publisher=Uganda National Council for Higher Education (UNCHE)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the university's graduation ceremony in March 2012, 2,048 graduates were awarded degrees, diplomas, and certificates in various disciplines. Of these, 57.9 percent were male and 42.1 percent were female. Seventy-four graduates received master's degrees and 24 received postgraduate diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/629331-Former-TZ-leader-to-grace-Kampala-University-graduation.html | title=Former Tanzania Leader To Grace Kampala University Graduation | publisher=[[New Vision]] | date=1 March 2012 | accessdate=16 July 2014 | last=Darious Magara | first=and Andrew Ssenyonga | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727090412/http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/629331-Former-TZ-leader-to-grace-Kampala-University-graduation.html | archivedate=27 July 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Löwenstein''' (18 May 1885 in [[Bleckede]] – 8 May 1939 in Paris) was a German [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician, Socialist reform pedagogue and one of the founders of [[Socialist Youth of Germany - Falcons]].

==Family and education==

Löwenstein's father, Bernhard Löwenstein, had a clothing shop, which brought the family a modest income. His mother Jeanette, born Blumenthal, died of [[cancer]] in 1892. In 1895 Kurt Löwenstein went to [[Judaism|Jewish]] private school in [[Hanover]]. In 1899 he went to high school where he earned tuition by delivering newspapers and holding after-classes where he helped school classmates with homework.

Between 1904 and 1907 Löwenstein studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] in [[Halberstadt]] and he was accepted into the orthodox Rabbi school in Berlin. At the same time he also attended Philosophical and Pedagogical courses at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelm University]]. In 1908 he was offered the position of the Rabbi in Hanover but refused it because of religious doubts.

On 29 April 1911 he married Mara Kerwel (1891-1969), a chemist. When they got married, they signed a following [[Prenuptial agreement|marriage contract]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fes.de/archiv/adsd_neu/inhalt/nachlass/nachlass_l/loewenstein-ku.htm source: FES Archiv]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a proof of their progressive thinking and acting concerning [[gender equality]]:

§1 On 1 April 1911 both of the contracties, out of free choice and based on love, agree to found the marriage upon equal rights and responsibilities.

§2 As long as the marriage will last, both contracties and their offspring will use the common name Kerlöw which derives from the marriage.

§3 To legalise the use of this name, state permission should be pursued. If this permission is not given, the contracties promise to use the name in all non administrative areas of life.

§4 To be lawfully wedded both of the contracties will also subject to the state marital contract. However, by a word of honour they declare that the responsibilities and rights, described in the state marital contract will not apply as they find them redundant.

In 1910 he finished his Ph.D thesis on [[Jean-Marie Guyau]]'s pedagogic concepts.

==Politics==
A [[Pacifism|pacifist]], Löwenstein applied to join the [[Red Cross]] in 1914 in [[Grodno]] ([[Belarus]]) where he took care of injured soldiers until 1918. In the meantime he joined ''Soldatenraete'', German Socialist soldier councils, and identified himself as a [[Socialism|Socialist]]. He joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (''Unabhängigen Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands'' - USPD) and became active especially in forming the positions on education and educational politics of the party.

In June 1920 he was elected as a member of the [[Bundestag|National Parliament]] until 1923 as a member of the USPD and from 1923 to 1933 as a Member of the SPD. In September 1920 he was elected an Educational Counselor of Berlin by Election Committee of the City Council. The Brunderburger president denied him of this position in 1920.

From 1921 Löwenstein was responsible for education in the City Council of Berlin – [[Neukölln]]. In this time he organised progressive school tuition fees, providing more school meals for children. He organised special preparation classes for graduation for working class children. Together with [[Fritz Karsen]] they founded the [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx School]], the first non-religious school in Berlin.

From 1922 to 1934 Löwenstein was Vice-president and one of the co-founders of the [[International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International|Socialist Educational International]] (now the IFM-SEI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-sei.org/c/show/24 International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International Official Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1934 he was the president of the International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International. From 1924 to 1933 he was the president of German Children's friend movement (ReichsArbeitsGemeinschaft der Kinderfreunde), now the [[Socialist Youth of Germany – Falcons]]. In 1933, when the organisation was forbidden, it united 130,000 children, 10,000 guides and 60,000 parents.

'''Lee Strasberg''' (born '''Israel Strassberg''';&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; November 17, 1901{{spaced ndash}}February 17, 1982) was a [[Austrian Poland|Polish]]-born&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100536432 |title=Lee Strasberg |work=Oxford Reference |accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; American actor, director, and [[theatre practitioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OD-yAAAAIAAJ|title=The world of the theatre|first=Robert Willoughby|last=Corrigan|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Scott, Foresman and Company|accessdate=15 March 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded, with directors [[Harold Clurman]] and [[Cheryl Crawford]], the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1931, which was hailed as "America's first true theatrical collective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/buford-burt.html|title=Burt Lancaster|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he became director of the nonprofit [[Actors Studio]] in New York City, considered "the nation's most prestigious acting school,"&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; and in 1966 he was involved in the creation of Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.

Although other highly regarded teachers also developed "the Method," Strasberg is often considered the "father of [[method acting]] in America," according to author [[Mel Gussow]], and from the 1920s until his death in 1982 "he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and movies."&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; From his base in New York, he trained several generations of theatre and film notables, including [[Anne Bancroft]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Montgomery Clift]], [[James Dean]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Geraldine Page]], [[Eli Wallach]], and directors [[Frank Perry]] and [[Elia Kazan]].&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;Gussow, Mel. [http://movies2.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1117.html "Lee Strasberg of Actors Studio Is Dead"]. ''New York Times'', February 18, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970 Strasberg had become less involved with the Actors Studio and, with his third wife, Anna, opened the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute]] with branches in New York City and in [[Hollywood]], to continue teaching the [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], which he had interpreted and developed, particularly in light of the ideas of [[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]], for contemporary actors. The institute's primary stated goal was "to reach a larger audience of eager and emerging talent"&lt;ref name="LSTFI website"&gt;LSTFI website&lt;/ref&gt; than was served by the Actors Studio's notoriously selective admission process,&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; and as teachers of the method began to deploy their own personal interpretations of the discipline, "to dispel growing confusion and misrepresentation of the method, preserving what had by now become fundamental discoveries in [[Theatre pedagogy|actor training]]."&lt;ref name="LSTFI website"/&gt; The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute has its own rigorous sets of entrance criteria required for admission into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Admissions |url=http://newyork.methodactingstrasberg.com/how-to-apply/ |website=Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute |accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former student Elia Kazan directed James Dean in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' (1955), for which Kazan and Dean were nominated for [[Academy Award]]s. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was "the greatest school of the theater [and] the best thing that can happen to an actor."&lt;ref name=Bast&gt;Bast, W. ''Surviving James Dean'', Barricade Books (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Tennessee Williams]], writer of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', said of Strasberg's actors, "They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life." Directors such as [[Sidney Lumet]], a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg's "method."&lt;ref name=EWB&gt;"Sidney Lumet". ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazan, in his autobiography, wrote, "He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a [[witch doctor]], a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], and a feared father of a Jewish home. ... [He] was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, and made them 'permanent.'"&lt;ref name=Kazan&gt;Kazan, Elia. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xglC324UIUgC ''Elia Kazan: A Life''], Da Capo Press (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|61}} Today, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, and Harvey Keitel lead this nonprofit studio dedicated to the development of actors, playwrights, and directors.

As an actor, Strasberg is probably best known for his supporting role as gangster [[Hyman Roth]] alongside his former student Pacino in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), a role he took at Pacino's suggestion after Kazan turned down the role, and which earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. He also appeared in ''[[... And Justice for All (film)|... And Justice for All]]'' (1979).&lt;ref name=Lumet&gt;Lumet, Sidney, and Rapf, Joanna E.

==Early years==
Lee Strasberg was born Israel Strassberg in [[Budaniv|Budzanów]] in [[Austrian Poland]] (part of [[Austria-Hungary]], now in Ukraine), to Jewish parents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/3578/|title=A Century of Strasberg|last=Tugend|first=Tom|date=November 23, 2000|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|access-date=May 27, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baruch Meyer Strassberg and his wife, Ida (born Chaia), née Diner, and was the youngest of three sons. His father emigrated to New York while his family remained in their home village with an uncle, a rabbinical teacher. His father, who worked as a presser in the garment industry, sent first for his eldest son and his daughter. Finally, enough money was saved to bring over his wife and his two remaining sons. In 1909 the family was reunited on [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side, where they lived until the early '20s. Young Strasberg took refuge in voracious reading and the companionship of his older brother, Zalmon, whose death in the [[1918 influenza epidemic]] was so [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] for the young Strasberg that, despite being a straight-A student, he dropped out of high school.&lt;ref&gt;Carnicke, Sharon. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qaflXwJBVSMC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Strasberg%20%22dropped%20out%22 ''Stanislavsky in Focus: An Acting Master for the Twenty-first Century''] New York: Routledge, 1988. {{ISBN|0-203-88209-1}}. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A relative introduced him to the theatre by giving him a small part in a [[Yiddish]]-language production being performed by the Progressive Drama Club. He later joined the Chrystie Street Settlement House's drama club. [[Philip Loeb]], casting director of the Theater Guild, sensed that Strasberg could act, although he was not yet thinking of a full-time acting career, and was still working as a shipping clerk and bookkeeper for a wig company. When he was 23 years old, he enrolled in the [[Clare Tree Major]]  School of the Theater. He became a naturalized United States citizen on January 16, 1939, in New York City at the New York Southern District Court.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Life-shaping revelation==
Kazan biographer [[Richard Schickel]] described Strasberg's first experiences with the art of acting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He dropped out of high school, worked in a shop that made hairpieces, drifted into the theater via a settlement house company and ... had his life-shaping revelation when [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] brought his [[Moscow Art Theatre]] to the United States in 1923. He had seen good acting before, of course, but never an ensemble like this with actors completely surrendering their egos to the work. ... [H]e observed, first of all, that all the actors, whether they were playing leads or small parts, worked with the same commitment and intensity. No actors idled about posing and preening (or thinking about where they might dine after the performance). More important, every actor seemed to project some sort of unspoken, yet palpable, inner life for his or her character. This was acting of a sort that one rarely saw on the American stage ... where there was little stress on the psychology of the characters or their interactions. ... Strasberg was galvanized. He knew that his own future as an actor—he was a slight and unhandsome man—was limited. But he soon perceived that as a theoretician and teacher of this new 'system' it might become a major force in American theater.&lt;ref name=Schickel&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''Elia Kazan: A Biography'', HarperCollins (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strasberg eventually left the Clare Tree Major School to study with students of Stanislavski—[[Maria Ouspenskaya]] and [[Richard Boleslavsky]]—at the [[American Laboratory Theatre]]. In 1925 Strasberg had his first professional appearance in ''Processional'', a play produced by the Theater Guild.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;Slater, Robert and Elinor.
''Great Jewish Men'', Jonathan David Company, Inc. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schickel:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Strasberg ... took away from the Actors Lab was a belief that just as an actor could be prepared physically for his work with dance, movement, and [[fencing]] classes, he could be mentally prepared by resort to analogous mental exercises. They worked on relaxation as well as concentration. They worked with nonexistent objects that helped prepare them for the exploration of equally ephemeral emotions. They learned to use "affective memory," as Strasberg called the most controversial aspect of his teaching—summoning emotions from their own lives to illuminate their stage roles. ...  Strasberg believed he could codify this system, a necessary precursor to teaching it to anyone who wanted to learn it. ...  [H]e became a director more preoccupied with getting his actors to work in the "correct" way than he was in shaping the overall presentation.&lt;ref name=Schickel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Acting director and teacher==

===Group Theater===
He gained a reputation with the Theater Guild of New York and helped form the Group Theater in New York in 1931.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;''The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'', Houghton Mifflin Reference Books, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; There, he created a technique that became known as "the method" or "[[method acting]]." His teaching style owed much to the Russian [[Theatre practitioner|practitioner]], Konstantin Stanislavski, whose book, ''[[An Actor Prepares]]'' (published in English in 1936), dealt with the [[psychology]] of acting. He began by directing, but his time was gradually taken up by the [[Theatre pedagogy|training of actors]]. Called "America's first true theatrical collective," the Lab immediately offered a few tuition-free scholarships for its three-year program to "promising students."&lt;ref name=Buford&gt;Buford, Kate. ''Burt Lancaster: An American Life'', DaCapo Press (2001)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote, "The Group Theatre ... with its self-defined mission to reconnect theater to the world of ideas and actions, staged plays that confronted social and moral issues ... with members [[Harold Clurman]], Lee Strasberg, Stella, and Luther Adler, [[Clifford Odets]], [[Elia Kazan]], and an ill-assorted band of idealistic actors living hand to mouth are seen welded in a collective of creativity that was also a tangle of jealousies, love affairs, and explosive feuds."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wendy. ''Real Life Drama'', Grove Press (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Arthur Miller]] said "the Group Theatre was unique and probably will never be repeated. For a while it was literally the voice of Depression America." Co-founder Harold Clurman, in describing what Strasberg brought to the Group Theater, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lee Strasberg is one of the few artists among American theater directors. He is the director of introverted feeling, of strong emotion curbed by ascetic control, sentiment of great intensity muted by delicacy, pride, fear, shame. The effect he produces is a classic hush, tense and tragic, a constant conflict so held in check that a kind of beautiful spareness results. The roots are clearly in the intimate experience of a complex psychology, an acute awareness of human contradiction and suffering.&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Strasberg, Kazan, Clurman, and others with the Group Theater spent summers at [[Pine Brook Country Club]] located in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre, Don Wilmeth, p. 21&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actors Studio===
In 1947 Elia Kazan, [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], also members of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]], started the [[Actors Studio]] as a nonprofit workshop for professional and aspiring actors to concentrate on their craft away from the pressures of the commercial theatre.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; Strasberg assumed leadership of the studio in 1951 as its artistic director. "As a teacher and acting theorist, he revolutionized American actor training and engaged such remarkable performers as [[Kim Hunter]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Geraldine Page]], [[Ellen Burstyn]], and [[Al Pacino]]." Since its inception, the studio has been a nonprofit educational corporation chartered by the state of New York, and has been supported entirely by contributions and benefits. ...  We have here the possibility of creating a kind of theatre that would be a shining medal for our country," Strasberg said in 1959. UCLA acting teacher Robert Hethmon writes, "The Actors Studio is a refuge. Its privacy is guarded ferociously against the casual intruder, the seeker of curiousities, and the exploiter. ... The Studio helps actors to meet the enemy within ... and contributes greatly to Strasberg's utterly pragmatic views on training the actor and solving his problems. ... [and] is kept deliberately modest in its circumstances, its essence being the private room where Lee Strasberg and some talented actors can work."

Strasberg wrote: "At the studio, we do not sit around and feed each other's egos. People are shocked how severe we are on each other."&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; Admission to the Actors Studio was usually by audition with more than a thousand actors auditioning each year and the directors usually conferring membership on only five or six each year. "The Studio was, and is ''[[sui generis]]''," said Elia Kazan, proudly. Beginning in a small, private way, with a strictly off-limits-to-outsiders policy, the Studio quickly earned a high reputation in theatre circles.

The Emmy Award–winning author of ''Inside Inside'', [[James Lipton]], writes that the Actors Studio became "one of the most prestigious institutions in the world" as a result of its desire to set a higher "standard" in acting.&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt; The founders, including Strasberg, demanded total commitment and extreme talent from aspiring students. [[Jack Nicholson]] auditioned five times before he was accepted; Dustin Hoffman, six times; and Harvey Keitel, 11 times. After each rejection, a candidate had to wait as long as a year to try again. [[Martin Landau]] and [[Steve McQueen]] were the only two students admitted one year, out of 2000 candidates who auditioned.&lt;ref name=Lipton/&gt;

*''Al Pacino'': "The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves. Brando doesn't give Lee any credit ... Next to Charlie (Charles Laughton), it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting."&lt;ref name=Pacino&gt;Pacino, Al, and Grobel, Lawrence. ''Al Pacino: In Conversation with Lawrence Grobel'', Simon and Schuster (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Marlon Brando:'' Movie stars spawned by Strasberg's Actors Studio were of a new type that is often labeled the "rebel hero," wrote Pamela Wojcik. Historian Sam Staggs writes that "[[Marlon Brando]] was the hot, sleek engine on the Actors Studio express," and called him "[the] embodiment of method acting,"&lt;ref&gt;Staggs, Sam. "When Blanche Met Brando: the Scandalous Story of ''A Streetcar Named Desire''," Macmillan (2005), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; but Brando was trained primarily by [[Stella Adler]], a former member of the Group Theatre, who had a falling out with Strasberg over his interpretations of Stanislavsky's ideas." He based his acting technique on the method, once stating, "It made me a real actor. The idea is you learn to use everything that happened in your life and you learn to use it in creating the character you're working on. You learn how to dig into your unconscious and make use of every experience you've ever had."&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;

In Brando's autobiography, ''Songs My Mother Taught Me'', the actor claimed he learned nothing from Strasberg: "After I had some success, Lee Strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshiped him, and I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because Elia Kazan was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls there, but Strasberg never taught me acting. Stella did—and later Kazan."&lt;ref&gt;Brando, Marlon. ''Songs My Mother Taught Me'', Random House (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

*''James Dean:'' According to James Dean biographer W. Bast, "Proud of this accomplishment, Dean referred to the studio in a 1952 letter, when he was 21 years old, to his family as 'The greatest school of the theater. It houses great people like Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Arthur Kennedy, Mildred Dunnock. ... Very few get into it. ...  It's the best thing that can happen to an actor. I'm one of the youngest to belong.'"&lt;ref name=Bast/&gt;
*''Marilyn Monroe:'' Film author [[Maurice Zolotow]] wrote: "Between ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' and ''[[Some Like it Hot]]'' only four years elapsed, but her world had changed. She had become one of the most celebrated personalities in the world. She had divorced [[Joe Di Maggio]]. She had married [[Arthur Miller]]. She had become a disciple of Lee Strasberg. She was seriously studying acting. She was reading good books."&lt;ref name=Zolotow&gt;Zolotow, Maurice. ''Billy Wilder in Hollywood'', Hal Leonard Corp. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tennessee Williams:'' [[Tennessee Williams]]'s plays have been populated by graduates of the studio, where he felt, "studio actors had a more intense and honest style of acting." He wrote, "They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life."&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt; Williams was a co-founder of the group and a key member of its playwright's wing; he later wrote ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', Brando's greatest early role.&lt;ref name=Screenwriting&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4bKZc5PDoYUC "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Screenwriting"] Alpha Books, (2004), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Jane Fonda:'' [[Jane Fonda]] recalled that at the age of 5, her brother, actor [[Peter Fonda]], and she acted out Western stories similar to those her father, [[Henry Fonda]], played in the movies. She attended Vassar College and went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, "I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father—who had to say so—told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!"&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Arnold W., and Blau, Judith R. ''Art and Society: Readings in the Sociology of the Arts'', [[State University of New York|State University of New York Press]] (1989), pp. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching methods and philosophy==
In describing his teaching philosophy, Strasberg wrote, "The two areas of discovery that were of primary importance in my work at the Actors Studio and in my private classes were improvisation and affective memory. It is finally by using these techniques that the actor can express the appropriate emotions demanded of the character."&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, Jeremy G. ''Star Texts: Image and Performance in Film and Television'', Wayne State University Press. (1991) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Strasberg demanded great discipline of his actors, as well as great depths of psychological truthfulness. He once explained his approach in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The human being who acts is the human being who lives. That is a terrifying circumstance. Essentially, the actor acts a fiction, a dream; in life, the stimuli to which we respond are always real. The actor must constantly respond to stimuli that are imaginary. And yet this must happen not only just as it happens in life, but [also] actually more fully and more expressively. Although the actor can do things in life quite easily, when he has to do the same thing on the stage under fictitious conditions, he has difficulty because he is not equipped as a human being merely to playact at imitating life. He must somehow believe. He must somehow be able to convince himself of the rightness of what he is doing in order to do things fully on the stage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to film critic/author [[Mel Gussow]], Strasberg required that an actor, when preparing for a role, delve not only into the character's life in the play but also, "Far more importantly, into the character's life before the curtain rises. In rehearsal, the character's prehistory,  perhaps going back to childhood, is discussed and even acted out. The play became the climax of the character's existence."&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;

===Elia Kazan as student===
In Elia Kazan's autobiography, the [[Academy Award]]–winning director wrote about his earliest memories of Strasberg as teacher:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He carried with him the aura of a prophet, a magician, a witch doctor, a psychoanalyst, and a feared father of a Jewish home. He was the center of the camp's activities that summer, the core of the vortex. Everything in camp revolved around him. Preparing to direct the play that was to open the coming season, as he had the three plays of the season before, he would also give the basic instruction in acting, laying down the principles of the art by which the Group worked, the guides to their artistic training. He was the force that held the thirty-odd members of the theatre together, made them 'permanent.' He did this not only by his superior knowledge but by the threat of his anger. ... He enjoyed his eminence just as the admiral would. Actors are as self-favoring as the rest of humanity, and perhaps the only way they could be held together to do their work properly was by the threat of an authority they respected. And feared. No one questioned his dominance—he spoke holy writ—his leading role in that summer's activities, and his right to all power. To win his favor became everyone's goal. His explosions of temper maintained the discipline of this camp of high-strung people. I came to believe that without their fear of this man, the Group would fly apart, everyone going in different directions instead of to where he was pointing. ... I was afraid of him too. Even as I admired him. Lee was making an artistic revolution and knew it. An organization such as the Group – then in its second year, which is to say still beginning, still being shaped—lives only by the will of a fanatic and the drive with which he propels his vision. He has to be unswerving, uncompromising, and unadjustable. Lee knew this. He'd studied other revolutions, political and artistic. He knew what was needed, and he was fired up by his mission and its importance.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Classroom settings===
Kazan described the classes taught by Strasberg:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At his classes in the technique of acting, Lee laid down the rules, supervised the first exercises. These were largely concerned with the actor's arousing his inner temperament. The essential and rather simple technique, which has since then been complicated by teachers of acting who seek to make the Method more recondite for their commercial advantage, consists of recalling the circumstances, physical and personal, surrounding an intensely emotional experience in the actor's past. It is the same as when we accidentally hear a tune we may have heard at a stormy or an ecstatic moment in our lives, and find, to our surprise, that we are reexperiencing the emotion we felt then, feeling ecstasy again or rage and the impulse to kill. The actor becomes aware that he has emotional resources; that he can awaken, by this self-stimulation, a great number of very intense feelings; and that these emotions are the materials of his art. ... Lee taught his actors to launch their work on every scene by taking a minute to remember the details surrounding the emotional experience in their lives that would correspond to the emotion of the scene they were about to play. 'Take a minute!' became the watchword of that summer, the phrase heard most often, just as this particular kind of inner concentration became the trademark of Lee's own work when he directed a production. His actors often appeared to be in a state of self-hypnosis.&lt;ref name=Kazan/&gt;{{rp|61}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====James Dean====
[[Image:James Dean in East of Eden trailer 2.jpg|thumb|James Dean in ''East of Eden'']]
In 1955 Strasberg student James Dean died in a car accident, at age 24. Strasberg, during a regular lecture shortly after this accident, discussed Dean. The following are excerpts from a transcription of his recorded lecture:
{{Clear}} &lt;!-- Ensures picture is complete before starting blockquote so it isn't two inches wide if pictures are set on large--&gt;

{{quote|(In the middle of his lecture on another topic) To hell with it! I hadn't planned to say this, because I don't know how I'll behave when I say it; I don't think it will bother me. But I saw Jimmy Dean in ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' the other night, and I must say that—[he weeps] You see, that's what I was afraid of. [A long pause] When I got in the cab, I cried. ... What I cried at was the waste, the waste. ... If there is anything in the theatre to which I respond more than anything else—maybe I'm getting old, or maybe I'm getting sentimental—it is the waste in the theatre, the talent that gets up and the work that goes into getting it up and getting it where it should be. And then when it gets there, what the hell happens with it? The senseless destruction, the senseless waste, the hopping about from one thing to the next, the waste of the talent, the waste of your lives, the strange kind of behavior that not just Jimmy had, you see, but that a lot of you here have and a lot of other actors have that are going through exactly the same thing. ... As soon as you grow up as actors, as soon as you reach a certain place, there it goes, the drunkenness and the rest of it, as if, now that you've really made it, the incentive goes, and something happens which to me is just terrifying. I don't know what to do. ...

The only answer possibly is that we somehow here find a way, a means, an organization, a plan [that] should really contribute to the theatre, so that there should not only be the constant stimulus to your individual development, which I think we have provided, but also that once your individual development is established, it should then actually contribute to the theatre, rather than to an accidental succession of good, bad, or indifferent things. But I am very, very scared that despite how strongly I feel, or despite how stimulated you become, nothing will be done. ... [A]nd we will just continue to get so caught up that in a strange way we do not really live our lives. ... To me that is the future of the Studio, that a unified body of people should somehow be connected with a tangible, consistent, and continuous effort. That is the dream I have always had. That is what got me into theatre in the first place. That was the thing that got me involved in The Actors Studio ... and now it becomes time to think a little bit more about our responsibility for that individual talent. ... I'm stuck. I don't know. And this is really the problem of the Studio.}}

====On Marilyn Monroe====
In 1962 [[Marilyn Monroe]] died at age 36. At the time of her death, she was at the height of her career. In 1999 she was ranked the sixth greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the [[American Film Institute]]. Strasberg gave the eulogy at her funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Keg-lMqyb4U|Watch videos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|meFKIbxsyRQ|Marilyn Monroe's funeral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For us, Marilyn was a devoted and loyal friend—a colleague constantly reaching for perfection. We shared her pain and difficulties, and some of her joys. She was a member of our family. ... It is difficult to accept the fact that her zest for life has been ended by this dreadful accident. Despite the heights and brilliance she had attained on the screen, she was planning for the future. She was looking forward to participating in the many exciting things. In her eyes, and in mine, her career was just beginning. ... She had a luminous quality. A combination of wistfulness, radiance, and yearning that set her apart and made everyone wish to be part of it—to share in the childish naiveté which was at once so shy and yet so vibrant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
His first marriage was to Nora Krecaum on October 29, 1926, until her death three years later in 1929. In 1934 he married actress and drama coach [[Paula Strasberg|Paula Miller]] (1909–66) until her death from cancer in 1966. They were the parents of actress [[Susan Strasberg]] (1938–99) and acting teacher [[John Strasberg]] (born 1941). His third wife was the former Anna Mizrahi (b. April 16, 1939) and the mother of his two youngest children, Adam Lee Strasberg (b. July 29, 1969) and David Lee Israel Strasberg (b. January 30, 1971).

==Death and commemoration==
[[Image:Lee Strasberg 800.jpg|thumb|250px|The rock at Lee Strasberg's grave at [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]]]]
On February 17, 1982, Lee Strasberg suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in New York City, aged 80.&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/663287992.html?dids=663287992:663287992&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Feb+18%2C+1982&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Lee+Strasberg%2C+%27Method%27+Acting+Mentor%2C+Dies+at+80&amp;pqatl=google "Lee Strasberg, 'Method' Acting Mentor, Dies at 80"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 18, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; With him at the time of his death at the hospital were his third wife, Anna, and their two sons. He was interred at [[Westchester Hills Cemetery]] in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]]. A day before his unexpected death, he was officially notified that he had been elected to the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]]. His last public appearance was on February 14, 1982, at ''Night of 100 Stars'' in the [[Radio City Music Hall]], a benefit for the [[Actors Fund]]. Along with Al Pacino and [[Robert De Niro]], he danced in the chorus line with [[the Rockettes]].&lt;ref name=obit1/&gt;

Actress Ellen Burstyn recalled that evening:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Late in the evening, I wandered into the greenroom and saw Lee sitting next to Anna, watching the taping on the monitor. I sat next to him and we chatted a little. Lee wasn't one for small talk, so I didn't stay long. But before I got up, I said, 'Lee, I've been asked to run for president of Actors Equity.' He reached over and patted me on the back, 'That's wonderful, dahling. Congratulations.' Those were the last words he ever said to me. ... Two days later, early in the morning, I was still asleep when the door to my bedroom opened. I woke up and saw my friend and assistant, Katherine Cortez, enter the room and walk toward me. ... 'We just got a call. Lee Strasberg died.' No, no, no, I wailed, over and over. 'I'm not ready,' and pulled the covers over my head. I had told myself that I must be prepared for this, but I was not prepared. What was I to do now? Who would I work for when I was preparing for a role? Who would I go to when I was in trouble?. ... His memorial service was held at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theater]] where ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' was playing. Lee's coffin was brought down the aisle and placed center stage. Everybody in the theater world came—actors, writers, directors, producers, and most, if not all of, his students. He was a giant of the theater and was deeply mourned. Those of us who had the great good fortune to be fertilized and quickened by his genius would feel the loss of him for the rest of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;Burstyn, Ellen. ''Lessons in Becoming Myself'', Riverhead Books (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an 80th birthday interview, he said that he was looking forward to his next 20 years in the theater. According to friends, he was healthy until the day he died. "It was so unexpected," Al Pacino said. "What stood out was how youthful he was. He never seemed as old as his years. He was an inspiration." Actress Jane Fonda said after hearing of his death, "I'm not sure I even would have become an actress were it not for him. He will be missed, but he leaves behind a great legacy."

==Legacy==
[[File:Lee Strasberg Way.jpg|thumb|250px|[[15th Street (Manhattan)|East 15th Street]] between [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square East]] and [[Irving Place]] in [[Manhattan]] has been designated "Lee Strasberg Way".]]"Whether directly influenced by Strasberg or not," wrote acting author Pamela Wojcik, "the new male stars all to some degree or other adapted method techniques to support their identification as rebels. ... He recreates romance as a drama of male neuroticism and also invests his characterization 'with an unprecedented aura of verisimilitude.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wojcik, Pamela. ''Movie Acting, the Film Reader: The Film Reader'', Routledge (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Acting teacher and author Alison Hodge explains: "Seemingly spontaneous, intuitive, brooding, 'private,' lit with potent vibrations from an inner life of conflict and contradiction, their work exemplified the style of heightened naturalism which (whether Brando agrees or not) Lee Strasberg devoted his life to exploring and promoting."&lt;ref name="Wojcik, op cit"&gt;Wojcik, op cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pamela Wojcik adds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because of their tendency to substitute their personal feelings for those of the characters they were playing, Actors Studio performers were well suited to become Hollywood stars. ... In short, Lee Strasberg transformed a socialistic, egalitarian theory of acting into a celebrity-making machine. ... It does not matter who 'invented' Marlon Brando or how regularly or faithfully he, Dean, or Clift attended the Studio or studied the method at the feet of Lee Strasberg. In their signature roles—the most influential performances in the history of American films—these three performers revealed new kinds of body language and new ways of delivering dialogue. In the pauses between words, in the language 'spoken' by their eyes and faces, they gave psychological realism an unprecedented charge. Verbally inarticulate, they were eloquent 'speakers' of emotion. Far less protective of their masculinity than earlier film actors, they enacted emotionally wounded and vulnerable outsiders struggling for self-understanding, and their work shimmered with a mercurial neuroticism. . ... [T]he method-trained performers in films of the '50s added an enhanced verbal and gesture naturalism and a more vivid inner life.&lt;ref name="Wojcik, op cit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012 Strasberg's family donated his library of personal papers to the [[Library of Congress]]. The papers include 240 boxes containing correspondence, rehearsal notes, photographs, theatrical drawings and posters, sketches of stage designs, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/04/lee-strasberg-papers-headed-to-library-of-congress.html "Lee Strasberg papers headed to Library of Congress"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Nobody Dies on Friday}}Strasberg, his wife [[Paula Strasberg|Paula]], his daughter [[Susan Strasberg|Susan]], and his son [[John Strasberg|John]], all appear as characters in [[Robert Brustein]]'s 1998 play ''Nobody Dies on Friday'', which one critic called a "scathing portrait of Strasberg," but one that "can by no means be dismissed as a simple act of character assassination." Brustein, a critic, director, and producer, had previously made public his dislike of [[Method acting|the method]] as a philosophy of acting. The play was produced by Brustein's [[American Repertory Theatre]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and was later presented in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Peter.

Initially housed in the First Executive Mansion on [[Ashmun Street]] of the city which is now used as a library, it was established by an Act of the [[Legislature of Liberia|National Legislature]] in 1958 under the administration of Liberia's 18th President, Dr [[William V.S. Tubman]]. Partly funded by [[UNESCO]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dakar.unesco.org/documents/en/unesco_liberia.htm Ministry of Education in Liberia] Retrieved on May 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in coordination with the Department of Public instructions (what is now the Liberian Ministry of Education), its primary goal was to obtain, preserve and display cultural artefacts and other historical items which depict the country's heritage.

==History==
The museum remained under the Department of Public Instructions until 1965 when it became the responsibility of the Department of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism. In 1981 this detached to form the National Bureau of Culture &amp; Tourism of which the museum operated under through much of the 1980s until June 1987 when it was dissolved and returned to the control of the Department of Information.
In 1972, the museum was relocated to a new building on [[Providence Island, Monrovia|Providence Island]] but four years later this building was removed to facilitate the construction of the [[People's Bridge]] over the [[Mesurado River]].

It was later moved to the Old Supreme Court building and formally reopened on July 25, 1987 with a ceremony given by the Vice President of Liberia, [[Harry F. Moniba]].&lt;ref name="micat.gov.lr"&gt;[http://www.micat.gov.lr/content.php?sub=National%20Museum&amp;?related=Culture Ministry of Information of the Government of the Republic of Liberia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515010101/http://www.micat.gov.lr/content.php?sub=National+Museum&amp;%3Frelated=Culture |date=2017-05-15 }} Retrieved on May 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum layout==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Dr. Harry Fumba Moniba.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The museum reopened on July 25, 1987 in a ceremony presented by [[Harry Moniba]].]]                                                 --&gt;
The museum is classified in three tiers, where on the ground floor there is a histographical gallery containing presidential papers, private documents and [[memoirs]] of past important executives of the Liberian government and [[photograph]]s and [[cartographical]] resources related to its culture. On display is the nation's first flag dating back to August 1847. There are also other items ranging from postage stamps to an editorial page of Liberia's daily newspaper, the ''[[Liberia Herald]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4556849.stm BBC News] May 18, 2005, Retrieved on May 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other items include traditional Liberian household furniture and utensils, and there is a craft shop run by the African Arts &amp; Crafts Inc.

On the next floor is the Ethnographical Gallery and on the top floor the contemporary arts gallery which illustrates Liberian artistic works many of which are product of a contract between the museum and art institutions and art colleges throughout the country where artists are commissioned to produce for the museum purposes.&lt;ref name="micat.gov.lr"/&gt;

Other museum facilities include a portable video system, editing and archival materials, [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] recordings and slides of visual and oral arts many of which offer an insight into Liberian cultures such as dance and the use of [[mask]]s in the country.

==Effects of the Liberian civil war==
The national museum was deeply affected by the 14 years of war during the [[First Liberian Civil War|First]] and [[Second Liberian Civil War]]s. According to the director of the museum Caesar Harris approximately 5,000 artifacts were looted during this period and now less than 100 larger artifacts remain.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; Still intact though is a 250-year-old dining table given as gift from [[Queen Victoria]] to Liberia's first President, [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]]. During the war, valuable museum items were often sold to fleeing expatriates and the museum itself came under fire during rebel attacks in 2003.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; However, although the war severely affected the content of the museum today it also has items which offer an insight into the war itself.

Professional institutions are the societies and associations, they help develop and promote a career and the people who practice in it. There are many chartered professional institutes in the UK, over 80, that cover many different areas of work. The different areas of work that are covered includes constructions, health, journalism, personnel, finance, engineering, law and of course, management. The professional institutes can help you both before and after you graduate.&lt;ref&gt;http://targetjobs.co.uk/professional-qualification-and-accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
There are institutes that have websites that you're able to sign up to, where they help you with your development and challenges within the professional institutes. One of the websites that provides this service is http://www.managers.org.uk/ the Chartered Management Institute. You are able to attend events and take courses based on many different types of institutes in management and learn about development, these would include: Leadership event, Building a business event, Visionary leaders event, Introduction to Management course and Essential management skills course. They say that they are the only Awarding Body that are able to award Chartered Manager status, which is the ultimate management accolade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managers.org.uk/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}

Different institutes have different ways of helping you further in your career, such as learning styles. The institutes would assess you, and how they assess you would be individual to the institute; it would most likely be based on your education, knowledge, skills and experience. They might also have different ways of grading and awarding points, as well as different types of membership that you're able to have; some institutes have one day programs, monthly programs and even group programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ims-online.com/membership.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Management is a major factor in all careers, it consists of organising, controlling, planning and also, directing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/management.html&lt;/ref&gt; Management is at the top of hierarchy as it is what controls everything else within a company/business. If there is no management, then there would be no order or organisation within a company, this would result in the company not being successful. This is why institutes for management would be important and very useful.

There are many different areas of work that go into management; it expands into many different sectors due to how broad management is. Some of the different types of management includes, '''Accounting''' management, '''Business''' management and '''Marketing''' management.

==Institutes==
An institute is an organisation that has a particular purpose, in this case, the purpose is for further and higher education;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=institute+definition&lt;/ref&gt; some higher education institutions hold university statues'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0729436052000318569 | volume=24 | title=Occupational stress in UK higher education institutions: a comparative study of all staff categories | journal=Higher Education Research &amp; Development | pages=41–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher education institutions need to have a distinct image that they should maintain and also to develop, this would be so that they can create a competitive advantage as the market is increasingly competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Paramewaran, R, and Glowacka, AE. (1995), “University image: an information processing perspective”, Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, Vol. 6 No. 2, pp. 41‐56.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tertiary education system that is undergoing fundamental metamorphosis, this is both in the UK and South Africa; they are both facing changes in government funding. There are at least 71 different institutes that are represented in the UK and at least 20 different institutions from South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Ivy, (2001) "Higher education institution image: acorrespondence analysis approach", International Journal of Educational Management, Vol. 15 Iss: 6, pp.276 - 282&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a company website called 'IMD World Competitiveness Centre', they have a partnership with institutes and have a worldwide network. They have partner institutes in 55 countries; the IMD World Competitiveness Centre helps with '''business''', academics highlight competitive advantage, governments and undercover opportunities by offering a range of products and services which includes workshops and economy assessments. They have partner institutes in Africa/Middle East and they include in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, South Africa and United Arab Emirates. Partner Institutes in America includes, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. In Asia/Pacific they include Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Lastly, in Europe they include, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcc-partner/#tab=2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are institutes that are profitable, there are also institutes that are not profitable. In the UK, there is an institute called 'Project Management Institute' and it is the world's leading non profitable professional membership association. It was founded in 1969 and it delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals that work in nearly every country, they advance careers and improve organisational success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmi.org/About-Us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK==
The UK government policies dictate that education in higher education institutes look to profit-making organisations for models that would help with performance improvement (Galloway, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, L. (1998), “Quality perceptions of internal and external customers: a case study in education administration”, The TQM Magazine, Vol. 10 No 1, pp. 20‐6.&lt;/ref&gt; This would mean that there is a need for strengthening of the partnership between educational institutes and business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">The '''Living Museum of Bujumbura''' ({{lang-fr|Musée Vivant de Bujumbura}}) is a [[zoo]] and [[museum]] in [[Burundi]]. The museum is located in the capital [[Bujumbura]] and is one of [[List of museums in Burundi|the country's public museums]]. It is dedicated to the [[wildlife]] and [[art]] of Burundi.&lt;ref name=Akeza&gt;{{cite news|last=Irakoze|first=Inès|title=Le Musée Vivant de Bujumbura, un trésor unique aux oubliettes|url=http://akeza.net/le-musee-vivant-de-bujumbura-un-tresor-unique-aux-oubliettes/|publisher=Akeza.net|date=13 December 2016|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was founded in 1977 and occupies a {{convert|3|ha}} park on the rue du 13 Octobre in downtown Bujumbura. In December 2016, the zoo's collection included six [[crocodile]]s, one [[monkey]], one [[leopard]], two [[chimpanzee]]s, three [[guinea fowl]]s, a [[tortoise]], an [[antelope]], and a number of [[snake]]s and fish.&lt;ref name=Akeza/&gt; A number of Burundian craftsmen also have workshops on the museum's premises.&lt;ref name=Akeza/&gt; Several different types of trees stand in the park, alongside a reconstruction of a traditional Burundian house (''rugo'').

The number of visitors to the museum fell sharply in the aftermath of the [[2015 Burundian unrest]], following a wider decline in the number of tourists to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Musée vivant de Bujumbura: Il a subi des pertes d’au moins 10%|url=http://www.ppbdi.com/index.php/ubumwe/imibano/2234-musee-vivant-de-bujumbura-sa-frequentation-pendant-la-periode-de-crise|publisher=Publication de Presse Burundaise|accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Vos''' (born 20 October 1983), also known as 'pokerbok', is a professional [[poker]] player from [[Australia]]. Vos was born in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], and attended Waldorf High School in [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]]. He excelled at [[International Mathematical Olympiad|mathematics olympiads]] while in high school, and represented his province in the interprovincial olympiad. Vos permanently deferred his [[Actuary|actuarial studies]] at [[Macquarie University]], to play poker full-time. Starting out online with limit [[Texas Holdem|hold'em]] in mid-2004, Vos soon turned his attention to no-limit games, and in short time, earned a reputation as being one of the world's top online poker players, such that he can often be found playing in the most expensive [[cash game]]s and tournaments online. When not travelling the world playing poker, Vos plans to divide his time between Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref name="fulltilt"&gt;[http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/markVos.php FullTilt.net Player profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711150649/http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/markVos.php |date=11 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Vos finished 8th in the main event of the [[Crown Australian Poker Championship]], winning  [[A$]]83,600. As of May 2006, Vos represents the [[Full Tilt Poker]] online poker cardroom as a friend of Full Tilt Poker. His name is reflected in red on Full Tilt tables.

In July 2006, Vos won Event 6 at the [[2006 World Series of Poker]] ([[World Series of Poker|WSOP]]), the [[2006 World Series of Poker Results#Event 6: .242.2C000 No Limit Hold .27em|$2000 no limit hold 'em event]]. Outlasting a field of 1,919 players, Vos entered heads up action with [[Nam Le (poker player)|Nam Le]] an almost 3:1 chip underdog. On the final hand, Vos raised to $90,000 preflop and Le made the call. The flop came {{cards|Qs|8s|3h}} and Le check-called a $150,000 bet by Vos. The turn was the {{cards|2d}} and Le check-called for $250,000. The river brought the {{cards|Qd}} to which Le checked and Vos moved all in. Le, suspecting a bluff, made the call with {{cards|6c|6d}}, but Vos turned over {{cards|Qc|10c}} for trips and the win, collecting $803,274 and the gold [[WSOP bracelet|bracelet]], becoming one of the youngest WSOP bracelet winners in history. After his victory, Vos said, "[Winning] does not really change things. I mean, it helps. But I still plan to play poker, then [in five years] I'll relax, settle down and decide what I want to do with the rest of my life." &lt;ref name="pokerpages"&gt;[http://www.pokerpages.com/tournament/result13601.htm PokerPages.com Tournament Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514031148/http://www.pokerpages.com/tournament/result13601.htm |date=14 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vos cashed four times at the 2008 World Series of Poker including finishing in 80th place out of 6,844 entries in the $10,000 buy-in Main Event, earning $77,200.

As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,200,000. His 9 cashes at the WSOP account for $977,728 of those winnings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/players/index.asp?sort=cashearned&amp;pagenum=2 World Series of Poker Earnings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809184243/http://www.worldseriesofpoker.com/players/index.asp?sort=cashearned&amp;pagenum=2 |date=9 August 2009 }}, worldseriesofpoker.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity''' was made by the Director-General of [[UNESCO]] starting in 2001 to raise awareness of [[intangible cultural heritage]] and encourage local communities to protect them and the local people who sustain these forms of cultural expressions.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt; Several manifestations of intangible heritage around the world were awarded the title of ''Masterpieces'' to recognize the value of the non-material component of culture, as well as entail the commitment of states to promote and safeguard the Masterpieces.&lt;ref name=2003_proclamation /&gt; Further proclamations occurred biennially.&lt;ref name=2005_proclamation /&gt;

The list totaled 429 elements {{As of | 2017 | lc = on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists Browse the Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Register of good safeguarding practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
UNESCO defines oral and intangible heritage as "the totality of tradition-based creations of a cultural community expressed by a group or individuals and recognized as reflecting the expectations of a community in so far as they reflect its cultural and social identity."&lt;ref name=protection&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO TO PROTECT MASTERPIECES OF THE ORAL AND INTANGIBLE HERITAGE OF HUMANITY|url= http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2000/00-48e.shtml |publisher=UNESCO Press| date=2000-05-10 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=convention /&gt; [[Language]], [[literature]], [[music]] and [[dance]], [[game]]s and [[sports]], [[cuisine|culinary traditions]], [[rituals]] and [[mythologies]], knowledge and practices concerning the universe, [[know-how]] linked to [[handicrafts]], and cultural spaces are among the many forms of intangible heritage.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt;&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO What is Intangible Cultural Heritage?|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00002 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intangible heritage is seen as a repository of [[cultural diversity]],&lt;ref name=2005_proclamation&gt;{{cite web| title=The Samba of Roda and the Ramlila proclaimed Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|date=2005-11-25|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30973&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creative expression, as well as a driving force for living cultures.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;  Since it can be vulnerable to forces of [[globalization]], [[social transformation]], and [[Toleration|intolerance]],&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web| title=Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 2003
|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17716&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO encourages communities to identify, document, protect, promote and revitalize such heritage.&lt;ref name=convention /&gt;

[[Image:Djemaa el Fna, evening.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Citizens' protection of activities in Morocco's [[Djemaa el Fna]] Square inspired UNESCO's ''Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity'' label.]]
Upon the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity on November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001271/127160m.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO encouraged recognition and protection of intangible heritage in the same way as natural and cultural treasures of tangible heritage are protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Linguistic Diversity: 3,000 Languages In Danger | date=2002-02-19 | url = http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1864&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although UNESCO has had a program (active since 1972) to protect the world's cultural and natural heritage, known as the [[World Heritage List]], it thought that the List was directed mostly to the protection and representation of tangible, monumental elements of past cultures or natural environment.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;&lt;ref name=press_release&gt;{{cite web| title=WORLD CULTURE REPORT 2000 CALLS FOR PRESERVATION OF INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE | date=2000-11-17 |url= http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2000/00-120e.shtml |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity, is UNESCO's response to the call for humanity to widen its concept of cultural heritage by bringing in the intangible aspects.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; 

The idea for the project came from people concerned about [[Morocco]]'s [[Jamaa el Fna|Jeema' el Fna Square]] in [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref name=protection /&gt; The square is known for traditional activities by storytellers, musicians and other performers, but it was threatened by economic development pressures.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;  In fighting for the protection of traditions, the residents called for action on an international level to recognize the need for the protection of such places—termed as cultural spaces—and other popular and traditional forms of cultural expression.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;  The UNESCO label of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt;&lt;ref name=convention /&gt;
{{cquote|The spectacle of Djemaa el Fna is repeated daily and each day it is different. Everything changes  – voices, sounds, gestures, the public which sees, listens, smells, tastes, touches. The oral tradition is framed by one much vaster – that we can call intangible.

Beginning in 2001, the new program has started identifying various forms of intangible heritage around the world for safeguarding through a Proclamation.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt; Under this act, national governments acceding to the UNESCO Convention, known as member states, are each allowed to submit a single candidature file, in addition to multi-national nominations, of intangible cultural heritage occurring within their territories.&lt;ref name=protection /&gt; The nominated intangible heritage may fall into two categories as set by the program:&lt;ref name= proclamation_criteria /&gt;
* forms of popular and traditional cultural expressions; or
* cultural spaces, i.e., places where cultural and popular activities are concentrated and regularly take place (markets squares, festivals, etc.)

The nominations are evaluated by a panel of experts in intangible heritage, including specialized [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), and are further scrutinized by a jury, whose 18 members have previously been selected by the UNESCO Director-General.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt;&lt;ref name=proclamation_criteria&gt;{{cite web| title=Proclamation of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity (2001-2005)|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00103 |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A set of criteria has been created to aid in the assessing of the nominations. The cultural expressions and spaces proposed for proclamation had to:&lt;ref name= proclamation_criteria /&gt;
# demonstrate their outstanding value as masterpiece of the human creative genius;
# give wide evidence of their roots in the cultural tradition or cultural history of the community concerned;
# be a means of affirming the cultural identity of the cultural communities concerned;
# provide proof of excellence in the application of the skill and technical qualities displayed;
# affirm their value as unique testimony of living cultural traditions;
# be at risk of degradation or of disappearing.

Furthermore, the nominees should be in conformity with UNESCO ideals, in particular, with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name= proclamation_criteria /&gt; The nomination proposals also had to provide proof of the full involvement and agreement of the local communities and to include an action plan for the safeguarding or promotion of the concerned cultural spaces or expressions, which should have been elaborated in close collaboration with the tradition bearers.&lt;ref name= proclamation_criteria /&gt;

Through the nomination process, the member states are encouraged to compile an inventory of their intangible heritage, raising awareness and protection of these treasures. In turn, the proclaimed Masterpieces receive commitment from UNESCO in financing plans for their conservation.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO ISSUES FIRST EVER PROCLAMATION OF MASTERPIECES OF THE ORAL AND INTANGIBLE HERITAGE|date=2001-05-18|url= http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2001/01-71e.shtml |publisher=UNESCO Press |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2003_proclamation&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO Twenty-eight masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity proclaimed|url= http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17120&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |publisher=UNESCO Press |date=2003-11-07 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proclamations in 2001, 2003 and 2005, designated a total of 90 forms of intangible heritage around the world as Masterpieces:

==Current status==
{{see|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists}}
The increasing number of candidature files received and number of Masterpieces proclaimed every two years meant that UNESCO's goal of raising awareness on the importance of the protection of intangible heritage has been achieved. The rise in the number of participating member states led to the 2003 adoption of the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, which took effect in 2008.&lt;ref name=convention /&gt;&lt;ref name=convention2&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716023040/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN |archivedate=2009-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard-setting instrument was meant to complement the 1972 World Heritage Convention in its protection of intangible culture.&lt;ref name=2001_proclamation /&gt;  Following the successful example of the World Heritage Convention's World Heritage List program, UNESCO established the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].  This superseded the Proclamation program when the Convention took effect in 2008.&lt;ref name=convention /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Intangible Heritage Lists | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the 90 previously proclaimed Masterpieces, which would be called elements, were featured as the first entries on the new List.&lt;ref name=2005_proclamation /&gt;&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web | title = Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=EN&amp;pg=00173 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process for designating an element for the list follows similar steps as the Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Forms for nominations, proposals and assistance requests|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00184 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former role of the jury was supplanted by a new body known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00009 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UNESCO established a separate program, identifying elements for the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]], to highlight elements at risk despite the efforts of the local community to preserve and protect it, as a result of which it cannot be expected to survive without immediate safeguarding.  It also established a fund to provide emergency assistance for the preservation of such elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding | url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00174 |accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, UNESCO drafted the [[Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage]], which provides an international framework, source of funding, and strategic overview for the further identification and protection of these masterpieces and other intangible cultural heritages. The Convention went into force on 2006, and has since been approved by over 130 members.

'''Meret Elisabeth Oppenheim''' (6 October 1913 &amp;ndash; 15 November 1985) was a German-born [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Surrealist]] [[artist]] and [[photographer]]. Oppenheim was a member of the [[Surrealist]] movement along with [[André Breton]], [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Max Ernst]], and other writers and visual artists. Besides creating art objects, Oppenheim also famously appeared as a model for photographs by [[Man Ray]], most notably a series of nude shots of her interacting with a printing press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manray-photo.com/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=Meret+Oppenheim&amp;categories_id=32 Meret Oppenheim at manray-photo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheim is named after Meretlein, a wild child who lives in the woods, from the novel ''[[Green Henry]]'' by Gottfried Keller.&lt;ref&gt;“Maureen P. Sherlock, “Mistaken Identities: Méret Oppenheim,” in ‘’The Artist Outsider: Creativity and the Boundaries of Culture, ed. by Michael D. Hall and Eugene W. Metcalf, 276-288 (Washington, DC: Smithsonian, 1993), p. 281”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Spector, “Meret Oppenheim: Performing Identities,” in ‘’Meret Oppenheim: Beyond the Teacup,’’ ed. by Jacqueline Burckhardt and Bice Curiger, 35-43 (New York: Independent Curators Incorporated, 1996), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheim had two siblings, a sister named Kristin (born 1915) and a brother named Burkhard (born 1919).&lt;ref name= "Bice Curiger, ''Meret Oppenheim: Defiance in the Face of Freedom'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1989), p. 9"&gt;Bice Curiger, ''Meret Oppenheim: Defiance in the Face of Freedom'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1989), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, a German-Jewish&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/09/artwork-meret-oppenheim&lt;/ref&gt; doctor, was conscripted into the army at the outbreak of war in 1914.&lt;ref name="Bice Curiger, ''Meret Oppenheim: Defiance in the Face of Freedom'' (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1989), p. 9"/&gt;  Consequently, Oppenheim and her mother, who was Swiss,&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; moved to live with Oppenheim's maternal grandparents in Delémont, Switzerland.&lt;ref name= "Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.10"&gt;"Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.10"&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, Oppenheim was exposed to a plethora of art and artists from a young age. Oppenheim was also inspired by her aunt, Ruth Wenger, especially by Wenger's devotion to art and her modern lifestyle.&lt;ref name= "Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.10"/&gt; During the late 1920s, Oppenheim was further exposed to different artworks connected to Modernism, Expressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Surrealism and Women|last=Caws|first=Mary Ann|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1991|isbn=0-262-53098-8|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1928, Oppenheim was introduced to the writings of [[Carl Jung]] through her father and was inspired to record her dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mifflin|first=Margot|date=September 1986|title=An Interview with Meret Oppenheim|url=|journal=Women Artist News|volume=11|pages=30–32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dreams would serve as important sources for much of her art throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: Retrospective|last=Eipeldauer, Brugger, Seivernich, eds.|first=|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Paul Klee]], the focus of a retrospective at the Kunshalle Basel in 1929, provided another strong influence on Oppenheim, arousing her to the possibilities of abstraction.

In May 1932, at the age of 18, Oppenheim moved to Paris and sporadically attended the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]].&lt;ref name="Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.267"&gt;"Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.267"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, Oppenheim met [[Hans Arp]] and [[Alberto Giacometti]]. After visiting her studio and seeing her work, Arp and Giacometti invited her to participate in the Surrealist exhibition in the “Salon des Surindépendants,” &lt;ref name="Curiger, ''Defiance'', p.267" /&gt; held in Paris between 27 October and 26 November.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Helfenstein, "Against the Intolerability of Fame: Meret Oppenheim and Surrealism," in ‘‘Beyond the Teacup,’’ p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheim later met [[André Breton]] and began to participate in meetings at the Café de la Place Blanche with the Surrealist circle. Shortly after she began to attend meetings regularly with Breton and other acquaintances, Oppenheim’s circle was joined by other Surrealist artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and Man Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: Beyond the Teacup|last=Burckhardt|first=Jacqueline|last2=Curiger|first2=Bice|publisher=Independent Curators Incorporated|year=1996|isbn=|editor-last=Capp|editor-first=Robbie|location=New York, NY|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual approach favored by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[Francis Picabia]] became important to her work.&lt;ref name="Meret Oppenheim: A Retrospective"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: A Retrospective|last=|first=|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1936, Oppenheim had her first solo exhibition in [[Basel]], Switzerland, at the [[Galerie Schulthess]].&lt;ref&gt;‘’Beyond the Teacup,’’ p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to contribute to Surrealist exhibitions until 1960. Many of her pieces consisted of everyday objects arranged to allude to female sexuality and feminine exploitation by the opposite sex. Oppenheim’s paintings focused on the same themes. Her abundant strength of character and her self-assurance informed each work she created, conveying a certain comfortable confrontation with life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Lisa Jaye|last2=Qualls|first2=Larry|date=1997-01-01|title=Nobody Will Give You Freedom You Have to Take It|jstor=3245744|journal=Performing Arts Journal|volume=19|issue=1|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her originality and audacity established her as a leading figure in the Surrealist movement.

Méret Oppenheim's first one-woman exhibition in the Galerie Schulthess, Basel (1936) featured surrealist objects. In 1937, Oppenheim returned to [[Basel]] and this marked the start of her artistic block. She struggled after she met success and worried about her development as an artist. Méret Oppenheim usually worked in spontaneous bursts and at times destroyed her work. Oppenheim took a hiatus from her artistic career in 1939 after an exhibition at the [[Galerie René Drouin]] started by [[Rene Drouin]] in [[Paris]]. In the exhibition she was featured alongside many artists, including [[Leonor Fini]] and [[Max Ernst]]. She did not share any art with the public again until the 1950s. Oppenheim then reverted to her "original style" and based her new artworks on old sketches and earlier works and creations.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney Chadwick, Grove Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Méret Oppenheim's best known artwork is ''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]] [Object (Breakfast in Fur)]'' (1936). Oppenheim's ''Object'' consists of a teacup, saucer and spoon that she covered with fur from a Chinese gazelle. The fur represents an affluent woman; the cup, hollow yet round, can evoke female genitalia; the spoon, with its phallic shape, further eroticizes the hairy object.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="From Dejeuner en fourrure to Caroline: Meret Oppenheim's Chronicle of Surrealism" Surrealism and Women|last=Riese Hubert|first=Renee|publisher=MIT Press|year=1993|isbn=|editor-last=Caws|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally spurred by a conversation Oppenheim had with Pablo Picasso and his lover Dora Maar in café Deux Magots about a fur bracelet she was wearing, Oppenheim created ''Object'' to liberate the saucer, spoon, and teacup from their original functions as consumer objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: Retrospective|last=Eipeldauer|first=Heike|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2013|isbn=978-3-7757-3511-7|editor-last=Brugger|editor-first=Ingried|location=Vienna, Austria|pages=17|chapter=Meret Oppenheim's Masquerades}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are thus able to feel emotions of joy and wonder when observing ''Object'' while also questioning the functionality of each of its components. The artwork’s title, developed by Breton, was inspired by both Leopold Sacher-Masoch’s novel ''Venus in Fur'' and Edouard Manet’s ''Dejeuner sur l’herbe.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caws|first=Mary Ann|date=2011|title=Meret Oppenheim's Fur Teacup|jstor=10.1525/gfc.2011.11.3.25|journal=Gastronomica|volume=11|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year of its creation, ''Object'' was purchased by [[Alfred H. Barr Jr.|Alfred Barr]] for the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York and was included in the museum's first Surrealist exhibition titled ''Fantastic Art: Dada and Surrealism''.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=80997|title=Meret Guy Oppenheim. ''Object''. 1936|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheim was willing to sell her artwork for one thousand francs, but Barr only offered her $50 and she accepted. This was the first Surrealist artwork that the museum acquired, and Oppenheim became known as the First Lady of MoMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/09/466061492/luncheon-in-fur-the-surrealist-tea-cup-that-stirred-the-art-world|title='Luncheon In Fur': The Surrealist Teacup That Stirred The Art World|last=Matyris|first=Nina|date=February 9, 2016|website=npr.org|access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheim’s ''Object'' would be one of the main forces that led to her lengthy artistic crisis due to its spiking increase in popularity after being displayed by Barr in New York. Although it brought Oppenheim a large amount of fame, ''Object'' reinforced the public’s belief that Oppenheim only practiced Surrealism which she found hindered her freedom of artistic expression and exploration of other artistic styles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: Beyond the Teacup|last=Burckhardt|first=Jacqueline|last2=Curiger|first2=Bice|publisher=Independent Curators Incorporated|year=1996|isbn=|editor-last=Capp|editor-first=Robbie|location=New York, NY|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ''Object'' became so widely known that many misconceptions about Oppenheim and her art were created because of it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, many incorrectly believed that Oppenheim mainly created objects in fur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Being known as the artist of ''Object'', Oppenheim was bounded to Surrealism from public expectation, a connection she was trying to avoid. Decades later, in 1972, she artistically commented on its dominance of her career by producing a number of "[[souvenir]]s" of ''Le Déjeuner en fourrure''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstmuseumbern.ch/dok_cms/temp/26F38386-D004-2D42-A248F2DBF99B3D63/Saaltexte_Oppenheim_e.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} and {{cite web|url=http://collectionsonline.lacma.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record&amp;id=114280&amp;type=101|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406202029/http://collectionsonline.lacma.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record&amp;id=114280&amp;type=101|archivedate=2012-04-06|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her life, Oppenheim has been willing to pose for photographers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her most popular photo-shoot with Man Ray deeply depicts her personal stance on femininity. Contrary to the discretion about the gender of ''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)|Le Déjeuner '&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''[[Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)|s]] creator, the photographs provided an unmistakable monument to her femininity and a testimony to her unwillingness to expose it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1937, Oppenheim returned to Basel, training as an art conservator in order to ensure her financial stability. This marked the beginning of a creative crisis that lasted until 1954. Although she maintained some contact with her friends in Paris, she created very little and destroyed or failed to finish much of what she created.&lt;ref name="Meret Oppenheim: A Retrospective" /&gt;

In 1956, Oppenheim designed the costumes and masks for [[Daniel Spoerri]]’s production of [[Picasso]]’s play ''Le Désir attrapé par la queue'' in Berne. She and artist Lilly Keller were cast as the curtains. Three years later, in 1959, she organized a ''Spring Banquet (Le Festin)'' in Bern for a few friends at which food was served on the body of a naked woman. With Oppenheim's permission, Andre Breton restaged the performance later that year at the opening of the ''Exposition inteRnatiOnale du Surrealisme (EROS),'' at the Galerie Cordier in Paris. Outside its original intimate setting, the performance was overly provocative and Oppenheim felt her original intention for the work was lost.&lt;ref name="Meret Oppenheim"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4416 Meret Oppenheim] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Oppenheim's home base of Bern became much more important as an art center. She continued to live and work there, as well as at a second home in Carona, Switzerland (1968), and maintained a studio in Paris starting in 1972. She was an important figure in feminist debates in the early 1970s, although she refused to identify as a feminist.

In 1983 Oppenheim designed ''The Spiral Column (Spiralsaule),'' unofficially known as "Meret Oppenheim Fountain," on the Waisenhausplatz in Bern. A tall concrete column wrapped with a garland of grass over a small watercourse, the fountain provoked a petition for its removal. In 1985 City of Paris commissioned ''Spiral (Nature's Way) [Spirale (Gang de Natur)'' from Oppenheim for the Jardins de l'ancienne Ecole polytechnique on the Montagne Ste. Genevieve near the Pantheon. The work was based on a 1971 model and finished posthumously a few months after Oppenheim's death in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meret Oppenheim: A Retropsective|last=|first=|publisher=Hatje Cantz|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1936, at the beginning of her career, Oppenheim was included in two important Surrealist exhibitions outside of Paris: ''The International Surrealist Exhibition'', New Burlington Galleries, London and ''Fantastic Art Dada Surrealism'', The Museum of Modern Art, New York.

In 1943, Oppenheim's work was included in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s show ''[[The Art of This Century gallery#Exhibition by 31 Women|Exhibition by 31 Women]]'' at the [[Art of This Century gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref name="MOMAbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Cornelia H.|last2=Schwartz|first2=Alexandra|title=Modern Women: Women Artists at The Museum of Modern Art|date=2010|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|isbn=9780870707711|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oppenheim's first retrospective was hosted by [[Moderna Museet|Moderna Museet Stockholm]] in 1967. In Switzerland, her first retrospective was held at Museum der Stadt, Solothurn (1974) and traveled to  [[Kunstmuseum Winterthur]] and [[Lehmbruck Museum|Wilhelm-Lehmbruck Museum]], Duisberg, Germany in 1975.

In 1996, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] mounted Oppenheim's first major museum show in the United States at a time when renewed interest in her work, particularly among young artists, had already begun in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck (June 28, 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/28/arts/art-review-after-a-furry-teacup-what-then.html After a Furry Teacup, What Then?] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a comprehensive retrospective of Oppenheim's work opened at the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]] in Berlin, gathering the artist’s paintings, sketches, sculptures, masks, clothing, furniture, and jewelry. Lenders included singer [[David Bowie]], the Swiss retail tycoon and art dealer Ursula Hauser, and the Dutch diamond magnate [[Sylvio Perlstein]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Eve M. Kahn (August 8, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/arts/design/meret-oppenheims-works-at-martin-gropius-bau.html Meret Oppenheim’s Works at Martin-Gropius-Bau] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Oppenheim received the {{Interlanguage link multi|Art Award of the City of Basel|de|3=Kulturpreis der Stadt Basel}} on January 16, 1975. In her acceptance speech, Oppenheim coined the phrase "Freedom is not given to you — you have to take it."  &lt;ref&gt;Belinda Grace Gardner, "From 'Breakfast in Fur' and Back Again," in Thomas Levy, ed., ''Meret Oppenheim: From Breakfast in Fur and Back Again'' (Bielefeld, Germany: Kerber Verlag, 2003), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, three years before her death, she received the 1982 [[Berliner Kunstpreis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/09/artwork-meret-oppenheim|title=The artwork of Meret Oppenheim: A surreal legacy|last=|first=|date=September 3, 2013|website=The Economist|access-date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Oppenheim, who died in 1985, at 72, kept careful notes about which patrons and colleagues she liked and where her works ended up. She dictated which of her writings should be published and when, and there are puzzling gaps, since she destroyed some material.  The archive and much artwork have been entrusted to institutions in Bern, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts Berne|Museum of Fine Arts]] and the National Library.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Levy Galerie, founded in 1970 by Hamburg resident Thomas Levy, represents the estate of Meret Oppenheim, in close collaboration with the artist's family.

The '''National Children’s Museum (NCM)''' is an interactive [[children's museum]] serving the Washington, D.C. metro area. In 2003, the [[United States Congress]] designated NCM as the only national museum dedicated entirely to children and their families.

Built on a foundation of inspiring curiosity and lifelong learning, the National Children's Museum will encourage visitors to imagine, investigate, create, and play. Each exhibit features hands-on applications of science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) to foster wonder and inspire creative problem solving for children from birth to twelve. NCM's mission is to inspire children to care about and improve the world.

The National Children's Museum is slated to reopen in 2019 in the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center]], just steps from the National Mall.

==History==

===Capital Children's Museum (1974-2004)===
NCM was founded as the Capital Children’s Museum in 1974. In 1979, it moved into a building at 220 [[H Street]], NE in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark Lofts: Heavenly Luxury!|url=http://landmarklofts.net/home/index.php?categoryid=14|accessdate=14 April 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140415031553/http://landmarklofts.net/home/index.php?categoryid=14|archivedate=15 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[Little Sisters of the Poor]] home. In 2003, Congress identified a need for a nationally recognized cultural and educational institution specifically for children. The H Street location closed in August 2004.

===Museum Without Walls (2004-2012)===
After the closure of the H Street location, the National Children’s Museum operated as a “museum without walls,” forging partnerships with other organizations and participating in community events, educational outreach programs and traveling exhibits.

During this period, NCM participated in a wide variety of events include the [[Egg rolling#United States|White House Easter Egg Roll]], the [[National Cherry Blossom Festival]], the [[Marine Corps Marathon]], Kids Euro Festival, Nickelodeon's Worldwide Day of Play, and NCM's own JumpOFF! and CycleFest, reaching hundreds of thousands of children and families each year.

NCM staff has conducted educational outreach activities in 14 states, presenting the Museum’s ''Family Literacy Projects on a Budget'' teacher training programs.

===Launch Zone (2009-2012)===
The Launch Zone opened at [[National Harbor, Maryland]], in 2009.  The 2,700-square-foot space offered exhibits and programming to young children and their families.  There was no charge for admission, and it was open to the public seven days a week.

The Launch Zone closed on September 3, 2012, in preparation for NCM's December 14, 2012, opening in a larger space at National Harbor.

NCM had two major exhibit areas: ''3 &amp; Under'' and ''Our World''.  [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based Roto Studio designed the 2,700-square-foot ''3 &amp; Under'' exhibit space, and [[Boston]]-based Amaze Design was appointed to fabricate the 9,000-square-foot ''Our World'' exhibit, way-finding signage, and donor wall.  Both firms specialize in museum [[exhibit design]].

On November 14, 2014, NCM announced that it would relocate back to Washington, D.C.

==The Next Chapter==

NCM closed at National Harbor in early January 2015 after having announced that it will relocate back to Washington, D.C. It is slated to re open in 2019, adjacent to the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center]]. The new space is Metro accessible, sitting right on Woodrow Wilson plaza adjacent the Federal Triangle stop, and will also feature a public cafe and espresso bar. &lt;ref name="WaPo2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGlone|first1=Peggy|title=Children's museum finds new home in the District|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/19/childrens-museum-finds-new-home-in-the-district/|accessdate=28 February 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, fellowships are presented to between nine and fifteen artists or groups at a ceremony in [[Washington, D.C.]]

The Fellows are nominated by individual citizens, with an average of over 200 nominations per year. From that pool of candidates, recommendations are made by a rotating panel of specialists, including one layperson, as well as folklorists and others with a variety of forms of cultural expertise. The recommendations are then reviewed by the [[National Council on the Arts]], with the final decisions made by the chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;ref name="30th"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2011-Heritage.pdf |title=National Heritage Fellowships 30th Anniversary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011 |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, 422 artists in a wide variety of fields have received Fellowships.&lt;ref name="fact"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA-Heritage-Fellows-Fact-Sheet-June2017-revised.pdf |title=NEA National Heritage Fellows Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 2017 |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The program was officially founded in 1982 by [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], the first director of the Folk and Traditional Arts Program at the NEA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=December 2, 2009 |title=Bess Lomax Hawes, 88; folklorist, performer, NEA official |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/01/AR2009120104228.html |work=Washington Post |access-date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a five-year period of development.&lt;ref name="30th"/&gt; In 1982, the monetary award associated with the Fellowship was $5,000;&lt;ref name="Siporin"/&gt; in 1993, it was increased to $10,000 and since 2009, the award amount is $25,000, which is considered "enough to make a difference, but not enough to go to anyone's head".&lt;ref name="30th"/&gt; Each recipient receives a certificate of honor, the monetary award, and a congratulatory letter from the President of the United States.

The annual recognition events are held in the Fall and consist of an awards ceremony, a banquet, and a concert that is open to the public. Over the years, the awards ceremony has been held at different locations in the US capitol city, including the NEA headquarters, [[Ford's Theatre]], [[George Washington University]],&lt;ref name="Siporin"/&gt; the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; and for the first time at the [[White House]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Trescott |first=Jacqueline |date=September 28, 1995 |title=First Lady Defends NEA: Art Fellowships Presented at the White House |work=The Washington Post |page=Style section, C03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, the banquet has been held in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="30th"/&gt; The concert features musical performances, craft demonstrations, and interviews with the honorees.&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; [[Master of ceremonies|Masters of ceremonies]] at the concerts have included folksinger [[Pete Seeger]], actress [[Ruby Dee]], author [[Studs Terkel]], journalist [[Charles Kuralt]], and since 1997 [[Nick Spitzer]], the host of public radio program ''[[American Routes]]''.&lt;ref name="30th"/&gt; Beginning in 2010, the Fellowship concerts have been streamed live on the NEA website and archived on YouTube.

In 2000, the NEA instituted the Bess Lomax Hawes Award in conjunction with the Fellowships, "given to an individual for achievements in fostering excellence, ensuring vitality, and promoting public appreciation of the folk and traditional arts".&lt;ref name="fact"/&gt; The Hawes Award has been given annually since 2000 to recognize "artists whose contributions, primarily through teaching, advocacy, and organizing and preserving important repertoires, have greatly benefited their artistic tradition. It also recognizes individuals, such as producers and activists, who have comprehensively increased opportunities for and public visibility of traditional artists."&lt;ref name="30th"/&gt;

'''Neuromechanics of orthoses''' refers to how the human body interacts with [[Orthotics|orthoses]]. Millions of people in the U.S. suffer from stroke, multiple sclerosis, postpolio, spinal cord injuries, or various other ailments that benefit from the use of orthoses.&lt;ref name="Herr"&gt;Dollar, Aaron M., and Hugh Herr. "Lower extremity exoskeletons and active orthoses: challenges and state-of-the-art." Robotics, IEEE Transactions on 24.1 (2008): 144-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as active orthoses and [[powered exoskeletons]] are concerned, the technology to build these devices is improving rapidly, but little research has been done on the human side of these [[User interface|human-machine interfaces]].

== Active orthoses ==

Active, or powered, orthoses differ from [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeletons]] in that orthoses generally refer to assistive devices to help people with disabilities walk. Exoskeletons typically refer to devices intended to augment an otherwise healthy individual's movements. However, the terms "active orthosis" and "exoskeleton" are often used interchangeably.

They can be made to either assist  or resist the wearer's movement. Assisting movement is beneficial for rehabilitation,&lt;ref name="ferris"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1414628 | pmid=16568153 | volume=11 | title=Powered lower limb orthoses for gait rehabilitation | year=2005 | journal=Top Spinal Cord Inj Rehabil | pages=34–49 | last1 = Ferris | first1 = DP | last2 = Sawicki | first2 = GS | last3 = Domingo | first3 = A | doi=10.1310/6gl4-um7x-519h-9jyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sawiki"&gt;Sawicki, Gregory S., Keith E. Gordon, and Daniel P. Ferris. "Powered lower limb orthoses: applications in motor adaptation and rehabilitation."Rehabilitation Robotics, 2005. ICORR 2005. 9th International Conference on. IEEE, 2005. http://www.kines.umich.edu/sites/webservices.itcs.umich.edu.drupal.kinesprod/files/resource_files/Sawicki2005.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; for providing soldiers and nurses with increased strength to improve job performance,&lt;ref name="Herr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ishii"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishii | first1 = Mineo | last2 = Yamamoto | first2 = Keijiro | last3 = Hyodo | first3 = Kazuhito | year = 2005 | title = Stand-alone wearable power assist suit-Development and availability | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsmec/45/3/45_3_703/_pdf | journal = Journal of robotics and mechatronics | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 575–583 | doi=10.20965/jrm.2005.p0575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for aiding people who have repetitive jobs, such as factory workers, to prevent injury. Lastly, this technology is also used to enable people who ordinarily cannot walk by their own means to walk ([http://www.ted.com/talks/eythor_bender_demos_human_exoskeletons.html eLEGS demonstration])&lt;ref name="kao"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2813403 | pmid=19878952 | doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.09.030 | volume=43 | title=Invariant ankle moment patterns when walking with and without a robotic ankle exoskeleton | year=2010 | journal=J Biomech | pages=203–9 | last1 = Kao | first1 = PC | last2 = Lewis | first2 = CL | last3 = Ferris | first3 = DP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Powered orthoses have also been made to resist or alter movement.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = Keith E. | last2 = Kinnaird | first2 = Catherine R. | last3 = Ferris | first3 = Daniel P. | year = 2013 | title = Locomotor Adaptation to a Soleus EMG Controlled Antagonist Exoskeleton | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of such orthoses is to study how the human body adapts to various difficulties. For example, if one muscle is restricted from movement, can our bodies figure out what other muscles to use instead?

=== Powering the human ===

While most articles on [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeletons]] focus on how to power the device, it is also important to know how to power the human who is using it. When designing an exoskeleton, the power requirements of each joint must be understood.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt; Through [[gait analysis]], we know that power varies across the hip, knee, and ankle joints. How the power is dispersed across these joints changes greatly depending on how fast the person is walking, if they are walking on a hill or if they are climbing stairs&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt;

A challenge with powering the user is knowing how much power that particular person requires, and at what precise moment does he/she need that power activated.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt; Too much or too little power will make the technology useless, but making it just right for the wearer means customizing each device.

=== Metabolic cost ===

The primary method in determining whether a device is assisting the person's task or hindering it is to measure the [[metabolic cost]] required to do the task.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt; The metabolic cost is how much a person consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide while performing a task.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;Brockway, J. M. "Derivation of formulae used to calculate energy expenditure in man." Hum Nutr Clin Nutr 41.6 (1987): 463-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donelan, J. Maxwell, Rodger Kram, and Arthur D. Kuo. "Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is a major determinant of the metabolic cost of human walking." Journal of Experimental Biology 205.23 (2002): 3717-3727.&lt;/ref&gt; To test whether the exoskeleton or active orthosis actually benefits the wearer, studies are done in which subjects first do the task without the device, then they do the same task while wearing the device, and the metabolic costs from the two tasks are compared.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt;

As of 2008, only one exoskeleton (as opposed to active orthosis) had been found to actually reduce the metabolic cost of walking while carrying a load.&lt;ref name="Herr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="physiologist"/&gt; Very little research on exoskeleton metabolic cost is done, but one study done by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center found that the exoskeleton they used actually increased the metabolic cost by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorczyk, Karen N., et al. The effects of a lower body exoskeleton load carriage assistive device on oxygen consumption and kinematics during walking with loads. ARMY NATICK SOLDIER CENTER MA, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, S. Galle et al. studied the metabolic cost of a powered ankle-foot extensor that assisted users with push-off while walking. After about 20 minutes to adapt to the device, the users metabolic cost of walking was reduced by 9%.&lt;ref name="galle"/&gt;

=== Control ===

Ferris discusses the influence of controller types in his paper, A Physiologist's Perspective on Robotic Exoskeletons for Human Locomotion.&lt;ref name="physiologist"/&gt;

Various methods for controlling lower limb active orthoses or exoskeletons:
* Utilize sensory information from the exoskeleton and only use the human to provide a gentle push in the direction he/she wants to go&lt;ref&gt;Zoss, Adam B., H. Kazerooni, and Andrew Chu. "Biomechanical design of the Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton (BLEEX)." Mechatronics, IEEE/ASME Transactions on 11.2 (2006): 128-138. http://bleex.me.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/hel-media/Publication/ICRA05-Design.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Foot sensors detect where the user wants to go&lt;ref name="Guizzo"&gt;Guizzo, Erico, and Harry Goldstein. "The rise of the body bots." IEEE SPECTRUM 42.10 (2005): 42.
{{cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct05/1901 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504142710/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct05/1901 |archivedate=2009-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*User freely moves hips in flexion and a set of full-bridge [[strain gauge]]s attach to the shin of the exoskeleton and a [[potentiometer]] on the knee joint&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Conor James, et al. "Development of a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton for load-carrying augmentation." Robotics and Automation, 2006. ICRA 2006. Proceedings 2006 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2006.
http://biomech.media.mit.edu/publications/WalshICRA2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ground reaction force]] sensors in the shoes, skin-surface [[Electromyography|electromyographic (EMG)]] electrodes between the hip and knee on both the fronts and back sides of the legs, [[potentiometer]]s on the joints, a [[gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]] on the backpack to determine torso position&lt;ref name="Guizzo" /&gt;
*Use an elastic band to attach force sensing resistors (FSRs) to the skin above a muscle. When that muscle flexes, the sensor feels the force and outputs the strength of the force along with joint angle data from a potentiometer to determine the torque required at the specified joint&lt;ref name="ishii"/&gt;
*Use both ground reaction force and a forward/backward pressure sensor that the user can manipulate with his/her feet&lt;ref&gt;Krupp, Benjamin T., and Christopher J. Morse. "The RoboKnee: An Exoskeleton for Enhancing Strength and Endurance During Walking."
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~shc/RoboKnee/Pratt_2004_ICRA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Footswitch-controlled, in which the artificial muscle is activated when the user's forefoot contacts the ground&lt;ref name="sawiki"/&gt;
*EMG-controlled, in which the amplitude of the user's muscle flexion determines the amount of force the artificial muscle provides &lt;ref name="sawiki"/&gt;
*Push button-controlled for a bilateral ankle-foot orthosis, for people with partial paralysis. The user pushes a button on a handheld device. Some users found that this requires too much concentration, while others liked the feeling of control they had.&lt;ref name="sawiki"/&gt;

=== Use in research ===

Some active orthoses have been created for the sole purpose of research. According to neurophysiologist Dr. Keith Gordon, "locomotor adaptation in humans is not well understood. To provide insight into the neural reorganization that occurs following a significant disruption to one's learned neuromuscular map relating a given motor command to its resulting muscular action, we tied the mechanical action of a robotic exoskeleton to the EMG profile of the soleus muscle during walking".&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; Daniel Ferris concurs in another paper, saying, "many key issues in locomotor physiology are either not well understood or under heated debate"&lt;ref name="physiologist"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2185037 | pmid=18185840 | doi=10.1142/S0219843607001138 | volume=4 | title=A PHYSIOLOGIST'S PERSPECTIVE ON ROBOTIC EXOSKELETONS FOR HUMAN LOCOMOTION | year=2007 | journal=Int J HR | pages=507–528 | last1 = Ferris | first1 = DP | last2 = Sawicki | first2 = GS | last3 = Daley | first3 = MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His research team custom-made active orthoses for his research subjects to wear while walking on a treadmill. When the subject flexed his/her [[soleus muscle]] in order to [[Plantarflexion|plantar flex]] (which allows a person to push off the ground while walking), the device would restrict the subject's movement, forcing his/her foot towards [[dorsiflexion]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; After an hour of walking with the device (a break was included), the subjects used their [[soleus muscle|soleus]] and [[gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]] muscles less, so they wouldn't be forced to dorsiflex as much, but they were not able to fully adapt to the requirements of the device.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;

Another study by Gordon's team showed that when the device works with our muscles, we adapt more easily. For example, he had subjects wear an active orthosis on one leg which performed a very strong plantar flexion every time they flexed the soleus, which is expected to plantar flex. However, the plantar flexion performed by the device was too strong and the subjects had to only use a minimal amount of muscle strength on that one leg in order to walk normally. People were able to adapt to this difficulty in under 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gordon | first1 = Keith E. | last2 = Ferris | first2 = Daniel P. | year = 2007 | title = Learning to walk with a robotic ankle exoskeleton | url = | journal = Journal of biomechanics | volume = 40 | issue = 12| pages = 2636–2644 | doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by S. Galle, et al., found similar results in the paper, "Adaptation to walking with an exoskeleton that assists ankle extension"&lt;ref name="galle"&gt;Galle, S., et al. "Adaptation to walking with an exoskeleton that assists ankle extension." Gait &amp; Posture (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
Gregory Sawiki, Keith Gordon, and Daniel Ferris together did a study on an active lower limb orthosis to understand how the device can be used to improve motor rehabilitation. After experimenting with different types of control (finding that some subjects thought that having a push button to activate the device required too much concentration, while others liked having the control over activation of the device), the team concluded that the ankle-foot orthosis they used needs a lot of improvements for rehabilitation, but could be "valuable in probing the relationship between gait mechanics and metabolic cost."&lt;ref name="sawiki"/&gt;

=== Considerations ===

According to [[Hugh Herr]], the performance of an orthosis should be based upon measurements of "metabolic cost of transport, walking speed, smoothness and repeatability of motions, muscle fatigue, and stability" as well as "the reduction of forces borne by the musculoskeletal system".&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt;

Power source, portability and weight are the biggest challenges facing active orthoses. A sufficient power source with today's technology adds too much weight to the device, making it difficult to do much more than lift itself. For that reason, most active orthoses are tethered to a power source - which works well enough for research and patient rehabilitation, since that also means a computer is always nearby&lt;ref name="Herr"/&gt;
Other challenges when making an active orthosis is the close interface with the human. This presents difficulties with aligning the joints of the operator with the joints of the device, constraining the human's movements by attaching the device to his/her body, other forces from the device that resist movement, controlling the machine while wearing it, determining how the device is changing the human's biomechanics, and ensuring the safety of the wearer.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowell III, Harrison P., Angela C. Boynton, and Michael Mungiole.Exoskeleton power and torque requirements based on human biomechanics. No. ARL-TR-2764. ARMY RESEARCH LAB ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND MD, 2002. http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA408684&lt;/ref&gt;
Patients in need of powered orthoses may have pathological conditions such as muscle weakness or spasticity, brain injury, or sensory loss, or they may have suffered an athletic injury or a number of different maladies. Each patient requires a specific alteration to his or her gait. The orthosis must be able to generate power at the precise moment the patient is having trouble with his or her stride&lt;ref name="sham"&gt;Shamaei, Kamran, and Aaron M. Dollar. "On the mechanics of the knee during the stance phase of the gait." Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR), 2011 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of people suffer from knee injuries, and because the knee supports the body weight during the stance phase while walking, more active orthoses are being made to relieve weight off the knee while in the stance phase.&lt;ref name = "sham" /&gt;

After suffering a neurological injury, patients typically must go through locomotor training that can involve several therapists. The task is quite hard on the therapist(s), so several devices have been made to assist with this problem. The Lokomat, AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer were all made to function with a treadmill. Wearable gait trainers would be useful to travel over ground. This adds the complications involved with starting and stopping a stride, changing direction, going up and down hills, and creating more challenging balancing exercises.&lt;ref name = "sham" /&gt;

==== Foot ====

An extensive study was done to determine how thick the sole of a soldier's boot could be before it interfered with his/her actions. It was found that a 2-inch thick sole affected certain squatting positions and was less comfortable than a thinner sole, but can ultimately be implemented in exoskeleton designs. The purpose of the study was to determine how much space could be made available for sensors in a soldier's exoskeleton boot.&lt;ref name="boot"&gt;Boynton, Angela C., and Harrison P. Crowell III.

== Passive orthoses ==

Passive orthoses do not require external power and are less likely to have moving parts. However, many passive orthoses have been developed to aid movement through use of springs and other such moving parts.&lt;ref name="Herr" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "cherry"&gt;Cherry, Michael S., Sridhar Kota, and Daniel P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Online patient education''', also known as '''online patient engagement''', is a method of providing medical information and education to patients using [[learning management systems]] delivered through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of bariatric Centers of Excellence Web sites for functionality and efficacy. Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;4(5):571-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of computer-based instruction and includes web seminars, downloadable materials, interactive learning courses, and audio/visual presentations. Generally, online patient education is supplemented with in-person consultations tailored to each individual.

==General usage==
Health professionals use online patient education to prepare patients for medical procedures, administer intake and informed consent paperwork, educate patients about health conditions, provide information about preventive care, encourage healthy behavior and lifestyle changes, etc. Health insurance companies use online patient education to inform patients about coverage policies. 

Online patient education is gaining popularity as home Internet access becomes more common and medical practices increasingly utilize digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in patient education Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 203-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers in Patient Education. Comput Inform Nurs 21(2):88-96, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Patients either view online patient education programs and materials in a medical office or from their homes or other remote locations with Internet access. Content may include interactive features such as quizzes, live question and answer sessions (in moderated web seminars), and the ability to complete and submit forms.

==Patient education by type==

===On location===
Any education delivered verbally by a healthcare provider to a single patient or group of patients can be considered as On Location patient education. Although this is still the most commonly used patient education method it is time consuming, can have consistency problems, and relies heavily on the individual patient ability to absorb, understand, and retain the verbal information.

===Paper based===
The second most common method. Any information brochure at a healthcare provider office falls under this category. The benefits of printed materials is that patients can refer back to the information

===Web based===
Patient education that is made available by a healthcare provider via his/her website, specific portal, or EHR. Web based education can be provided in an [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] and [[Synchronous learning|Synchronous]] styles.

==Advantages==
Educating patients with online technology can be advantageous&lt;ref&gt;Online patient education: A superior alternative to in-person information seminars Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages S44-S45&lt;/ref&gt; for both medical practices and patients because it gives health care providers the opportunity to create comprehensive educational materials that are consistently presented, rather than relying on face-to-face meetings in which information is presented by a staff member.&lt;ref&gt;Patients Postoperatively Forget Aspects of Preoperative Patient Education. Obesity Surgery, 15, 2005 1066-1069&lt;/ref&gt; Patients need not possess advanced computer/web skills to use this method of learning. A survey of 3200 patients revealed that even patients who are not computer literate are satisfied with online patient education as means of learning about medical care.

The '''Oral History Metadata Synchronizer''' (OHMS) is a web application designed to enhance online access to oral history interviews.  OHMS was originally designed and created by the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]], University of Kentucky Libraries in 2008 for deployment through the Kentucky Digital Library.  In 2011, the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] received a grant from the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services]] to make the system open source and free to use with interoperability and sustainability as the primary goals.   According to the Nunn Center, "The primary purpose for OHMS is to empower users to more effectively and efficiently discover information in an oral history interview online by connecting the user from a search result to the corresponding moment in an interview."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHMS: Oral History Metadata Synchronizer|url=http://nunncenter.org/OHMS/?page_id=32|publisher=Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, University of Kentucky Libraries|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OHMS is a two-part system which includes the web app (the back-end) and the viewer (user interface).  The web application is used to prepare the oral history interview by embedding timecode into a transcript or creating a time-coded index of the interview, which is then viewable online in the OHMS Viewer, accessible from the archive's chosen content management system.

The original version of OHMS synchronized transcribed text with time code in the audio/video, as well as providing a user map/viewer that connected search results of a transcript to the corresponding moments in the audio or video. OHMS designer [[Douglas A. Boyd|Doug Boyd]] writes, "OHMS inexpensively and efficiently encodes transcripts of interviews and then connects the transcripts to the corresponding moments in the audio or video interview."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Doug|title=OHMS: Enhancing Access to Oral History for Free|journal=Oral History Review|year=2013|volume=40|series=Winter-Spring|issue=1|doi=10.1093/ohr/oht031|url=http://ohr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/ohr.oht031.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=CvecnLmfvHTndIThttp://|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Nunn Center introduced the Interview Indexing Module which allows indexing or annotation of an interview that corresponds to time-code. In his article in the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]], Brad Wolverton writes about Doug Boyd's work on OHMS: "Through his work as director of the [[Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History]] he’s developed a method for indexing audio and video recordings, making it easy for researchers to call up precise words without having to listen to endless hours of tape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolverton|first=Brad|title=New Tool Could Help Researchers Make Better Use of Oral Histories|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/players/new-tool-could-help-researchers-make-better-use-of-oral-histories/28855|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Fall of 2011, the  [[Institute for Museum and Library Services]] awarded the Nunn Center a National Leadership Grant of$195,853 to further develop OHMS for open source distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=Taylor|title=University of Kentucky's Oral History Program "Potentially Revolutionary"|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2013/06/30/2699101/university-of-kentuckys-oral-history.html|accessdate=10 July 2013|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=June 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; OHMS is currently being developed and the grant initiative is working with project partners to implement the system beyond the University of Kentucky.

'''Raphaël Enthoven''' (born 9 November 1975) is a [[France|French]] [[philosophy]] teacher, radio host and television host. An ''[[Agrégation|agrégé]]'' who taught at [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]] and [[Paris Diderot University]], Enthoven is known to the French public for hosting various philosophy-related shows on radio and television. Although he has been described as a [[philosopher]],&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s A Chattefight As Novelist Levy Nips Carla Bruni|url=http://observer.com/2005/10/its-a-ichatteifight-as-novelist-levy-nips-carla-bruni/|accessdate = 18 January 2018|first = Sheelah |last = Kolhatkar |date = 3 October 2005|website = [[New York Observer|Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeFigaro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Raphaël Enthoven : « Notre époque est celle de la contamination de la vertu par le ressentiment»|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/2017/07/28/31003-20170728ARTFIG00267-raphael-enthoven-notre-epoque-est-celle-de-la-contamination-de-la-vertu-par-le-ressentiment.php|accessdate = 18 January 2018|first = Eugénie |last = Bastié |date = 28 July 2017|website = [[Le Figaro]]| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enthoven himself rejects being labeled as such.&lt;ref name="LeFigaro"/&gt;

==Career==
After obtaining the qualification in philosophy from [[École Normale Supérieure]], he taught for two years at the [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3]], then at the [[University of Paris]] VII-Jussieu, and during the first two years (2002 and 2003) at the [[Université populaire de Caen]], founded by [[Michel Onfray]], where he runs the general philosophy seminar. After distancing himself from the latter{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}, he became co-producer of the radio show  ''Les vendredis de la philosophie'' on [[France Culture]]. Having previously lectured political philosophy at the [[Sciences Po]], (2000 - 2003, 2005 - 2007) and at the [[École polytechnique (France)|École Polytechnique]] (2007 - 2010), he also taught on [[Spinoza]], [[Bergson]] and [[Clément Rosset]] on ''Les mardis de la philo'' and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] on the [[meaning of life]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Since 2013, he also teaches philosophy to first and second year high-school students at the [[École Jeannine Manuel]], a private bilingual high-school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lemonde.fr/televisions-radio/article/2015/10/09/l-information-sous-l-il-du-prof-enthoven_4786601_1655027.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the adviser to the editor of [[Philosophie Magazine]], where he holds the "Meaning and life",&lt;ref&gt;[http://philomag.com//article,analyse,sens-et-vie-la-mauvaise-foi-par-raphael-enthoven,197.php Exemple d'article de la rubrique « Sens et vie »]&lt;/ref&gt; it is still in production at France Culture.  Having dealt with the Appointment Policy, in partnership with the magazine ''L'Express'', he has become an everyday icon in the new program schedule for France Culture in 2008-2009 by bringing to life the show ''The new paths of knowledge'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-culture2/emissions/chemins/presentation.php Site des ''nouveaux chemins de la connaissance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216230323/http://www.radiofrance.fr/chaines/france-culture2/emissions/chemins/presentation.php |date=2009-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monday to Friday at 17h.

Since October 2008, he has produced the show ''Philosophy'' broadcast on Sunday at 1pm on [[Arte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arte.tv/fr/accueil/2235074.html Philosophie - Pouvoir | Philosophie #1: Le pouvoir | Philosophie | Monde | fr - ARTE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518074517/http://www.arte.tv/fr/accueil/2235074.html |date=2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He read Marcel Proust in ''Les Intermittences du cœur'' and ''Albertine endormie'', with Karol Beffa as pianist.

==Personal life==
Enthoven was born in [[Paris]], the son of journalist [[Catherine David (writer)|Catherine David]] and [[Publishing|publisher]] [[Jean-Paul Enthoven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vsd.fr/actualite/raphael-enthoven-2248 Raphaël Enthoven - VSD]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage Of Justine Lévy And Raphaël Enthoven On September 21st, 1996 In Paris, France.|url=https://www.gettyimages.es/detail/fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/marriage-of-justine-levy-and-raphael-enthoven-fotograf%C3%ADa-de-noticias/113412946#/marriage-of-justine-levy-and-raphael-enthoven-on-september-21st-1996-picture-id113412946|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he married writer [[Justine Lévy]], daughter of philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], himself a friend of Enthoven's father. In 2000, Enthoven began an affair with singer [[Carla Bruni]], which eventually prompted divorce from Lévy in 2001. Justine Lévy wrote a fictionalized version of the story in her book ''Nothing Serious''.&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt;

In July 2001, Enthoven had a son named Aurélien with Carla Bruni.&lt;ref name="Observer"/&gt; In 2007, he separated from Bruni and began a relationship with actress [[Chloé Lambert]], who gave birth to their son in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voici.fr/news-people/actu-people/l-ex-de-carla-bruni-raphael-enthoven-est-papa-264059&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to have separated around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legossip.net/maud-fontenoy-en-couple-raphael-enthoven-ex-carla-bruni/222015/&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, he had a son with sailor and politician [[Maud Fontenoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francedimanche.fr/les-journalistes-ont-la-parole/maud-fontenoy-en-guerre-contre-le-pere-de-son-troisieme-enfant%E2%80%89/ Maud Fontenoy : En guerre contre le père de son troisième enfant !]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, he has four children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Livres/News/Raphael-Enthoven-J-ai-ete-la-victime-d-un-livre-haineux-et-le-pretexte-d-une-chanson-d-amour-3298771 Raphaël Enthoven : « J’ai été la victime d’un livre haineux et le prétexte d’une chanson d’amour » (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Kindergarten program is create specifically for the younger child.  The Program's unique daily rhythm is filled with reverence for the magic of early childhood.  Students under the age of six or seven learn primarily through imitation and activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waldorfinthehome.org/2012/03/learning_through_imitation_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaswece.org/waldorf_education/what_is.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Kindergarten the students engage in creative play with home activities and simple, natural materials that encourage imagination.  Rhythms of the seasons and festivals are woven into the daily activities.  Kindergartners start each day with a walk through the woods surrounding the campus.  Through each season they experience the natural wonders surrounding them.

'''Grades 1-8''' [http://www.steinerschool.org/lower-school/] &lt;br&gt;
All Rudolf Steiner School teachers recognize that each student has unique academic, artistic and physical gifts.  The task of the teacher is to provide the inspiration and environment in which these gifts can be cultivated.  Each subject is initially presented artistically through a story, poem, drama, drawing or song.  This artistic doorway is one through with the students with widely varying intellectual capacities and learning styles can readily enter.  The class teacher ideally remains with his/her students from first through eighth grades.  Not only is the teacher's intimate knowledge of the students a tremendous advantage, but he/she can also draw out connections with the material across the years.  The teacher's commitment to the class enables students to develop trust.  They can then focus joyfully on their academic work.

'''''Science of Education''''' (full title: '''''Science of Education: Its General Principles Deduced from its Aim and the Aesthetic Revelation of the World''''') is a book written by the German empiricist [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]. It was first published in German in 1806 and the first English printing was in 1902. Herbart emphasized education as the way for an individual to fulfill his potential and created a scientific method to help him do so. The Science of Education advocated a five-step methodology that appeals to learner’s interests and applies content back to morals and daily life.&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science (December 29, 1893), "Book Reviews: The Science of Education", Science (in English) 22 (269): 362, JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/1767208&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers can be found in Germany, England, and the United States who are still implementing this pedagogy today.

== Overview ==
Herbart's theory of education was called Herbartanism. He held that the psychological process of learning should be taken into account when devising curricula and goals for education. He emphasized the importance of using social and physical environments to promote learning in the classroom. Herbart held that there were '''five formal steps''' to teaching:
* '''Relate''' new material to relevant past ideas in order to engage the students. 
* '''Present''' new material through experience and/or manipulative.
* '''Associate''' new ideas to old through comparison of similarities and differences. 
* '''Generalize''' material, especially with younger students to show the relationships between ideas and objects in the world.
* '''Apply''' acquired knowledge in a relevant way to clearly interpret life. In this step, the student must make this connection his/her own, applying it to his/her own life
Because Herbart believed that a science of education was possible, he supported the idea that education should be an acceptable area of study in higher education. 

== Summary ==

===Book I===
In the first book Herbart discusses the general aim of education. The teacher is a guide to moral development of students and must create a relationship with the students that enables them to construct an inner censor for good and evil.&lt;ref name = "Andrea"&gt;English, Andrea (2011), "Critical Listening and the Dialogic Aspect of Moral Education: J.F. Herbart’s Concept of the Teacher as Moral Guide", Educational Theory (in English) 61 (2): 171–192, doi:10.1111/j.1741-5446.2011.00398.x&lt;/ref&gt; Herbart also discusses the role of the authority in the education of children. He concluded that there are two kinds of children, those who will fear punishment and want to avoid it and those whose desires will overcome their fear of authority. Learners should be taught to fear authority but also take risks so that boys can become men.&lt;ref name="Herbart, John Friedrich 1908 p. 296"&gt;Herbart, John Friedrich; Felkin, Henry &amp; Emmie (1908), Science of Education: Its General Principles Deduced from its Aim and the Aesthetic Revelation of the World tr. From German (in English), Boston: D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Publishers, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; The first book also includes Herbart's discussion on the individuality of students and the many different elements that play into a child's morality.

===Book II===
The second book examines the many sides of learners—the multitude of influences and characteristics that each learner brings to the table. Educators need to understand that the only influence they have over learners is the freedom of choice. Educators can influence their students by giving options to potentially more profitable inquiry. Learners come with many different backgrounds, desires, and talents, and the educator needs to facilitate learner's growth in many respects as opposed to just their interests. Herbart argues that interests are similar to desires and therefore can be used to help children obey authority. Knowledge and sympathy must be taken into account when choosing which choices to give learners especially when it comes to instruction.&lt;ref name="Herbart, John Friedrich 1908 p. 296"/&gt; The purpose of instruction is to marry nature and humanity. Instruction weaves together the gaps in our experiences and our feelings, but instruction must be systematic as to not confuse the learner.

===Book III===
Book three addresses Herbart's deep relationship with morality. He believed that the moral man commands himself.&lt;ref name = "Andrea"/&gt; The book discusses the positive and negative sides of morality as well as moral judgement. The [[categorical imperative]] expresses a judgment of oneself in light of one’s recognition of the other. Herbart defines how moral character reveals itself when presented with different situations and how our character forms as a result of these natural experiences. Finally, Herbart addresses discipline and how it can affect the formation of one's character as well as the proper ways to employ it.&lt;ref name="Herbart, John Friedrich 1908 p. 296"/&gt;

'''SkillsUSA''' is a United States [[Career and Technical Student Organization|career and technical student organization]] serving more than 395,000 high school, college and middle school students and professional members enrolled in training programs in trade, technical and skilled service occupations, including health occupations.

==History==
SkillsUSA was originally known as the Vocational Industrial Clubs of America (VICA). Prior to 1965, attempts at creation of national skill organizations failed. There was still a demand for skill and trade organizations, however. In 1960, the [[Association for Career and Technical Education|American Vocational Association]] (AVA) held a meeting, where a committee was formed to facilitate a solution. Representatives from the [[U.S. Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] and the [[National Association of State Supervisors of Trade and Industrial Education]] (NASSTIE – now known as the Association for Skilled and Technical Sciences – ASTS – http://www.astsonline.org) formed the committee. By 1962, the AVA encouraged the Office of Education to hire an employee to form the national organization. At the 1964 AVA convention, powerful leaders of industry and organizational leaders to include [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]] spoke in favor of the proposed organization.

[[Image:VICASealOriginal.svg|thumb|left|The original VICA seal]]The constitution establishing the Vocational Industrial Clubs of America was adopted at the Trade and Industrial Youth Conference May 6–8, 1965 at the Hotel Andrew Jackson in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee.  Representatives for 14 states, consisting of approximately 200 students, advisors, and business and labor representatives, gathered to choose the club's name, colors, motto, purposes and goals.&lt;ref name="offhist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skillsusa.org/about/history.shtml |title=SkillsUSA History |accessdate=July 6, 2007 |publisher=SkillsUSA, Leesburg, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CThist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cttech.org/skillsusavica/about_us/history.htm |title=SKILLSUSA HISTORY |accessdate=July 6, 2007 |publisher=Connecticut SkillsUSA |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407015431/http://www.cttech.org/skillsusavica/about_us/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official red blazer, part of the organization's uniform, was patterned after the blazer from Illinois's organization.&lt;ref name="CThist" /&gt;  These representatives were from existing vocational education groups which agreed to finance the effort, from the states of [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[North Carolina]], [[Missouri]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]]. Illinois actually provided the salary for Philip Baird to be the first executive secretary of the newly founded VICA. The [[National FFA Organization]] is credited with making the first financial contribution. The American Vocational Association offered office space at no cost in its Washington headquarters. Additionally, the AVA's Trade and Industrial Division provided a grant.&lt;ref name="CThist" /&gt;

[[Image:VicaLogoOriginal.svg|thumb|150px|right|The original VICA logo.]]Tommy Snider from [[Griffin, Georgia]] was elected as VICA's first student president and Larry W. Johnson, the assistant supervisor of T&amp;I education and state advisor for the Vocation Industrial Clubs of North Carolina, became the first executive secretary of VICA on July 1, 1965.&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CThist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="svlh"&gt;{{cite book |last=SkillsUSA-VICA |title=SkillsUSA-VICA Leadership Handbook |edition=Revised, 1999 |series= |publisher=SkillsUSA-VICA, Inc. |pages= 10–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued in the position until 1987.

By 1966, membership was up to 29,534, spanning 1,074 clubs across 26 states and territories.  Additionally, the first issue of the club's magazine was produced.&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;  At the national conference, held in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], Arkansas, the VICA emblem was unveiled, and the first official state [[charters]] were presented.&lt;ref name="CThist" /&gt;

In 1969, the Postsecondary Division of VICA was approved during a Constitutional Convention held in [[Memphis, Tennessee]],&lt;ref name="CThist" /&gt; bringing total membership to 82,000.&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;    The following year, the first edition of the VICA Leadership Handbook was published.&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;

On VICA's 10-year anniversary (1975), the organization inducted its one millionth member.  Three years later, VICA saw the start of the construction of its National Leadership Center in [[Leesburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;

[[Image:SkillsUSA-VICALogo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The SkillsUSA-VICA logo, 1999.]]VICA hosted the International Youth Skill Olympics—held a competition following the [[National Leadership and Skills Conference]] (NLSC)—for the first time in 1979, in [[Atlanta]].

In 1995, the national competition, then known as the United States Skill Olympics, was renamed to the SkillsUSA Championships during the NLSC. In, 1999, during the NLSC, VICA was renamed to SkillsUSA-VICA. The name was shortened to SkillsUSA in 2002.&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;

==Membership==
SkillsUSA has over 690,420 members, organized into at least 2 classrooms and 69 states and territorial associations (including the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Virgin Islands]]) as well as alumni members.

The third component of the suite, ''Career Essentials: Assessments'', previously known as Skill Connect Assessments, offers reliable evaluation of over 40 technical and employability areas. The assessments were originally developed through a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. 

Student2Student Mentoring gives high school students a chance to mentor younger students. Jump into STEM! provides tools for high school students to mentor middle- and elementary-school students in skills and activities that may lead to career interests in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

CareerSafe is a credentialed 10-hour online training program developed in cooperation with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to provide students with basic knowledge of safety and a credential desired in the job market.

[[Image:SkillsUSA 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The NLSC opening ceremonies for the 2008 conference.]]
The National Leadership and Skills Conference is held annually in Louisville, Ky.  Most of the competitions are held at the Kentucky Exposition Center, on the showroom floor. General sessions are held in Freedom Hall. The week-long conference entails the competitions, SkillsUSA TECHSPO (the nation's largest trade show in trade and industrial education), a career fair, and SkillsUSA student government sessions. The SkillsUSA Championships is expected to bring in $14 million to Louisville's economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wlky.com/news/15084687/detail.html?rss=lou&amp;psp=news&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the various state associations socialize and learn from one another during the week.  Each state association has collectible pins that are often traded between students from various state associations.  These pins are normally worn on the official SkillsUSA blazer.

There are recreational activities scheduled during the conference week, including a SkillsUSA night at Kentucky Kingdom.

The week culminates in the awards ceremony. The NLSC generally has a featured keynote speaker. There have been a number of noteworthy speakers.  Some of them include:&lt;ref name="offhist" /&gt;

*[[Ronald Reagan]], 40th President of the United States

==Contests==
SkillsUSA offers competitive activities in which students strive to achieve in a variety of occupational skill and leadership areas. Competition in skill and personal achievement is encouraged at all levels. Leadership contests include public speaking, [[parliamentary procedure]], safety, Opening and Closing ceremonies, and job interviewing. Occupational skill contests include the building trades, health occupations, automotive technology, the electrical/electronics industry and personal services. Among many others, there are competitions for outstanding SkillsUSA chapter, community service, entrepreneurship and customer service.

Competitions begin locally and continue through the state and national levels. Some states also have district competitions. In most contests at the national championships, SkillsUSA presents medallions to the top three winners. In other contests, more than three medals may be presented if a standard is met. State and local contests may include the official national contests, but may also include contests not offered at the national level.

The contests are organized and run through a partnership of industry, labor and education. These partners provide awards as well. More than 5,500 students – winners from their states – compete in the $36-million national event, which covers exposition space equivalent to 16 football fields.

SkillsUSA is the official U.S. representative to the WorldSkills Competition. Select winners from the SkillsUSA Championships train for one year before competing at the biennial internationals.
SkillsUSA competitions develop enthusiasm for learning and a sense of accomplishment. By recognizing students’ skills and abilities, the competitions promote professional development and appreciation of quality job skills. The events also stimulate public, and specifically student, interest in career and technical training.&lt;ref&gt;SkillsUSA Leadership Handbook, Twenty-Fourth Printing, Revised, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may participate in three types of contests: Leadership, Occupationally  Related, and Skilled and Technical Sciences. Demonstration contests are added to determine interest. If interest is sufficient, demonstration contests can become official competitions and are added to one of the three categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skillsusa.org/compete/contests.shtml SkillsUSA Championships Contest Descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919165326/http://skillsusa.org/compete/contests.shtml |date=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = SkillsUSA Championships Technical Standards 2017 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.

[[File:Six degrees of separation.svg|thumb|The "six degrees of separation" model]]
The '''small-world experiment''' comprised several experiments conducted by [[Stanley Milgram]] and other researchers examining the [[average path length]] for [[social network]]s of people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milgram|first=Stanley|date=May 1967|title=The Small World Problem|url=|journal=Psychology Today|publisher=Ziff-Davis Publishing Company.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a [[Small-world network|small-world]]-type network characterized by short path-lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase "[[six degrees of separation]]", although Milgram did not use this term himself.

==Historical context of the small-world problem==

[[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s conjectures based on his radio work in the early 20th century, which were articulated in his 1909 [[Nobel Prize]] address,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guglielmo Marconi]], 1909, Nobel Lecture, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.pdf Wireless telegraphic communication].&lt;/ref&gt; may have inspired{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Hungarian author [[Frigyes Karinthy]] to write a challenge to find another person to whom he could not be connected through at most five people.&lt;ref name=bara&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ Barabási, Albert-László]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304041427/http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ |date=2005-03-04 }}. 2003. "[http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103151518/http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html |date=2007-01-03 }}" New York: Plume.&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps the earliest reference to the concept of [[Six Degrees of Separation|six degrees of separation]], and the search for an answer to the small world problem.

Mathematician [[Manfred Kochen]] and political scientist [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]] wrote a mathematical manuscript, "Contacts and Influences", while working at the [[University of Paris]] in the early 1950s, during a time when Milgram visited and collaborated in their research. Their unpublished manuscript circulated among academics for over 20 years before publication in 1978. It formally articulated the mechanics of [[social network]]s, and explored the mathematical consequences of these (including the degree of connectedness). The manuscript left many significant questions about networks unresolved, and one of these was the number of degrees of separation in actual social networks.

Milgram took up the challenge on his return from Paris, leading to the experiments reported in "The Small World Problem" in the May 1967 (charter) issue of the popular magazine ''[[Psychology Today]]'', with a more rigorous version of the paper appearing in ''[[Sociometry]]'' two years later. The ''Psychology Today'' article generated enormous publicity for the experiments, which are well known today, long after much of the formative work has been forgotten.

Milgram's experiment was conceived in an era when a number of independent threads were converging on the idea that the world is becoming increasingly interconnected. Michael Gurevich had conducted seminal work in his empirical study of the structure of social networks in his [[MIT]] doctoral dissertation under Pool. Mathematician Manfred Kochen, an Austrian who had been involved in [[Statism|statist]] [[urban design]], extrapolated these empirical results in a mathematical manuscript, ''Contacts and Influences'', concluding that, in an American-sized population without social structure, "it is practically certain that any two individuals can contact one another by means of at least two intermediaries. In a [socially] structured population it is less likely but still seems probable. And perhaps for the whole world's population, probably only one more bridging individual should be needed."{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} They subsequently constructed [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s based on Gurevich's data, which recognized that both weak and strong acquaintance links are needed to model social structure. The simulations, running on the slower computers of 1973, were limited, but still were able to predict that a more realistic three degrees of separation existed across the U.S. population, a value that foreshadowed the findings of Milgram.

Milgram revisited Gurevich's experiments in acquaintanceship networks when he conducted a highly publicized set of experiments beginning in 1967 at [[Harvard University]]. One of Milgram's most famous works is a study of obedience and authority, which is widely known as the [[Milgram Experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stanleymilgram.com/milgram.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731014305/http://www.stanleymilgram.com/milgram.php# |archive-date=2008-07-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Milgram's earlier association with Pool and Kochen was the likely source of his interest in the increasing interconnectedness among human beings. Gurevich's interviews served as a basis for his small world experiments.

Milgram sought to devise an experiment that could answer the small world problem. This was the same phenomenon articulated by the writer [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in the 1920s while documenting a widely circulated belief in [[Budapest]] that individuals were separated by six degrees of social contact. This observation, in turn, was loosely based on the seminal [[demographic]] work of the Statists who were so influential in the design of Eastern European cities during that period. Mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], born in Poland and having traveled extensively in Eastern Europe, was aware of the Statist rules of thumb, and was also a colleague of Pool, Kochen and Milgram at the University of Paris during the early 1950s (Kochen brought Mandelbrot to work at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and later [[IBM]] in the U.S.). This circle of researchers was fascinated by the interconnectedness and "social capital" of social networks.

Milgram's study results showed that people in the United States seemed to be connected by approximately three friendship links, on average, without speculating on global linkages; he never actually used the phrase "six degrees of separation". Since the ''[[Psychology Today]]'' article gave the experiments wide publicity, Milgram, Kochen, and Karinthy all had been incorrectly attributed as the origin of the notion of "six degrees"; the most likely popularizer of the phrase "six degrees of separation" is [[John Guare]], who attributed the value "six" to Marconi.

==The experiment==

Milgram's experiment developed out of a desire to learn more about the probability that two randomly selected people would know each other.&lt;ref name=milg&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Travers|first=Jeffrey|last2=Milgram|first2=Stanley|date=1969|title=An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem|jstor=2786545|journal=Sociometry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=425–443|doi=10.2307/2786545}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one way of looking at the small world problem. An alternative view of the problem is to imagine the population as a social network and attempt to find the [[average path length]] between any two nodes. Milgram's experiment was designed to measure these path lengths by developing a procedure to count the number of ties between any two people.

===Basic procedure===
[[File:Experement Small World (possible option).gif|500px|thumb|One possible path of a message in the "Small World" experiment by Stanley Milgram.]]
# Though the experiment went through several variations, Milgram typically chose individuals in the U.S. cities of [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Wichita, Kansas]], to be the starting points and [[Boston, Massachusetts]], to be the end point of a chain of correspondence. These cities were selected because they were thought to represent a great distance in the United States, both socially and geographically.&lt;ref name=bara /&gt;
# Information packets were initially sent to "randomly" selected individuals in Omaha or Wichita. They included letters, which detailed the study's purpose, and basic information about a target contact person in Boston. It additionally contained a roster on which they could write their own name, as well as business reply cards that were pre-addressed to Harvard.
# Upon receiving the invitation to participate, the recipient was asked whether he or she personally knew the contact person described in the letter. If so, the person was to forward the letter directly to that person. For the purposes of this study, knowing someone "personally" was defined as knowing them on a first-name basis.
# In the more likely case that the person did not personally know the target, then the person was to think of a friend or relative who was more likely to know the target. They were then directed to sign their name on the roster and forward the packet to that person. A postcard was also mailed to the researchers at Harvard so that they could track the chain's progression toward the target.
# When and if the package eventually reached the contact person in Boston, the researchers could examine the roster to count the number of times it had been forwarded from person to person. Additionally, for packages that never reached the destination, the incoming postcards helped identify the break point in the chain.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Results===

Shortly after the experiments began, letters would begin arriving to the targets and the researchers would receive postcards from the respondents. Sometimes the packet would arrive to the target in as few as one or two hops, while some chains were composed of as many as nine or ten links. However, a significant problem was that often people refused to pass the letter forward, and thus the chain never reached its destination. In one case, 232 of the 296 letters never reached the destination.&lt;ref name=milg /&gt;

However, 64 of the letters eventually did reach the target contact. Among these chains, the [[average path length]] fell around five and a half or six. Hence, the researchers concluded that people in the United States are separated by about six people on average. Although Milgram himself never used the phrase "[[Six Degrees of Separation|six degrees of separation]]", these findings are likely to have contributed to its widespread acceptance.&lt;ref name=bara /&gt;

In an experiment in which 160 letters were mailed out, 24 reached the target in his home in [[Sharon, Massachusetts]].  Of those 24 letters, 16 were given to the target by the same person, a clothing merchant Milgram called "Mr. Jacobs".  Of those that reached the target at his office, more than half came from two other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |title=The Tipping Point |publisher=Little Brown |pages= 34–38 |chapter=The Law of the Few}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers used the postcards to qualitatively examine the types of chains that are created. Generally, the package quickly reached a close geographic proximity, but would circle the target almost randomly until it found the target's inner circle of friends.&lt;ref name=milg /&gt; This suggests that participants strongly favored geographic characteristics when choosing an appropriate next person in the chain.

===Criticisms===
There are a number of methodological criticisms of the small-world experiment, which suggest that the average path length might actually be smaller or larger than Milgram expected. Four such criticisms are summarized here:

# Judith Kleinfeld argues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kleinfeld |first1=Judith |date=March 2002|title=Six Degrees: Urban Myth? |journal=Psychology Today |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC |doi= |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200203/six-degrees-urban-myth |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Milgram's study suffers from selection and non-response bias due to the way participants were recruited and high non-completion rates. First, the "starters" were not chosen at random, as they were recruited through an advertisement that specifically sought people who considered themselves well-connected. Another problem has to do with the attrition rate. If one assumes a constant portion of non-response for each person in the chain, longer chains will be under-represented because it is more likely that they will encounter an unwilling participant. Hence, Milgram's experiment should underestimate the true average path length. Several methods have been suggested to correct these estimates; one uses a variant of [[survival analysis]] in order to account for the length information of interrupted chains, and thus reduce the bias in the estimation of average degrees of separation.&lt;ref name = "Schnettler2009"&gt;Schnettler, Sebastian. 2009. "A small world on feet of clay? A comparison of empirical small-world studies against best-practice criteria." Social Networks, 31(3), pp. 179-189, {{doi|10.1016/j.socnet.2008.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# One of the key features of Milgram's methodology is that participants are asked to choose the person they know who is most likely to know the target individual. But in many cases, the participant may be unsure which of their friends is the most likely to know the target. Thus, since the participants of the Milgram experiment do not have a topological map of the social network, they might actually be sending the package further away from the target rather than sending it along the [[Shortest path problem|shortest path]]. This is very likely to increase route length, overestimating the average number of ties needed to connect two random people. An omniscient path-planner, having access to the complete social graph of the country, would be able to choose a shortest path that is, in general, shorter than the path produced by the [[greedy algorithm]] that makes local decisions only.
# A description of heterogeneous social networks still remains an open question. Though much research was not done for a number of years, in 1998 [[Duncan Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] published a breakthrough paper in the journal ''Nature.'' Mark Buchanan said, "Their paper touched off a storm of further work across many fields of science" (''Nexus'', p60, 2002). See Watts' book on the topic: ''[[Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age]]''.
# Some communities, such as the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], are completely isolated, disrupting the otherwise global chains. Once these people are discovered, they remain more "distant" from the vast majority of the world, as they have few economic, familial, or social contacts with the world at large; before they are discovered, they are not within any degree of separation from the rest of the population. However, these populations are invariably tiny, rendering them of low statistical significance.

In addition to these methodological criticisms, conceptual issues are debated. One regards the social relevance of indirect contact chains of different degrees of separation. Much formal and empirical work focuses on diffusion processes, but the literature on the small-world problem also often illustrates the relevance of the research using an example (similar to Milgram's experiment) of a targeted search in which a starting person tries to obtain some kind of resource (e.g., information) from a target person, using a number of intermediaries to reach that target person. However, there is little empirical research showing that indirect channels with a length of about six degrees of separation are actually used for such directed search, or that such search processes are more efficient compared to other means (e.g., finding information in a directory).&lt;ref name = "Schnettler2009b"&gt;Schnettler, Sebastian. 2009. "A structured overview of 50 years of small-world research" Social Networks, 31(3), pp. 165-178, {{doi|10.1016/j.socnet.2008.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

===The social sciences===
''[[The Tipping Point]]'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]], based on articles originally published in ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_01_11_a_weisberg.htm Six Degrees of Lois Weisberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630055725/http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_01_11_a_weisberg.htm |date=2007-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborates on the "funneling" concept. Gladwell condenses sociological research, which argues that the six-degrees phenomenon is dependent on a few extraordinary people ("[[connector (social)|connectors]]") with large networks of contacts and friends: these hubs then mediate the connections between the vast majority of otherwise weakly connected individuals.

Recent work in the effects of the small world phenomenon on disease transmission, however, have indicated that due to the [[strongly connected component|strongly connected]] nature of social networks as a whole, removing these hubs from a population usually has little effect on the average path length through the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (Barrett et al., 2005).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Mathematicians and actors===
Smaller communities, such as mathematicians and actors, have been found to be densely connected by chains of personal or professional associations. Mathematicians have created the [[Erdős number]] to describe their distance from [[Paul Erdős]] based on shared publications. A similar exercise has been carried out for the actor [[Kevin Bacon]] and other actors who appeared in movies together with him &amp;mdash; the latter effort informing the game "[[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]". There is also the combined [[Erdős-Bacon number]], for actor-mathematicians and mathematician-actors. Players of the popular Asian game [[Go (board game)|Go]] describe their distance from the great player [[Honinbo Shusaku]] by counting their [[Shusaku number]], which counts degrees of separation through the games the players have had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laird|first1=Roy|title=What’s Your "Shusaku Number?" «  American Go E-Journal|url=http://www.usgo.org/news/2011/07/whats-your-shusaku-number/|accessdate=29 November 2017|work=American Go Association|issue=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research on the small-world problem==
The small-world question is still a popular research topic today, with many experiments still being conducted. For instance, Peter Dodds, Roby Muhamad, and Duncan Watts conducted the first large-scale replication of Milgram's experiment, involving 24,163 e-mail chains and 18 targets around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/301/5634/827 "An Experimental Study of Search in Global Social Networks"]. ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 8 August 2003: Vol. 301 no. 5634 pp. 827-829DOI:10.1126/science.1081058&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodds ''et al''. also found that the mean chain length was roughly six, even after accounting for attrition. A similar experiment using popular social networking sites as a medium was carried out at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Results showed that very few messages actually reached their destination. However, the critiques that apply to Milgram's experiment largely apply also to this current research.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Network models===
In 1998, [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] from [[Cornell University]] published the first network model on the small-world phenomenon. They showed that networks from both the natural and man-made world, such as the neural network of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and [[power grid]]s, exhibit the small-world phenomenon. Watts and Strogatz showed that, beginning with a regular lattice, the addition of a small number of random links reduces the diameter&amp;mdash;the longest direct path between any two vertices in the network&amp;mdash;from being very long to being very short. The research was originally inspired by Watts' efforts to understand the synchronization of [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] [[stridulation|chirps]], which show a high degree of coordination over long ranges as though the insects are being guided by an invisible conductor. The mathematical model which Watts and Strogatz developed to explain this phenomenon has since been applied in a wide range of different areas. In Watts' words:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://discovermagazine.com/1998/dec/frommuhammadalit1553 | title=From Muhammad Ali to Grandma Rose | date =1 December 1998 | first=Polly | last=Shulman | publisher=DISCOVER magazine | accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think I've been contacted by someone from just about every field outside of English literature. I've had letters from mathematicians, physicists, biochemists, neurophysiologists, epidemiologists, economists, sociologists; from people in marketing, information systems, civil engineering, and from a business enterprise that uses the concept of the small world for networking purposes on the Internet.}}

Generally, their model demonstrated the truth in [[Mark Granovetter]]'s observation that it is "the strength of weak ties" that holds together a social network. Although the specific model has since been generalized by [[Jon Kleinberg]], it remains a canonical case study in the field of [[complex network]]s. In [[network theory]], the idea presented in the [[small-world network]] model has been explored quite extensively. Indeed, several classic results in [[random graph]] theory show that even networks with no real topological structure exhibit the small-world phenomenon, which mathematically is expressed as the diameter of the network growing with the logarithm of the number of nodes (rather than proportional to the number of nodes, as in the case for a lattice). This result similarly maps onto networks with a power-law degree distribution, such as [[scale-free networks]].

In [[computer science]], the small-world phenomenon (although it is not typically called that) is used in the development of secure peer-to-peer protocols, novel routing algorithms for the Internet and [[ad hoc]] wireless networks, and search algorithms for communication networks of all kinds.

==In popular culture==
Social networks pervade popular culture in the United States and elsewhere. In particular, the notion of [[Six Degrees of Separation|six degrees]] has become part of the collective consciousness. [[Social networking websites]] such as [[Facebook]], [[Friendster]], [[MySpace]], [[XING]], [[Orkut]], [[Cyworld]], [[Bebo]], and others have greatly increased the connectivity of the online space through the application of social networking concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6185">The '''Society of Les Voyageurs''' is a fraternal student organization at the [[University of Michigan]]. It is one of the oldest university [[List of university outing clubs|outing clubs]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umich.edu/~lvs/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1907, the Society of Les Voyageurs is the second oldest [[student organization]] on the University of Michigan campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigandaily.com/content/about-campus-les-voyageurs&lt;/ref&gt;  On Sunday evenings during the academic year, the Society hosts communal dinners known as "Sunday Feeds" along with educational programs and entertainment related to the outdoors.

==History==

The Society of Les Voyageurs was founded in 1907 by University of Michigan students Elmer "Lindy" Lehndorff, Lawrence "Larry" Lark, and Chester MacChesney.  They named the Society after the pioneering [[French-Canadian]] [[voyageurs]] of the [[Great Lakes]] [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], whom they admired as early adventurers and outdoorsmen.  Society membership was initially open only to male students at the University. The Society's Constitution was amended in 1972 to allow for the admission of women, and the Society has been co-ed since that time. The Society has published an annual [[yearbook]] since 1910 as well as several volumes of Society history.

After nearly two decades of renting space on the University of Michigan campus, the Society drew up plans in 1924 to construct a cabin on several acres of property along the Huron River in Ann Arbor.  "Pine Lodge", as it was originally named, was built almost entirely by Society members in the spring and summer of 1925, and has continually served since then as the home for the Society as well as a residence for student members. During the summer of 2012, the renamed Habe Mills Pine Lodge underwent an extensive renovation, including the installation of "Kay's Kitchen."  The new kitchen is named for Kay Lane, a University student in the late 1960s and early 1970s upon whom Society members bestowed the title "Queen of the Cabin," and who ultimately paved the way for the admission of women as full members of the Society.  After graduating from the University of Michigan, Kay remained active in the Society and was a well known friend and mentor to several generations of members.

==2012 Cabin Renovation==
Beginning in the summer of 2012, the cabin underwent a major renovation costing over $100,000. Plans for the renovation had been tossed around for years, and the final plans were made official in early January of that year. Most of the work was contracted out to By The River Carpentry, but many of the actives and alumni were around and gave a helping hand. The renovation consisted of expanding the dining room, adding an upstairs bathroom, re-doing the kitchen, adding in a hallway between the dining room and kitchen and expanding the upstairs lodge. The work was completed in August 2012, and was ready to welcome back students for the 2012 Fall semester. Potlucks continue as normal, but now there is more space to accommodate even more lovely guests.

[[File:Cancun-42.jpg|thumb|Cancun is a popular spring break destination]]

'''Spring break''' is a vacation period in early spring at universities and schools which started during the 1930s in the United States and is observed in some other mainly Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laurie|first1=John|title=Spring break: The Economic, Socio-Cultural and Public Governance Impacts of College Students on Spring break Host Locations|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109023091|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring break is frequently associated with extensive gatherings and riotous partying in warm climate locations such as [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and [[Cancun]], Mexico, attended regardless of participants' educational standings.

As a holiday it is variously known as '''Easter vacation''', '''Easter holiday''', '''April break''', spring '''vacation''', '''mid-term break''', '''study week''', '''reading week''', '''reading period''', or '''Easter week''', depending on regional conventions.

==History==
Spring break is an academic tradition in various mostly western countries that is scheduled for different periods depending on the state and sometimes the region.

===Asia===
====Japan====
In [[Japan]], the spring break starts with the end of the academic year in March and ends on April 1 with the beginning of a new academic year.

====Kuwait====
In [[Kuwait]], the spring break is between the two academic or school semesters, usually in December or January, but could last until early February. It is usually a 2 or 3-week break, however, there is no fixed date for it, as the date is adjusted in accordance with the Lunar or [[Hijri calendar]], as it is the case for almost all Arab and Muslim nations.

====South Korea====
In [[South Korea]], the spring break starts in mid-February (the end of the academic year) and ends on March 1 (a national holiday) with the beginning of a new academic year.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Europe===
====Czech Republic====
In the [[Czech Republic]], only primary and secondary school students have a spring break. The break is one week long and the date of the break differs from county to county to avoid overcrowding of the break destinations in the Czech Republic (Czechs usually travel to the mountains to ski there). The counties are divided into six groups, each group containing counties evenly distributed across the country. The first group starts the holiday on the first Monday of February, the last group starts the holiday five weeks later (usually in early March). The last group of counties becomes the first one to have the spring break the next year.

====Georgia====
Before 2017, the spring break in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was typically an Easter holiday, lasting from Thursday to Tuesday in the Holy Week. In 2017, the new Minister of Education and Science of Georgia Aleksandre Jejelava made a new reform by which, students of preschools, elementary &amp; high schools as well as colleges and universities get six days of holiday in March, lasting from March 8 to March 15, for people to go on winter vacations or do other activities.

====Germany====
In [[Germany]], universities typically schedule a semester break of five to eight weeks around March. The [[Whitsun]] ([[Pentecost]]) holidays around late May or early June are also considered a spring break.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studenten-wg.de/infos/semesterferien.html studenten-wg.de] - About semester breaks in Germany (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
In [[Greece]], spring break takes place during the [[Holy Week]] and the one after it.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Lithuania====
In [[Lithuania]], spring break (called Easter holidays or spring holidays) takes place one week before Easter and one day after it (as it is the second day of Easter), all school students have this vacation. Primary school students have another week of holidays after Easter.

====Portugal====
In [[Portugal]], spring break is mostly known as "Easter Holidays" and it gives two weeks to all students around the country.

====Russia====
Before 1917 there was an Easter Break in schools. In the [[Soviet Union]], spring break was always from 24 to 31 of March. Now, many schools in Russia still have the spring break, but the exact date is decided by the school itself. In the majority of cases it is set in the middle of April. Also, the public holidays in May, connected with Labour day, can be an accurate equivatent of the spring break.

==== Slovakia ====
[[Slovakia]] gives a week-long break to its [[Primary education|elementary school]] and [[Secondary education|secondary school]] students in the months of February and March. The break is one week long and the date of the break differs from county to county to avoid overcrowding of the break destinations in the Slovak Republic. The counties are divided into three groups, the first group starts the holiday on the end of February, the last group starts the holiday two weeks later (in early March).

There is, as well another, shorter Easter break which starts on Holly Thursday and ends on next Tuesday.  

====Spain====
In [[Spain]], there is not a spring break. Instead, the [[Holy Week in Spain|Holy Week]] is celebrated and students usually have holidays during these days.

====United Kingdom====
The Easter break in the [[United Kingdom]] is from one to two and a half weeks (depending on the local council and school policy) for primary and high schools, and for two to four weeks for university students, and fits around Easter.

===North America===
====Canada====
[[Canada]] gives a week-long break to its [[Primary education|elementary school]] and [[Secondary education|secondary school]] students in the month of March, with the time varying from province to province; [[New Brunswick]] and [[Quebec]], for example, place their March breaks during the first week of March; [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[British Columbia]] schedule theirs during the second or third week, and is usually a week long; the break in [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] usually occurs in the last week of March. In Canada, spring Break for post-secondary students is called 'reading week' or 'reading break,' depending on the duration. However, the formal title of Mid-term Break has been the preferred generic term. Reading Week in Canada usually occurs in the month of February, coinciding with [[Family Day (Canada)|Family Day]]. 

====Jamaica====
In [[Jamaica]], the spring break starts in the first week of Good Friday. The break may range from one week to two weeks, often times two. This break starts depending on which month the Easter holiday begins, March or April.

====Mexico====
In [[Mexico]], spring break takes place during the [[Holy Week]] and the one after it.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====United States====

In the [[United States]], spring break at the college and university level can occur from March to April, depending on term dates and when [[Easter Sunday|Easter holiday]] falls. Usually, spring break is about one week long, but many [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] institutions in the United States schedule a two-week-long break known as "Easter Break," "Easter Holidays", or "Easter Vacation", as they generally take place in the weeks before or after Easter.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, in the states of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Maine]], schools typically schedule spring break for the week of the third Monday in April to coincide with [[Patriots' Day]].

===Central America===
====Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras====
In [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]], it takes place during Easter; schools give students a whole week to rest while the staff workforce rests approximately three days.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===South America===
====Colombia====
In [[Colombia]], spring break takes place the first week of April, during the [[Holy Week]] until the second week.

====Chile====
In [[Chile]], many schools and universities take vacations in the middle of September coinciding with the celebration of the [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|Fiestas Patrias]] (Celebration of that country).Being located in the Southern Hemisphere, spring begins approximately at the end of this holiday week so it acts similarly to the American spring break.

==Spring break festivals==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
Large annual spring break festivities take place in various countries, often in the form of [[music festival]]s and joined by special [[nightclub]] [[Party|parties]], beach activities and accommodation offers. This is an incomplete list of places with spring break festivals.

===Pacific===
The [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] enjoys spring break during November. Some tour companies are now chartering out entire island resorts for the festivities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://remixmagazine.com/springbreak-the-exclusive-island-get-away-you-dont-want-to-miss-out-on/ Island Party Fiji]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fiji====

Some tour companies put on special chartered flights for spring break at discounted rates.

=====Panama City Beach, Florida=====
Starting in the late 90's, [[Panama City Beach, Florida|Panama City Beach]] began advertising the destination hoping to attract crowds that had formerly gone to Fort Lauderdale and then Daytona Beach before those communities enacted restrictions.  From 2010-2016 an estimated 300,000 students traveled to the destination. The spawn of social media and digital marketing helped boost the beach town into a student mecca during March. Following well publicized shootings and a gang rape in 2015, several new ordinances were put into effect prohibiting drinking on the beach and establishing a bar closing time of 2&amp;nbsp;a.m. Central Time.  Reports show a drop in Panama City Beach's spring break turnout in March 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Some-local-businesses-say-the-smaller-spring-break-crowds-have-had-a-negative-impact-on-the-local-economy-373795851.html|title=Some businesses see negative economic impact this spring break|first=Kelly|last=Baumgarten|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by increased family tourism in April 2016.  Both are credited/blamed on the new ordinances by the [[Bay County, Florida|Bay County]] Community Development Corporation (CDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsherald.com/news/20160626/panama-city-reports-record-bed-tax-numbers-in-april|title=Panama City reports record bed tax numbers in April|first=KATIE|last=LANDECK|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fort Lauderdale, Florida=====
[[Fort Lauderdale]]'s reputation as a spring break destination for college students started when the [[Colgate University]] men's swim team arrived to practice there over Christmas break in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Marsh |first= Bill |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/weekinreview/19marsh.html |title= The innocent birth of the spring bacchanal |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 19 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attracting approximately 20,000 college students in the 1950s, spring break was still known as 'Spring vacation' and was a relatively low key affair. This began to change when [[Glendon Swarthout]]’s novel, ''Where the Boys Are'' was published in 1960, effectively ushering in modern spring break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurie|first=John|title=Spring Break: The Economic, Socio-Cultural and Public Governance Effects of College Students on Spring break Host Locations|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109023091|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swarthout’s 1960 novel was quickly made into a movie of the same title later that year, ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'', in which college girls met boys while on spring break there. The number of visiting college students immediately jumped to over 50,000.&lt;ref name="sfhm"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://historymiamiarchives.org/pdfs/sfh-1991-1.pdf |title=Where the boys were |last=George |first=Paul S. |date=1991 |work=South Florida History Magazine |access-date=16 November 2017 |publisher=Historical Association of Southern Florida |issue=1 |pages=5-8 |via=[[HistoryMiami]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, Ft. Lauderdale was attracting between 250,000-350,000 college students per year during spring break. Residents of the Fort Lauderdale area became so upset at the damage done by college students that the local government passed laws restricting parties in 1985. At the same time, the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act]] was enacted in the United States, requiring that Florida raise the minimum drinking age to 21 and inspiring many underage college vacationers to travel to other locations in the United States for spring break. By 1989, the number of college students traveling to Fort Lauderdale fell to 20,000, a far cry from the 350,000 who went four years prior.&lt;ref name="sfhm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bohn|first=Lauren|title=A brief history of spring break|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1888317,00.html|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=3 October 2012|date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====South Padre Island, Texas=====
In the early 1980s, [[South Padre Island]] became the first location outside of Florida to draw a large number of college students for spring break. With only a few thousand residents, South Padre Island has consistently drawn between 80,000 and 120,000 spring breakers for the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurie|first=John|title=Spring break: The Economic, Socio-Cultural and Public Governance Impacts of College Students of Spring break Host Locations|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109023091|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate marketing==
It is common for major brands that cater to the youth market (e.g., [[Coca-Cola]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[MTV]], and branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]]) to market at spring break destinations.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}

'''Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for [[science fiction]] writers. Since its origin in 1985, it has been held in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]]; Bryn Mawr, [[Pennsylvania]]; and most recently in Little Switzerland, North Carolina.

Currently organized by Richard Butner, Sycamore Hill was started by [[John Kessel]] and [[Mark L. Van Name]]. It is an invitation-only workshop for established SF, fantasy, and slipstream writers. Attendees have included [[Kelly Link]], [[Carol Emshwiller]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Connie Willis]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Robert Frazier (writer)|Robert Frazier]], [[Ted Chiang]], [[Benjamin Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000278.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], among many others.

A collection of original stories from the 1994 workshop was published as the anthology ''Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology'', edited by John Kessel, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner ([[Tor Books]], 1996). It includes works by Richard Butner, Carol Emshwiller, Karen Joy Fowler, Robert Frazier, Gregory Frost, Alexander Jablokov, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Jonathan Lethem, Maureen F. McHugh, Michaela Roessner, Bruce Sterling, and Mark L. Van Name.

[[Orson Scott Card]] wrote about his experience at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop in the essay "On Sycamore Hill." Scholars such as Michael Collins identify Card's Sycamore Hill experience as marking a critical "turning point" in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward Other Worlds: Perspectives on John Milton, C.

'''Vergara v. California''' was a lawsuit in the [[California]] state courts which dealt with a child's right to [[education]] and to instruction by effective [[teachers]]. The suit was filed in May 2012 by lawyers on behalf of nine California public school student plaintiffs. It alleged that several California statutes on teacher tenure, layoffs, and dismissal violate the [[Constitution of California]] by retaining some "grossly ineffective" teachers and thus denying equal protection to students assigned to the teachers.  Furthermore, according to the complaint, the statutes had a [[disparate impact]] on poor and minority students, who were more likely to be assigned to a grossly-ineffective teacher.

On June 10, 2014, after a two-month trial, Judge Rolf M. Treu of the California Superior Court ruled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v. California - Tentative Decision | court = Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles |date = June 10, 2014 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Tenative-Decision.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all of the statutes challenged by the student plaintiffs were unconstitutional;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Medina | first = Jennifer | title = Judge Rejects Teacher Tenure for California | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = June 10, 2014 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/us/california-teacher-tenure-laws-ruled-unconstitutional.html?_r=0 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ruling was finalized in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara v.

== The challenged statutes ==

The lawsuit identified five separate statutes that kept ineffective teachers in the classroom.  The argument by the student plaintiffs in the lawsuit was that [[tenure]] decisions had to be made too quickly, and that once tenure was granted it was too difficult to remove a teacher if a mistake had been made in granting tenure.  The presence of ineffective teachers necessarily meant that some students were denied their constitutional right to a quality education.  The defendants argued that it was possible to remove bad teachers and that these laws did not cause bad teachers to be in the schools.

=== Permanent Employment ("Tenure") statute ===

Certain provisions of the California Education Code conferred "permanent employment" status (or [[tenure]]) on any teacher who had not been informed that his or her teaching contract had been cancelled by March of the second year of teaching.  Permanent status required school districts to follow specific evidentiary and procedural requirements before firing a teacher.  Lawyers for teachers unions in ''Vergara'' argued that this was not equivalent to lifetime employment, but instead just recognition of the due process requirements that would have to be satisfied if teachers were to be fired for any one of a number of specified reasons.

=== Dismissal statutes ===

A series of three statutes in California specified a series of procedural requirements that had to be satisfied if a tenured teacher was to be dismissed.  These requirements, the plaintiffs argued, put undue cost on districts if they wished to remove a teacher.  They were also considerably beyond the normal due process rights for other civil servants in California.  John Deasy, Superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), testified that the statutes harmed students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Deasy | first = John | title = Op-Ed: L.A. Unified’s Deasy applauds Vergara ruling on teacher rules | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = June 10, 2014 | url = http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-deasy-vergara-teachers-20140611-story.html | accessdate = December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last In, First Out ("LIFO") layoff statute ===

The final challenged statute dictates how district administrators prioritize which teachers are to be laid off if they were to reduce the size of their teaching staff.  The California law required strict application of [[LIFO (education)|last in first out,]] or LIFO.  With a few exceptions, before any tenured teacher could be laid off, the district had to remove all of the more junior, nontenured teachers.  According to LIFO, it is impermissible to use information about teacher effectiveness in making layoff decisions.

== The trial court decision: the challenged statutes "shock the conscience" ==
On June 10, 2014, the court ruled that the statutes at issue produced disparities that "[[Shocks the conscience|shock the conscience]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 7, line 21 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and violate the equal protection clause of the [[Constitution of California|California Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 3, lines 19-27 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As background, the court began the ''Vergara'' opinion with a discussion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case of [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown v. Board of Education'' (1954)]] and the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] cases of [[Serrano v. Priest|''Serrano v. Priest I'' (1971)]], [[Serrano v. Priest|''Serrano v. Priest II'' (1976)]], and ''Butt v. State of California'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Butt v. State of California |vol = Volume 4, |reporter = California 4th Reporter, |opinion = page 668 |date = 1992 |url= http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/butt-v-state-california-31401}}&lt;/ref&gt; "While these cases addressed the issue of a lack of '''equality''' of educational '''opportunity''' . . . here this Court is directly faced with issues that compel it to apply these constitutional principles to the '''quality''' of the educational experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 2, lines 23-28 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court examined the challenged California statutes under [[strict scrutiny]] [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 8, lines 19-24 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence regarding teacher effectiveness ===
School administrators asked the judge to review a copy of "California Standards for the Teaching Profession" (2009 Edition) as evidence. The court pointed out that the opening sentence of those Standards state: "A growing body of research confirms that the '''quality of teaching''' is what matters most for the students' development and learning in schools." (Emphasis added by the court).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 7, lines 8-11 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Based on a 4 year study, Dr. [[Thomas Kane (economist) | [Thomas] Kane]] testified that students in LAUSD [[Los Angeles Unified School District | [the Los Angeles Unified School District]]] who are taught by a teacher in the bottom 5% of competence lose 9.54 months of learning in a single year compared to students with average teachers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 7, lines 24-26 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dr. [[David Berliner | [David] Berliner]], an expert called by [California school administrators], testified that 1 - 3% of teachers in California are grossly ineffective. Given that the evidence showed roughly 275,000 active teachers in this state, the extrapolated number of grossly ineffective teachers ranges from 2,750 to 8,250."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 8, lines 2-4 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A tenure period of less than two years was insufficient ===
The court found that California's tenure period was actually less than the two-year period ostensibly outlined in the statute. This was because a tenure decision had to be made in March, before the end of a new teacher's second school year. In contrast, the credentialing induction period for new teachers lasted two full school years. "Thus, a teacher reelected [for tenure] in March may not be recommended for credentialing after the close of the induction program in May, leaving the applicable district with a non-credentialed teacher with tenure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 9, lines 1-19 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There was extensive evidence presented, including some from [school administrators that the tenure statute did not] provide nearly enough time for an informed decision to be made regarding the decision of tenure (critical for both students and teachers)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 9, lines 21-25 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesse Rothstein]] and [[David Berliner]] were experts who testified for the defendant school officials during the trial. Both stated that two years was not the optimal amount of time needed to make a tenure decision. Three years to five years was instead suggested as a better time frame to make the tenure decision for the mutual benefit of students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 10, lines 10-12 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveying tenure periods in other U.S. states, the court found that as of the trial (January 27 to March 27, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 6, lines 13-15 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 states had no tenure system at all, 9 states had tenure periods of four to five years, 32 had a three-year period, and 5 (including California) had a period of two years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 10, lines 14-17 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firing a teacher in California was too expensive and time consuming ===
Lawyers for the plaintiff school students alleged that it was "too time consuming and too expensive to go through the dismissal process as required by the Dismissal Statutes to rid school districts of grossly ineffective teachers." The court agreed, concluding that "such time and cost constraints cause districts in many cases to be very reluctant to even commence dismissal procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 10, line 25 to page 11, line 3 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court noted that school administrators and teachers unions had raised "the entirely legitimate issue" of protecting a teacher's due process rights when she or he was faced with the possibility of being fired. However, the court decided that "given the evidence . . . the Dismissal Statutes present the issue of ''uber'' due process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 11, lines 21-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This Court is confident that the independent judiciary of this state is no less dedicated to the protection of reasonable due process rights of teachers than it is of protecting the rights of children to constitutionally mandated equal education opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 12, lines 23-26 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teacher layoffs prioritized solely by seniority harm students ===

California's [[LIFO (education)|LIFO]]-only layoff statute required "the last-hired teacher [to be] the statutorily-mandated first-fired one when lay-offs occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 18-19 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute did not contain "an exception or waiver based on teacher effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 17-18 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"No matter how gifted the junior teacher, and no matter how grossly ineffective the senior teacher, the junior gifted one . . . is separated from [the students] and a senior grossly ineffective one . . . is left in place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 13, lines 19-23 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The logic of [this statutory scheme] is unfathomable and therefore constitutionally unsupportable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 4-5 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveying layoff rules for teachers in other U.S. jurisdictions, the court found that as of the trial (January 27 to March 27, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 6, lines 13-15 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 states provided that seniority could not be considered; 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion; 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors; and 10 states (including California) provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 14, lines 10-14 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding, experts and attorneys at the trial court level ===
Funding for the plaintiff school students was provided by [[David Welch (optical engineer)|David Welch]], a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Callahan | first = David | title = Meet the Tech Entrepreneur Putting Teacher Tenure on Trial | newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]] | date = February 3, 2014 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/meet-the-tech-entrepreneu_b_4718858.html | accessdate = December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welch is the founder of a nonprofit education reform organization called Students Matter through which the plaintiffs' attorney's fees were paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Raden | first = Bill | last2 = Cohn | first2 = Gary | title = David Welch: The Man Behind Vergara v.

The plaintiff school students' trial experts included a group of economists who examined various aspects of teacher effectiveness under "[[value-added modeling]]".  The original complaint was built on the analyses of teacher effectiveness and the estimated economic cost of ineffective teachers by [[Eric Hanushek]] of Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hanushek | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Hanushek  | title = Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth? | journal = Education Next | volume =  11 | issue =   3 | publisher = [[Hoover Institution]], [[Stanford University]] | date = Summer 2011 | url = http://educationnext.org/valuing-teachers/ | accessdate = December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hanushek | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Hanushek | title = The economic value of higher teacher quality | journal = Economics of Education Review | volume =  30 | issue =  3 | pages =466–479 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775710001718 | accessdate = December 5, 2014 | doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2010.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raj Chetty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chetty | first = Raj | authorlink = Raj Chetty | last2 = Friedman | first2 = John N. | last3 = Rockoff | first3 = Jonah | title = Measuring the Impacts of Teachers II: Teacher value-added and the student outcomes in adulthood | journal = [[The American Economic Review]] | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.jstor.org/journal/amereconrevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Harvard University) and [[Thomas Kane (economist)|Thomas Kane]] (Harvard University) testified on the distribution of ineffective teachers in California and particularly in Los Angeles.  Dan Goldhaber (University of Washington) testified on the impact of LIFO layoff statutes.  Plaintiff rebuttal testimony was provided by Eric Hanushek and by Dr. Anthony Smith, former superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District.

Other expert witnesses during the trial included [[Linda Darling Hammond]] (Stanford University), [[David Berliner]] (Arizona State University), and Susan Moore Johnson (Harvard University), who testified on their understanding of the problems of tenure and of the impact of ineffective teachers. [[Jesse Rothstein]] of the University of California, Berkeley, testified that tenure restrictions served the interest of student achievement.

The school students were represented by the [[Gibson Dunn]] law firm.  The defense for school administrators was provided by the [[California Attorney General]].  The [[California Teachers Association]] intervened on the side of the defense and was represented by Altschuler Berzon.

== The appeals court reversal: the challenged statutes are constitutional ==

Soon after the trial court's ruling was issued it was appealed by California Governor [[Jerry Brown]], who reasoned that "[c]hanges of this magnitude, as a matter of law and policy, require appellate review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nagourney | first = Adam | title = California Governor Appeals Court Ruling Overturning Protections for Teachers | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 30, 2014 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/us/california-governor-fights-decision-on-teacher-tenure.html | accessdate = December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard on February 25, 2016 by the [[California courts of appeal|California Court of Appeal]], Second Appellate District, Division Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Blume | first = Howard | last2 = Resmovits  | first2 = Joy | title = Judges weigh arguments over teacher vs. student rights in landmark tenure lawsuit | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = February 25, 2016 | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-vergara-tenure-battle-20160225-story.html | access-date = April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2016 the Court of Appeal's three judge panel unanimously overturned the trial court's ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2016) - Appellate Decision |pinpoint = page 652 |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4910371724480037363&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,45&amp;sciodt=6,45}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that the attorneys for the plaintiff school students "failed to show that the statutes themselves make any certain group of students more likely to be taught by ineffective teachers than any other group of students,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2016) - Appellate Decision |pinpoint = page 627 |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4910371724480037363&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,45&amp;sciodt=6,45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the job of the appellate judges was "merely to determine whether the statutes are constitutional, not if they are 'a good idea.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2016) - Appellate Decision |pinpoint = page 627 |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4910371724480037363&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,45&amp;sciodt=6,45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Blume | first = Howard | last2 = Resmovits | first2 = Joy | last3 = Kohli | first3 = Sonali | title = In a win for unions, appeals court reverses ruling that threw out teacher tenure in California | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = April 14, 2016 | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-court-rejects-bid-to-end-teacher-tenure-in-california-marking-huge-win-for-unions-20160414-story.html | access-date = April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on the statutes alone, the Court of Appeal found that "[t]he evidence . . . revealed deplorable staffing decisions being made by some local administrators that have a deleterious impact on poor and minority students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2016) - Appellate Decision |pinpoint = page 651 |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4910371724480037363&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,45&amp;sciodt=6,45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The California Supreme Court's refusal to review the case ==

Two out of the three justices who disagreed with the decision to deny review submitted dissenting statements outlining why they believed the Court of Appeal decision should have been re-examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Emma | title = California Supreme Court decision leaves state’s teacher tenure law in place | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = August 22, 2016 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/08/22/california-supreme-court-decision-leaves-states-teacher-tenure-law-in-place/ | access-date = August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Goodwin Liu]] wrote, "[a]s the state's highest court, we owe the . . . schoolchildren throughout California, our transparent and reasoned judgment on whether the challenged statutes deprive a significant subset of students of their fundamental right to education and violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Vergara v.

== Implications ==
The day after the ''Vergara'' trial court decision in June 2014, the Associated Press described it in a USA Today article as "a landmark decision that could influence the gathering debate over tenure across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | first = | title = Judge strikes down California teacher tenure: Judge also took issue with laws that say last hired must be first fired | newspaper = USA Today | date = June 11, 2014 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/11/californiateacher-tenure/10313471/ | accessdate = November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials from the teachers' union criticized the trial court's decision, saying that insufficient evidence was provided by the plaintiffs to show that the statutes being challenged were harmful for students, and further that the court "blatantly ignored" evidence to the contrary, saying that in actuality, the laws improve public education.  They further criticized the decision for "intrud[ing] on an inherently legislative function."&lt;ref name=CadelagoGrip&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cadelago|first1=Christopher|title=Activists look to courts to weaken grip of California teachers union|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article21185103.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=16 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519131208/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article21185103.html|archivedate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2014 a similar lawsuit modeled on the ''Vergara'' case, ''[[Davids v.

An article published in the Washington Post on April 14, 2016 said that the Court of Appeal's decision reversing the trial court handed "a major victory to teachers unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Emma | title = California appeals court upholds teacher tenure, a major victory for unions | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = April 14, 2016 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/california-appeals-court-upholds-teacher-tenure-a-major-victory-for-unions/2016/04/14/8dde2d94-0297-11e6-9d36-33d198ea26c5_story.html | access-date = April 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent report on National Public Radio used similar language (albeit limited to California) when discussing the California Supreme Court's refusal to review the appellate decision, calling the denial of review "a major victory for teachers unions in California."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gonzales | first = Richard | title = California Teacher Tenure Laws Upheld | newspaper = National Public Radio / The Two-Way | date = August 22, 2016 | url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/22/490991086/california-teacher-tenure-laws-upheld | access-date = August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's two largest teachers unions issued triumphant press releases after the California Supreme Court precluded further state court review. The president of the [[National Education Association|NEA]]-affiliated [[California Teachers Association]] called ''Vergara'' a "case brought by wealthy anti-public education millionaires who spent millions of dollars to bypass voters, parents, and the legislature in an attempt to impose their harmful education agenda on local schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Victory for Students as California Supreme Court Rejects Review of Vergara Appeal | publisher = California Teachers Association | date = August 22, 2016 | url = http://www.cta.org/About-CTA/News-Room/Press-Releases/2016/08/20160822.aspx | access-date = September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the California Federation of Teachers (the [[American Federation of Teachers|AFT]]'s California affiliate) blamed the ''Vergara'' lawsuit for fostering a teacher shortage in the state, and then said, "[w]e can now turn closer attention to solving the actual problems we confront in our schools, such as securing adequate funding . . . reducing class sizes, promoting and strengthening peer assistance and review, and reinforcing collaborative district practices with a proven record of success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = California Supreme Court affirms appeal court decision: 'Vergara v.

== Possible pivot to the California State Legislature ==

When the trial court judge determined that the tenure, dismissal and layoff statutes were unconstitutional, he also conceded that "it is not the function of this Court to dictate or even to advise the legislature . . . how to replace the Challenged Statutes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Vergara (2014) - Judgment |pinpoint = page 15, lines 13-15 |url= http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SM_Final-Judgment_08.28.14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the California Supreme Court's denial of review effectively upheld the validity of those same statutes, the leaders of the Students Matter group that initiated and funded the lawsuit signaled that the next battles might be legislative: "The Supreme Court’s decision places the responsibility for improving the state’s teacher retention, evaluation and dismissal laws squarely with the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]]. And that’s where we intend to take this fight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stokes | first = Kyle | title = California state Supreme Court declines to take up Vergara case, which targeted teacher job protections | newspaper = KPCC / Southern California Public Radio | date = August 22, 2016 | url = http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/08/22/63829/state-supreme-court-declines-to-take-up-vergara-ca/ | access-date = August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proponents from both sides of the dispute agreed that the legislature, and not the courts, was the appropriate venue for further deliberation to take place.  Assistant professor in public policy at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] Mark Paige said of the state court's decision, "This was an appropriate move by the Supreme Court and really a victory for the idea of a [[separation of powers]] as it relates to [[Education policy|education-policy]] matters."  He continued, "The trial court decision was an example of an activist court. The opinion lodged the trial court in the middle of a policy matter."&lt;ref name="TimesWin"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Howard Blume|author2=Joy Resmovits|title=In a major win for teachers unions, California Supreme Court lets teacher tenure ruling stand|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-edu-ca-supreme-court-lets-teacher-tenure-survive-20160819-snap-story.html|accessdate=5 September 2016|work=latimes.com|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=23 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830120757/http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-edu-ca-supreme-court-lets-teacher-tenure-survive-20160819-snap-story.html|archivedate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days after the California Supreme Court denied review, leading newspapers in California's two largest metropolitan areas (Los Angeles and San Francisco) published editorials which called on the state's legislature and teachers unions to address the issues raised in the ''Vergara'' case. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' acknowledged that labor statutes protecting teachers may not be the most significant contributors to the educational difficulties encountered by California's students. Nonetheless, the ''Times'' Editorial Board concluded that "California’s tenure and seniority laws do tend to protect the worst teachers at the expense of students. The Legislature, always too obliging to the desires of the teachers unions, must gather its strength on behalf of the state’s children to reform bad laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = LA Times Editorial Board | title = Now that the Vergara case is over, let's reform teacher tenure laws | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = August 24, 2016 | url = http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-teacher-tenure-ruling-20160823-snap-story.html | access-date = September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also reproved California's teachers unions for keeping "profoundly rigid rules that protect incompetent classroom instructors and harm low-income students." Like the ''Times'', the editors at the ''Chronicle'' asserted that it should be "the Legislature [that overhauls] the tenure rules," but they also noted that "teacher groups are among California’s biggest political spenders and have gutted past efforts at addressing these educational inequities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Editorial | title = State Supreme Court action means status quo on teacher tenure wins | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | date = August 23, 2016 | url = http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/State-Supreme-Court-action-means-status-quo-on-9180463.php | access-date = September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
