The '''Pucikwar language''', '''''A-Pucikwar''''', is an [[extinct language]] of the [[Andaman Islands]], [[India]], formerly spoken by the [[Pucikwar people]] on the south coast of [[Middle Andaman]], the northeast coast of [[South Andaman]], and on [[Baratang Island]].  It belonged to the [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese family]].

==History==
As the colonisation and settlement process of the Andaman Islands intensified from the late 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Great Andamanese]] groups were greatly reduced in number and became alienated from their traditional territories. The few surviving Great Andamanese soon lost the cultural and linguistic distinctions among them that were present at the onset of the 19th century, when at least ten distinct tribal and linguistic groups were recorded.
By the 1901 census, the Pucikwar were reduced to 50,&lt;ref name="gob"&gt;A. N. Sharma (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WEztW7c0CqQC&amp;pg=PA75 Tribal Development in the Andaman Islands]'', page 75. Sarup &amp; Sons, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; but distinctions between tribal groups and subgroups had become considerably blurred (and some intermarriage had also occurred with Indian and [[Karen people|Karen (Burmese)]] settlers).  
The Pucikwar tribe disappeared as a distinct group sometime after 1931.&lt;ref name="vanDriem2001"&gt;{{Citation | title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region : Containing an Introduction to the Symbiotic Theory of Language | author=George van Driem | date=2001 | publisher=BRILL | isbn=90-04-12062-9 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=fiavPYCz4dYC | quote=''... The Aka-Kol tribe of Middle Andaman became extinct by 1921. The Oko-Juwoi of Middle Andaman and the Aka-Bea of South Andaman and Rutland Island were extinct by 1931. The Akar-Bale of Ritchie's Archipelago, the Aka-Kede of Middle Andaman and the A-Pucikwar of South Andaman Island soon followed. By 1951, the census counted a total of only 23 Greater Andamanese and 10 Sentinelese. That means that just ten men, twelve women and one child remained of the Aka-Kora, Aka-Cari and Aka-Jeru tribes of Greater Andaman and only ten natives of North Sentinel Island ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''.

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

The '''Bea language''', '''''Aka-Bea''''',&lt;ref&gt;also Beada ~ Biada or Bogijiab ~ Bojigniji ~ Bojigyab&lt;/ref&gt; is an extinct [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] language of the Southern&lt;ref name=Manoh1&gt;Manoharan, S. (1983). "Subgrouping Andamanese group of languages." ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''
XII(1): 82-95.&lt;/ref&gt; group. It was spoken around the western [[Andaman Strait]] and around the northern and western coast of [[South Andaman]].

==History==
The Bea were one of the [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Andaman Islands]], one of the ten or so [[Great Andamanese]] tribes identified by [[British Empire|British]] colonials in the 1860s.  Their language was closely related to the other [[Great Andamanese languages]]. They were extinct as a distinct people by 1931.&lt;ref name="vanDriem2001"/&gt;

==Samples==

The following [[poem]] in Aka-Bea was written by a [[Tribal chief|chief]], ''Jambu'', after he was freed from a six-month [[Prison|jail]] term for [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;Man, E.H. (1923). ''Dictionary of the South Andaman Language''. British India Press: Bombay&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''ngô:do kûk l'àrtâ:lagî:ka,''
: ''mō:ro el:ma kâ igbâ:dàla''
: ''mō:ro el:mo lê aden:yarà''
:: ''pō:-tōt läh.''
: Chorus: ''aden:yarà pō:-tōt läh.''

Literally:

: thou heart-sad art,
: sky-surface to there looking while,
: sky-surface of ripple to looking while,
:: bamboo spear on lean-dost.

Translation:

: Thou art sad at heart,
: gazing there at the sky's surface,
: gazing at the ripple on the sky's surface,
:: leaning on the bamboo spear.

Note, however, that, as seems to be typical of Andamanese [[poetry]], the words and sentence structure have been somewhat abbreviated or inverted in order to obtain the desired [[rhythm]]ical effect.

As another example, we give part of a [[creation myth]] in Oko-Juwoi, reminiscent of [[Prometheus]]:

: ''Kuro-t'on-mik-a Mom Mirit-la, Bilik l'ôkô-ema-t, peakar at-lo top-chike at laiche Lech-lin a, kotik a ôko-kodak-chine at-lo Karat-tatak-emi-in.''

Literally:

:"Kuro-t'on-mik-in Mr. Pigeon, God ?-slep-t, wood fire-with stealing-was fire the.late Lech-to he, then he ?-fire-make-did fire-with Karat-tatak-emi-at."

Translated (by Portman):

: Mr. [[Pigeon]] stole a firebrand at Kuro-t'on-mika, while [[God]] was sleeping.  He gave the brand to the late Lech, who then made fires at Karat-tatak-emi.

In [[textual criticism]], an '''archetype''' is a text that originates a textual tradition. By using a [[Stemmatics|stemmatic]] approach, the textual critic tries to trace the oldest surviving manuscript and show the relationship it has to its ancestors. This makes it possible to compare changes made in different traditions branching off from the archetype, and develop an edition that reconstructs the text of the archetype as closely as possible.

An archetype should not be confused with the [[autograph]], which is the first handwritten manuscript by an author. The archetype is also commonly mistaken to be the original text, although many would argue that it is impossible to locate an original text&lt;ref&gt;Epp, Eldon Jay. "The Multivalence of the Term 'Original Text' in New Testament Textual Criticism." ''The Harvard Theological Review'', vol. 92, no. 3, 1999, pp. 245–281. {{JSTOR|1510127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; within a tradition where there may not be surviving evidence, and because the author and editors may have constructed several drafts and editions throughout the process, from the moment of birth of the author's idea until the publication of an edition of the work. On the other hand, an archetype could be the original, in the sense that it is not a copy, but the concrete surviving, unmodified text.

'''Ask the Rabbi''' is a term used in Jewish newspapers and on Jewish websites for [[responsa]], known as ''Shut'' (Hebrew: שו"ת, literally [[Question|Q]]&amp;[[Answer (response)|A]]), the traditional term for correspondence with [[rabbi]]s, usually on a [[Halacha|Halachic]] basis. This phrase is often used in casual conversation in Hebrew pop culture.

== Background and development ==

"Ask the Rabbi" is often used as an [[internet]] term for ''[[History of responsa in Judaism|responsa]]'': questions sent to rabbis and the answers received. The term became widespread on Jewish websites in the early 2000s.

==Responsa in Judaism==
{{main|History of responsa in Judaism}}

Jewish religious literature contains thousands of books of responsa also known as ''Shut'' in Hebrew, which started during the time of the [[Geonim]] and are popular to this day. The questions range over many topics, mostly about Jewish law ([[Halacha]]), but also requests for an explanation of a [[Talmud]]ic issue or Jewish thought. The answers may be short or long and very detailed. A large part from the correspondence is from rabbis, or from community leaders, sending an important question to a great rabbi. Naturally, the questions asked in the past did not demand an immediate and urgent answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=גליק|first=שמואל|title=אשנב לספרות השו"ת|year=תשע"ב–2012|publisher=בית המדרש לרבנים באמריקה}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the present time, due to the internet, communication is fast and knowledge can be made public, there are several websites that feature rabbis answering questions received through the web site, by [[Email]] or by [[SMS]]. The questions are answered within a few days or, for urgent questions, within a few hours. The majority of online questions come from the general public, Jewish and non-Jewish, and cover many topics. Many questioners use the anonymity of the Internet for intimate questions they are embarrassed to ask face to face. This way of answering is so popular, that some articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=הבר|first=חיים|title=Such as האם מותר לאכול קינואה בפסח|url=http://www.tapuz.co.il/blog/net/ViewEntry.aspx?entryId=971421&amp;skip=1|accessdate=14 March 2013|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are based on them.

== Comments and criticism ==

The option to ask questions about Judaism online was received enthusiastically by web users. However, there is some opposition to this phenomenon. The main criticism is around the replacement of old fashioned, face-to-face communication by a virtual medium and the "instant" answers received to the questions. Judaism teaches the importance of study and work in order to gain knowledge, and the ease of asking the Internet might promote laziness and degradation of the value of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rav Ariel|first=Yaakov|title=הרב אריאל על השו"ת האינטרנטי|url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/234366|accessdate=14 March 2013|newspaper=inn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional questions arise, such as whether to answer the specific questioner or to think about other users who will see the answer, whether to answer locally or in an extended way, and whether to answer certain questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=כנס רבני שאל את הרב|url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/234295|publisher=INN|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Baldev Singh was born in the village Chand Nawaan, in the [[Moga, Punjab]] district. He started his career as a teacher in the [[Muktsar]] area and spent some time in Himachal Pradesh as a teacher as well. Later he moved to [[Calcutta]] and worked as a truck cleaner, taxi driver and truck operator.

==Career==
Singh is known for his novels ''Sadaknaama'' and ''Laal Batti''. His novel ''Sadaknaama'' was a road narrative of truck drivers from Punjab. It started as a column in [[Amrita Pritam]]'s magazine ''Nagmani'' and was later published as a [[three-volume novel]]. The stories in the novel were based on Singh's real experiences. He himself was a truck driver for 10 years, while working as a teacher. The book became very popular in Punjabi literature and "Sadaknaama" became part of his name for his fans.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120122/spectrum/book7.htm | title=The Truth Behind The Fiction | publisher=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'' | date=22 January 2012 | accessdate=18 December 2013 | author=Singh, Nonika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His novel ''Laal Batti'' dealt with the [[red-light area]] of Kolkatta, for which he studied his subject for over a decade. It was also adapted into play by Manch Rang Manch, and directed by [[Kewal Dhaliwal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_11-3-2005_pg7_22 |title=Theatre lovers flock to Panj Pani festival on 4th day |publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|''Daily Times'' (Pakistan)]] |place=Lahore |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219012522/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_11-3-2005_pg7_22 |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel ''Annadaata'' was about plights of farmers in Punjab and is also part of the [[Punjabi literature]] curriculum in the [[Guru Nanak Dev University]] and [[Punjabi University]]. He plans to write sequels to both these books. His play ''Mitti Rudan Kare'' also remains popular.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

His latest work ''Dhahwan Dilli De Kingre'' was about the legendary rebel [[Dulla Bhatti]]. The novel won him a Sahitya Akademi Award for Punjabi in 2011.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">'''Barallete''' is a largely vanished [[argot]] which used to be employed by the traditional knife-sharpeners and [[umbrella]]-repairers (''afiadores e paragüeiros'') of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]]  province of [[Ourense (province)|Ourense]], in [[Spain]].  

It was based on the [[Galician language]] as spoken in Ourense, but its users substituted everyday words with invented ones of no linguistic connection, making it impossible for other people to understand it.

An example of Barallete is:
 
:''Habia que chusar anque oretee ou axa barruxo, porque facía falta zurro, que Sanqueico nono da de balde.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050821234656/http://usuarios.lycos.es/vacariza/cobacost3.html]

:"We had to work even if it rained or even if there was mud, because money was needed, and God does not provide it free".

The same sentence in standard Galician:

:''Había que traballar aín[da ]que chova ou haxa barro, porque facía falta diñeiro, que Deus non o dá de balde.''

Barallete is said to have arisen in the twelfth century, and many words and phrases from this argot have been published in various recent works of fiction and non-fiction.[http://www.almargen.com.ar/sitio/seccion/musica/pato/]

This article outlines the '''differences''' between [[Malaysian English]], Malaysian Colloquial English ([[Manglish]]) &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgY1CJTKH6gC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=manglish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C7L9TpjYGYSyrAeLzcT9Dw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=manglish&amp;f=false Lingua et Linguistica 1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[British English]], which for the purposes of this article is assumed to be the form of English spoken in south east England, used by the British Government, the [[BBC]] and widely understood in other parts of the [[United Kingdom]].

Malaysian English (MyE), formally known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE), is a form of English used and spoken in Malaysia as a second language. Malaysian English should not be confused with Malaysian Colloquial English, which is famously known as Manglish, a portmanteau of the word Malay and English, or Street English.

Manglish can be likened to an [[Pidgin|English-based pidgin]] language or a [[patois]] and it is usually barely understandable to most speakers of English outside Malaysia except in the case of Singapore where a similar colloquial form of English is spoken known as [[Singlish]]. Though very similar, Manglish today receives more Malay influences while Singlish more Chinese.

== Spelling ==
Despite being traditionally-based on British English, Malaysian English has, in recent decades, been strongly influenced by [[American English]]. This can be commonly seen in web-based media and documents produced within organisations.  When using computers, the writer is typically unaware of the differences between British and American English and uses the default settings on their software spell-checker. Most computer software in Malaysia, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]], come pre-set with American English as the default and these settings are seldom changed to British English, resulting in the proliferation of American English in many places of work, local universities and other places with heavy reliance on documents and content created by using computers. In schools and in the print media however, Malaysians revert to British English.

Manglish does not possess a standard written form, although many variations exist for transcribing certain words. For most purposes it is a spoken tongue.

In Malaysian education, written English is based on British English but most of the students speak in a local accent influenced by American pronunciations.

== Grammar ==

Much of Manglish grammatical structure is taken from [[varieties of Chinese]] and the [[Malay language]]. For example, the phrase "Why you so like that one?" means "Why are you behaving in that way" in standard English.  In [[Cantonese]], a similar phrase would be rendered as "Dímgáai néih gám ge?" or literally "Why you like that?"  The "one" in the sample phrase does not literally mean the numeral one, instead it is used more as a suffix device. It is also sometimes rendered as "wan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7GlcaOkztQUC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=manglish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C7L9TpjYGYSyrAeLzcT9Dw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=manglish&amp;f=false The Routledge concise history of Southeast Asian writing in English, By Rajeev Shridhar Patke, Philip Holden]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian English is taught.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOTcr9mrtEUC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;dq=manglish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C7L9TpjYGYSyrAeLzcT9Dw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=manglish&amp;f=false The Handbook of Business Discourse, By Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common characteristics are [[anastrophe]] and omission of certain prepositions and articles. For example, "I haven't seen you in a long time" becomes "Long time never seen you already".

== Vocabulary ==

=== Words only used in British English ===

To a large extent, standard Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely due to the country's colonisation by Britain beginning from the 18th century. But because of influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and movies, Malaysians are also usually familiar with many American English words. For instance, both lift/elevator and lorry/truck are understood, although the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases is the American English form more widespread, e.g. chips instead of crisps, fries instead of chips.

=== Words or phrases only used in Malaysian English ===

Malaysian English is gradually forming its own vocabulary, these words come from a variety of influences. Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not present in British or American English.

An optional suffix usually used to donate a question mark to yes, as in "yeah meh?" or "ye ke?" i.e. "Are you sure?", with the former being more commonly used amongst those of Chinese descent and the latter by Malays.
|No equivalent.
|-
|Mar

Mostly used as a suffix. Derived from Chinese. For example, a person would say "I didn't know mar"; which somewhat has the same meaning as "I didn't know la" but is softer than "la". When the person says "I didn't know mar", it indirectly states that the person is being apologetic about not knowing something.

|-
|Ar

An optional suffix usually used to donate a question mark, as in "Sure ar?" or "Are you sure ar?", i.e. "Are you sure?"
|No equivalent.
|-
|Lah/La

A popular suffix to phrases and sentences. Originates from both Malay and Chinese where its usage is grammatically correct, for instance, (Cantonese) "M hou gam yeung la" would literally mean "Don't be like that", except that there is an extra word at the end, "la". Another example: "cannot, lah", i.e."Sorry that's not possible." and "Rest some more-lah.", i.e. "Please rest for a while longer,"; It is important to note that the tone of which the prefix is spoken greatly affects the context of the statement. Example, saying "Okay -lah" while squinting one eye and hesitating the -lah, would be to give a mediocre opinion about something (as in "The food was okay-lah"). Meanwhile, to say a short increasing pitched -lah as in "Okay -lah. We'll all go to Ipoh later", would be to agree about something. "Lah" is also generally used to soften an otherwise angry/stern tone, such as: "Stop it lah" as opposed to just an abrupt "Stop it!", or "Don't be like that la" as opposed to "Don't be like that". It is usually perceived as less insulting when a "lah" is added in sentences such as those, and typically means that the person uttering the sentence is not angry, unless of course, it is said in a harsh tone.
|No equivalent.
|-
|Gostan
To reverse, especially in the context of driving motor vehicles. A contraction of the term "go astern" (Mostly used in states of [[Penang]] and [[Kedah]]).
|To reverse, to go backwards

== Pronunciation ==

{{main|Phonemic differentiation}}
In Malaysian English, the last syllable of a word is sometimes not pronounced with the strength that it would be in British English.

Also, p and f are sometimes pronounced somewhat similarly among speakers of Malay descent. For example, the two Malay names 'Fazlin' and 'Pazlin' may sound almost identical when spoken by Malays, whereas this confusion would not arise when spoken by a British Speaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">'''Constance Cox''' (''ca.'' 1881-1960) was a Canadian [[schoolteacher]] of part [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] ancestry who lived and taught with the [[Gitksan]] First Nation in northwestern [[British Columbia]] and served as [[interpreter]] for several anthropologists.

She was born to Thomas and Margaret Hankin in [[Hazelton, British Columbia|Hazelton, B.C.]], and was considered, despite her mixed ancestry, the [[first white child]] born in that community. She was baptised by [[William Ridley (bishop)|William Ridley]], Bishop of the [[Church of England]]'s Caledonia (northern B.C.) diocese. Her father, Thomas Hankin, sponsored a $3,000 (Cdn) [[potlatch]] feast to present the infant Constance to the large population of Gitksans who had come to live at Hazelton. Hankin, a former [[Hudson's Bay Company]] employee, had founded Hazelton on his English godmother's legacy, built a store there, and also provided founding investments in the cannery communities of [[Inverness, British Columbia|Inverness]], and [[Port Essington, British Columbia|Port Essington]], B.C. Margaret Hankin was Tlingit on her mother's side, while her father was an HBC employee. Margaret spoke seven different First Nations languages and passed much of this profiency on to Constance. (Later, Margaret remarried, to Captain [[R. E. Loring]], Indian Agent at Hazelton.)

While serving as Hazelton police interpreter in the trial of three Gitksans arrested in a near-battle between settler miners and Gitksans at Hazelton, Constance met a telegraphist named Eddie R. Cox, whom she married.

Starting in the 1920s, she served as interpreter and sometimes informant during some of the anthropologist [[Marius Barbeau]]'s fieldwork among the Gitksan. (Some of Barbeau's use of her and her mother's ethnographic and historical information in print led to a recriminatory letter from Cox.)  Barbeau eventually began to rely more on the Tsimshian chief [[William Beynon]]'s services as interpreter in his Gitksan work.

In 1958, Mrs. Cox served as interpreter when the anthropologists [[Wilson Duff]] and [[Michael Kew]] brokered an agreement with the nearby Gitksan community of [[Kitwancoo]]l (a.k.a. [[Gitanyow]]), arranging for some of the village's totem poles to be removed to the [[Royal British Columbia Museum]] for preservation. She also served as interpreter in creating the monograph by Duff that resulted.

She eventually moved to North Vancouver, B.C., with her husband when his employer transferred him there.

'''Dariush Shayegan''' ({{lang-fa|داریوش شایگان}}; 2 February 1935 – 22 March 2018) was an Iranian philosopher and [[cultural theorist]].

== Life and career==
He was born in Tabriz from an Iranian father and a Georgian mother.{{citation needed||date=March 2018}} Shayegan studied at [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]]. He was a Professor of [[Sanskrit]] and [[India]]n religions at [[Tehran University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/mehrzad-boroujerdi-iranian-intellectuals-and-the-west-the-tormented-triumph-of-nativism-syracuse-ny-syracuse-university-press-1996-pp-256/ED7DA92867130561C84F5CE1156CEC93|title=MEHRZAD BOROUJERDI, Iranian Intellectuals and the West: The Tormented Triumph of Nativism (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1996).

Besides [[Persian language|Persian]], Shayegan spoke and wrote in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]].{{citation needed||date=March 2018}}According to [[Dariush Borbor]], the well known architect, urban planner and contemporary, Shayegan's formative years were in Geneva&lt;ref&gt;داریوش بوربور از هفتاد سال خاطراتش با داریوش شایگان می‌گوید؛ ژنو، شهری که شایگان در آن دوباره متولد شد»، خبرگزاری ایلنا، 2/13/ 2018 http://www.ilna.ir/بخش-فرهنگ-هنر-6/592847-ژنو-شهری-که-شایگان-در-آن-دوباره-متولد-.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
He wrote a novel "Land of Mirage" in [[French language|French]] which won the [[ADELF]] award presented by the [[Association of French Authors]] on December 26, 2004. Among Iranians who won the ADELF award prior to him [[Ahmad Kamyabi Mask]] and [[Javad Hadidi]] are notable. According to the Persian daily ''Aftab'', Shayegan is well known in France for his books in the field of philosophy and mysticism.{{citation needed||date=March 2018}}

Shayegan, who studied with [[Henry Corbin]] in Paris, also has many pioneering works on Persian mysticism and mystic poetry. He was a founding director of the Iranian Center for the Studies of Civilizations. In 1977, Shayegan initiated an international symposium on the "dialogue between civilizations," a concept that has been selectively appropriated by the former Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]]. In 2009 Shayegan was awarded the inaugural [[Global Dialogue Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldialogueprize.org|title=www.globaldialogueprize.org|website=www.globaldialogueprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international award for "outstanding achievements in the advancement and application of intercultural value research", in recognition of his dialogical conception of cultural subjectivity (for a statement of the award committee and a scholarly presentation (including a fairly complete bibliography) of Shayegan's contribution to intercultural dialogue, see the (copyrighted) webpages of this award.)

== Death ==
Shayegan died on 22 March 2018, at the age of 83 in Tehran.&lt;ref name="mehrnews4256732"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mehrnews.com/news/4256732/داریوش-شایگان-درگذشت |title=داریوش شایگان درگذشت |date=March 22, 2018 |website=[[Mehr News Agency]] |language=Persian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322062555/https://www.mehrnews.com/news/4256732/داریوش-شایگان-درگذشت |archive-date=March 22, 2018 |access-date=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dexiothetism''' refers to a reorganisation of a [[clade]]'s [[bauplan]], with right becoming [[ventral]] and left becoming [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]]. The organism would then recruit a new left hand side.

==Details==
If a [[Bilaterian|bilaterially symmetrical ancestor]] were to become affixed by its right hand side, it would occlude all features on that side. When that organism wanted to become secondarily bilaterally symmetrical again, it would be forced to resculpt its new left and right hand sides from the old left hand side. The end result is a bilaterially symmetrical animal, but with its dorsoventral axis rotated a quarter of a turn.&lt;ref name='gee'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gee | first1 = Henry | authorlink1 = Henry Gee | title = Before the backbone: views on the origin of the vertebrates | chapter = Jefferies' Calcichordate Theory | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | date = 1996 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Dexiothetism has been implicated in the origin of the unusual embryology of the [[cephalochordate]] [[amphioxus]], whereby its gill slits originate on the left hand side and the migrate to the right hand side.

In [[Dick Jefferies|Jefferies]]' [[Calcichordate Theory]], he supposes that all [[chordate]]s and their [[mitrate]] ancestors are dexiothetic.

'''Digital Data Systems''', or '''DDS''', was a leading solutions provider and consultancy firm specializing in [[operations support systems]] (OSS) and [[business support system]]s (BSS) in the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) and carrier marketplace within the telecommunications industry. DDS was an independent provider of OSS and BSS during a time when such systems were provided by the large telecommunications switch vendors. It completed in OSS / BSS head-to-head against AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom (now Nortel Networks), and others in providing services that sold and deployed amongst the [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]], including: [[Bell Atlantic]], [[Southwestern Bell]], and [[Pacific Telesis]]. It had a hardware joint venture with [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS Computer Systems]] who provided the hardware platform upon which it ran. The business was acquired by [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) in 1992.

==Products and Services==
In addition to consulting services, the Company had two products: MATCH and DETECT.

===MATCH===
The Match product provided automated systems for telephone companies in [[Operations, administration and management]] (OA&amp;M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&amp;T 1AESS switches to newer digital switches, such as [[Northern Telecom]]'s [[DMS-100]] or [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[5ESS]] switches. The MATCH was composed of three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the [[AT&amp;T]] [[1AESS]], 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including [[COSMOS (telecommunications)|COSMOS]] and [[TIRKS]].  Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal [[database management system]], which was configurable based on job and customer preferences. The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system in line with the source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&amp;T 5AESS recent change messages and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new switching platform.

===DETECT===
The DETECT product utilized the Decoding and Matching modules of the MATCH product and brought in data records from [[RBOC]] [[telecommunications billing]] systems. Given the manual nature of service provisioning through the [[Recent change memory administration center|RCMAC]] at the time, many services were provisioned-but-unbilled by [[RBOC]]s. DETECT would identify provisioned-but-unbilled services and optionally generate the necessary machine instructions to recapture leaking revenue. The DETECT product detected over multi-million in revenue leakage often found in large centrex groups of multinational corporations.

In [[BDSM]], '''edgeplay''' is a subjective term for activity (sexual or mentally manipulative) that may challenge the conventional S.S.C. ([[safe, sane and consensual]]) scheme; if one is aware of the risks and consequences and is willing to accept them, then the activity is considered RACK ([[risk-aware consensual kink]]).

Edgeplay may involve the consequences of potential short- or long-term harm or death, exemplified by activities such as breathplay ([[erotic asphyxiation]]), [[fire play]], [[knife play]], and gunplay, as well as the potential increased risk of disease [[Seroconversion|seroconverting]] when the risk of bodily fluid exchange is present, such as with [[cutting]], [[bloodplay]], or [[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]].

The mindset of those involved constitutes what is edgeplay because knowledge of or experience with the activity or partner(s) may dictate what and to what extent they will act. The propriety for more dangerous or taboo-themed activities varies by individual, due to differences in moralities as well as trust between participants and experience. The only consistent rule is that activities must not be coercive, deceitful, or injurious without prior agreement or knowledge. This does exclude how others may react to the outcome(s) of the activity if they go beyond what can be handled by the partners.

In the mid-1990s, the [[Living in Leather]] convention did not have panels on [[ageplay]] or [[Coprophilia|scat]] because, at the time, they were considered too extreme for consensual activity. By 2000, some considered them to be within the scope of edgeplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9371008/2/Breaking-Blood-on-Alabaster Breaking Blood on Alabaster], written by [https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2669092/Chanse-Lowell Chanse Lowell].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4644">'''Eric Heinz Lenneberg''' (19 September 1921 – 31 May 1975) was a [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[neurologist]] who pioneered ideas on [[language acquisition]] and [[cognitive psychology]], particularly in terms of the concept of innateness.
He was born in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany. Ethnically [[Jew]]ish, he left [[Nazi Germany]] because of rising [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[persecution]]. He initially fled to Brazil with his family and then to the United States where he attended the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Harvard University]]. A professor of [[psychology]] and [[neurobiology]], he taught at the [[Harvard Medical School]], the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor and [[Cornell University]] and Medical School.

Lenneberg's 1964 paper "The Capacity of Language Acquisition," originally published in 1960, sets forth seminal arguments about the human-specific biological capacity for language, which were then being developed in his research and discussions with [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and others at [[Harvard]] and [[MIT]], and popularized by [[Steven Pinker]] in his book, ''[[The Language Instinct]]''. He presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities, parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits:

* Universal appearance of a trait at a single time across a species. "Species typical" traits.
* Universal appearance across time for a group. Not just an artifact of cultural history. Again, "species typical" diagnostic feature.
* No learning of the trait is possible.
* Individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.

In his publication ''Biological Foundations of Language'' he advanced the [[hypothesis]] of a [[critical period]] for language development; a topic which remains controversial and the subject of debate. Lenneberg's biological approach to language was related to developments such as the [[motor theory of speech perception]] developed by [[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues at [[Haskins Laboratories]] and also provided historical antecedents to issues now emerging in [[embodied philosophy]] and [[embodied cognitive science|embodied cognition]].

Lenneberg reargued extensively against the psychological implications of the work of [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], specifically in regards to the [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis|idea that language influences thought]].&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, Stacy. (2001). ''Language and Thought: Examining Linguistic Relativity''&lt;/ref&gt; Lenneberg's argument against this notion was that 'linguistic and non-linguistic events must be separately observed and described before they can be correlated.'&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, John (ed.) 1956. ''Language, Thought and Reality: Selected writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Lenneberg was quite involved in the scientific community, as he was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], Sigma Xi, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Psychological Association, the Society for Research in Child Development, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, U., Tapper, D., Gibson,E.J.

==Education==
He attended primary school in Düsseldorf, Germany until 1933, when he moved to Brazil. In 1949, he received a B.A. from the University of Chicago. Lenneberg then went on to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology and Linguistics from Harvard in 1956.

'''GNOME Dictionary''', also called '''gnome-dictionary''', is a [[DICT client]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] by Emmanuele Bassi and others. It is part of the [[free software]] [[GNOME]] desktop suite. It allows users to look up words in various dictionary sources.

gnome-dictionary was at first an independent [[DICT]] protocol client called '''gdict''', created by Bradford Hovinen, Spiros Papadimitriou and Mike Hughes;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-dictionary/log/ gdict ChangeLog]&lt;/ref&gt; it was included inside the gnome-utils meta-package during the 1.x release cycle.  As a companion to the original application was also added an [[applet]] for [[gnome-panel]].

After the 2.0 release of GNOME, due to lack of direct maintainership, the code base of gdict passed the point of being maintainable.  In October 2005, the current maintainer of gnome-dictionary Emmanuele Bassi decided to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] the application and applet from scratch, removing the old (and mostly deprecated) code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-utils-list/2005-October/msg00004.html Email on the gnome-utils mailing list about the re-design]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new gnome-dictionary was added to GNOME during the 2.13 development cycle and became part of the 2.14 GNOME release.  It supports multiple dictionary sources, printing the definitions found and saving them to a text file, and has a simpler user interface. The logic of the application and the applet has been moved inside its own [[Library (computer science)|shared library]] called libgdict which can be used by third party applications. As of July 2006 the development version of gnome-dictionary became feature equivalent to the pre-2.14 release,&lt;ref&gt;[http://log.emmanuelebassi.net/archives/2006/07/rainbows-and-pots-of-gold/ Announce on Emmanuele Bassi's blog about the speller widget]&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of the list of similar words found (also known as ''speller'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">'''Gedaliah Bublick''' (1875—1948) was a  [[Yiddish]] [[writer]] and [[Zionist]] leader.

==Biography==
Gedaliah Bublick was  born in [[Grodno]], [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Belarus]]), the son of Aaron Bublick. He was raised in [[Białystok]] where he remained until 1900. He obtained a traditional Jewish education at the [[Łomża]] [[Yeshiva]] in Poland and later at the famous [[Mir yeshiva (Belarus)|Mir Yeshiva]] in [[Lithuania]].

In 1900, Bublick went to Paris to help a group of Białystok families trying to gain entry to [[Argentina]] under the [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron de Hirsch Fund]]. After obtaining the appropriate visas, Bublick joined the group for three years as a [[Hebrew]] teacher for their children.

In 1904 Bublick left Argentina for the United States where he began working for the [[New York City|New York]] Orthodox Yiddish newspaper, ''Yiddishe Tageblatt'' (The Jewish Daily Page). He was a vociferous opponent of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]]. In 1915, he was appointed editor-in-chief of the ''Yiddishe Tageblatt''.

As a young man, Bublick drifted away from traditional Jewish life for the [[Haskalah]] (Enlightenment) Movement, but eventually returned to religion and became a staunch advocate for [[Orthodox Judaism]]. In his book ''Min Hametzar'', he predicted massive intermarriage and detected danger in the Conservative movement. He wrote "It's a battle between Harvard and [[Volozhin yeshiva|Volozhin]]."

A street in the [[Ramot]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] is named for Bublick.

==Zionist activism==
In 1920, Bublick visited Palestine for the first time. Bublick was active in the Jewish community and was one of the founders of the [[American Jewish Congress]]. He was elected as a vice-chairman of the American Jewish Congress in May 1920. He served on the executive board of the [[World Zionist Organization]] (1919-1926) and the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]. He was a well-known publicist for religious Zionism and was one of the founders of the American [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] and served as its president from 1928 to 1932. He traveled to Palestine on many occasions to support Jewish settlement. In 1925, he attended the opening ceremonies of the [[Hebrew University]] as the representative of the [[Keren Hayesod|Keren Ha-Yesod]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24586">{{Esperanto sidebar |expanded=Criticism}}
Gender asymmetry is one of the aspects of the constructed language [[Esperanto]] that is most frequently targeted for criticism.{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} There are numerous proposals to regularize both grammatical and lexical gender. Although the language is unable to change. 

In the text below, when a proposed word or usage is not grammatically correct according to the standard rules of Esperanto grammar, it will be marked with an asterisk.

== Gender in Esperanto ==
{{Main article|Esperanto vocabulary#Gender}}
Esperanto does not have [[grammatical gender]] other than in the two personal pronouns ''li'' "he" and ''ŝi'' "she". Nevertheless, gender is often a fuzzy issue. In practical usage words formed with the suffix ''-ul'' "person" are ambiguous, sometimes used with a masculine meaning in the singular, but generally neutral in the plural. However, concepts of gender have changed over time, and many words that were once considered masculine are now neutral, especially words related to professions and animals. In older texts it is only context that disambiguates. For example, in the saying ''al feliĉulo eĉ koko donas ovojn'' "to a happy man, even a ''koko'' gives eggs" (Zamenhof), the word ''koko'' means "rooster", not "chicken".&lt;ref&gt;Kalocsay &amp; Waringhien, ''Plena analiza gramatiko'' (1985:61)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be confusing to those who are not familiar with that saying, as the word ''koko'' has become more neutral over time.

In modern usage, most noun roots are lexically neutral, a couple of dozen are lexically masculine, and a smaller number lexically feminine. Most masculine roots may be made feminine through the addition of the suffix ''-ino,'' and made to describe a group of both males and females with the addition of ''ge-.'' For example, ''patro'' means "father", ''patrino'' "mother", and ''gepatroj'' "parents", but ''gepatroj'' cannot be used in the singular ''*gepatro'' for "parent". For these gendered words there is no easy way to make the singular neutral equivalent. Often there is a separate root that acts like this, for example ''knabo'' "boy" → ''infano'' "child"; ''filo'' "son" → ''ido'' "offspring", etc. Some neutral counterparts can be made with word-building. The meaning of "parent" can be achieved with either ''gener-into'' "[[wikt:genitor|genitor]]", or ''ge-patr-ano'' "member of the parents". However, it is more common to simply say ''unu el la gepatroj'' "one of the parents" or ''patro aŭ patrino'' "father or mother".

The most common roots that are masculine unless specifically marked as feminine are:
*Kin terms: [[Wiktionary:avo|avo]] "grandfather", [[Wiktionary:edzo|edzo]] "husband", [[Wiktionary:fianĉo|fianĉo]] "fiancé", [[Wiktionary:filo|filo]] "son", [[Wiktionary:frato|frato]] "brother", [[Wiktionary:nepo|nepo]] "grandson", [[Wiktionary:nevo|nevo]] "nephew", [[Wiktionary:onklo|onklo]] "uncle", [[Wiktionary:patro|patro]] "father", [[Wiktionary:vidvo|vidvo]] "widower", [[Wiktionary:kuzo|kuzo]] "(male) cousin"

Gender-neutral roots such as ''leono'' "lion" and ''kelnero'' "waiter" may be made feminine with a grammatical suffix ''(leonino'' "lioness", ''kelnerino'' "waitress"), but there is no comparable way to derive the masculine; there was not even originally a word for "male".&lt;ref name=PAG32&gt;''Plena analiza gramatiko,'' §&amp;nbsp;32(A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&amp;aid=100091&amp;teil=0412&amp;seite=00000012&amp;zoom=1 |title=Önb-Anno-Buch |publisher=Anno.onb.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&amp;aid=100078&amp;teil=0203&amp;seite=00000050&amp;zoom=1 |title=Önb-Anno-Buch |publisher=Anno.onb.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-buch?apm=0&amp;aid=100086&amp;teil=0303&amp;seite=00000021&amp;zoom=1&amp;ues=1 |title=Önb-Anno-Buch |publisher=Anno.onb.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words without a feminine suffix may take a masculine reading, especially in the case of people and domestic animals; ''koko,'' for example, means "chicken", but is read as masculine in ''koko kaj kokino'' "rooster and hen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bertilo Wennergren |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/o-vortoj/seksa_signifo.html |title=PMEG : Seksa signifo de O-vortoj |publisher=Bertilow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zamenhof used the nominal root ''vir'' "man, human male" to make words for animals masculine.

Moreover, the prefix ''vir-'' is idiomatic, as ''virbovo'' (man-bovine) could still mean either "bull" or "minotaur/cherub"; it is only by convention that it is generally understood to mean "bull", and writers have coined words such as ''taŭro'' "bull" to bypass the issue.&lt;ref name=PAG32 /&gt;

== Common elements to regularizing Esperanto gender ==
Critics such as Dale Spender and Veronica Zundel feel that deriving feminine from masculine words causes women to be either "linguistically excluded… or else named negatively", while others are bothered by the lack of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3kBtZ5WdrI8C&amp;pg=PA21|title = Women Have a Word for It|last = Zundel|first = Veronica|journal = [[Third Way (magazine)|Third Way]]|accessdate = 13 August 2014|date = May 1988|publisher = Third Way Ltd|issue = 5|volume = 11|issn = 0309-3492|editor-last = Dean|editor-first = Tim|pages = 21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = [[Man Made Language]]|last = Spender|first = Dale|publisher = Pandora|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-86358-401-5|pages = 21–22|authorlink = Dale Spender|origyear = 1980, Indiana University|edition = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such sentiments have sparked numerous attempts at reform, none of which have been accepted by the [[Akademio de Esperanto]].&lt;ref name="PMEGafiks" /&gt;

Reforms tend to address a few key areas:
*A masculine suffix, parallel to the feminine ''-ino''
*An [[Wiktionary:epicene|epicene]] affix
*An epicene pronoun (like s/he or singular "they" in English)

Three specific proposals surface repeatedly, as they derive from the existing resources of the language. These are the masculine suffix ''*-iĉo,'' workarounds and expanded uses of the epicene prefix ''ge-,'' and the epicene pronoun ''*ŝli.''

=== Masculine suffixes ===
Perhaps the earliest proposal for a masculine grammatical suffix was ''*-uno.'' ''*-Olo'' is also occasionally seen. However, the most popular today is ''*-iĉo.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bertilo Wennergren |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/vortfarado/neoficialaj_afiksoj/sufiksoj/ich.html |title=Pmeg : Iĉ |publisher=Bertilow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''*-Uno'' was created through [[ablaut]] of ''-ino.'' It is, in fact, the only such possibility, as ''-ano, -eno,'' and ''-ono'' already exist. Similarly, ''*-olo'' was created through ablaut of ''-ulo'' "person". ''*-Iĉo'' was created by analogy with the pet-name suffix ''-ĉjo,'' the only masculine suffix in the language, so that the pet names and general gender suffixes are symmetrical:

{|class=wikitable
|-
! !!Endearment!!Gender
|-
!Feminine
|''-njo''||''-ino''
|-
!Masculine
|''-ĉjo''||''*-iĉo''
|}

An element common to all such proposals is that the gender-changing nouns are to be reanalyzed as gender neutral when they occur without a gender suffix, as the names of professions and nationalities, such as ''policano'' "policeman" → "police officer" and ''anglo'' "Englishman" → "English person", did in the mid twentieth century. This doesn't affect all words: Nouns that never changed gender to begin with, such as ''taŭro'' "bull", do not take gender suffixes in these reforms either. The resulting paradigms are as follows:

{|class=wikitable
! !!Standard!!Un-proposal!!Iĉ-proposal!!Transl.!!Endearment
|-
!Neutral
|''gepatroj'' (plural only)||''*patro''||''*patro''||"parent"|| —
|-
!Feminine
|''patrino''||''patrino''||''patrino''||"mother"||''panjo'' "mama"
|-
!Masculine
|''patro''||''*patruno''||''*patriĉo''||"father"||''paĉjo'' "papa"
|}

The most common objection to the ''*-iĉo'' proposal is the very analysis of words such as "patro" as gender neutral. The reason behind the objection is that the specifically masculine words are defined as such in the Fundamento, and it is felt that reanalyzing them as gender neutral violates the Fundamento. One proposed solution to this problem is to introduce new root words for the gender neutral concepts: parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, etc. As an example, the hypothetical root word *tevo (parent) could then accept both ''*-iĉo'' to denote ''father'' and ''-ino'' to denote ''mother''.

Though none of these are widespread, ''*-iĉo'' has appeared in books published by [[Jorge Camacho (writer)|Jorge Camacho]] and Luiz Portella.

Proponents of one proposal often claim that a competing proposal is confusing because it resembles an existing suffix, for example that ''*patriĉo'' "father" resembles&lt;!-- the lack of an * implies that it's standard--&gt; pejorative ''patraĉo'' "a bad father", or that ''*patruno'' "father" resembles ''patrino'' "mother", but there does not seem to be a problem in actual use: With the word stress on the suffix vowel, ''-iĉo/-aĉo'' and ''-uno/-ino'' are as distinct as many other pairs of Esperanto suffixes, such as ''-ilo/-ulo.'' One specific objection to the ''-iĉo'' proposal is that ''*nepiĉo'' "grandson" is homophonous with ''ne piĉo'',&lt;!--the only thing the article should talk about is its focus, in this case the objection is to the slang meaning--&gt; ''piĉo'' being Esperanto slang for "pussy";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reta-vortaro.de/revo/art/picx.html|title=Reta Vortaro [piĉ/o]|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esperanto-panorama.net/vortaro/eoen.htm |title=Esperanto – English Dictionary |publisher=Esperanto-panorama.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, ''uno'' would mean not just "a male" but also "the [[United Nations|UN]]".

=== Epicene prefixes ===
Various epicene affixes have also been proposed. They may be proposed ''instead of'' a masculine suffix—that is, gender derivation remains as in standard Esperanto, but the language gains a simple way of saying "a parent"—or ''in addition to'' a masculine suffix, often to avoid confusion between people speaking reformed and standard Esperanto. The only such affix commonly seen is the prefix ''ge-''. In standard Esperanto, ''ge-'' means both sexes together, and is normally only seen in the plural.&lt;!--the further details hurt the flow of the article, "normally" this case implies that there are exceptions; it would say "only" if not--&gt; In conversation, however, singular ''ge-'' is not uncommonly extended to meanings such as ''*gepatro'' "a parent" when a speaker either doesn't know or doesn't wish to reveal the gender of the noun. Many gender-reform proposals would make such usage official.

{|class=wikitable
|+Epicene ''ge-''
|-
! !! Without&lt;br /&gt;masculine !! With&lt;br /&gt;masculine!!
|-
!Neutral
|''*gepatro''||''*gepatro''||"parent"
|-
!Feminine
|''patrino''||'' ''||"mother"
|-
!Masculine
|''patro''||''*patriĉo''||"father"
|}

People who use ''*patriĉo'' for "father" may avoid the unaffixed noun ''patro'' "*parent" altogether as ambiguous, or may use it and switch to ''*gepatro'' only when they need to disambiguate.

=== Treatment of gendered words ===
Many of these proposals propose that all gender-changing words such as ''patro'' become neutral once a masculine suffix is in use, with the only remaining gendered words being those such as ''taŭro'' and ''damo'' that never changed gender to begin with. However, since ''viro'' has numerous masculine uses, and there are already dedicated words for the neutral and feminine equivalents (''adolto'' "adult" or ''plenkreskulo'' "grownup", and ''femino'' "woman"&lt;ref&gt;Included in recent editions of the ''Plena Ilustrita Vortaro.'' ''Femino'' is occasionally [[back-formation|back-formed]] to ''femo.''&lt;/ref&gt;), ''viro'' is also commonly retained as a masculine root.

The word ''eŭnuko'' "eunuch" has through [[back-formation]] given rise to the suffix ''*-uko'' for castrated people or animals, creating forms such as ''*bovuko'' "steer", from ''bovo'' "cattle", to replace ''okso'' "steer", though ''eks-'' "ex-" is sometimes seen in this context: ''eksvirkato'' "castrated cat" (lit. "ex-male-cat") vs. ''*katuko''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bertilo Wennergren |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/vortfarado/neoficialaj_afiksoj/sufiksoj/uk.html |title=Pmeg : Uk |publisher=Bertilow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender-neutral pronouns ==
{{Main article|Esperanto grammar#Pronouns}}
As in English, Esperanto has a personal pronoun for "he", ''li,'' and "she", ''ŝi''. Paraphrasing ''li aŭ ŝi'' "he or she" to avoid mentioning gender is, as in English, considered awkward, and is avoided in conversation and literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bodine|first=Ann|title=Androcentrism in prescriptive grammar: singular ‘they’, sex-indefinite ‘he’, and ‘he or she’.|journal=Language in Society|year=1975|volume=4|issue=2|pages=129–146|doi=10.1017/s0047404500004607}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 18, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are two general approaches to resolving this issue: modifying an existing pronoun, and creating a new pronoun.

=== Extending the range of an existing pronoun ===
The existing third-person pronouns are ''li'' "he" (the pronoun generally used when gender is not known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bertilo Wennergren |url=http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/pronomoj/tria.html |title=PMEG : Tria persono |publisher=Bertilow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''ŝi'' "she", ''ĝi'' "it", ''ili'' "they", ''oni'' "one", ''si'' (reflexive), ''tiu'' "that one".



''Ĝi'' is used principally with animals and objects. [[Zamenhof]] also prescribed it to be the epicene pronoun for use when the sex of an individual is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, Aŭgusto&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his writing it is only used for children:
:''La infano ploras, ĉar '''ĝi''' volas manĝi'' "the child is crying, because it wants to eat".
The idea that ''ĝi'' cannot be used for people in general is due to interference from English - other languages use neuter pronouns for people (e.g. o in Turkish, hän in Finnish). Uralic and Turkic languages do not have gender and use the same gender neutral pronoun for "he", "she", "it" of English. In Zamenhof's day it was customary to specify gender whenever it was known &lt;!-- this is about Esperanto, the European languages should not be mentioned unless a connection can be draw--&gt;. A shift from ''li'' and ''ŝi'' to ''ĝi'' would thus be a stylistic extension similar to the ongoing shift from copula-plus-adjective to verb (such as ''bluas'' for ''estas blua),'' and nothing so radical as the creation of a new pronoun would be required.

However, when gender becomes a problem it is much more common for people to use the demonstrative adjective and pronoun ''tiu'' (that one) as a work-around. Unfortunately, this remedy is not always available. For example, in the sentence,
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke '''li''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''he''' is hungry",
the pronoun ''li'' cannot easily be replaced with ''tiu,'' as that would normally be understood to refer to someone other than the person speaking:
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke *'''tiu''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''that person''' is hungry".
Similar problems of confusion arise with trying to use ''oni'' "one" in such situations:
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke *'''oni''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''one''' is hungry".
This could be used to express deference or other forms of indirectness, but would not be understood to refer to the person who made the statement.

It would be possible to extend the use of [[reflexive pronoun]] ''si,'' which officially cannot occur in subject position, to that of a [[wiktionary:logophor|logophoric pronoun]]:
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke *'''si''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''himself/herself''' is hungry".
Although not a full solution, as ''si'' refers to a previously mentioned person, this could be used in combination with ''tiu'' to introduce a subject. It also has the advantage of clarifying the sentence, since it is ambiguous in standard Esperanto whether ''li'' "he" refers to the someone who is speaking, or someone else. However, logophoric pronouns are alien to European languages, and this solution is rare.

Due to English influence, singular "they" has been reported{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}:
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke *'''ili''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''they''' are hungry".

However this causes problems regarding Esperanto’s noun agreements and is not readily accepted by people of other language backgrounds.

A proposal which is totally consistent with regular grammar is to hyphenate ''li'' (''he'') and ''ŝi'' (''she'') to ''li-ŝi'' (or ''ŝi-li''), similar to some other constructs in Esperanto, such as ''pli-malpli'' (''more or less'').

Finally, the epicene sense of ''li'' can be made explicit with singular ''ge-,'' though pronouns do not normally take any affixes apart from grammatical inflections:
:''Iu ĵus diris, ke *'''geli''' malsatas'' "Someone just said that '''(s)he''' is hungry".

=== New pronouns ===
Existing Esperanto personal pronouns end in ''i'', and only four proposals for a new pronoun are at all common: ''gi'', ''hi'', ''ri'', and the blend ''ŝli.''

''Gi'' is a popular proposal because it is iconic: in writing, it resembles ''ĝi,'' which it also resembles in meaning, and it is similar to the occasionally epicene prefix ''ge-.'' This makes it readily recognizable. Also along these lines is the use of the epicene prefix itself, ''geli.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esperanten.wordpress.com/2007/10/18/16/ |title=Ĉu vi geli-as? &amp;#124; Esperanten |publisher=Esperanten.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making ''li'' the epicene pronoun is also a common approach, as it is transparently related to the epicene plural ''ili'' "they". Such approaches then diverge in how to treat the masculine. Gender may simply be abandoned, reducing the inventory to ''li'' "s/he" and ''ili'' "they", or a new masculine pronoun may be created. One proposal is ''hi'' "he", so that the gendered pronouns ''hi'' and ''ŝi'' both derive from English.

A variant of this that was popular for a time in online newsgroups, called ''[[:eo:riismo|riism]],'' modifies ''li'' slightly to ''ri'' as a signal that the speaker is using gender-neutral pronouns, but then in order to avoid confusion eliminates ''li'' and ''ŝi'' completely, so that the inventory becomes ''ri'' "s/he" and ''ili'' "they". The riist "manifesto" also adopts the masculine suffix ''*-iĉo'' and the occasional epicene use of ''ge-'' to avoid any resulting confusion. Critics{{Who|date=June 2009}} maintain that it is important to retain the option of gendered pronouns, if for no other reason than the translation of much of the world's literature; and that in actual rather than theoretical use, ''*ri'' as a pronoun would cause chronic confusion with the many verbs that begin with ''ri-,'' such as ''ri gardas'' "s/he keeps" vs ''rigardas'' "looks", ''ri petas'' "s/he asks" vs ''ripetas'' "repeats", ''etc.''

Breaking with the single consonant-''i'' form of the pronouns, but instantly recognizable to most Esperantists, is another proposal, ''ŝli.'' This is just the reading pronunciation of the abbreviation ''ŝ/li,'' the equivalent of English "s/he", and is frequently seen in informal writing.

=== Gender in plural pronouns ===
In addition to removing gender from the singular pronouns, proposals have also been made to add gender to the plural in order to better translate material (such as the Bible) that was written in a language that has plural gender.

Due to the symmetry between ''li'' "he" and ''ili'' "they", the obvious choice is to make ''ili'' masculine and to create an analogous feminine form, *''iŝi.'' This was proposed by [[Kálmán Kalocsay]] and [[Gaston Waringhien]] in the 3rd edition of their ''Plena Gramatiko de Esperanto'' (pp 72–73, note 1). They cited the biblical passage Matthew 28:10-11:

:''Tiam Jesuo diris al '''ili''' ({{sm|la virinoj}}): Ne timu; iru, diru al miaj fratoj, ke '''ili''' foriru en Galileon, kaj tie '''ili''' min vidos. Kaj dum '''ili''' iris...''
:"Then Jesus said to them [the women], “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. '''They''' will see me there.” While '''they''' were going, ..."

It is obvious from context that "They will see me there" refers to the brothers. However, the identity of the "they" in "While they were going" is completely opaque. Kalocsay and Waringhien proposed the following solution:

:''Tiam Jesuo diris al *'''iŝi''': Ne timu, iru, diru al miaj fratoj, ke '''ili''' foriru en Galileon, kaj tie '''ili''' min vidos. Kaj dum *'''iŝi''' iris..."

'''Ishi''' (c. 1861 &amp;ndash; March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Yana people#Yahi|Yahi people]] from the present-day state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the [[Yana people|Yana]]) were killed in the [[California genocide]] in the 19th century. Ishi, who was widely acclaimed as the "last wild Indian" in America, lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he emerged near the foothills of [[Lassen Peak]] in [[Northern California]].

''Ishi'', which means "man" in the [[Yana language]], is an adopted name. The [[anthropologist]] [[Alfred Kroeber]] gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISHI: A Real-Life The Last Of The Mohicans|url=https://www.mohicanpress.com/mo08019.html|website=ISHI: A Real-Life The Last Of The Mohicans|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked his name, he said: "I have none, because there were no people to name me," meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name on his behalf.

Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who both studied him and hired him as a research assistant. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in [[San Francisco]].

===Early life===

[[File:Ishiquiver.jpg|thumb|upright|Ishi's quiver of arrows (Richard Burrill, 2011).]]
In 1865,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=21391|title=Butte|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ishi and his family were attacked in the [[California Indian Wars|Three Knolls Massacre]], in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was popularly believed to be extinct.&lt;ref name="mpress_ishi" /&gt; Prior to the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1848–1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997.&lt;ref name="UCSF"&gt;Rockafellar, Nancy (date unknown). "The story of Ishi: A Chronology". Retrieved on 2011-01-14 from https://history.library.ucsf.edu/ishi.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining damaged water supplies and killed fish; the deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://biography.yourdictionary.com/ishi Ishi Biography]"&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of [[Redding Rancheria]]) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, leading to the latter setting bounties on the natives. Prices included 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

Richard Burrill wrote, in ''Ishi Rediscovered'': 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In 1865, near the Yahi’s special place, Black Rock, the waters of Mill Creek turned red at the Three Knolls Massacre. 'Sixteen' or 'seventeen' Indian fighters killed about forty Yahi, as part of a retaliatory attack for two white women and a man killed at the Workman’s household on Lower Concow Creek near Oroville. Eleven of the Indian fighters that day were Robert A. Anderson, Hiram Good, Sim Moak, Hardy Thomasson, Jack Houser, Henry Curtis, his brother Frank Curtis, as well as Tom Gore, Bill Matthews, and William Merithew. W. J. Seagraves visited the site, too, but some time after the battle had been fought.

Robert Anderson wrote, "Into the stream they leaped, but few got out alive. Instead many dead bodies floated down the rapid current." One captive Indian woman named Mariah from Big Meadows (Lake Almanor today), was one of those who did escape. The Three Knolls battle is also described in [[Theodora Kroeber]]’s ''Ishi in Two Worlds.''

Since then more has been learned. It is estimated that with this massacre, Ishi's entire cultural group, the Yana/Yahi, may have been reduced to about sixty individuals. From 1859 to 1911, Ishi's remote band became more and more infiltrated by non-Yahi Indian representatives, such as [[Wintun]], [[Nomlaki]], and [[Pit River Tribe|Pit River]] individuals.

In 1879, the federal government started [[American Indian boarding schools|Indian boarding schools]] in California. Some men from the reservations became renegades in the hills. Volunteers among the settlers and military troops carried out additional campaigns against the northern California Indian tribes during that period.&lt;ref name="burrill"&gt;Burrill, Richard (2001).  ''Ishi Rediscovered''.  Barron's art guides, Anthro Company, 2001.  {{ISBN|1878464515}}, 9781878464514.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late 1908, a group of surveyors came across the camp inhabited by two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother, respectively. The former three fled while the latter hid herself in blankets to avoid detection, as she was sick and unable to flee. The surveyors ransacked the camp and Ishi's mother died soon after his return. His sister and uncle never returned.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

===Walking into the modern world===
After the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving and with nowhere to go, at around the age of 50, on August 29, 1911, Ishi walked out into the western world.&lt;ref name="mpress_ishi"&gt;[https://www.mohicanpress.com/mo08019.html ''Ishi: A Real-Life Last Of The Mohicans''], Mohican Press&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured attempting to forage for meat near [[Oroville, California]], after forest fires in the area.&lt;ref name=NYT961911&gt;{{cite news|title=FIND A RARE ABORIGINE.; Scientists Obtain Valuable Tribal Lore from Southern Yahi Indian.|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E17FB355A15738DDDAE0894D1405B818DF1D3|accessdate=2012-09-02|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 1911|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The "wild man" caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Museum of Anthropology—now the [[Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology]] (PAHMA)—read about him and brought him to their facility,&lt;ref name=NYT961911 /&gt; then housed on the [[University of California, San Francisco]] campus in an old law school building. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked with them as a research assistant and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he temporarily lived in Berkeley with the [[anthropologist]] [[Thomas Talbot Waterman]] and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271470|title=Ishi in Two Worlds, 50th Anniversary Edition|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|accessdate=2012-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ishi.jpg|thumb|Ishi with Alfred L. Kroeber in 1911]]
Waterman and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years and interviewed him at length in an effort to reconstruct Yahi culture. He described family units, naming patterns, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older survivors in his group. He identified material items and showed the techniques by which they were made. Ishi provided valuable information on his native [[Yana language]], which was recorded and studied by the [[linguist]] [[Edward Sapir]], who had previously done work on the northern dialects.

Lacking acquired immunity to the diseases common among European Americans, Ishi was often ill. He was treated by [[Saxton Pope|Saxton T. Pope]], a professor of medicine at UCSF. Pope became close friends with Ishi, and learned from him how to make bows and arrows in the Yahi way. He and Ishi often hunted together.

Ishi died of [[tuberculosis]] on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were "You stay. I go."&lt;ref name="Starr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Starr|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HnIh_auw9MC&amp;pg=PA330|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515797-0|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friends at the university initially had tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition called for the body to remain intact. But the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could prevent it. 

Ishi's brain was preserved and the body cremated. His friends placed grave goods with his remains before cremation: "one of his bows, five arrows, a basket of acorn meal, a boxful of shell bead money, a purse full of tobacco, three rings, and some obsidian flakes." Ishi's remains were interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma, near San Francisco.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;[https://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views1h39.htm "Ishi's Hiding Place", Butte County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716172531/https://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views1h39.htm |date=July 16, 2006 }}, ''A History of American Indians in California: Historic Sites'', National Park Service, 2004, accessed November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kroeber put Ishi's preserved brain in a deerskin-wrapped Pueblo Indian pottery jar and sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. It was held there until August 10, 2000, when the Smithsonian repatriated it to the descendants of the [[Redding Rancheria]] and [[Pit River]] tribes. This was in accordance with the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989 (NMAI).&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ishi's Kin To Give Him Proper Burial: Indians to bury brain in secret location in state |first= Kevin |last=Fagan |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 10, 2000 |page= A-5 |url= https://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/08/10/MN88399.DTL&amp;ao=all#ixzz1wBvJxpTg }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Fri, director of the [[National Museum of Natural History]], "Contrary to commonly-held belief, Ishi was not the last of his kind. In carrying out the repatriation process, we learned that as a Yahi–Yana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthropology.si.edu/repatriation/projects/ishi.htm |title=NMNH - Repatriation Office - The Repatriation of Ishi, the last Yahi Indian |publisher=Anthropology.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place.&lt;ref name="SFC" /&gt;

==Possible multi-ethnicity==
[[Image:Ishi 1914.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ishi in 1913]]
In 1994, Steven Shackley of UC Berkeley learned of a paper by Jerald Johnson, who noted morphological evidence that Ishi's facial features and height were more typical of the [[Wintu]] and [[Maidu]]. He theorized that under pressure of diminishing populations, members of groups that were once enemies may have intermarried to survive. Johnson also referred to oral histories of the Wintu and Maidu that told of the tribes' intermarrying with the Yahi.&lt;ref name="Shackley"/&gt; The debate on this has not been definitively settled. 

In 1996, Shackley announced work based on a study of Ishi's [[projectile point]]s and those of the northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi's production was more typical of points of the [[Nomlaki]] or Wintu tribes, and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi may have been of mixed ancestry, and related to and raised among members of another of the tribes.&lt;ref name="Shackley"&gt;[https://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/96legacy/releases.96/14310.html 02.05.96 – "Ishi apparently wasn't the last Yahi, according to new evidence from UC Berkeley research archaeologist"], ''News'', University of Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; He based his conclusion on a study of the points made by Ishi compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures. 

Among Ishi's techniques was the use of what is known as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arf.berkeley.edu/archaeology-news/arf-newsletter-1996-v3-2 |title=Some Inferences For Hunter-Gatherer Style and Ethnicity |publisher=Arf.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known to be a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes. This suggests that Ishi may have learned the skill directly from a male relative of one of those tribes. These people lived in small bands, close to the Yahi. They were traditional competitors and enemies of the Yahi.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

Ishi's story has been compared to that of [[Ota Benga]], an [[Mbuti]] [[pygmy]] from Congo. His family had died and were not given a mourning ritual. He was taken from his home and culture. During one period, he was displayed as a zoo exhibit. Ota died on March 20, 1916, five days before Ishi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFghGGXLJ7IC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=ishi+and+ota+benga&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8vfrkTA0Dr&amp;sig=Zyyx3AJ412YFD5IpaQu7H0WlTaM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCGoVChMItMnUn6ffxwIVAXceCh3n1w9_#v=onepage&amp;q=ishi%20and%20ota%20benga&amp;f=false|page=41|title=Ishi in Three Centuries|authors=Kroeber, Karl &amp; Kroeber, Clifton B.

[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|right|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region and called Thuluth.]]

'''Islamic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]],&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based upon the [[Arabic alphabet|alphabet]] in the lands sharing a common Islamic cultural heritage. It includes [[Arabic calligraphy|Arabic Calligraphy]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Persian calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book |last=Blair |first=Sheila S. |title=The art and architecture of Islam : 1250–1800 |year=1995 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-06465-9 |edition=Reprinted with corrections |author2=Bloom, Jonathan M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|218}}--&gt;&lt;ref name=ens&gt;Chapman, Caroline (2012). ''Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture'', {{ISBN|978-979-099-631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt Islami'' (خط اسلامي), meaning Islamic line, design, or construction.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the [[Qur'an]]; chapters and excerpts from the Qur'an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. Deep religious association with the [[Qur'an]], as well as suspicion of figurative art as [[Taghut|idolatrous]], has led calligraphy to become one of the major forms of artistic expression in Islamic cultures.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|222}}--&gt; It has also been argued that Islamic calligraphy was motivated less by iconophobia (since, in fact, images were by no means absent in Islamic art) than by the centrality of the notion of writing and written text in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, “The Content of Form: Islamic Calligraphy Between Text and Representation,” in ''Sign and Design'', ed. B. Bedos-Rezak and J. Hamburger (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 2016), 169–190.&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy, for instance, that the Prophet Muhammad is related to have said: "The first thing God created was the pen."&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Abi Dawud, Sunnah 4699.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works. In antiquity, a pupil would copy a master's work repeatedly until their handwriting was similar. The most common style is divided into angular and cursive, each further divided into several sub-styles.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;!--[[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] calligraphy is associated with abstract [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] motifs on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary [[artists]] in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.
 They used it to represent God because they denied representing God with images.&lt;ref name="Bernard Lewis"&gt;Bernard Lewis and Butnzie Ellis Churchill, ''Islam : the Religion and the People'', {{ISBN|978-0-13-223085-8}}&lt;/rf&gt;--&gt;

==Instruments and media==
The traditional instrument of the Islamic calligrapher is the [[kalam]], a [[pen]] normally made of dried [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[bamboo]]; the [[ink]] is often in [[colour|color]], and chosen such that its intensity can vary greatly so that the greater strokes of the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect. Some styles are often written using a metallic-tip pen.
[[File:Niebuhr Beschreibung von Arabien Tab XIII.png|thumbnail|Five principal Arabic calligraphic cursive styles:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Naskh (نسخ nasḫ)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Nasta‘liq (نستعلیق nastaʿlīq)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Diwani (ديواني dīwānī)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Thuluth (ثلث ṯuluṯ)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Ruq‘ah (رقعة ruqʿah)]]
Islamic calligraphy is applied to a wide range of decorative mediums other than paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=ens/&gt; Before the advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. The advent of paper revolutionized calligraphy. While monasteries in Europe treasured a few dozen volumes, libraries in the [[Muslim world]] regularly contained hundreds and even thousands of books.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|218}}

Coins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing visual depiction with words. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur'an.

By the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were calligraphic inscribed textiles that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the [[Suaire de Saint-Josse]], used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in northwestern France.&lt;ref name=Bloom /&gt;{{rp|223–5}}

==Styles==
===Kufic===
[[File:A section of the Koran - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left|9th century [[Qur'an]], an early kufic example from the [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid period]]]]
[[File:Bowl with Kufic Calligraphy, 10th century.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Bowl with [[Kufic]] [[Calligraphy]]'', 10th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

'''[[Kufic]]''' is the oldest form of the Arabic script. The style emphasizes rigid and angular strokes, which appears as a modified form of the old [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963439648|title=A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture|last=Flood, Necipoğlu|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=|year=2017|isbn=9781119068570|volume=Volume I|location=Hoboken|pages=109-110|oclc=963439648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaic Kufi consisted of about 17 letters without diacritic dots or accents. Afterward, dots and accents were added to help readers with pronunciation, and the set of Arabic letters rose to 28.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie (1984). ''[http://universityoftexasbrownsville.worldcat.org/title/calligraphy-and-islamic-culture/oclc/20420019&amp;referer=brief_results Calligraphy and Islamic Culture]''. New York: New York University Press. p. 4. [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] [[Special%3ABookSources/0814778305|0814778305]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed around the end of the 7th century in the areas of [[Kufa]], Iraq, from which it takes its name.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; The style later developed into several varieties, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and squared kufi. It was the main script used to copy Qur'ans from the 8th to 10th century and went out of general use in the 12th century when the flowing naskh style become more practical, although it continued to be used as a decorative element to contrast superseding styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kūfic script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324418/Kufic-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no set rules of using the Kufic script; the only common feature is the angular, linear shapes of the characters. Due to the lack of methods, the scripts in different regions and countries and even down to the individuals themselves have different ways to write in the script creatively, ranging from very square and rigid forms to flowery and decorative.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;

Common varieties include&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; square Kufic, a technique known as ''[[banna'i]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jonathan M. Bloom |author2=Sheila Blair |title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA212 |accessdate=4 January 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=101, 131, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary calligraphy using this style is also popular in modern decorations.

Decorative Kufic inscriptions are often imitated into [[pseudo-kufic]]s in [[Middle Ages|Middle age]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe. Pseudo-kufics is especially common in [[Renaissance]] depictions of people from the [[Holy Land]]. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13–14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found natural to represent [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] in association with them.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Rosamond E. Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600, University of California Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Naskh (script)|Naskh]]===
[[File:Folio from a Qur'an (Mamluk dynasty).jpg|thumb|right|[[Muhaqqaq]] script in a 14th-century Qur'an from the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]].]]

The use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, but because in the early stages of their development they lacked discipline and elegance, cursive was usually used for informal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Art of Arabic Calligraphy, a brief history |url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |author=Mamoun Sakkal |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Islam, a new script was needed to fit the pace of conversions, and a well-defined cursive called '''[[naskh (script)|naskh]]''' first appeared in the 10th century. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in Qur'ans, official decrees, and private correspondence.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.loc.gov/intldl/apochtml/apocfragments.html |title=Library of Congress, Selections of Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Calligraphy: Qur'anic Fragments |publisher=International.loc.gov |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the basis of modern Arabic print.

Standardization of the style was pioneered by [[Ibn Muqla]] (886&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;940 A.D.) and later expanded by [[Abu Hayan at-Tawhidi]] (died 1009 A.D.) and [[Muhammad Ibn Abd ar-Rahman]] (1492&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;1545 A.D.). Ibn Muqla is highly regarded in Muslim sources on calligraphy as the inventor of the naskh style, although this seems to be erroneous. However, Ibn Muqla did establish systematic rules and proportions for shaping the letters, which use 'alif as the [[x-height]].&lt;ref&gt;Kampman, Frerik (2011). ''[http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Kampman-2011-Typography-Bachelor-Thesis-Arabic-Frerik-Kampman-20120823-download.pdf Arabic Typography; its past and its future]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation of the naskh includes:
#'''[[Thuluth]]''' is developed as a display script to decorate particular scriptural ice. Letters have long vertical lines with broad spacing. The name, meaning "third", is in reference to the x-height, which is one-third of the 'alif.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/thuluth-naskh.html|title=Thuluth and Naskh|last=Kvernen|first=Elisabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Riq'ah]]''' is a handwriting style derived from naskh and thuluth, first appeared in the 9th century. The shape is simple with short strokes and little flourishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/tawqi-riqa.html|title=Tawqi' and Riqa'|last=Kvernen|first=Elizabeth|date=2009|website=CalligraphyQalam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Muhaqqaq]]''' is a majestic style used by accomplished calligraphers. It was considered one of the most beautiful scripts, as well as one of the most difficult to execute. Muhaqqaq was commonly used during the Mameluke era, but the use becomes largely restricted to short phrases, such as the [[basmallah]], from the 18th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, Nassar (2011). ''Sacred Script: Muhaqqaq in Islamic Calligraphy''. New York: I.B.Tauris &amp; Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1-84885-439-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional styles===
[[File:Miremad-1.jpg|thumb|right|Nasta'liq calligraphy by [[Mir Emad Hassani]], perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher.]]
With the [[spread of Islam]], the [[Arabic script]] was established in a vast geographic area with many regions developing their own unique style. From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.&lt;ref name="LOCFragments" /&gt;

# '''[[Nasta'liq]]''' is a [[cursive]] style originally devised to write the [[Persian language]] for literary and non-Qur'anic works.&lt;ref name=qalam&gt;{{cite web| title= An Introduction of Arabic, Ottoman, and Persian Calligraphy: Style|author=Kvernen, Elizabeth |year=2009|publisher=Calligraphy Qalam |url=http://calligraphyqalam.com/styles/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nasta'liq is thought to be a later development of the naskh and the earlier ta'liq script used in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ta'liq Script |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581497/taliq-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''ta'liq'' means "hanging", and refers to the slightly steeped lines of which words run in, giving the script a hanging appearance. Letters have short vertical strokes with broad and sweeping horizontal strokes. The shapes are deep, hook-like, and have high contrast.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt; A variant called ''[[Shikasta Nastaʿlīq|Shikasteh]]'' is used in more informal contexts.
# '''[[Diwani]]''' is a cursive style of Arabic calligraphy developed during the reign of the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by [[Housam Roumi]], and reached its height of popularity under [[Süleyman I the Magnificent]] (1520–1566).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diwani script|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/166798/diwani-script|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called ''djali'' are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization and became the ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured confidentiality and prevented forgery.&lt;ref name=qalam/&gt;
# '''[[Sini (script)|Sini]]''' is a style developed in China. The shape is greatly influenced by [[Chinese calligraphy]], using a horsehair brush instead of the standard reed pen. A famous modern calligrapher in this tradition is [[Hajji]] [[Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hajinoordeen.com/gallery.html "Gallery"], ''Haji Noor Deen''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--==Calligrams==

[[File:The Bismillah India.jpg|thumb|Bismillah calligraphy from the [[Mughal Empire]].]]

[[Calligraphy]], the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, also has its figurative sides. By interweaving written words, made from an "Allah", a "Muhammad", a "[[Basmala|Bismillah]]", etc., or using [[micrography]],&lt;ref name = "bnf"&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm BNF - Torah, Bible, Coran]. In French.&lt;/ref&gt; calligraphers produced anthropomorphic figures ([['Ali]], the Ideal Human of [[Sufi|mystics]], a praying man,&lt;ref name=Praying&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying Man|url=http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|publisher=Ethiopian Muslims Network|accessdate=29 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217032258/http://www.ethiopianmuslims.net/Images/calligraphy2.jpg|archivedate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a face), zoomorphisms (symbolic creatures, most from the Shi'a iconography, like the lion (Ali "the Lion of God")&lt;ref name = "Cartage"&gt;[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/GeogHist/histories/Oldcivilization/Egyptology/Calligraphy/art5.jpg Lion of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; horse ([['Ali]]'s [[Duldul (mule)|Duldul]]),&lt;ref name = "Levha"&gt;[http://www.levha.net/calligraphy/calligraphy_index.html Horse of 'Ali].&lt;/ref&gt; fish,&lt;ref name = "bnf" /&gt; stork or other bird (the qur'anic [[Hudhud]])&lt;ref name = "IslArch"&gt;[http://www.islamicarchitecture.org/art/images/calligraphy/islamic.calligraphy.birdtext.101.gif HudHud].{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "UCSC"&gt;[http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/art/islamic_bird.jpg Islamic Bird], ''UC Santa Cruz Currents Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and inanimate representations (a sword ([[Zulfiqar|Dhu al-Fiqar]]), a mosque, a ship (made from the letter ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'', a symbol of mystical union, literally meaning "and," in Arabic)). Calligrams are related to Muslim mysticism and popular with many leading calligraphers in [[Turkey]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and [[India]] from the 17th century onward.

Although striking in appearance, calligrams have never been regarded as appropriate or a decent expression of the art by the master calligraphers. Many calligrams therefore were produced by either folk calligraphers or for the interest of uncultivated people. These calligrams were not exhibited in mosques or Sufi convents in the Ottoman state, for example.

An element in this perspective is the rejection of the interpretation by the heretic Hurufiyyah Sufi order which sees letters as true manifestations of the fate, events and creation in themselves.

In the teachings of calligraphy, figurative imagery is used to help visualize the shape of letters to trace, for example, the letter ''ha' '' looks in ''nasta'liq'' similar to two eyes, as its Persian name implies: "he' two eyes" ''he' do cheshm''). In literature and poetry seeing in letters a reflection of the natural world goes back to the [[Abbasid]] times.

One of the contemporary masters of the calligram genre is [[Hassan Massoudy]] and [[Wissam Shawkat]].

Good commercial examples are the logos of [[Al Jazeera]], an international news station based at [[Qatar]], and the [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]], a Scottish academic journal on the [[Middle East]], and also the work of the calligrapher and designer Wissam Shawkat.--&gt;

===Modern===
In the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the ''[[Hurufiyya movement]]''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture]. Volume II. Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 1294. {{ISBN|1119068665}}. OCLC 1006377297.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists working in this field use calligraphy as a graphic from within a contemporary artwork. &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' for letter. Traditionally, the term was charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is an explicit reference to a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism.  In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos. &lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyyah artists  struggled to find their own individual  dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa around 1955, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the use of calligraphy in modern artworks appears to have emerged independently in various Islamic states. Few of the artists working in this field, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, Necipoğlu (2017). [https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-companion-to-islamic-art-and-architecture-2-from-the-mongols-to-modernism/oclc/1006377297&amp;referer=brief_results A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture].

'''Jerry Alan Fodor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|d|ər}}; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an [[American philosopher]] and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientist]]. He held the position of [[State of New Jersey]] Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at [[Rutgers University]] and was the author of many works in the fields of [[philosophy of mind]] and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the [[modularity of mind]] and the [[language of thought]] hypotheses, among other ideas. He was known for his provocative and sometimes [[polemic]]al style of argumentation and as "one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. In addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960, Fodor's work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fodor/|title=Fodor, Jerry - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fodor argued that mental states, such as [[belief]]s and [[desire (philosophy)|desires]], are relations between individuals and [[Representational theory of mind|mental representations]]. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.

For Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of [[modularity of the mind|modules]], or "organs", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the "central processing" part of the mind, which has a more global and less "domain specific" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.

Although Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the [[philosophy of language]] because of this problem of the meaning and [[reference]] of [[mental content]]s. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against [[semantic holism]]. Fodor strongly opposed [[reductionism|reductive]] accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are [[multiple realizability|multiple realizable]] and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded [[Darwinian]] and [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] theories of [[natural selection]].

==Biography==
Jerry Fodor was born in [[New York City]] on April 22, 1935,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|last=Shook|first=John. R.|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2005|isbn=9781843710370|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ijpj1tB3Qr0C|via=Google Books|page=817}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was of [[Jewish]] descent. He received his A.B. degree (''summa cum laude'') from [[Columbia University]] in 1956, where he studied with [[Sydney Morgenbesser]], and a PhD in philosophy from [[Princeton University]] in 1960, under the direction of [[Hilary Putnam]]. From 1959 to 1986 Fodor was on the faculty of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. From 1986 to 1988 he was a full professor at the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY). From 1988 until his retirement in 2016 he was State of New Jersey Professor of philosophy and cognitive science at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]], where he was emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.rutgers.edu/people/emeritus-faculty|title=Emeritus Faculty|website=www.philosophy.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norfleet, Phil.

Accessed 22 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides his interest in philosophy, Fodor passionately followed [[opera]] and regularly wrote popular columns for the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' on that and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/jerry-fodor "LRB: Jerry Fodor"]. ''London Review of Books''. Lrb.co.uk. Accessed 22 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Colin McGinn]], who taught with Fodor at Rutgers, described him in these words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fodor (who is a close friend) is a gentle man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble at the same time ... a formidable polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul.... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart, can be a chastening experience.... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [University] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent ''the leading philosopher of mind'' in the world today. I had met him in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=McGinn, Colin | title=The Making of a Philosopher | year=2002 | publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-019792-6|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fodor was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He received numerous awards and honors: New York State Regent's Fellowship, Woodrow Wilson Fellowship ([[Princeton University]]), Chancellor Greene Fellow (Princeton University), [[Fulbright Fellowship]] ([[University of Oxford]]), Fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]], and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry.

He lived in New York with his wife, the linguist [[Janet Dean Fodor]], and had two children. Fodor died on November 29, 2017, at his home in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/obituaries/jerry-a-fodor-dead-philosopher-of-the-mind.html|title=Jerry A.

==Fodor and the nature of mental states==
In his article "Propositional Attitudes" (1978), Fodor introduced the idea that mental states are relations between individuals and mental representations. Despite the changes in many of his positions over the years, the idea that [[intentionality|intentional attitudes]] are relational has remained unchanged from its original formulation up to {{as of | 2010 | alt = the present time}}.&lt;ref name="Fodor1"&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry A. | title=Representations: Philosophical Essays on the Foundations of Cognitive Science | year=1981 | publisher=The MIT Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]|isbn=978-0-262-06079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that article, he attempted to show how mental representations, specifically sentences in the [[language of thought]], are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnapian]] view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|title=Meaning and Necessity|publisher=Chicago University Press|location=Chicago|year=1947|isbn= 978-0-226-09347-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Field, H.H.|title=Mental Representation|year=1978|journal=Erkenntnis|issue=1
|pages=9–61|volume=13
|doi=10.1007/BF00160888
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harman, G.|title=Conceptual Role Semantics|year=1982|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|issue=2|pages=242–256|volume=23|doi=10.1305/ndjfl/1093883628}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] view that they are between individuals and the [[proposition]]s expressed by such sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frege, G.|title=Über Sinn und Bedeutung|journal=Zeitschrift für Philosophie und Philosophische Kritik|year=1892}}; trans. it. ''Senso e denotatione'', in A. Bonomì, ''La Struttura Logica del Linguaggio'', Bompiani, Milan 1973, pp 9–32&lt;/ref&gt;
Fodor's own position, instead, is that to properly account for the nature of intentional attitudes, it is necessary to employ a ''three-place'' relation between individuals, representations and propositional contents.&lt;ref name="Fodor1" /&gt;

Considering mental states as three-place relations in this way, [[representative realism]] makes it possible to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the [[computational theory of mind|computational]] notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.&lt;ref name="Fodor1" /&gt;

==The functional architecture of the mind==
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|The ideas of [[modularity of mind]] have predecessors in the 19th-century movement of [[phrenology]] founded by [[Franz Joseph Gall]].]]

Following in the path paved by [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]], Fodor developed a strong commitment to the idea of [[psychological nativism]].&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francesco Ferretti|title=Jerry A. Fodor:Mente e Linguaggio|year=2001|publisher=Editori Laterza|location=Rome|isbn=978-88-420-6220-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of [[behaviourism]] and [[associationism]]. These criticisms also led him to the formulation of his hypothesis of the [[modularity of the mind]].

Historically, questions about mental architecture have been divided{{By whom|date=January 2010}} into two contrasting theories about the nature of the faculties. The first can be described as a "horizontal" view because it sees mental processes as interactions between faculties which are not domain specific. For example, a judgment remains a judgment whether it is judgment about a perceptual experience or a judgment about the understanding of language. The second can be described as a "vertical" view because it claims that our mental faculties are domain specific, genetically determined, associated with distinct neurological structures, and so on.&lt;ref name="FF" /&gt;

The vertical vision can be traced back to the 19th century movement called [[phrenology]] and its founder [[Franz Joseph Gall]]. Gall claimed that mental faculties could be associated with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally "read off" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior [[parietal lobe]].&lt;ref name="Fodor2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fodor, Jerry A. | title=The Modularity of Mind:An Essay in Faculty Psychology |year= 1983 | publisher=The MIT Press | isbn=978-0-262-56025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simplistic view of modularity has been disproved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=J.M.S.|title=Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens (1794-1867) and cortical localization|journal=European Neurology|date=2009|volume=61|issue=5|doi=10.1159/000206858|pmid=19295220|pages=311–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerr|first1=PB|last2=Caputy|first2=AJ|last3=Horwitz|first3=NH|title=A history of cerebral localization|journal=Neurosurgical Focus|date=Apr 15, 2005|volume=18|issue=4|page=e1|pmid=15844861|doi=10.3171/foc.2005.18.4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the course of the last century.

Fodor revived the idea of modularity, without the notion of precise physical localizability, in the 1980s, and became one of the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his [[monograph]] ''Modularity of Mind''.&lt;ref name="Fodor2" /&gt; Two properties of modularity in particular, ''informational encapsulation'' and ''domain specificity'', make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an [[atomism|atomistic]] and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.&lt;ref name="Fodor2" /&gt;

Fodor's notions of mental modularity, informational encapsulation and domain specificity were taken up and expanded, much to Fodor's chagrin, by cognitive scientists such as [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] such as [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Henry Plotkin]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pinker, S|title=How the Mind Works | publisher= Norton |location= New York|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Plotkin, H.|title=Evolution in Mind|year=1997|publisher=Alan Lane|location=London|isbn=978-0-7139-9138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pylyshyn, Z. |title=Computation and Cognition |publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Fodor complained that Pinker, Plotkin and other members of what he sarcastically called "the New Synthesis" have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. He insisted that the mind is not "massively modular" and that, contrary to what these researchers would have us believe, the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the [[computational theory of mind|computational]], or any other, model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fodor, J. |title=The Mind Doesn't Work That Way:The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology|publisher=MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-262-56146-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional realism==
In ''A Theory of Content and Other Essays'' (1990), Fodor takes up another of his central notions: the question of the reality of mental representations.&lt;ref name="Fodor3"&gt;{{cite book | author=Fodor, Jerry A. | title=A Theory of Content and Other Essays | year=1990 | publisher=The MIT Press | isbn=978-0-262-56069-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.

===Fodor's criticism of Dennett===
Fodor starts with some criticisms of so-called ''standard realism''. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the [[semantics|semantic]] theory of mental content and asserts that there is an [[isomorphism]] between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.&lt;ref name="Fodor3" /&gt;

In particular, Fodor criticizes the [[instrumentalism]] of [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref name="Fodor3" /&gt; Dennett maintains that it is possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel C. | title=The Intentional Stance | year=1987 | publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining ''why'' the intentional strategy works:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires works so well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the ''only'' theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.&lt;ref name="Fodor4"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fodor, Jerry A. | title=Fodor's Guide to Mental Representations | journal=Mind | volume=94 | issue=373 | pages=76–100 | doi=10.1093/mind/xciv.373.76| year=1985 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Productivity, systematicity and thought===
Fodor also has ''positive'' arguments in favour of the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of [[Noam Chomsky]] to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as [[connectionism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |fodor= |jerry a.= |pylyshyn= |zenon w.= |year=1988 |title=Connectionism and cognitive architecture: A critical analysis |journal=Cognition|issue=1–2 |pages=3–71 |pmid=2450716 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(88)90031-5 |last1= Fodor |first1= Jerry A. |last2= Pylyshyn |first2= Zenon W. |volume= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chomsky= |nopp= |authorlink1=Noam Chomsky|title=Syntactic Structures|year=1957|publisher=Mouton |location=The Hague/Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and [[compositionality]].

Productivity refers to a representational system's unbounded ability to generate new representations from a given set of symbols. "John", "loves", and "Mary" allow for the construction of the sentences "John loves Mary" and "Mary loves John". Fodor's [[language of thought]] theorizes that representations are decomposable into constituent parts, and these decomposed representations are built into new strings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

More important than productivity is systematicity since it does not rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition. The argument states that a cognizer is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another. For example, no one who understands "John loves Mary" is unable to understand "Mary loves John", and no one who understands "P and Q" is unable to understand "P". Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics, but some challenge that thought is systematic in the same way languages are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |title=Systematicity |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=93 |issue=12 |pages=591–614 |author=Cummins |doi=10.2307/2941118|jstor=2941118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others from the [[connectionist]] tradition have tried to build non-classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1987 |title=The constituent structure of mental states: A reply to Fodor and Pylyshyn |journal=Southern Journal of Philosophy |volume=26 |pages=137–160 |author=Smolensky Paul |doi=10.1111/j.2041-6962.1988.tb00470.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.468.755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that systematicity and productivity depend on the compositional structure of language means that language has a combinatorial semantics. If thought also has such a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] semantics, then there must be a language of thought.&lt;ref name="Found"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fodor, J,|title=RePresentations. Philosophical Essays on the Foundations of Cognitive Science|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Mass.|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second argument that Fodor provides in favour of representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on the relation between the [[representational theory of mind]] and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations goes hand in hand with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the ''form'' of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.&lt;ref name="Found" /&gt;

For Fodor, this formal notion of thought processes also has the advantage of highlighting the parallels between the causal role of symbols and the contents which they express. In his view, syntax plays the role of mediation between the causal role of the symbols and their contents. The semantic relations between symbols can be "imitated" by their syntactic relations. The inferential relations which connect the ''contents'' of two symbols can be imitated by the formal syntax rules which regulate the derivation of one symbol from another.&lt;ref name="Found" /&gt;

==The nature of content==
From the beginning of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content contrasts sharply with the [[inferential role semantics]] to which he subscribed earlier in his career. {{As of|2010}} Fodor criticizes inferential role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of [[semantic holism|holism]] excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.&lt;ref name="Hol"&gt;Fodor, J. ''Holism: A Shopper's Guide'', (with E. Lepore), Blackwell, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-18193-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-holism===
Fodor has made many and varied criticisms of holism. He identifies the central problem with all the different notions of holism as the idea that the determining factor in semantic evaluation is the notion of an "epistemic bond". Briefly, P is an epistemic bond of Q if the meaning of P is considered by someone to be relevant for the determination of the meaning of Q. Meaning holism strongly depends on this notion. The identity of the content of a mental state, under holism, can only be determined by the ''totality'' of its epistemic bonds. And this makes the realism of mental states an impossibility:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;blockquote&gt;If people differ in an absolutely general way in their estimations of epistemic relevance, and if we follow the holism of meaning and individuate intentional states by way of the ''totality'' of their epistemic bonds, the consequence will be that two people (or, for that matter, two temporal sections of the same person) will never be in the same intentional state. Therefore, two people can never be subsumed under the same intentional generalizations. And, therefore, intentional generalization can never be successful. And, therefore again, there is no hope for an intentional psychology.&lt;ref name="Hol" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The asymmetric causal theory===
Having criticized the idea that semantic evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system, Fodor can adopt an [[externalism|externalist]] position with respect to mental content and meaning. For Fodor, in recent years, the problem of naturalization of the mental is tied to the possibility of giving "the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to (expresses, represents, is true of) another piece" in non-intentional and non-semantic terms. If this goal is to be achieved within a representational theory of the mind, then the challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non-logical symbols of the LOT. Fodor's initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for "water" in Mentalese expresses the property H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water. The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the "Crude Causal Theory". According to this theory, the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence. The term "horse", for example, says of a horse that it is a horse. In order to do this, it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol "horse" be in a law-like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of ''horse''.&lt;ref name="Fodor3" /&gt;

The main problem with this theory is that of erroneous representations. There are two unavoidable problems with the idea that "a symbol expresses a property if it is ... necessary that all and only the presences of such a property cause the occurrences". The first is that not ''all'' horses cause occurrences of ''horse''. The second is that not ''only'' horses cause occurrences of ''horse.'' Sometimes the ''A''(''horses'') are caused by A (horses), but at other times—when, for example, because of the distance or conditions of low visibility, one has confused a cow for a horse—the ''A'' (''horses'') are caused by B (cows). In this case the symbol ''A'' doesn’t express just the property A, but the disjunction of properties A or B. The crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing the case in which the content of a symbol is disjunctive from the case in which it isn’t. This gives rise to what Fodor calls the "problem of disjunction".

Fodor responds to this problem with what he defines as "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, it is necessary to break the symmetry at the base of the crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of ''A'' caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ''[[ontology|ontologically]] dependent'' on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (''A''= A) and the false ones (''A'' = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the point of view of semantics, errors must be ''accidents'': if in the extension of "horse" there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of "horse" that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if "horse" did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying "this is a horse" presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. If we put this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say "horse" depends on the fact that horses cause one to say "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say "horse" does ''not'' depend on the fact that cows cause one to say "horse"...&lt;ref name="Fodor3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Functionalism==
During the 1960s, various philosophers such as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called "folk psychology" while adhering to a [[materialism|materialist]] vision of the world which did not violate the "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: [[behaviorism]] and the [[type identity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Putnam, Hilary | title=Mind, Language and Reality | year=1988 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with [[behaviorism|logical behaviorism]] was that it failed to account for causation ''between'' mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.

[[File:Reduktionismus.png|thumb|An illustration of multiple realizability. M stands for mental and P stand for physical. The diagram shows that more than one P can instantiate one M, but not ''vice versa''. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (M1 goes to M2, etc.)]]
One can solve these problems, according to Fodor, with [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], a hypothesis which was designed to overcome the failings of both [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[reductionism]]. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the [[multiple realizability]] of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of ''token materialism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fodor, Jerry | title=The Mind/Body Problem | journal=Scientific American | issue=244 |pages=124–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

Fodor co-authored the book ''[[What Darwin Got Wrong]]'' (2010) with the biolinguist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini in which they describe neo-Darwinists as being "distressingly uncritical" and say of Darwin's theory of evolution that "it overestimates the contribution the environment makes in shaping the phenotype of a species and correspondingly underestimates the effects of endogenous variables."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527466.100-survival-of-the-fittest-theory-darwinisms-limits.html Survival of the fittest theory: Darwinism's limits]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/did-charles-darwin-get-it-wrong-1882253.html |title=Did Charles Darwin get it wrong? |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-OjJPwAACAAJ ''What Darwin Got Wrong'']{{dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] describes this book as "a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection"&lt;ref&gt;[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/worst-science-journalism-of-the-year-darwin-completely-wrong-again/ "Worst science journalism of the year: Darwin completely wrong (again)"], ''[http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/ Why Evolution is True]''&lt;/ref&gt; and "as biologically uninformed as it is strident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/improbability-pump "The Improbability Pump"] (a review of ''What Darwin Got Wrong'' and [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''The Greatest Show on Earth''), ''[http://www.thenation.com/ The Nation]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher and anti-scientism author [[Mary Midgley]] praises ''What Darwin Got Wrong'' as "an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities".&lt;ref name=Midgley&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/what-darwin-ot-wrong What Darwin Got Wrong by Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli Palmarini], [[Mary Midgley]], [[The Guardian]], 6 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book also received positive review by mathematician and Intelligent Design Theorist [[William Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncommondescent.com/evolution/what-darwin-got-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A wide variety of philosophers of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the [[language of thought]] hypothesis has been accused of either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, [[Simon Blackburn]] suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for ''it'' to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of ''this'' representational substrate and so on, ''ad infinitum''? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Blackburn, S. | title=Spreading the Word | year=1984 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it does not have to be learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.

In 1981 Daniel Dennett had formulated another argument against the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, on the basis of the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually ''thinking'' or ''believing'' somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" in [[Mentalese]]. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as "desiring to breathe clear air" in a stuffy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, D.C. | title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology | year=1981 | publisher=MIT Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some linguists and philosophers of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed "extreme" concept nativism. [[Kent Bach]], for example, takes Fodor to task for his criticisms of [[lexical semantics]] and [[polysemy]]. Fodor claims that there is no lexical structure to such verbs as "keep", "get", "make" and "put". He suggests that, alternatively, "keep" simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, "keep your clothes on", "keep your receipt" and "keep washing your hands" will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, ''differently'', to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME.&lt;ref name="Bach"&gt;{{cite web | author=Bach, Kent | title=Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong. By Jerry A. Fodor (book review) |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/kbach/Fodorreview.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not the differing interpretations of "fast" in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] inference, is a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pustejovsky, J. | title=The Generative Lexicon | year = 1995 | publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in ''Concepts'': "People sometimes used to say that ''exist'' must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fodor, J. | title = Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong | year = 1998 | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 54 | isbn = 978-0-19-823636-8 | url = http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823636-0.pdf#search=%22Concepts%3AWhere%20Cognitive%20Science%20Went%20wrong%22 | format = online PDF text | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912061929/http://www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-823636-0.pdf#search=%22Concepts%3AWhere%20Cognitive%20Science%20Went%20wrong%22 | archivedate = 2006-09-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics find it difficult to accept Fodor's insistence that a large, perhaps implausible, number of concepts are primitive and undefinable. For example, Fodor considers such concepts as EFFECT, ISLAND, TRAPEZOID, and WEEK to be all primitive, innate and unanalyzable because they all fall into the category of what he calls "lexical concepts" (those for which our language has a single word). Against this view, Bach argues that the concept VIXEN is almost certainly composed out of the concepts FEMALE and FOX, BACHELOR out of SINGLE and MALE, and so on.&lt;ref name="Bach" /&gt;

One of his critics, [[Fiona Cowie]], says that Fodor's innatism is "indicative of a certain degree of pessimism as to our prospects for understanding how a mind comes to be furnished," it just has the furniture it has.

In 1973 Nerbøvik published his most well-known book; the general overview ''Norsk historie 1870–1905''.&lt;ref name=aft/&gt; It was later remade into ''Norsk historie 1860–1914.

He died in March 2004 at [[Rikshospitalet]], having gone through a lengthy struggle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jostein Nerbøvik 1938-2004|last=Nore|first=Aslak|authorlink=Aslak Nore|date=20 March 2004|work=[[Klassekampen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kristijonas Donelaitis''' (1 January 1714 – 18 February 1780; {{lang-la|Christian Donalitius}}&lt;ref name="Suziedelis2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suziedelis|first=Saulius A.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lithuania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkGB1CSfIlEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=17 February 2018|date=2011-02-07|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810875364|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Prussian Lithuanians|Prussian Lithuanian]]&lt;ref name=lane/&gt; poet and [[Lutheran]] pastor. He lived and worked in [[Lithuania Minor]], a territory in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], that had a sizable Lithuanian-speaking minority. He wrote the first classic Lithuanian language poem, ''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]'' ({{lang-lt|Metai}}), which became one of the principal works of Lithuanian poetry.&lt;ref name=BALT/&gt; The poem, a classic work of [[Lithuanian literature]], depicts everyday life of Lithuanian peasants, their struggle with [[serfdom]], and the annual cycle of life.&lt;ref name=CONOR/&gt;

==Early life==
Donelaitis was born at [[Gusevsky District|Lasdinehlen]] estate near [[Gumbinnen]], [[East Prussia]].  His parents were free peasants who owned the land that they cultivated. His father died in 1720, leaving seven children (4 sons and 3 daughters). One of his three brothers, Friedrich, became a goldsmith in [[Königsberg]]. Another brother, Michael, inherited the father's farm. His third brother, Adam, became a [[blacksmith]] and innkeeper.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

In 1731, Donelaitis began attending the cathedral school in [[Kneiphof]], a section of Königsberg.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; He lived in a pauper's dormitory and often went hungry for days.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; After graduation, he received a scholarship in 1736 to study at the [[University of Königsberg]]. For four years he studied Lutheran theology. His world view was shaped by the classical curriculum, required Lithuanian studies, and the [[Pietism]] movement.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; He learned the [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[French language|French]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] languages, and studied the writings of classical authors such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], [[Horace]], and [[Virgil]].&lt;ref name=el/&gt; After graduation, he was appointed as a [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] in Stallupönen(Lithuanian: Stalupėnai) (now [[Nesterov|Nesterov, Kaliningrad Oblast]]). After the school rector died, Donelaitis took over his position. In 1743, he passed the required examination to become a pastor in Tollmingkehmen(Lithuanian: Tolminkiemis) (now [[Chistye Prudy, Kaliningrad Oblast]]).&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

==Life in Tollmingkehmen==
[[File:Tolminkiemis9.JPG|thumb|left|Inside the former Lutheran church of Tollmingkehmen, built by Donelaitis. In 1964, it was transformed into a memorial museum of Donelaitis.]]
Donelaitis lived in Tollmingkehmen from 1743 to his death in 1780. At the time, the parish of Tollmingkehmen had around 30 villages with around 3,000 residents.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The population was about two-thirds German and one-third Lithuanian.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; In 1744 Donelaitis married Anna Regina Ohlefant, widow of the school rector in Stallupönen. In 1747, he worked to restore the [[rectory]], and built a new brick church in 1756. In 1757, during the [[Seven Years' War]], Donelaitis and his parishioners retreated to the [[Romincka Forest]] to hide from Russian invaders.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; When he returned to the town, Donelaitis refused to preach praises to the [[Russian Tsar]]. After the war he rebuilt a burned school and sponsored construction of a shelter to widows. His hobbies included building thermometers and barometers, and constructing [[piano]]s and [[clavichord]]s.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;  He died, aged 66, in [[Tollmingkehmen]], [[East Prussia]].

==Works==
[[File:First page of the Donelaitis' Metai manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|The original first page of ''Spring Joys'', which is considered the beginning of ''The Seasons'']]
None of Donelaitis' works were published during his lifetime. Donelaitis wrote at least three poems in the German language (''An der Amstrath Donalitius nach dem Verlust seiner Gattin'', ''Der Gott der Finsterniss'', and ''Unschuld sei mein ganzes Leben'').&lt;ref name=le/&gt; His Lithuanian works consist of six [[fable]]s and the poem ''[[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]''. Donelaitis' publisher, [[Ludwig Rhesa]], believed that the fables, based on [[Aesop's Fables]], were written for his students in Stallupönen.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Their language and poetic rhythm are not as well-developed as in his later works.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

His major work, ''The Seasons'', was titled by Rheza. It consisted of four [[idyll]]s, totaling 2,997 [[hexameter]]s.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The work was a long-term project, often revised and rewritten, without a clear beginning or ending. Only two original idylls survive. The other two were destroyed during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=le/&gt; The full work is known from a copy made by Pastor Hohlfeldt after 1794. Between 1809 and 1818, Rheza collected Donelaitis' works, edited and translated them, and finally published it as ''Das jahr in vier Gesängen''.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; It was a heavily edited and censored edition, containing only about one sixth of the original poem. In 1824, Rheza also published the fables. A fuller publication of ''The Seasons'' was prepared by [[August Schleicher]] in 1865, but this edition was criticized by [[Georg H. F. Nesselmann]], who prepared an edition in 1869.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

==Legacy==

K.Donelaitis and his works are important part of Lithuanian culture and led to creation of literature and music works based on Donelaitis' life and his poem ''Seasons''.
In [[Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] in 1985 opera ''Kristijonas'' by Algimantas Bražinskas was performed.

'''Kw'adza''' (Qwadza) is an extinct [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language formerly spoken in [[Tanzania]] in the Mbulu District.  The last speaker died sometime between 1976 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; It is poorly attested, and apart from perhaps being close to [[Aasáx language|Aasax]], its classification is not certain; although it has a large number of identifiably Cushitic roots, the numerals ''itame'' 'one' and ''be'a ~ mbɛa'' 'two', for example, suggest a connection with [[Hadza language|Hadza]].

== Phonology ==
The phonology is not certain, but the following has been suggested (Ehret 1980):

{|class="IPA wikitable"
|m||n|| ||ɲ||ŋ|| ||
|-
|b||d|| || ||ɡ||ɡʷ||
|-
|p||t|| || ||k||kʷ||ʔ
|-
| ||tsʼ||tɬʼ||tʃʼ||kʼ||kʼʷ||
|-
|f||s||ɬ|| ||x||xʷ||h
|-
|β̞||dz||l||j|| || ||
|}
{{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} have the allophones {{IPA|[dʒ]}} and {{IPA|[ɽ]}} before front vowels. {{IPA|/tʃʼ/}} is 'mildly' ejective. Ehret reports that {{IPA|/kʼ/}} and {{IPA|/kʼʷ/}} are voiced {{IPA|[ɡ, ɡʷ]}} if a preceding consonant is voiced. 

Vowels are {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">In [[computer science]], a '''linear grammar''' is a [[context-free grammar]] that has at most one nonterminal in the [[Left-hand side and right-hand side of an equation|right hand side]] of each of its productions.

A '''linear language''' is a language generated by some linear grammar.

==Example==
A simple linear grammar  is ''G'' with ''N'' = {S}, Σ = {a, b}, ''P'' with start symbol ''S'' and rules
: S &amp;rarr; aSb
: S &amp;rarr; &amp;epsilon;
It generates the language &lt;math&gt;\{ a^ib^i \; | \; i \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Relationship with regular grammars==
Two special types of linear grammars are the following:
* the '''left-linear''' or left regular grammars, in which '''all nonterminals''' in right hand sides are '''at the left ends''';
* the '''right-linear''' or right regular grammars, in which '''all nonterminals''' in right hand sides are '''at the right ends'''.
Collectively, these two special types of linear grammars are known as the [[regular grammar]]s; both can describe exactly the [[regular language]]s.

Another special type of linear grammar is the following:
* linear grammars in which all nonterminals in right hand sides are at the left or right ends, but not necessarily all at the same end.

By inserting new nonterminals, every linear grammar can be brought into this form without affecting the language generated.
For instance, the rules of ''G'' above can be replaced with
: S &amp;rarr; aA
: A &amp;rarr; Sb
: S &amp;rarr; &amp;epsilon;

Hence, linear grammars of this special form can generate all linear languages.

==Expressive power==
All regular languages are linear; conversely, an example of a linear, non-regular language is {a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;}, as explained above.
All linear languages are [[context-free language|context-free]]; conversely, an example of a context-free, non-linear language is the [[Dyck language]] of well-balanced bracket pairs.
Hence, the regular languages are a [[proper subset]] of the linear languages, which in turn are a proper subset of the context-free languages.

While the linear languages that are regular languages are [[deterministic context-free language|deterministic]], there exist linear languages that are nondeterministic. For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the linear grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε.  An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John |author2=[[Rajeev Motwani]] |author3=[[Jeffrey Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] 2nd edition | year = 2001 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | pages = 249–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This language is nondeterministic. Since nondeterministic context-free languages cannot be accepted in linear time, linear languages cannot be accepted in linear time in the general case. Furthermore, it is undecidable whether a given context-free language is a linear context-free language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Greibach | first=Sheila | title=The Unsolvability of the Recognition of Linear Context-Free Languages |date=October 1966 | work=Journal of the ACM | volume=13 | issue=4 | doi=10.1145/321356.321365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure properties==
If ''L'' is a linear language and ''M'' is a regular language, then the intersection &lt;math&gt;L \cap M&lt;/math&gt; is again a linear language; in other words, the linear languages are closed under intersection with regular sets. Furthermore, the linear languages are closed under [[String operations#String homomorphism|homomorphism]] and [[String operations#String homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman, ''[[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]]'', Addison-Wesley Publishing, Reading Massachusetts, 1979. {{ISBN|0-201-02988-X}}., Ex. 11.1, pp. 282f&lt;/ref&gt; These three closure properties show that the linear languages form a [[cone (formal languages)|full trio]]. Full trios in general are language families that enjoy a couple of other desirable mathematical properties.

'''Linguistic philosophy''' is the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, the latter the position of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34494">[[Image:Map of sinitic languages full-en.svg|thumb|500px|Geographic distribution of [[Chinese language]] families within the [[Greater China Region]] including [[mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] (not shown on the map)]]

The following is a list of [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese languages and dialects]], many of which are [[mutually unintelligible]].

== Classification ==

Linguists classify these varieties as the [[Sinitic]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] [[language family]]. Within this broad classification, there are between seven and fourteen subgroups, depending on the classification.

== Traditional classification ==

The traditional Chinese classification lists seven groups, comprising:

* [[Mandarin Chinese|Guan]] (including [[Beijing dialect|Beijing]] and [[Nanjing dialect|Nanjing]] variants)
* [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (including the [[Shanghainese]] and [[Suzhounese]] variants)
* [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (including the [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]] variants)
* [[Min Chinese|Min]] (including the [[Hokkien]] and [[Fuzhounese]] variants)
* [[Hakka language|Hakka]] (Kejia)
* [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] (Hunanese)
* [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] (Jiangxinese)

(shown here with the [[Romanization|romanized]] [[Standard Chinese]] names of the categories, ordered alphabetically).

== Modern linguistic classification ==

[[James Matisoff]]'s classification is as follows:

* [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] → [[Jin Chinese|Jin]]
* [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] → [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]]
* [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] → [[Pinghua]]
* [[Min Chinese|Min]]
* [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]]
* [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka (Kejia)]]
* [[Gan Chinese|Gan]]

Matisoff's list uses the common English names of the groups, ordered by decreasing number of speakers of languages within the group.

== Distinction between dialects and languages ==

In addition to the varieties listed below, it is customary to speak informally of dialects of each province (such as [[Sichuan dialect]] and [[Hainan dialect]]). These designations do not generally correspond to classifications used by linguists, but each nevertheless has characteristics of its own.

==List in the ''Atlas''==
The extensive 1987 ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' groups Chinese topolects (geographical varieties) as follows.  Units are:
*Supergroup (''dàqū''), of which there are but two: Mandarin and Min
*Group (''qū''), corresponding to the [[varieties of Chinese]] of the ISO standard
*Subgroup (''piàn''), which may be mutually unintelligible with other subgroups&lt;ref&gt;For example, though the Southwestern Mandarin of Chengdu is intelligible to speakers of Standard Chinese, other local variants of Southwestern Mandarin may not be mutually intelligible to each other.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cluster (''xiǎopiànn''), which may be mutually unintelligible with other clusters
*Local dialect (''diǎn''), which are the dialects sampled by the ''Atlas''

In the list below,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kurpaska (2010) ''Chinese Language(s):  A look through the prism of The Great Dictionary of Chinese Dialects''&lt;/ref&gt; local dialects are not listed.  Groups are in bold, subgroups are numbered, and clusters are bulleted.

'''María Victoria Moreno Márquez''' (1 May 1939 – 22 November 2005) was a Spanish writer and teacher. She was one of the pioneers of literature for children and young people in Galician. The [[Galician Literature Day|Day of Galician Literature]] was devoted to her on 17 May 2018.

==Life==
Born in a town bordering Portugal, she was the daughter of a lawyer and a teacher, studied in Barcelona and graduated in Romance Studies from the University of Madrid, where she was taught by Rafael Lapesa and Dámaso Alonso.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culturagalega.gal/album/detalle.php?id=60|title=María Victoria Moreno {{!}} Álbum de mulleres {{!}} culturagalega.org|website=culturagalega.gal|language=gl|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending two years in Lugo and some time in Vilalonga (Sanxenxo), where she began to write Anagnórise, she arrived in Pontevedra in 1963 as a teacher (later a professor) and taught at the IES Valle-Inclán and the IES Gonzalo Torrente Ballester.

She actively participated in the cultural and political life of Pontevedra. Her fascination from a very young age with Galicia and its language led to an absolute commitment to the defence and promotion of Galician.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6273">'''Master of Wine''' ('''MW''') is a [[professional certification|qualification]] (not an [[academic degree]]) issued by The Institute of Masters of Wine in the [[United Kingdom]]. The MW qualification is generally regarded in the wine industry as one of the highest standards of professional knowledge.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 430"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Robinson, Jancis | encyclopedia=[[The Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title= Masters of Wine |year=2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |pages= 430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://wineonsix.com/cms-wset-master-sommelier-master-of-wine/ |title=The differences of the CMS, WSET, Master Sommelier, &amp; Master of Wine|website=Wine on VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was founded in 1955, but the MW examinations were first arranged in 1953 by the [[Worshipful Company of Vintners]] and the Wine and Spirits Association.&lt;ref&gt;Masters of Wine [http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/about/index.cfm About the Institute of Masters of Wine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723100704/http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/about/index.cfm |date=2012-07-23 }}, accessed on December 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The Institute of Masters of Wine is a [[non-profit]] organization funded by its members and by corporate sponsorship from within the [[wine]] industry. Its stated objectives are:
* To promote the knowledge, understanding and appreciation of wine;
* To uphold the highest standards within the wine industry;
* To enhance personal and professional goals in pursuing wine-related activities.

==Qualification==
Before enrolling in the MW study programme, prospective students must hold an advanced wine qualification, at least Diploma level from the [[Wine &amp; Spirit Education Trust]], or an appropriately high level sommelier certificate, such as Advanced Sommelier from the [[Court of Master Sommeliers]]. Also, prospective students need to have a minimum of three years' professional work experience in the global wine community. Applicants must submit a basic essay, a tasting paper, a brief statement explaining their interest in becoming a Master of Wine, and a reference to support their application, from a Master of Wine or another senior wine trade professional. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/education/who-can-apply.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The study programme is made up of three stages. Stage 1 is the foundation year and gives students the opportunity to meet Masters of Wine and fellow students in both professional and social settings. Stage 1 assessment includes six pieces of work throughout the year, culminating in an exam that takes place in early June. The exam involves one tasting paper and two essays. Stage 2 is a crucial time for students - it can be very intense but immensely rewarding. Students must provide three pieces of work for assessment throughout the Stage 2 year, and must pass both the Theory and Practical parts of the June MW Examination in order to progress to the Research Paper in Stage 3. The Research paper is an individual paper of between 6,000 and 10,000 words in length, on a topic of the student's choice. The whole qualification takes at least three years to complete in full.

==Membership==
Until 1983, the examination was limited to United Kingdom wine importers, merchants and retailers.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Sam, ''The New York Times'' (April 7, 2004). [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/07/dining/noses-seek-wine-geekdom-s-biggest-prize.html Noses Seek Wine Geekdom's Biggest Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; The first non-UK Master of Wine was awarded in 1988.  As of October 2017, there are 369 MWs in the world, living in 29 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastersofwine.org/en/aboutus/faq.cfm#faq-4AE63C9C-8BB8-4C38-B31F29F92F3808EA|title=Frequently asked questions: How many Masters of Wine are there? In how many countries?|last=|first=|date=|website=The Institute of Masters of Wine|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MWs are spread across 5 continents, wherein UK has 208 MWs, USA has 45 MWs, Australia has 24 MWs and France only has 16 MWs. There are 9 countries with 1 MW each on the list. 

Today, members hold a range of occupations including [[winemaker]]s, [[Viticulture|viticulturists]], winemaking consultants, wine writers and journalists, wine educators, and wine service, restaurant and hotel management.  In addition, many are involved in the purchasing, importing, distribution, sales and marketing of wine. Typically, [[sommelier]]s choose to become [[Master Sommelier]], but only a handful of individuals have achieved both qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Janet, ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' (September 22, 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">'''Miller twist rule''' is a mathematical formula created by Don Miller to calculate the optimum rate of twist for a given bullet traveling through a [[Rifling|rifled]] barrel.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;Miller, Don. ''[http://www.jbmballistics.com/bibliography/articles/miller_stability_2.pdf How Good Are Simple Rules For Estimating Rifling Twist]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Precision Shooting - June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Miller suggests that while [[Alfred George Greenhill|Greenhill]]'s formula works well there are better and more precise ways to calculate what the proper twist rate for a bullet should be that are not much more difficult to calculate.

==Formula==
[[File:.30-06 Springfield.svg|thumb|400px|A diagram of a [[.30-06 Springfield]] showing the bullet diameter (7.85 mm) and length (31.28 mm).]]
The following formula is one recommended by Miller.&lt;ref name="c1" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{t}^2 = \frac{30m}{sd^3l(1+l^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* m = bullet mass in grains
* s = gyroscopic stability factor (dimensionless)
* d = bullet diameter in inches
* l = bullet length in calibers
* t = twist in calibers per turn

Given those definitions we can expand:

&lt;math&gt;{t} = \frac{T}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = twist in inches per turn, and

&lt;math&gt;{l} = \frac{L}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = bullet length in inches.

===Stability factor===
Using Miller's formula we can also calculate the stability factor assuming we already know the twist. Simply solve for &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;{s} = \frac{30m}{t^2d^3l(1+l^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Twist in inches per turn===
It is possible to solve for twist in inches/turn directly by solving for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{T} = \sqrt{\frac{30m}{sdl(1+l^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Notes===
Note that the constant 30 is Miller roughly approximating the velocity as 2800&amp;nbsp;ft/sec, standard temperature (59 degrees Fahrenheit), and pressure (750&amp;nbsp;mm Hg and 78% humidity) in the equation. Miller states that these values are taken from the [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Army Standard Metro]] but does note that his values are slightly off. He goes on to point out that the difference should be small enough that it can be ignored.

It should also be noted that the bullet density is missing from Miller's formula despite the fact that Miller himself states his formula expands upon Greenhill's. The bullet density in the equation above is implicit in &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; through the [[moment of inertia]] approximation.

Finally, note that the denominator in Miller's equation is based upon the relative shape of a modern bullet. &lt;math&gt;l(1+l^2)&lt;/math&gt; is roughly the formula for the shape of an American football.

===Safe values===
When computing this formula Miller states several ''safe'' values that can be used in place of some of the more difficult to determine variables. For example, he states that assuming a [[Mach number|mach]] number of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; = 2.5 (or roughly 2800&amp;nbsp;ft/sec assuming standard conditions at sea level where 1 Mach is roughly 1116&amp;nbsp;ft/sec) is a safe value to use in regards to velocity. He also states that rough estimates that involve temperature should use &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = 2.0.

==Example==
If we take the [[Nosler]] [[Spitzer (bullet)|Spitzer]] [[.30-06 Springfield]] round, which is similar to the one pictured above, we can easily fill in the variables and calculate the estimated twist rate.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nosler.com/Reloading-Data/30-06-Springfield-180-Grains.aspx Nosler - Up Front] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114043727/http://www.nosler.com/Reloading-Data/30-06-Springfield-180-Grains.aspx |date=2012-01-14 }}'', Accessed February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the formula

&lt;math&gt;t = \sqrt{\frac{30m}{sd^3l(1+l^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

We then fill in:
* m = 180 grains
* s = 2.0 (the safe value noted above)
* d = .308 inches
* l = 1.180" /.308" = 3.83 calibers

&lt;math&gt;t = \sqrt{\frac{30 * 180}{2.0 * .308^3 * 3.83(1+3.83^2)}} = 39.2511937&lt;/math&gt;

Which tells us we have 39.2511937 calibers per turn. We calculate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and see that

&lt;math&gt;T = 39.2511937 * .308 = 12.0893677&lt;/math&gt;

So our rifling should be roughly 12" per turn. The average twist of [[.30-06]] caliber rifles is 10 inches per turn, so 12 inches per turn is fairly accurate. The discrepancy seen here also helps explain why certain bullets seem to work better in certain rifles when fired under similar conditions.

==Comparison to Greenhill's formula==
Greenhill's formula is actually much more complicated in full form. The [[rule of thumb]] that Greenhill devised based upon his formula is actually what is seen in most places, including [[rifling|Wikipedia]]. That rule was:

&lt;math&gt;Twist = \frac{C D^2}{L} \times \sqrt{\frac{SG}{10.9}}&lt;/math&gt;

The actual formula was:&lt;ref&gt;Mosdell, Matthew. ''The Greenhill Formula''. {{cite web |url=http://www.mamut.net/MarkBrooks/newsdet35.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718205935/http://www.mamut.net/MarkBrooks/newsdet35.htm |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} (Accessed 2009 AUG 19)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{s^2 * m^2}{C_{M_\alpha} \div \sin(a) * t * d * v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* S = gyroscopic stability
* s = spin rate in radians per second
* m = polar moment of inertia
* &lt;math&gt;C_{M_\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Stability derivatives|pitching moment coefficient]]
* a = angle of attack
* t = transverse moment of inertia
* d = air density
* v = velocity

Thus, Miller, in essence, took Greenhill's rule of thumb and expanded it slightly while, at the same time, keeping the formula simple enough to calculate without advanced training in mathematics. To improve on Greenhill, Miller used mostly empirical data and some basic geometry.

==Corrective equations==
Miller, in his work, notes several corrective equations that can be used:

The velocity (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) correction for twist (&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;f_v{^{1/2}} = [\frac{v}{2800}]^{1/6}&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) correction for stability factor (&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt;f_v = [\frac{v}{2800}]^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

The altitude (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) correction under standard conditions: &lt;math&gt;f_a = e^{3.158x10^{-5} * h}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is altitude in feet.

A '''networked book''' is an open book designed to be written, edited, and read in a networked environment.&lt;ref&gt;This definition of the networked book was introduced in a paper written by Kim White about a project undertaken by the Institute for the Future of the Book [http://www.futureofthebook.org] it was published by Kairosnews [http://www.kairosnews.org/node/4328] as part of the C&amp;W Online 2005 Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a platform for social exchange, and is potentially linked to other books and other discussions. [[Wikipedia]] can be considered a networked book.

==Characteristics==
The networked book has four primary characteristics: 
*The Networked Book is an Open Book
*The Networked Book is Structurally Granular or Disaggregated
*The Networked Book is Social
*The Networked Book is Processed

===Open book===
The networked book maintains an open structure during all or part of its creation. For example, [[Lawrence Lessig]]'s, ''[[Code: Version 2.0]]'' used a [[wiki]] to open the editing process for the second edition of ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]],'' in order to "draw upon the creativity and knowledge of the community. This is an online, collaborative book update; a first of its kind. Once the project nears completion, Professor Lessig will take the contents of this wiki and ready it for publication." In other words, at some point the book was declared finished, and closed to further input and adjustment by the community.  Another example of an open book structure is the popular [[Wikipedia]]. This online wiki encyclopedia is entirely and ''indefinitely'' open.

Another example of a networked book is Turbulence.org's 2009 commissioned anthology, [[Networked: a (networked book) about (networked art)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkedbook.org/|title=Networked: a (networked_book) about (networked_art):|work=turbulence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website explores writing, art, and culture in networked society, and explores the subject on multiple levels.  In addition to the thematic matter, the initial commissioned authors were invited to submit chapters using a [[blog]] or  [[wiki]] format. While seven of the authors chose the blog format (with the CommentPress plugin), artist/theorist [[Patrick Lichty]] created a [[wiki]]-formatted chapter, "Art in the Age of Dataflow",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lichty.networkedbook.org/|title=Art in the Age of Dataflow:|work=turbulence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which discusses literary theories of spatial narrative from its inception in the 1940s to the age of [[big data]].  Like [[Lawrence Lessig]]'s text, Dataflow was intended as a propositional text from which the online community expand on the original chapter.  The chapter as it existed in 2012 was captured and included in Lichty's Institute for Networked Culture book, "Variant Analyses, Interrogations of New Media Art and Culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/no-12-variant-analyses-interrogations-of-new-media-art-and-culture-patrick-lichty/|title=Variant Analyses, Interrogations of New Media Art and Culture:|work=Intstitute for Networked Culture, Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structurally granular or disaggregated===
The networked book manifests a certain "disarticulation of the body of text" and "disaggregated/reaggregated" structure as described by Raffaele Simone in his essay,  ''The Body of the Text.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/6794.html|title=The Future of the Book|work=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Disarticulation of the body of the text occurs when the text generated by an author is not perceived as closed to external interventions, an entity to which the author can have access only to read (or, to use an information science image, in the manner of [[read-only memory|ROM]], that is "read only"), but as an open entity to which one has access—for purposes of both reading and writing. When the text is disarticulated it is perceived as an entity which can be disaggregated (broken apart), manipulated, and reaggregated (reassembled) without damaging the text per se or the author."

The networked book is a form that helps us reconstruct and understand the prolific and increasingly granular world of information that surrounds us. Moreover, the networked book sets up formats that are often designed to update continually, incorporating new information and reconfiguring the book to accommodate new content and present it coherently.

Jonathan Harris' ''10 x 10''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenbyten.org/|title=10x10 / 100 Words and Pictures that Define the Time / by Jonathan J. Harris|work=tenbyten.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; builds its content from [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds. The piece selects the most frequently used words from the major news networks to assemble an hourly "portrait" of our world. This visualization tool represents a type of structure that we will soon see in networked books. The human editor/programmer creates the search and visualization function and the machine then collects, edits, and presents text and images according to criteria built into the program. This type of "book" format depends on granular content that can be "manipulated and reaggregated" by a tool.

===Social===
[[Social software]] environments create spaces for communal authorship. They allow raw, unedited content to be collectively assembled within the nascent form of the electronic book itself, facilitating a gestational space for content to evolve from spontaneous discussion into an edited "book" according to the activity of the social network. [[LiveJournal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livejournal.com/|title=LiveJournal: Discover global communities of friends who  share your unique passions and interests.|work=livejournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful model for socially networked books.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[McKenzie Wark]]'s [http://www.futureofthebook.org/gamertheory/ GAM3R 7H30RY 1.1], an open book experiment produced by the [http://www.futureofthebook.org Institute for the Future of the Book].&lt;/ref&gt;

The multiple-author forum creates a different kind of thinking environment. Individual points of view are mediated by multiple voices. This may allow for a more democratic approach to issues and a multifaceted rendering of topics not possible in the single-author print model.

===Processed===
The future book will be a networked book or a "[[Processed Book Project|processed book]]" as [[Joseph Esposito]] [http://prosaix.com/pbos] calls it. To process a book, he says, is more than simply building links to it; processing also includes a modification of the act of creation, which tends to encourage the absorption of the book into a network of applications, including but not restricted to commentary. This "processing" creates iterations of the book: critiques, revisions and trajectories that accumulate around the original draft. The iterations of [[Wikipedia]] are a good example of this principle. The networked book, as a process-based knowledge machine incorporates the thinking ''process'' of multiple authors.

==Processing the networked book==
It is useful, in this case, to compare the processing of a networked book to the standard editorial procedures found in print culture. Both print books and networked books originate from an idea conceived by a senior editor or an author. However, the participatory framework of a networked book is articulated by a designer, and executed by a programmer, before the content is written or assembled, thus creating an open book structure. Paper-based books are turned over to the designer, production artist and printer after the content is finished, resulting in a closed book structure. The networked book is assembled, in whole or in part, by a community of authors according to the thesis imagined by the editor/author and within the space created by the designer and programmer. The community of contributors acts as both author and reader, which is drastically different from the single-author print model wherein, reader is audience rather than co-creator. In a networked book, content is generated and revised by the community and the various iterations of the text are often saved and can be returned to and discussed. In a paper-based book, content is generally constructed by a single author and is revised under the supervision of an editor. The readers have no part in this process and the revisions are only examined and debated in special cases, and then usually by scholars or authors, not by the general readership. After the content has been generated by the community within the framework of the network book's thesis and architecture, the reader/editor implements strategies for marking out meaningful pathways through the material using search engines and visualization applications.

'''Obfuscation''' is the [[wikt:obscure#Verb|obscuring]] of the intended [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of [[communication]] by making the message difficult to understand, usually with [[mental confusion|confusing]] and [[ambiguity|ambiguous]] language. The obfuscation might be either unintentional or [[intention|intentional]] (although intent usually is [[connotation|connoted]]), and is accomplished with [[circumlocution]] (talking around the subject), the use of [[jargon]] (technical language of a profession), and the use of an [[argot]] ([[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] language) of limited communicative value to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Tom McArthur, Ed., (1992) p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[expository writing]], unintentional obfuscation usually occurs in [[draft document]]s, at the beginning of [[composition (language)|composition]]; such obfuscation is illuminated with [[critical thinking]] and editorial revision, either by the writer or by an editor. Etymologically, the word ''obfuscation'' derives from the Latin ''obfuscatio'', from [[wikt:obfuscate#Etymology|''obfuscāre'' (to darken)]]; synonyms include the words [[wikt:beclouding|beclouding]] and [[wikt:abstrusity#Noun|abstrusity]].

==Background==
Doctors are faulted for using [[jargon]] to conceal unpleasant facts from a patient; the American author and physician [[Michael Crichton]] said that [[medical writing]] is a "highly skilled, calculated attempt to confuse the reader". The psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]] said that medical notation is a form of multiple audience control, which allows the doctor to communicate to the pharmacist things which the patient might oppose if he or she could understand medical jargon.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957) ''Verbal Behavior'' p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eschew==
"Eschew obfuscation", also stated as "eschew obfuscation, espouse elucidation", is a humorous [[fumblerules|fumblerule]] used by English teachers and professors when lecturing about proper writing techniques. Literally, the phrase means "avoid being unclear" or "avoid being unclear, support being clear", but the use of relatively uncommon words causes confusion in much of the audience (those lacking the [[vocabulary]]), making the statement an example of [[irony]], and more precisely a [[heterological]] phrase. The phrase has appeared in print at least as early as 1959, when it was used as a section heading in a [[NASA]] document.&lt;ref&gt;United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ''NASA Technical Memorandum'' (1959), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier similar phrase appears in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses]]'', where he lists rule fourteen of good writing as "eschew [[surplusage]]".

==White box cryptography==
In white-box cryptography, obfuscation refers to the protection of cryptographic keys from extraction when they are under the control of the adversary, e.g., as part of a [[Digital rights management|DRM]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Chow S, Eisen P, Johnson H, et al. A white-box DES implementation for DRM applications[M]//Digital Rights Management. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2002: 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Network security==
In [[network security]], obfuscation refers to methods used to obscure an attack payload from inspection by network protection systems.

The principal musician in an [[orchestra]], as well as any large [[musical ensemble]], is the lead player for each respective section of instruments. For example, there are multiple sections of an orchestra. The [[String instrument|strings]], [[woodwinds]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] sections all have subsections. The first [[violin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, second violins, [[viola]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[cello]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[double bass]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;es, [[flute]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[clarinet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[oboe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[bassoon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[trumpet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[trombone]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[French horn]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[tuba]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and percussion are all subsections, each possessing a principal musician. Most musical ensembles possess some variety of subsection, with each subsection having a principal player. The principal for each section is the most talented and valuable player. The principal is usually decided with a rigorous [[audition]] process. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horvath|first1=Janet|title=Team Orchestra- What Does a Section Leader Do?|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/team-orchestra-section-leader/|website=www.interlude.hk|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does a principal lead each section with their talented playing, they lead with verbal and physical communication. Verbally, principals must communicate directions from the [[conductor (music)|conductor]] to the rest of their section. String principals must communicate direction of [[Bowing (music)|bowings]] as well as any changes in direction of bowings. 

Principals also verbally communicate to their section specific [[Musical note|note]]s that sound wrong, or sections in the music that need practicing, in order to maintain the performance level of their section. Physically, sections look to the principal for entrance cues, expression, and intensity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to leading the section, principal musicians play all of the solos written for their instrument in any given piece. The principal first violin is called the [[concertmaster]] (or "leader" in the UK) and is considered the leader of not only the [[string section]], but of the entire orchestra, subordinate only to the [[Conducting|conductor.]]

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] uses the [[Hebrew alphabet]] with optional [[niqqud|vowel diacritics]]. The '''romanization of Hebrew''' is the use of the [[Latin alphabet]] to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] Hebrew words.

For example, the Hebrew name spelled {{hebrew|יִשְׂרָאֵל}} ("Israel") in the Hebrew alphabet can be romanized as ''{{strong|Yisrael}}'' or ''{{strong|Yiśrāʼēl}}'' in the Latin alphabet.

Romanization includes any use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. [[Transliteration]] uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas [[orthographic transcription|transcription]] uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Both what? Transliteration ''already'' includes both by this explanation}}

To go the other way, that is from English to Hebrew, see [[Hebraization of English]]. Both Hebraization of English and Romanization of Hebrew are forms of transliteration. Where these are formalized these are known as "transliteration systems", and, where only some words, not all, are transliterated, this is known as "transliteration policy".

== Transliteration ==

=== When to transliterate ===
{{main|Transliteration}}
Transliteration assumes two different [[Writing system|script systems]]. The use of a French word in English without translation, such as "[[bourgeois]]", is not transliteration. The use of a Hindi word in English such as "[[khaki]]" (originally खाकी) is transliteration. Transliteration of a foreign word into another language is usually the exception to translation, and often occurs when there is something distinctive about the word in the original language, such as a [[double entendre]], [[uniqueness]], religious, cultural or political significance,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. rationale of the author of ''Athenian settlements of the fourth century B.C.'' p. xiii Jack Cargill – 1995 "In relation to Greek words other than personal names, the main issue is deciding when to transliterate, i.e., when to employ an Anglicized Greek word rather than translating the Greek word into English. My tendency is "when in doubt, ..."{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=when in doubt, do, or when in doubt, don't?}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may occur to add local flavour.

In the cases of Hebrew transliteration into English, many Hebrew words have a long history of transliteration, for example [[Amen]], [[Satan]], [[ephod]], [[Urim and Thummim]] have traditionally been transliterated, not translated.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus p. 152 Henry Leopold Ellison – 1982 "THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS II Exodus 28:1–43 (cont'd) THE EPHOD (28:5 14) We have no means of giving a definitive meaning to 'ephod', the English being simply a transliteration of the Hebrew."&lt;/ref&gt; These terms were in many cases also first transliterated into Greek and Latin before English.

Different publishers have different transliteration policies. For example [[ArtScroll]] publications generally transliterate more words relative to sources such as the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] 1911, or [[Jewish Publication Society]] texts.

=== How to transliterate ===
There are various [[transliteration]] standards or systems for Hebrew-to-English; no one system has significant common usage across all fields. Consequently in general usage there are often no hard and fast rules in Hebrew-to-English transliteration, and many transliterations are an approximation due to lack of equivalence between the [[English alphabet|English]] and [[Hebrew alphabet]]s. Conflicting systems of transliteration often appear in the same text, as certain Hebrew words tend to associate with certain traditions of transliteration. For example,
{{quote|For Hanukkah at the synagogue Beith Sheer Chayyim, Isaac donned his talis that Yitzchak sent him from Bet Qehila in Tsfat, Israel.{{Dubious |reason=This screwball example looks made up by a Wikipedia editor, or if not it appears to be an artifact of careless editing|date=April 2017}}}}
This text includes instances of the same word transliterated in different ways: The Hebrew word {{hebrew|בית}} is transliterated as both ''Beith'' and ''Bet''.

These discrepancies in transliterations of the same word can be traced to discrepancies in the transliterations of individual Hebrew letters, reflecting not only different traditions of transliteration into different languages that use Latin alphabets, but also the fact that different pronunciation styles exist for the same letters in Israel (e.g. mainstream secular Ashkenazi pronunciations used in the media versus Mizrahi, Arab, or Orthodox Ashkenazi colloquial pronunciations). For example, ''Hanukkah'' and ''Chayyim'' are transliterated with different initial letter combinations, although in Hebrew both begin with the letter [[Heth|{{hebrew|ח}}]]; the use of "ch" reflects German / Yiddish influence and pronunciation, whereas the "h" or "ḥ" may indicate a softer pronunciation of [[Heth|{{hebrew|ח}}]] as in ancient [[Hebrew]], [[Judeo-Arabic]] or [[Mizrahi Hebrew]]. Similarly, the Hebrew letter [[Taw|{{hebrew|ת}}]] is transliterated as ''th'' in the word ''Beith'', [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|''s'']] in the word [[tallit|''talis'']], and [[Sephardi Hebrew|''t'']] in the word ''Bet'', even though it is the same letter in all three words in Hebrew. The Hebrew letter [[Qoph|{{hebrew|ק}}]] is transliterated as ''c'' in ''Isaac'', ''k'' in ''Yitzchak'', and ''q'' in ''Qehila''. Finally, the Hebrew letter [[Tsade|{{hebrew|צ}}]] is transliterated variously as ''s'' (in ''Isaac''{{Dubious |reason="Issac" is not not a transliteration but rather the English equivalent|date=April 2017}}), ''tz'' (in ''Yitzchak''), and ''ts'' (in ''Tsfat''), again reflecting different traditions of spelling or pronunciation. These inconsistencies make it more difficult for the non-Hebrew-speaking reader to recognize related word forms, or even to properly pronounce the Hebrew words thus transliterated.

== Historic instances ==

Early [[romanization]] of Hebrew occurred with the contact between the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] and the [[Jew]]s. It was influenced by earlier [[transliteration]] into the [[Greek language]]. For example, the name of the Roman province of [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]] (63 BCE) was apparently derived from the Greek words {{lang|grc|Ἰούδα}} (Iouda) and {{lang|grc|Ἰουδαία}} (Ioudaia). These words can be seen in Chapter 1 of [[Esdras]] (Ezra) in the [[Septuagint]], a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek. The Greek words in turn are transliterations of the Hebrew word {{hebrew|יהודה}} (''Yehuda'') that we now know adapted in English as the names [[Judah (surname)|Judah]], Judas and Jude.

In the 1st century, [[Satire XIV|Satire 14]] of Juvenal uses the Hebraic words ''sabbata'', ''Iudaicum'', and ''Moyses'', apparently adopted from the Greek.

The 4th-century and 5th-century Latin translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] romanize its proper names. The familiar Biblical names in English are derived from these romanizations. The [[Vulgate]], of the early 5th century, is considered the first direct Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible. Apart from names, another term that the Vulgate romanizes is the [[technical terminology|technical term]] ''[[mamzer]]'' ({{hebrew|ממזר}}).

With the rise of [[Zionism]], some Jews promoted the use of romanization instead of Hebrew script in hopes of helping more people learn Hebrew. One such promoter was Ithamar Ben Yehuda, or [[Ittamar Ben Avi]] as he styled himself. His father [[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]] raised him to be the first modern native speaker of Hebrew. In 1927 Ben-Avi published the biography ''Avi'' in romanized Hebrew (now listed in the online catalog of the [[Jewish National and University Library]]). However, the innovation did not catch on.

Political activist [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], leader of [[Betar (youth movement)|Betar]], and Chief [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi Kook]], also expressed their support for the reform of Hebrew script using Latin letters.

== Modern uses ==
[[File:Giwatajjim066.jpg|thumbnail|Road signs in [[Israel]] written in [[Hebrew]] and romanized Hebrew transliteration]]
Romanized Hebrew can be used to present Hebrew terminology or text to anyone who is not familiar with the Hebrew script. Many Jewish prayer books include supplementary romanization for some or all of the Hebrew-language congregational prayers.

Romanized Hebrew is also used for Hebrew-language items in library catalogs and Hebrew-language place names on maps. In Israel, most catalogs and maps use the Hebrew script, but romanized maps are easily available and road signs include romanized names. Some Hebrew speakers use romanization to communicate when using internet systems that have poor support for the Hebrew alphabet. Romanized Hebrew is also used in music scores, in part because music is written left-to-right and Hebrew is written right-to-left.

Standard romanizations exist for these various purposes. However, non-standard romanization is widely seen, even on some Israeli street signs. The standards are not generally taught outside of their specific organizations and disciplines.

== Standards ==

*'''Traditional, scholarly''': [[ISO 259]]:1984; [[ISO 259-2]]:1994 (simplified); [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL) Handbook of Style
*'''National''': ''Rules of Transcription: Romanization of Hebrew''. [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], 1957. Updated and augmented with a simplified version, 2000. Replaced by a new system altogether in 2006.
*{{Section link|Artscroll|Transliteration system}}
*'''Bibliographic data''': ANSI Z39.25-1975; [[American Library Association|ALA]]/[[Library of Congress|LC]] Romanization Tables (1991) and their book ''Hebraica Cataloging'' (1987), with ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (1972–1993) as an authority on names and common terms. Library of Congress Authorities is an online database that records and sources the forms of subjects, names, and titles that the Library of Congress uses.
*'''Geographic names''': [[United States Board on Geographic Names|BGN]]/PCGN 1962 (US and UK), approximately equivalent to [[UNGEGN]] 1977 (United Nations), as both are based on the Academy of the Hebrew Language recommendations. However, BGN provides more and somewhat different specific recommendations. The GEONet Names Server is an authoritative online database that lists BGN names and assists with font character availability and conventional forms of names.
*'''Phonemic''': [[ISO 259-3|ISO/FDIS 259-3:1999]] (not an adopted standard)

===Comparative table===

The following table is a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its [[Latin script]] [[transliteration]] values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph if your browser doesn't support right-to-left text layout). The conventions here are [[ISO 259]], the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system,&lt;ref name="Report on UN Romanization"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/rom1_he.pdf "Report on the Current Status of United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names"], Compiled by the UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization Systems Version 4.0, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the modern common informal [[Israel]]i transcription. In addition, an [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] pronunciation is indicated&amp;mdash;historical ([[Tiberian vocalization]]) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.

For the letters {{hebrew|בּ גּ דּ כּ פּ תּ}} with [[dagesh]] in ISO 259 Classical Hebrew and by the Hebrew Academy standard, they are transcribed as single graphemes (b g d k p t) at the beginnings of words, after other consonants, and after [[Shva|shewa]] ְ&amp;nbsp; or ẖatafim ֱ&amp;nbsp; ֲ&amp;nbsp; ֳ&amp;nbsp;. In almost every other situation, they are transcribed as double letters (bb gg dd kk pp tt). This does not apply to common Israeli Hebrew transliteration, where there are no double consonants.

The letters {{hebrew|א ה}} at the ends of words without additional [[niqqud]] are silent and not transliterated. The letter {{hebrew|ו}} at the end of a word with ẖolam ֹ&amp;nbsp; is also silent and not transliterated. The letter {{hebrew|י}} at the end of a word after ẖiriq ִ&amp;nbsp; is also silent and not transliterated. The situation of the letter {{hebrew|י}} at the end of a word after ẕere ֵ&amp;nbsp; or seggol ֶ&amp;nbsp; is more complicated, as they are silent in Classical Hebrew and in Hebrew Academy prescription and not transliterated in those systems, but they form diphthongs (ei) in Israeli Hebrew&amp;mdash;see the vowels and diphthongs sections further down. In any event, the shewa naẖ is placed between two adjacent consonants in all situations; if there is not even a shewa naẖ between consonants, then the first of the two consonants is silent and not transliterated&amp;mdash;this is usually one of {{hebrew|א ו י}}, but even occasionally {{hebrew|ה}} and rarely {{hebrew|ש}} (in the name {{hebrew|יִשָּׂשכָר}} [[Issachar]]) are encountered silent in this fashion. In Israeli Hebrew transcription, a vowel before yud at the end of a word or before yud then shewa naẖ inside a word, is transcribed as a diphthong (ai oi ui)&amp;mdash;see the diphthongs section further down.

In Classical Hebrew transliteration, vowels can be long (gāḏōl), short (qāṭān) or ultra short (ḥăṭep̄), and are transliterated as such. Ultra short vowels are always one of šəwā nāʻ ְ&amp;nbsp;, ḥăṭep̄ səḡōl ֱ&amp;nbsp;, ḥăṭep̄ páṯaḥ ֲ&amp;nbsp; or ḥăṭep̄ qāmeṣ ֳ&amp;nbsp;. Šəwā ְ&amp;nbsp; is ''always'' always šəwā nāʻ (pronounced) if it's immediately after the word's first consonant, or after a consonant after a long vowel and before another pronounced consonant&amp;mdash;otherwise, šəwā is realized as šəwā nāḥ (silent). The vowels ṣērē ֵ&amp;nbsp; and ḥōlem ֹ&amp;nbsp; are always long in all situations. The vowels ḥīreq ִ&amp;nbsp;, səḡōl ֶ&amp;nbsp;, páṯaḥ ַ&amp;nbsp;, qāmeṣ ָ&amp;nbsp;, qibbūṣ ֻ&amp;nbsp; and šūreq {{hebrew|וּ}}&amp;nbsp; are always long if they are the stressed syllable, or if they are in a syllable before only one consonant and another vowel, and in these cases they are transliterated as long. If they are unstressed and before a double consonant or a consonant cluster, or in the word's final ''unstressed'' syllable, then they are always short and transliterated as short. But if a vowel carries an accent ֫&amp;nbsp; or a meteg ֽ&amp;nbsp;, then it is always long&amp;mdash;a meteg in particular is often used in places where a vowel is long but not necessarily the word's stressed syllable. Lastly, there are exceptional circumstances when long vowels&amp;mdash;even ṣērē and ḥōlem&amp;mdash;may not force a following šəwā to become šəwā nāʻ, including for example names such as {{hebrew|גֵּרְשֹׁם}} [[Gershom|Gēršōm]] (not Gērəšōm as it might seem), {{hebrew|בֵּלְשַׁאצַּר}} [[Belshazzar|Bēlšaṣṣạr]] (not Bēləšaṣṣạr) and {{hebrew|צִֽקְלַג}} [[Ziklag|Ṣīqlạḡ]] (not Ṣīqəlạḡ). Some of these seem to be learned exceptions, and most words under the same circumstances have šəwā nāʻ as expected, such as {{hebrew|נָֽצְרַת}} [[Nazareth|Nāṣərạṯ]] (not Nāṣrạṯ). (This is ''all'' moot in Israeli Hebrew, where, as already mentioned, [[shva nach]] tends to opportunistically replace [[shva na]] where comfortable, so {{hebrew|נָֽצְרַת}} is Natzrat not Natzerat, etc.)

For the vowel qamaẕ ָ, whether the vowel is long or short in Classical Hebrew affects the pronunciation in Academy or Israeli Hebrew, even though vowel length is not phonemic in those systems, and the difference is transliterated accordingly. Qamaẕ qatan when short is /o/, except when at the end of a word when not before a final consonant, in which case it is /a/. Qamaẕ gadol is ''usually'' /a/, but in rare situations in Classical Hebrew it can be treated as a long open /ọ/, which although pronounced identically to /ā/ (both were {{IPA|[ɔː]}}), this a/o distinction is clearly made in the pronunciation of Academy and Israeli Hebrew, and is thus transliterated.

If any word ends with one of {{hebrew|הַּ חַ עַ}}, then the vowel pataẖ is pronounced ''before'' the consonant, not after as it is written, and so the ''transliterated'' sequence is /ah/, /aẖ/, /aʻ/, etc.

In certain rare words that are meant to begin with two consecutive consonants even in Classical Hebrew, an invisible səḡōl qāṭān vowel is pronounced before the two consonants in Classical Hebrew and is so transcribed, because Classical words may not begin with more than one consonant. This rule does not apply to Academy and Israeli Hebrew, where consonant clusters are more tolerated. For example, the word {{hebrew|שְׁתַּ֫יִם}} ("two") would appear as štáyim, but is actually ʼeštáyim.{{Dubious |reason=where is the glottal stop and "eh" sound coming from?|date=April 2017}} However, it remains simply shtayim in Academy and Israeli Hebrew.

In 2006, the Hebrew Academy replaced their 1953 transliteration rules with new rules, and these were adopted as a United Nations standard in 2007.&lt;ref name="Report on UN Romanization" /&gt; {{As of|2008}}, migration to the new transliteration standard is still underway, and many signs and documents still use the 1953 conventions. The new 2006 rules attempt to more closely follow Israeli Hebrew vowel habits (such as the collapse of many shva na), but stop short of adopting most of the informal transliteration patterns. It still transliterates the diphthong {{IPA|[e̞͡ɪ]}} as /e/, and it still transliterates separate /ẖ/ and /kh/ in all cases. It is unspecific about rules governing the transliteration of phonemes not traditionally native to Hebrew.

== Transcription vs. transliteration ==

Different purposes call for different choices of romanization. One extreme is to make a phonetic transcription of one person's speech on one occasion.

In Israel, a pronunciation known as General Israeli Hebrew or Standard Hebrew is widely used and documented. For Israeli speech and text where linguistic groups are not at issue, romanization can use a phonetic transcription according to Standard Hebrew pronunciation. However, there are many Israeli groups with differing pronunciations of Hebrew and differing social priorities.

An attempt to devise a more general system of romanization is complicated by the long and varied history of the Hebrew language. Most Hebrew texts can be appropriately pronounced according to several different systems of pronunciation, both traditional and modern. Even today, it is customary to write Hebrew using only consonants and [[matres lectionis]]. There was no way to indicate vowels clearly in Hebrew writing until the time of the [[Second Temple]]. Since an earlier time, multiple geographically separated communities have used Hebrew as a language of literature rather than conversation.

One system of assigning and indicating pronunciation in Hebrew, the [[Tiberian vocalization]], is broadly authoritative for Hebrew text since the end of the Second Temple period (Sáenz-Badillos, page xi). It is possible to accommodate the pronunciations of different communities by transliterating the Tiberian vocalization without attempting to transcribe a specific phonetic pronunciation.

Notable varieties of Hebrew for which Tiberian vocalization is not suitable are the Hebrew of the Qumran community (as known from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) and of the [[Samaritan]]s. For romanizations of Samaritan pronunciation, it is advisable to take quotations directly from a Samaritan edition of the Hebrew Bible, which has approximately 6,000 textual variations from Jewish editions.

It is appropriate to focus only on the consonantal spelling when discussing unusually structured words from ancient or medieval works.

== Use of Tiberian principles ==
{{Main|Tiberian vocalization}}

The Tiberian vocalization was devised in order to add indications of pronunciation to the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, without changing the consonantal text. It was intended for experts in Biblical Hebrew grammar and morphology.

Transliterations usually avoid the typographically complex marks that are used in Tiberian vocalization. They also attempt to indicate vowels and syllables more explicitly than Tiberian vocalization does. Therefore a technical transliteration requires the use of Tiberian principles, as mentioned below, rather than simply representing the Tiberian symbols. Many transliteration standards require a thorough knowledge of these principles, yet they usually do not provide practical details.

=== Vowels ===
* There are seven basic vowels.
* A vowel may be long, short, or ultrashort.
* The vowel "shva" may be sounded (shva na) or silent (shva nach).
* Consonants that have been used historically to indicate vowels, the "matres lectionis", are no substitute for proper vowel marks.
* The vowel "kamets" may have its usual sound (kamets gadol – long "a") or a different sound (kamets katan – short "o").

=== Consonants ===

* Six consonants (beth, gimel, daleth, kaph, pe, and tav) can be hard or soft. To be specific, they are pronounced either as [[Stop consonant|stops]] or [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] ("spirantized"). For example, the letter bet can be pronounced as "b" or "v". Tiberian vocalization marks a hard consonant with a ''[[dagesh]] kal'' (in the Hebrew term) or ''lene'' (Latin). A soft consonant lacks a ''dagesh kal'', and is sometimes explicitly marked using ''[[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]]'', an overbar. Transliterations sometimes also use an overbar or underbar to mark a soft consonant. (In Modern Sephardic Hebrew, however, only three consonants—bet, kaph, and pe—retain the hard–soft distinction. In the Ashkenazic style of pronunciation, the soft tav is sounded as "s".)
* A letter that looks like shin may be that letter (when marked with a shin dot) or the letter sin (when marked with a sin dot).
* Most consonants can undergo [[gemination]]. Tiberian vocalization marks gemination with a ''dagesh hazak'' (in the Hebrew term) or ''forte'' (Latin), which looks the same as ''dagesh kal''.
* A consonant that is normally silent (most often he) may be sounded if it is a root consonant or possessive ending. Tiberian vocalization marks such a consonant using a mapiq, which looks like a dagesh.
* A silent vav may be used to hold a holem vowel, but sometimes a vav with holem has consonant value.

== Additional transliteration principles ==

A further complication is that the Roman alphabet does not have as many letters for certain sounds found in the Hebrew alphabet, and sometimes no letter at all. Some romanizations resolve this problem using additional non-Tiberian principles:

* The two letters that represent a stop may be written using the forward and backward quote marks, or similar marks.
* Certain consonants are considered "emphatic" (the consonants ח ט צ), due to being pronounced traditionally toward the back of the mouth. They may be transliterated distinctively by using an underdot.
* The letter "vav" (ו) was once pronounced like English "w", in contrast to its current pronunciation identical to the letter "vet" (the soft letter ב).
* The Karmeli transcription (see link at bottom of page) creates additional letters based on similar Hebrew or Cyrillic letters to represent the sounds that lack Roman letters.

Finally, for ease of reading it is common to apply certain principles foreign to Hebrew:
* Use a hyphen between common prefixes or suffixes and a romanized word.
* Capitalize the first letter of a proper name, but not its prefixes.

A '''satellite town''' or '''satellite city''' is a concept in [[urban planning]] that refers essentially to smaller [[metropolitan area]]s which are located somewhat near to, but are mostly independent of larger metropolitan areas.

==Characteristics==
Satellite cities are small or medium-sized cities near a large [[metropolis]], that:

*predate the metropolis' suburban expansion
*are at least partially independent from that metropolis economically and socially
*are physically separated from the metropolis by rural territory or by a major geographic barrier such as a large river; satellite cities should have their own independent [[list of United States urban areas|urbanized area]], or equivalent
*have their own [[commuter town|bedroom communities]]
*have a traditional downtown surrounded by traditional "inner city" neighborhoods
*may or may not be counted as part of the large metropolis' [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]]

===Quick reference===
In the [[United States]], the easiest way to tell if a community is a satellite city or some other type of development (see below) is to refer to the [[List of United States urban areas]], to see if it has its own independent urbanized area or is considered to be part of the urbanized area of its larger neighbor. This rule has exceptions, but should generally be followed.

==Satellite cities versus other types of settlement==
Satellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development.

===Suburbs===
Satellite cities differ from [[suburb]]s in that they have distinct employment bases, commutersheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not [[bedroom communities]].

===Edge cities===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
Satellite cities differ from [[edge city|edge cities]], which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic [[downtown]], a distinct independent [[municipal government]], existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by ''both'' their own family of [[bedroom communities]] ''and'' a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Conceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge city could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas, but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves.

Some satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the ''uptown'' variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous.

===Multi-polar cities===
In some cases large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin cities]]. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in such cases :
*satellites are clearly much less important than the larger center around which they are located, while the various nodes of multi-polar cities are close to each other in importance
*satellites are separated from the larger center by a substantial belt of rural territory, while twin cities may be fully integrated in physical form

For example, [[Fort Worth, Texas]] is a twin of [[Dallas, Texas]] because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite. Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same [[List of United States urban areas|urbanized area]] should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other.

===Metropolitan areas===
Conceptually, satellite cities are miniature [[metro areas]] on the fringe of larger ones. Satellite cities are sometimes listed as part of the larger metro area, and sometimes listed as totally independent. In the United States, satellite cities are often (but not always) listed as independent [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s within a single [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]] that is unified with the larger metropolis.

'''Speech and language impairment''' are basic categories that might be drawn in issues of communication involve hearing, speech, language, and fluency.

A [[Speech disorder|speech impairment]] is characterized by difficulty in articulation of words. Examples include stuttering or problems producing particular sounds. [[Manner of articulation|Articulation]] refers to the sounds, [[syllables]], and [[phonology]] produced by the individual.  [[Voice]], however, may refer to the characteristics of the sounds produced—specifically, the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], quality, and intensity of the sound.  Often, [[fluency]] will also be considered a category under speech, encompassing the characteristics of [[rhythm]], rate, and emphasis of the sound produced &lt;ref name="Batshaw, M.L. 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Batshaw | first1 = Mark L | title = Children with disabilities | volume = 5 | publisher = Paul H. Brookes | year = 2002 | location = Baltimore |oclc=608999305 | isbn = 0-86433-137-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Language disorder|language impairment]] is a specific impairment in understanding and sharing thoughts and ideas, i.e. a disorder that involves the processing of linguistic information. Problems that may be experienced can involve the form of language, including [[grammar]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]]; and the functional aspects of language, including [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]&lt;ref name="Batshaw, M.L. 2002"/&gt;

An individual can have one or both types of impairment. These impairments/disorders are identified by a [[speech-language pathology|speech and language pathologist]].

==Speech disorders==
{{main|Speech disorder}}
The following are brief definitions of several of the more prominent speech disorders:

===Apraxia of speech===
{{main|Apraxia of speech}}
Apraxia of speech is the acquired form of motor speech disorder caused by brain injury, stroke or dementia.

===Developmental verbal dyspraxia===
{{main|Developmental verbal dyspraxia}}
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] refers specifically to a motor speech disorder.  This is a [[neurological disorder]].  Individuals suffering from developmental verbal apraxia encounter difficulty saying sounds, [[syllables]], and words.  The difficulties are not due to weakness of muscles, but rather on coordination between the brain and the specific parts of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Souza TN, Payão Mda C, Costa RC |title=Childhood speech apraxia in focus: theoretical perspectives and present tendencies |journal=Pro Fono |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=76–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19360263 |doi=10.1590/S0104-56872009000100013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/ChildSandL.htm |title=Child Speech and Language |work=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association |accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Apraxia of speech]]''' is the acquired form of this disorder caused by brain injury, stroke or dementia.

Interventions are more effective when they occur individually at first, and between three and five times per week.  With improvements, children with apraxia may be transitioned into group therapy settings.  Therapeutic exercises must focus on planning, sequencing, and coordinating the muscle movements involved in speech production.  Children with developmental verbal dyspraxia must practice the strategies and techniques that they learn in order to improve.  In addition to practice, feedback can be helpful to improve apraxia of speech.  Tactile feedback (touch), visual feedback (watching self in mirror), and verbal feedback are all important additions.&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009). Childhood apraxia of speech. Retrieved July 12, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/ChildhoodApraxia.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Biofeedback has also been cited as a possible therapy.  Functional training involves placing the individual in more speech situations, while providing him/her with a speech model, such as the SLP.&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"/&gt; Because the cause is neurological, however, some patients do not progress.
In these cases, AAC may be more appropriate.

===Dysarthria===
{{main|Dysarthria}}
Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that results from a neurological injury.  Some stem from central damage, while other stem from peripheral nerve damage.  Difficulties may be encountered in respiratory problems, vocal fold function, or velopharyngeal closure, for example.&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Palmer, John |author2=Yantis, Phillip A. |title=Survey of communication disorders |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Baltimore |year=1990 |pages= |isbn=0-683-06743-5 |oclc=20168213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orofacial myofunctional disorders===
{{main|Orofacial myological disorders}}
[[Orofacial myological disorders|Orofacial myofunctional disorders]] refers to problems encountered when the [[tongue]] thrusts forward inappropriately during speech.  While this is typical in infants, most children outgrow this.  Children that continue to exaggerate the tongue movement may incorrectly produce [[speech sound]]s, such as /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/, and /dʒ/.  For example, the word, "some," might be pronounced as "thumb".&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

The treatment of OMD will be based upon the professional's evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009). Orofacial myofunctional disorders. Retrieved July 10, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/OMD.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Each child will present a unique oral posture that must be corrected.  Thus, the individual interventions will vary.  Some examples include:
* increasing awareness of muscles around the mouth
* increasing awareness of oral postures
* improving muscle strength and coordination
* improving speech sound productions
* improving swallowing patterns

===Speech sound disorder===
{{main|Speech sound disorder}}
Speech sound disorders may be of two varieties: [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] (the production of sounds) or [[phonological process]]es (sound patterns).  An articulation disorder may take the form of substitution, omission, addition, or distortion of normal speech sounds.  Phonological process disorders may involve more systematic difficulties with the production of particular types of sounds, such as those made in the back of the mouth, like "k" and "g".&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

Naturally, abnormalities in speech mechanisms would need to be ruled out by a medical professional.  Therapies for articulation problems must be individualized to fit the individual case.  The placement approach—instructing the individual on the location in which the tongue should be and how to blow air correctly—could be helpful in difficulties with certain speech sounds.  Another individual might benefit more from developing auditory discrimination skills, since he/she has not learned to identify error sounds in his/her speech.  Generalization of these learned speech techniques will need to be generalized to everyday situations.&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"/&gt; Phonological process treatment, on the other hand, can involve making syntactical errors, such as omissions in words.  In cases such as these, explicit teaching of the linguistic rules may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009). Speech sound disorders: Articulation and phonological processes. Retrieved July 9, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/SpeechSoundDisorders.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases of [[speech sound disorder]]s, for example, may involve difficulties articulating speech sounds.  Educating a child on the appropriate ways to produce a speech sound and encouraging the child to practice this articulation over time may produce natural speech, Speech sound disorder. Likewise, stuttering does not have a single, known cause, but has been shown to be effectively reduced or eliminated by fluency shaping (based on behavioral principles) and [[stuttering]] modification techniques.

===Stuttering===
{{main|Stuttering}}
Stuttering is a disruption in the fluency of an individual's speech, which begins in childhood and may persist over a lifetime.  Stuttering is a form of [[disfluency]]; disfluency becomes a problem insofar as it impedes successful [[communication]] between two parties.  Disfluencies may be due to unwanted repetitions of sounds, or extension of speech sounds, syllables, or words.  Disfluencies also incorporate unintentional pauses in speech, in which the individual is unable to produce speech sounds.&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

While the effectiveness is debated, most treatment programs for [[stuttering]] are behavioral.  In such cases, the individual learns skills that improve [[oral communication]] abilities, such as controlling and monitoring the rate of speech.  SLPs may also help these individuals to speak more slowly and to manage the physical tension involved in the [[communication]] process.  Fluency may be developed by selecting a slow rate of speech, and making use of short phrases and sentences.  With success, the speed may be increased until a natural rate of smooth speech is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009). Stuttering. Retrieved July 19, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, punishment for incorrect speech production should be eliminated, and a permissive speaking environment encouraged.  Electronic fluency devices, which alter the auditory input and provide modified auditory feedback to the individual, have shown mixed results in research reviews.

Because stuttering is such a common phenomenon, and because it is not entirely understood, various opposing schools of thought emerge to describe its etiology.  The Breakdown theories maintain that stuttering is the result of a weakening or breakdown in physical systems that are necessary for smooth speech production.  Cerebral dominance theories (in the stutterer, no cerebral hemisphere takes the neurological lead) and theories of perseveration (neurological "skipping record" of sorts) are both Breakdown theories.  Auditory Monitoring theories suggest that stutters hear themselves differently from how other people hear them.  Since speakers adjust their communication based upon the auditory feedback they hear (their own speech), this creates conflict between the input and the output process.  Psychoneurotic theories posit repressed needs as the source of stuttering.  Lastly, Learning theories are straightforward—children learn to stutter.  It should be clear that each etiological position would suggest a different intervention, leading to controversy with the field.&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"/&gt;

===Voice disorders===
[[List of voice disorders|Voice disorders]] range from [[aphonia]] (loss of [[phonation]]) to [[dysphonia]], which may be phonatory and/or resonance disorders.  [[Phonatory]] characteristics could include breathiness, hoarseness, harshness, intermittency, [[pitch (music)|pitch]], etc. [[Resonance]] characteristics refer to overuse or underuse of the resonance chambers resulting in [[hypernasality]] or [[hyponasality]].&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"/&gt; Several examples of [[Voice disorders|voice problems]] are [[vocal cord]] nodules or polyps, vocal cord paralysis, paradoxical [[vocal fold]] movement, and spasmodic dysphonia.  Vocal cord nodules and polyps are different phenomena, but both may be caused by vocal abuse, and both may take the form of growths, bumps, or swelling on the vocal cords.  Vocal fold paralysis is the inability to move one or both of the vocal cords, which results in difficulties with voice and perhaps [[swallowing]].  Paradoxical [[vocal fold]] movement occurs when the vocal cords close when they should actually be open.  Spasmodic dysphonia is caused by strained vocal cord movement, which results in awkward voice problems, such as jerkiness or quavering.&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

If nodules or polyps are present, and are large, surgery may be the appropriate choice for removal.  Surgery is not recommended for children, however.  Other medical treatment may suffice for slighter problems, such as those induced by gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergies, or thyroid problems.  Outside of medical and surgical interventions, professional behavioral interventions can be useful in teaching good vocal habits and minimizing abuse of vocal cords.  This voice therapy may instruct in attention to pitch, loudness, and breathing exercises.  Additionally, the individual may be instructed on the optimal position to produce the maximum vocal quality.  Bilateral paralysis is another disorder that may require medical or surgical interventions to return vocal cords to normalcy; unilateral paralysis may be treated medically or behaviorally.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2009"&gt;ASHA (2009). Voice disorders. Retrieved July 16, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/voice.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vocal cord dysfunction|Paradoxical vocal fold movement (PVFM)]] is also treated medically and behaviorally.  Behavioral interventions will focus on voice exercises, relaxation strategies, and techniques that can be used to support breath.  More generally, however, PVFM interventions focus on helping an individual to understand what triggers the episode, and how to deal with it when it does occur.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2009"/&gt;

While there is no cure for [[spasmodic dysphonia]], medical and psychological interventions can alleviate some of the symptoms.  Medical interventions involve repeated injections of [[Botox]] into one or both of the vocal cords.  This weakens the laryngeal muscles, and results in a smoother voice.&lt;ref name="ASHA 2009"/&gt;

==Language disorders==
{{main|Language disorder}}
A language disorder is an impairment in the ability to understand and/or use words in context, both verbally and nonverbally. Some characteristics of language disorders include improper use of words and their meanings, inability to express ideas, inappropriate grammatical patterns, reduced [[vocabulary]] and inability to follow directions. One or a combination of these characteristics may occur in children who are affected by language learning disabilities or developmental language delay. Children may hear or see a word but not be able to understand its meaning. They may have trouble getting others to understand what they are trying to communicate.

===Specific language impairment===
{{Main|Specific language impairment}}
Interventions for [[specific language impairment]] will be based upon the individual difficulties in which the impairment manifests. For example, if the child is incapable of separating individual [[morphemes]], or units of sound, in speech, then the interventions may take the form of [[rhyming]], or of tapping on each [[syllable]]. If comprehension is the trouble, the intervention may focus on developing [[metacognitive strategies]] to evaluate his/her knowledge while reading, and after reading is complete.  It is important that whatever intervention is employed, it must be generalized to the general education classroom.&lt;ref name='ASHA LBLD 2009'/&gt;

===Selective mutism===
{{main|Selective mutism}}
Selective mutism is a disorder that manifests as a child that does not speak in at least one social setting, despite being able to speak in other situations. Selective mutism is normally discovered when the child first starts school.&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

Behavioral treatment plans can be effective in bringing about the desired communication across settings. Stimulus fading involves a gradual desensitization, in which the individual is placed in a comfortable situation and the environment is gradually modified to increase the stress levels without creating a large change in stress level. Shaping relies on behavioral modification techniques, in which successive attempts to produce speech is reinforced.  Self-modeling techniques may also be helpful; for example, self-modeling video tapes, in which the child watches a video of him/herself performing the desired action, can be useful.

If additional confounding speech problems exist, a SLP may work with the student to identify what factors are complicating speech production and what factors might be increasing the mute behaviors.  Additionally, he/she might work with the individual to become more comfortable with social situations, and with the qualities of their own voice.  If voice training is required, they might offer this as well.&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009 k). Selective mutism.  Retrieved July 21, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/SelectiveMutism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aphasia===
{{main|Aphasia}}
Aphasia refers to a family of language disorders that usually stem from injury, lesion, or [[atrophy]] to the left side of the brain that result in reception, [[perception]], and recall of language; in addition, language formation and expressive capacities may be inhibited.&lt;ref name="Palmer, J.M. 1990"/&gt;

===Language-based learning disabilities===
Language-based learning disabilities, which refer to difficulties with [[reading (process)|reading]], [[spelling]], and/or [[writing]] that are evidenced in a significant lag behind the individual's same-age peers.  Most children with these disabilities are at least of average intelligence, ruling out intellectual impairments as the causal factor.&lt;ref name="ASHA ChildSandL"/&gt;

==Diagnostic criteria==
The [[DSM-5]] and the [[ICD-10]] are both used to make specific diagnostic decisions.
Speech and language disorders commonly include communication issues, but also extend into various areas such as oral-motor function—sucking, swallowing, drinking, or eating. In some cases, a child's communication is delayed considerably behind his/her same-aged peers.  The effects of these disorders can range from basic difficulties in the production of certain letter sounds to more comprehensive inabilities to generate ([[expressive language|expressive]]) or understand ([[receptive language|receptive]]) language. In most cases, the causal factors that create these speech and language difficulties are unknown.  There are a wide variety of biological and environmental causal factors that can create them, ranging from drug abuse to neurological issues.  For more information on causal hypotheses, refer to the section on models.&lt;ref name="nichcy.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/speechlanguage |title=Speech and Language Impairments |format= |work= National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY)
|accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental disorders===
Developmental disorders tend to have a genetic origin, such as mutations of [[FOXP2]], which has been linked to developmental verbal dyspraxia and specific language impairment. Some of these impairments are caused by genetics.  Case histories often reveal a positive family history of [[communication disorders]]. Between 28% and 60% of children with a speech and language deficit have a sibling and/or parent who is also affected.&lt;ref name="ASHA. 2009"/&gt; Down syndrome is another example of a genetic causal factor that may result in speech and/or language impairments. [[Stuttering]] is a disorder that is hypothesized to have a strong genetic component as well.

Some speech and language impairments have environmental causes.  A specific language impairment, for example, may be caused by insufficient language stimulation in the environment.  If a child does not have access to an adequate role model, or is not spoken to with much frequency, the child may not develop strong language skills.  Furthermore, if a child has little stimulating experiences, or is not encouraged to develop speech, that child may have little incentive to speak at all and may not develop speech and language skills at an average pace.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt;

Developmental disabilities such as [[autism]] and neurological disorders such as [[cerebral palsy]] may also result in impaired communicative abilities. Similarly, malformation or malfunctioning of the [[respiratory system]] or speech mechanisms may result in speech impairments.  For example, a cleft palate will allow too much air to pass through the [[nasal cavity]] and a [[cleft lip]] will not allow the individual to correctly form sounds that require the upper lip.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt; The development of [[vocal fold nodules]] represents another issue of biological causation.  In some cases of biological origin, medical interventions such as surgery or medication may be required.  Other cases may require speech therapy or behavioral training.

===Acquired disorders===
Acquired disorders result from brain injury, stroke or atrophy, many of these issues are included under the [[Aphasia]] umbrella.
Brain damage, for example, may result in various forms of aphasia if critical areas of the brain such as [[Broca's area|Broca's]] or [[Wernicke's area]] are damaged by lesions or atrophy as part of a [[dementia]].

===Speech and language assessment===
{{main|Speech and language assessment}}
What follows are a list of frequently used measures of speech and language skills, and the age-ranges for which they are appropriate.&lt;ref name="Batshaw, M.L. 2002"/&gt;
* Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – Preschool (3–6 years)
* Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (6–21 years)
* MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (0–12 months)
* The Rossetti Infant-Toddler Language Scale (0–36 months)
*Preschool Language Scale (0–6 years)
* Expressive One-word Picture Vocabulary Test (2–15 years)
* Bankson-Bernthal Phonological Process Survey Test (2–16 years)
* Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation 2 (2–21 years)
*[[Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test]]  (2.5–40 years)

===In the United States of America===
Under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act| Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004]], the federal government has defined a speech or language impairment as "a communication disorder such as stuttering, impaired articulation, a language impairment, or a voice impairment, which adversely affects a child's learning". In order to qualify in the educational system as having a speech or language impairment, the child's speech must be either unintelligible much of the time or he/she must have been professionally diagnosed as having either a [[speech impairment]] or [[language delay]] which requires intervention.  Additionally, IDEA 2004 contains an exclusionary clause that stipulates that a speech or [[language disorder|language impairment]] may not be either cultural, ethnic, [[bilingual]], or [[dialectical]] differences in language, temporary disorders (such as those induced by dental problems), or delayed abilities in producing the most difficult [[linguistic]] sounds in a child's age range.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt;

==Management==
[[Speech-language pathology|Speech-language pathologists (SLPs)]] offer many services to children with speech or language disabilities.

===Speech-language pathology===
{{main|Speech-language pathology}}
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) may provide individual therapy for the child to assist with speech production problems such as stuttering.  They may consult with the child's teacher about ways in which the child might be accommodated in the classroom, or modifications that might be made in instruction or environment.  The SLP can also make crucial connections with the family, and help them to establish goals and techniques to be used in the home.  Other service providers, such as counselors or vocational instructors may also be included in the development of goals as the child transitions into adulthood.&lt;ref name="nichcy.org"/&gt;

The individual services that the child receives will depend upon the needs of that child.  Simpler problems of speech, such as hoarseness or vocal fatigue (voicing problems) may be solved with basic instruction on how to modulate one's voice.  Articulation problems could be remediated by simple practice in sound pronunciation.  Fluency problems may be remediated with coaching and practice under the guidance of trained professionals, and may disappear with age.  However, more complicated problems, such as those accompanying [[autism spectrum|autism]] or [[stroke]]s, may require many years of one-on-one therapy with a variety of service providers.  In most cases, it is imperative that the families be included in the treatment plans since they can help to implement the treatment plans.  The educators are also a critical link in the implementation of the child's treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;Morales, S. (2009). The mechanics of speech and language. Retrieved July 10, 2009, from http://www.childspeech.net/u_ii.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

For children with [[language disorders]], professionals often relate the treatment plans to classroom content, such as classroom textbooks or presentation assignments.  The professional teaches various strategies to the child, and the child works to apply them effectively in the classroom.  For success in the educational environment, it is imperative that the SLP or other speech-language professional have a strong, positive rapport with the teacher(s).&lt;ref name='ASHA LBLD 2009'&gt;ASHA. (2009). Language-based learning disabilities. Retrieved July 10, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/LBLD.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech-language pathologists create plans that cater to the individual needs of the patient.  If speech is not practical for a patient, the SLP will work with the patient to decide upon an [[Augmentative and alternative communication|augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)]] method or device to facilitate communication.  They may work with other patients to help them make sounds, improve voices, or teach general communication strategies.  They also work with individuals who have difficulties swallowing.  In addition to offering these types of communication training services, SLPs also keep records of evaluation, progress, and eventual discharge of patients, and work with families to overcome and cope with communication impairments (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009).

In many cases, SLPs provide direct clinical services to individuals with communication or swallowing disorders.  SLPs work with physicians, psychologists, and social workers to provide services in the medical domain, and collaborate with educational professionals to offer additional services for students to facilitate the educational process.  Thus, speech-language services may be found in schools, hospitals, outpatient clinics, and nursing homes, among other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2009). Speech-language pathologist. Retrieved July 10, 2009, from http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos099.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The setting in which therapy is provided to the individual depends upon the age, type, and severity of the individual's impairment.  An infant/toddler may engage in an early intervention program, in which services are delivered in a naturalistic environment in which the child is most comfortable—probably his/her home.  If the child is school-aged, he/she may receive speech-language services at an outpatient clinic, or even at his/her home school as part of a weekly program.  The type of setting in which therapy is offered depends largely upon characteristics of the individual and his/her disability.

As with any professional practice that is informed by ongoing research, controversies exist in the fields that deal with speech and language disorders.  One such current debate relates to the efficacy of oral motor exercises and the expectations surrounding them.  According to Lof,&lt;ref&gt;Lof, G.L. (2006). Logic, theory, and evidence against the use of non-speech oral motor exercises to change speech sound production. ASHA Convention 2006, 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; non-speech oral motor exercises (NS-OME) includes "any technique that does not require the child to produce a speech sound but is used to influence the development of speaking abilities". These sorts of exercises would include blowing, tongue push-ups, pucker-smile, tongue wags, big smile, tongue-to-nose-to-chin, cheek puffing, blowing kisses, and tongue curling, among others.  Lof continues, indicating that 85% of SLPs are currently using NS-OME.  Additionally, these exercises are used for dysarthria, apraxia, late talkers, structural anomalies, phonological impairments, hearing impairments, and other disorders.  Practitioners assume that these exercises will strengthen articulatory structures and generalize to speech acts.  Lof reviews 10 studies, and concludes that only one of the studies shows benefits to these exercises (it also suffered serious methodological flaws).  Lof ultimately concludes that the exercises employ the same structures, but are used for different functions.&lt;ref&gt;Lof, G.L. (2003). Oral motor exercises and treatment outcomes. Language Learning and Education, April 2003, 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The NS-OME position is not without its supporters, however, and the proponents are numerous.

===Interventions===
Intervention services will be guided by the strengths and needs determined by the speech and language evaluation.  The areas of need may be addressed individually until each one is functional; alternatively, multiple needs may be addressed simultaneously through the intervention techniques.  If possible, all interventions will be geared towards the goal of developing typical communicative interaction.  To this end, interventions typically follow either a preventive, remedial, or compensatory model.  The preventive service model is common as an early intervention technique, especially for children whose other disorders place them at a higher risk for developing later communication problems.  This model works to lessen the probability or severity of the issues that could later emerge.  The remedial model is used when an individual already has a speech or language impairment that he/she wishes to have corrected.  Compensatory models would be used if a professional determines that it is best for the child to bypass the communication limitation; often, this relies on AAC.

Language intervention activities are used in some therapy sessions. In these exercises, an SLP or other trained professional will interact with a child by working with the child through play and other forms of interaction to talk to the child and model language use. The professional will make use of various stimuli, such as books, objects, or simple pictures to stimulate the emerging language.  In these activities, the professional will model correct pronunciation, and will encourage the child to practice these skills.  Articulation therapy may be used during play therapy as well, but involves modeling specific aspects of language—the production of sound.  The specific sounds will be modeled for the child by the professional (often the SLP), and the specific processes involved in creating those sounds will be taught as well.  For example, the professional might instruct the child in the placement of the tongue or lips in order to produce certain consonant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Kids Health. (2009). Speech language therapy. Retrieved July 13, 2009, from http://kidshealth.org/parent/system/ill/speech_therapy.html#.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is another avenue of intervention, and can help children whose physical conditions make communication difficult. The use of electronic communication systems allow nonspeaking people and people with severe physical disabilities to engage in the give and take of shared thought.

===Adaptability and limitations===
While some speech problems, such as certain voice problems, require medical interventions, many speech problems can be alleviated through effective behavioral interventions and practice.  In these cases, instruction in speech techniques or speaking strategies, coupled with regular practice, can help the individual to overcome his/her speaking difficulties.  In other, more severe cases, the individual with speech problems may compensate with AAC devices.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt;

Speech impairments can seriously limit the manner in which an individual interacts with others in work, school, social, and even home environments.  Inability to correctly form speech sounds might create stress, embarrassment, and frustration in both the speaker and the listener.  Over time, this could create aggressive responses on the part of the listener for being misunderstood, or out of embarrassment.  Alternatively, it could generate an avoidance of social situations that create these stressful situations.  Language impairments create similar difficulties in communicating with others, but may also include difficulties in understanding what others are trying to say (receptive language). Because of the pervasive nature of language impairments, communicating, reading, writing, and academic success may all be compromised in these students.  Similar to individuals with speech impairments, individuals with language impairments may encounter long-term difficulties associated with work, school, social, and home environments.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt;

===Assistive technology===
[[Augmentative and alternative communication|Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)]] includes all forms of communication other than oral communication that an individual might employ to make known his/her thoughts.  AAC work to compensate for impairments that an individual might have with expressive language abilities.  Each system works to maintain a natural and functional level of communication.  There is no one best type of AAC for all individuals; rather, the best type of AAC will be determined by the strengths and weaknesses of a specific individual.  While there are a large number of types of AAC, there are fundamentally two categories: aided and unaided.

Unaided systems of communication are those that require both communication parties to be physically present in the same location.  Examples of unaided systems include gestures, [[body language]], [[sign language]], and communication boards. Communication boards are devices upon which letters, words, or pictorial symbols might be displayed; the individual may interface with the communication board to express him/herself to the other individual.

Aided systems of communication do not require both individuals to be physically present in the same location, though they might be.  Aided systems are often electronic devices, and they may or may not provide some form of voice output.  If a device does create a voice output, it is referred to as a speech generating device.  While the message may take the form of speech output, it may also be printed as a visual display of speech.  Many of these devices can be connected to a computer, and in some cases, they may even be adapted to produce a variety of different languages.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHA. (2009 l). Augmentative and alternative communication. Retrieved July 11, 2009, from http://asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusion vs. exclusion===
Students identified with a speech and language disability often qualify for an [[Individualized Education Plan]] as well as particular services. These include one-on-one services with a speech and language pathologist. Examples used in a session include reading vocabulary words, identifying particular [[vowel]] sounds and then changing the context, noting the difference. School districts in the United States often have speech and language pathologists within a special education staff to work with students. Additionally, school districts can place students with speech and language disabilities in a [[resource room]] for individualized instruction. A combination of early intervention and individualized support has shown promise increasing long-term academic achievement with students with this disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1001/jama.285.18.2339| url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/jama;286/9/1026-a |title=Long-term Effects of an Early Childhood Intervention on Educational Achievement and Juvenile Arrest|last=Reynolds|first=Arthur J.|author2=Judy A. Temple |author3=Dylan L. Robertson |author4=Emily A. Mann |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]|volume=285|issue=18|year=2001|pages=2339–2346|pmid=11343481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students might work individually with a specialist, or with a specialist in a group setting.  In some cases, the services provided to these individuals may even be provided in the regular education classroom. Regardless of where these services are provided, most of these students spend small amounts of time in therapy and the large majority of their time in the regular education classroom with their typically developing peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mastropieri, Margo A. |author2=Scruggs, Thomas E. |title=The Inclusive Classroom: Strategies for Effective Instruction (4th Edition) |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-13-500170-6 |oclc=268789048 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapy often occurs in small groups of three or four students with similar needs.  Meeting either in the office of the speech-language pathologist or in the classroom, sessions may take from 30 minutes to one hour.  They may occur several times per week.  After introductory conversations, the session is focused on a particular therapeutic activity, such as coordination and strengthening exercises of speech muscles or improving fluency through breathing techniques.  These activities may take the form of games, songs, skits, and other activities that deliver the needed therapy.  Aids, such as mirrors, tape recorders, and tongue depressors may be utilized to help the children to become aware of their speech sounds and to work toward more natural speech production.

==Prevalence==
In 2006, the U.S. Department of Education indicated that more than 1.4 million students were served in the public schools' special education programs under the speech or language impairment category of IDEA 2004.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"/&gt; This estimate does not include children who have speech/language problems secondary to other conditions such as [[deafness]]; this means that if all cases of speech or language impairments were included in the estimates, this category of impairment would be the largest.  Another source has estimated that communication disorders—a larger category, which also includes hearing disorders—affect one of every 10 people in the United States.&lt;ref name="nichcy.org"/&gt;

ASHA has cited that 24.1% of children in school in the fall of 2003 received services for speech or language disorders—this amounts to a total of 1,460,583 children between 3 –21 years of age.&lt;ref name="ASHA. 2009"&gt;ASHA. (2009). Incidence and prevalence of speech, voice, and language disorders in the adults in the United States: 2008 edition. Retrieved July 7, 2009, from http://asha.org/research/reports/speech_voice_language.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this estimate does not include children who have speech/language problems secondary to other conditions.  Additional ASHA prevalence figures have suggested the following:
* Stuttering affects approximately 4% to 5% of children between the ages of 2 and 4.
* ASHA has indicated that in 2006:
** Almost 69% of SLPs served individuals with [[disfluency|fluency problems]].
** Almost 29% of SLPs served individuals with [[Voice disorder|voice]] or [[Hypernasal speech|resonance disorder]]s.
** Approximately 61% of speech-language pathologists in schools indicated that they served individuals with [[specific language impairment|SLI]]
** Almost 91% of SLPs in schools indicated that they servedindividuals with phonological/articulation disorder
* Estimates for language difficulty in preschool children range from 2% to 19%.
* [[Specific language impairment|Specific Language Impairment (SLI)]] is extremely common in children, and affects about 7% of the childhood population.&lt;ref name="ASHA. 2009"/&gt;

==Discrimination==
While more common in childhood, speech impairments can result in a child being bullied.  [[Bullying]] is a harmful activity that often takes place at school, though may be present in adult life.  Bullying involves the consistent and intentional harassment of another individual, and may be physical or verbal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;IStutter. (2005). Teasing and bullying: Facts and support. Retrieved July 22, 2009, from http://www.latrobe.edu.au/istutter/?q=node/16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech impairments (e.g., [[stuttering]]) and language impairments (e.g., [[dyslexia]], [[auditory processing disorder]]) may also result in discrimination in the workplace.  For example, an employer would be discriminatory if he/she chose to not make reasonable accommodations for the affected individual, such as allowing the individual to miss work for medical appointments or not making onsite-accommodations needed because of the speech impairment.  In addition to making such appropriate accommodations, the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) protects against discrimination in "job application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment".&lt;ref&gt;Parry, W.D. (2009). Being your own best advocate. Retrieved July 26, 2009, from http://www.valsalva.org/advocate.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the mid 19th century, the scientific endeavors of such individuals as [[Charles Darwin]] gave rise to more systematic and scientific consideration of physical phenomenon, and the work of others, such as [[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]], also lent scientific rigor to the study of speech and language disorders.  The late 19th century saw an increase in "pre-professionals," those who offered speech and language services based upon personal experiences or insights. Several trends were exhibited even in the 19th century, some have indicated the importance of elocution training in the early 19th century, through which individuals would seek out those with training to improve their vocal qualities. By 1925 in the USA interest in these trends lead to the forming of the organization that would become [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) and the birth of speech-language pathology.&lt;ref name='Duchan 2008'&gt;Duchan, J.F. (2008). Getting here: A short history of speech pathology in America. Retrieved July 15, 2009, from http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~duchan/new_history/overview.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth century has been proposed to be composed of four major periods: Formative Years, Processing Period, Linguistic Era, and Pragmatics Revolution.  The Formative Years, which began around 1900 and ended around WWII, was a time during which the scientific rigor extended and professionalism entered the picture. During this period, the first school-based program began in the U.S. (1910).  The Processing Period, from roughly 1945-1965, further developed the assessment and interventions available for general communication disorders; much of these focused on the internal, psychological transactions involved in the communication process.  During the Linguistic Era, from about 1965-1975, professionals began to separate language deficits from speech deficits, which had major implications for diagnosis and treatment of these communication disorders.  Lastly, the Pragmatics Revolution has continued to shape the professional practice by considering major ecological factors, such as culture, in relation to speech and language impairments.  It was during this period that IDEA was passed, and this allowed professionals to begin working with a greater scope and to increase the diversity of problems with which they concerned themselves.&lt;ref name="Smith, D.D. 2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Deborah D. |author2=Tyler, Naomi Chodhuri |title=Introduction to Special Education: Making A Difference (7th Edition) |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-205-60056-5 |oclc=268789042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">[[File:VithkuqiScript.png|thumb|250px|The letters of the Vithkuqi alphabet matched to their [[Albanian alphabet|modern Albanian equivalents]].]]
'''Vithkuqi script''', also called '''Büthakukye''' or '''Beitha Kukju''' after the appellation applied to it by German Albanologist [[Johann Georg von Hahn]], was an [[alphabet]] invented for writing the [[Albanian language]] between 1825 and 1845 by [[Albanians|Albanian]] scholar [[Naum Veqilharxhi]]. Though the script is sometimes erroneously claimed to be named after its inventor, as in [[Carl Faulmann]]'s ''Das Buch der Schrift'', the alphabet's name is derived from [[Vithkuq]], a village in the [[Korçë]] region where Veqilharxhi was born. Vithkuqi script was specifically designed to be as religiously neutral as possible, avoiding the duplication of Greek, Latin, or Arabic characters. It had a near-perfect correspondence between letters and phonemes, but lacked characters for modern Albanian "gj", "rr", "xh", and "zh". The script never took hold because of its inventor's premature death and because of the prohibitive costs of cutting new type for the invented characters; nevertheless, a number of documents using the script were published in the late 19th century. The script was eventually overwhelmed by the [[Greek script|Greek]], [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts it had been designed to supplant, the latter becoming the official one in 1909.

Other original scripts used for Albanian were the [[Elbasan script]] and the [[Todhri alphabet|Todhri script]] of the 18th century. These scripts similarly failed to see prolonged widespread usage.

== Overview ==
The principal evidence cited for the existence of "Wiki-constitutionalism" is the sheer number of constitutions which have existed in Latin America when compared with other regions of the globe. If one looks at fully restructured rewrites (as opposed to amendments), "the [[Dominican Republic]] has had 32 separate constitutions since its independence in 1821. [[Venezuela]] follows close behind with 26, [[Haiti]] has had 24, [[Ecuador]] 20, and [[Bolivia]] recently passed its seventeenth"&lt;ref name=lr/&gt; and "over half of the 21 Latin American nations have had at least ten constitutions while, in the rest of the world, only Thailand (17), France (16), Greece (13), and Poland (10) have reached double digits."&lt;ref name=lr/&gt;

The original piece is highly critical of leaders such as [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Rafael Correa]] and [[Evo Morales]] who have allegedly helped prolong a self-perpetuating cycle of constitutional attrition by pushing new constitutions packaged with "ever-longer lists of promises and rights alongside greater executive functions",&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/75150/wiki-constitutionalism |title=Wiki-Constitutionalism|first=Daniel |last=Lansberg-Rodriguez |work=[[CBS News]] |date=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in constitutions which are "not only the shortest-lived, but also among the longest in the world."&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Bolivia's and Ecuador's constitutions have 411 and 444 articles, respectively, and "read like laundry lists of guaranteed rights, such as access to mail and telephones; guarantees for culture, identity, and dignity; and shorter work-weeks."&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt;

== Controversy ==
After an unauthorized and inaccurate Spanish translation of the article began circulating in May 2010, controversy erupted in the [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] press over Wiki-constitutionalism and whether the mention of Dominican President [[Leonel Fernández]] alongside Hugo Chávez, Rafael Correa, Evo Morales and Colombian president [[Álvaro Uribe]] as "attempting to tear up and revise their constitutionally mandated term limits" &lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; was tantamount to an accusation of his being a [[dictator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panoramadiario.com/articulo/articulo/2/articulo-de-la-cadena-cbs-califica-al-presidente-fernandez-de-dictador/ |title=Artículo de la cadena CBS califica al presidente Fernández de dictador |language=Spanish|work=Panorama Diario |date=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barahonero.com/2010/05/la-cadena-cbs-dice-que-leonel.html |title=La cadena CBS dice que Leonel Fernández,es un "Dictador Moderno" entre un puñado de ellos |language=Spanish |work=Barahonero.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramon Morel Cerda, the former head of the Supreme Electoral Council for the Dominican Republic discussed the controversy on June 7, 2010, in an opinion piece for the "Hoy" Newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almomento.net/news/135/ARTICLE/61711/2010-06-08.html |title=Cómo constituir un régimen dictatorial|language=Spanish |work=Hoy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
